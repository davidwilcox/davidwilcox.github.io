<h1>o Serve - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I thought that you might be interested in some of the things that have happened in my life in the last few months. On Thursday morning, October 10, 1985, in the fourth-floor council room of the Salt Lake Temple, I was invited to sit on a small stool placed at the feet of President Spencer W. Kimball, who sat in a chair. With President Kimball's hands on my head, and surrounded in a circle by President Hinckley and all the members of the Council of the Twelve, I was ordained an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ and set apart as a member of the Council of the Twelve. President Hinckley was voice. I was given a blessing that is a great source of comfort and strength to me. To say the least, my brothers and sisters, I was then and still am now overwhelmed with this calling to serve as a special witness of the Lord and to serve you, the members of the Church.<br><br>In 1974 President Kimball called me to preside over the Canada Toronto Mission. He also called me to serve as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy in 1976. It is very special to me to know that the last priesthood ordinance he participated in before his passing was my ordination to the holy apostleship. I have a deep love and respect for our beloved President Kimball. He will always hold a very special place in the hearts of my wife, Barbara, our children, and myself, as I know he does in all of your hearts.<br><br>As I have relived this most meaningful experience in my life over and over again, I have asked myself the question that I believe almost everyone asks when called to serve in the Church, "Why me, Lord?" The privilege of serving as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy for the past nine and one half years has taken me to many parts of the earth on errands for the Lord. I believe I know as well as anyone in the Church that there are thousands of faithful and devoted men and women who serve the Lord with their whole soul and they serve him with great distinction. Knowing as I do that there are many men worthy and capable of such a sacred calling as mine, the question "Why me?" has had a sobering impact upon my own soul.<br><br>I have, during the past three months, come to the comforting knowledge that the Lord and my Brethren see in me something I can do to help the work of the Lord continue to move forward. In my specific case I am also aware that the dedicated service of many of my forefathers could well have influenced my call to the Council of the Twelve. Since the very beginnings of the restoration of the Church they gave all that they had, even their lives, for this great work. Family members of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum have served in the Council of the Twelve since the organization of the Council of the Twelve in 1835.<br><br>I count it a blessing to be a representative now of the family of Joseph and Hyrum, and acknowledge publicly that to follow my great-grandfather, Joseph F. Smith, and both of my grandfathers, Hyrum Mack Smith and Melvin J. Ballard, into the Council of the Twelve Apostles is a great honor and responsibility. I will do my very best to be the kind of a servant that is worthy of such a birthright.<br><br>On several occasions I have been assured by my Brethren that they felt my forefathers must have sustained my call in the councils on the other side as well as the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve on this side of the veil. But how is it that a call to serve in the Church comes into the lives of sons and daughters of God? Let me explore this with you for a few minutes.<br><h2><b>By Their Own Choice and Agency</b></h2><br>To begin with, I am sure that our behavior in the premortal world had a great deal to do with our birthright here upon the earth. I do not pretend to understand the whole process, but I have come to a comfortable assurance in my own heart that to be born in a land that is free, where men and women can worship God through the dictates of their own feelings and consciences, is a great blessing. As you know, in many countries of this world today a meeting such as this one could never be held. The blessings of the abundance of physical conveniences of life that every one of us enjoys is overwhelming when we compare our abundant life to the struggle for survival that is ever present in many parts of the earth.<br><br>Nineteen eighty-five took me twice to the vast continent of Africa, where I walked among the people and observed firsthand their terrible suffering. For example, the value of a tent placed on bare earth to shield the children of God from the cold night winds of the desert and the scorching heat of the day has a new and impactful meaning to me that is very difficult to express in words. You and I have beds with mattresses and bedding to sleep on. We have hot and cold running water at our command. We have sanitation facilities to help control disease and sickness of all kinds. Our homes are heated, and some are air conditioned. Many of us have comfortable air-conditioned automobiles in which to travel.<br><br>The question could well be asked, How in the plan of our Heavenly Father do some of his children have so much while others have so little? One answer for us who are sitting here tonight is found in this mandate from the Lord, "For of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><br>God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son have every right to expect much from you and me. In the great plan of salvation all of the mortal children of our Father in Heaven, while in the premortal world, elected by their own choice and agency to follow the Lord rather than Lucifer. By this choice we earned the right to receive a physical body of flesh and bones. The blessing of our mortal body perhaps will not be fully understood until we pass from this life into the next one. We know, however, that to receive this physical body is absolutely essential to "dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 76:62).<br><br>By our mortal life we can experience the testing process of exercising our free agency. The right to make our own choices is essential to our preparation for celestial living in the presence of God. We learn by this process to either love and embrace the teachings and commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ or to follow the temptings and enticements of the devil. Every human soul makes hundreds of choices daily, and when these are compounded and totaled they will determine our eternal destiny. Never forget that one of life's most important choices is to repent and turn away from evil to embrace gospel standards. This process is part of the great plan of life. In our case, as members of the true Church of Jesus Christ, we have the perfect standard or guideline for knowing how to choose the right way to live in mortality. The gospel of Jesus Christ with its teachings and commandments leading to eternal life is what we must choose to follow. We are blessed while living in mortality to have both physical body and spirit joined together. In this state of our existence we are on the road to becoming as our Father in Heaven. For he said after the fall of Adam, "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil" (Genesis 3:22).<br><br>The prophet Alma explains the great experience of mortality as a probationary state or existence.<br><br><i>And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</i>[Alma 12:24]<br><br>And so we are here in mortality with a physical body and the spirit united to help us work out our own salvation. The spirit within each one of us must learn to bring our body under subjection. By the power of our spirit, we must bring ourselves under the control of the commandments and teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We should always remember that to die without embracing the gospel and living its commandments will only complicate our eternal progress, because it is far easier to repent and change while living in this probationary state. Do not suppose that your desires and appetites will change because you die. We will surely rise from the grave with the same desires and habits that were present upon our interment to the grave. Therefore, as Alma pled,<br><br><i>And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance.</i>[Alma 13:27]<br><h2><b>The Struggle Between Good and Evil</b></h2><br>The challenges to live in the world are great. In many ways these challenges are more difficult for you young people today than they were when I was your age. In a recent issue of a national magazine the whole issue of morality was examined. Let me quote from that article:<br><br><i>The Pentagon launches an investigation of 45 of the nation's top 100 defense contractors for bribery, kickbacks, false claims, bid rigging and overcharges.</i>. . .<br><br>[A]<i>stockbrokerage</i>[firm]<i>pleads guilty to defrauding banks of tens of millions of dollars and is fined 2 million dollars.</i><br><br><i>Major student cheating scandals are disclosed at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Southern California.</i><br><br><i>Professional baseball players admit to using cocaine, a major point-shaving scandal hits the Tulane University basketball squad, and several other schools are cited for recruiting violations.</i><br><br><i>Kickbacks to Salvation Army officials are admitted by two Philadelphia exporters who said they sought favored treatment in purchasing used clothes from the charitable organization.</i><br><br><i>A New York socialite whose ancestors go back to Mayflower Pilgrims is set free with a token fine after confessing that she ran a million-dollar-a-year prostitution ring.</i>. . .<br><br>I'm just highlighting from this article, and I want to continue.<br><br>. . .<i>Gambling used to be widely condemned. Now, many more churches run bingo games, and 22 states and the District of Columbia operate lotteries. Drinking used to be widely condemned. Now, nearly two thirds of Americans drink at least occasionally.</i><br><br><i>Premarital sex used to be widely condemned. Today, it is commonplace, although many still consider it a moral lapse. Federal statistics show that about half of the women who married during the early 1960s said they had sex before their weddings. Now, more than four fifths report they had sexual experience. On average, U.S. girls have their first sexual intercourse at age 16, boys at 15 and a half. "Premarital sex is seen as part of discovery". . . .</i><br><br><i>Notes a woman college student at Northwestern University: "There has to be concern about birth control and getting an education before people engage in premarital sex, but it's not wrong. It's perfectly natural.</i>" . . .<br><br>. . .<i>A recent Yale University study for</i>Psychology Today<i>of 7,500 readers showed that 45 percent of women as well as 45 percent of men said they had cheated on their spouses.</i>. .<br><br><i>For some, honesty depends on the circumstances. As sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset of Stanford observes: "Everybody lies. But the question is, to what extent do you consciously deceive others? Do you exaggerate to impress a girl or a guy? Do you fudge on your curriculum vitae to impress an employer? Do you twist the truth to succeed in your job?"</i><br><br><i>No one knows whether the truth is more twisted today than in the past. But some scholars think it is.</i>. . .<br><br>. . . [Lying]<i>allows many people to excuse dishonesty on grounds ''that it does not matter whether or not we lie when we have a good reason for doing so."</i><br><br><i>A major legal and ethical dilemma for Americans is abortion. Before 1973, it was illegal in most states and practiced sub rosa. Today, it is legal in most cases, widely practiced and under furious attack.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Teen pregnancy has become so acute that groups across the nation are trying to combat it.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Cheating, stealing and lying at work have "really popped to the surface since the recessions of the early 1980s," . . . "honesty tests" for job applicants</i>[show that]<i>3 of every 10 prospective retail workers admit stealing from a previous employer". . . .</i><br><br><i>"Teaching values has always been a cooperative effort by the family and the social institutions". . . . "Now, you have TV instead, but it is hard to see what moral values, if any, are taught by TV. The institutions where moral values are usually reinforced have fallen apart."</i><br><br><i>Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, says that "by the time the typical student graduates from high school, he or she has spent more hours with TV (15,000) than with teachers (12,000)."</i><br><br><i>The</i>U.S. News<i>poll showed that 20 percent of young adults have tried cocaine and half of those under 30 have smoked marijuana. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese, citing the nation's 24 million cocaine users, warns, "A national disaster is in the making."</i>["The State of American Values,"<i>U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report,</i>9 December 1985, pp. 54–58 passim]<br><br>What is the impact of television shows that present violence, killings, sex, the image of wealth, the power of money? Who do you suppose is influencing the writers and producers of such programs? Surely Satan has his hand in this programming. As our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ observe how you and I live our lives in this present environment, as they see how we deal with the struggle between good and evil, they come to know us, to trust us with the work of leading their Church. We demonstrate every day that we are learning to choose the right and to depart from evil. Through this process we are preparing to meet and live with God.<br><h2><b>The Power of Revelation</b></h2><br>The power of revelation from God to man is the way the Lord reveals his will to his servants. The process of extending calls to members to serve in the Church is a process of revelation. If you are true and faithful to the teachings of the commandments of the gospel, if you repent and turn away from sin, revelation will come to your Church leaders at the ward, stake, and general levels to call you to serve in the callings you have prepared yourself to receive as a result of your exercising your free agency in choosing to keep the commandments of the Lord.<br><br>As an example of this process, let me share with you an experience I had when I was on assignment in South America. I was asked by the Brethren to divide a stake and choose new leadership for the new stake.<br><br>I realize that to some of you this may not sound like a very difficult assignment, but let me assure you that it is a very important responsibility. The reality was that I knew the Lord had already chosen, by the process we have been discussing, the man he wanted for stake president. You should know that the General Authorities seek to know the mind and will of the Lord in order to extend on his behalf the call from him to his sons and daughters to serve.<br><br>In this instance, when I arrived at the stake to begin the interviewing of the potential leaders, the current stake president advised me there were only three men who could possibly be considered to serve as the stake president. Since I do not speak nor understand Spanish, everything that was said to me had to be translated and everything I said also needed translating. I explained to the stake president that the procedure of the Church was that I would interview all of the priesthood leaders living within the new stake.<br><br>Since there were over thirty priesthood leaders to be interviewed through the interpreter, that process took considerably longer than normal. Late Saturday night I had not found the person the Lord wanted to preside over this new stake. I reviewed once more with the current stake president all of the potential leaders. We discovered that there was one man who lived in a small district that was being incorporated into the new stake. I inquired after this man and learned that the reason he had not come in for an interview was that he was at home caring for his wife and three children who were ill. Telephone communication, as you know, is very limited in many parts of South America; so it required sending someone out to this brother's home, which was some distance away from where we were, to invite him to meet with me early Sunday morning.<br><br>When this fine man arrived I interviewed him, and I knew this was the man to be the new stake president. You see, he had been preparing through thirty-four years of living for this call by repenting of his sins and striving to keep the commandments of the gospel of Jesus Christ, by serving a full-time mission, by accepting responsibilities and leadership and teaching positions in the Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "Every man who has a calling to minister to the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of heaven before this world was" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 365). I believe this. It behooves everyone of us to live as close to the teachings of the gospel as we can so we will not forfeit our foreordained opportunities to serve the Lord.<br><br>I called this faithful brother to serve at 7:20 a.m. Sunday morning, knowing that the general session of the conference would begin at 10:00 a.m. It seemed almost impossible to me how he would ever select his counselors, organize his high council, and make other calls to leadership in such a short period of time.<br><br>Expressing my concern that we were under such a terrible time constraint, this wonderful man smiled, reached into his shirt pocket, pulled out a piece of paper, and then said to me, "Brother Ballard, I am prepared. You see, I was told by the Spirit last night that I would be called to be the stake president. Here are my counselors, here are the men I would like to be my high council, here are the others to serve as leaders of the stake."<br><br>The new stake was organized and the leaders sustained during the 10:00 a.m. session. Immediately following the general session I set apart the leadership of the new stake. All was done through the use of interpreters and was possible because the principle of revelation directed the callings of Heavenly Father's children.<br><br>There is no doubt in my mind that the principle of revelation directs the Church today. I also know that our lives are carefully observed by Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We prepare to serve by the daily decisions we make, and these righteous decisions prepare us to fulfill the will of the Lord in helping to build the Church and the kingdom of God.<br><br>Now as we embark on the new year of 1986, I pray that the Lord will bless each one of us that we might make the necessary commitments in our own lives to live worthy of our membership in the only true church of Jesus Christ. May we prepare ourselves to serve the Lord in whatever capacity he may desire to call us. May the Lord bless each of us to repent where repentance is necessary, to choose to do the right things in life for the right reasons.<br><h2><b>A Sure Witness</b></h2><br>In closing, I feel impressed, my brothers and sisters, to share with you another very special experience that occurred on Sunday, November 10, in that same fourth-floor council room. I am the newest special witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I testify to you that our Heavenly Father's will was manifest through the spirit of revelation when the Council of the Twelve unanimously sustained the ordination and setting apart of President Ezra Taft Benson as the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Let no one question or wonder whether or not the power of revelation is manifest in the leading councils of the Church, for I witness to you tonight that as I stood in the circle as the junior apostle and laid my hand--along with the hands of the other apostles--upon the head of President Benson, the confirming witness came to me that the will of the Lord was being fulfilled on that sacred occasion. This experience was another sure witness to me that God our Father does live, that Jesus Christ is his son, that by the power of revelation the will of the Lord is made manifest in the callings of his sons and daughters to serve them in the Church.<br><br>May God bless every one of us here tonight that we will so live to have the Spirit of the Lord with us to help us make wise choices in the daily decisions of our lives. May you students especially be blessed to live in this world without ever succumbing to the evil practices that are so prevalent all about you.<br><h2><b>Anchor Your Faith</b></h2><br>I would pray a blessing to be upon each one of you, by the apostolic power that is mine under the ordination I have discussed with you tonight, that you might anchor your faith in the divine mission of this Church, in the mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and in the words of the scriptures that he brought forth to us in this last day, even the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.<br><br>You need anchors, my dear young brothers and sisters. Anchor your faith. If you are wavering for any reason, go to your knees, pick up your scriptures, study, ponder and pray, call down the blessings of heaven, and by the same power that we talked about this evening, the power of revelation, God will reveal to your soul the truthfulness of this great work.<br><br>There have been many attacks in many parts of the earth against the Church. We have been through some difficult times in these last few months. But I suggest that times could well get much worse than they are now, and the anchor to your faith and the anchor to mine must be on our own personal witness and revelation that the gospel of Jesus Christ has in fact been restored to the earth in its fullness through the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>I have been rereading the history of the Church. We just don't know what trouble is compared to the problems of the early leaders of this Church. I submit to you that those who remained true and faithful and went forward to establish this great work on the face of the earth were those men and women who had an unwavering testimony, a witness in their own hearts by the power of revelation earned by their own study, pondering, and prayers.<br><br>We love you. You are the future of the Church. I pray God will bless every one of you individually in your lives. If you are troubled with something, go to him in your prayers. If you need help, go to your bishops. Trust in the power of revelation and in the power of faith, which is the great power that moves this work forward.<br><br>May you be prepared to do all that you know how to in living your lives in such a way that you will be prepared to be chosen by the Lord to serve this great Church. This is my humble prayer that I offer in your behalf and mine in the sacred and beloved name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>M.

<h1> Oh Lord, Keep My Rudder True - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Matters of Loyalty</b></h2><br>A recent event on our campus helps set the stage for my remarks today. It was covered thoroughly by the press, including an excellent editorial published in the<i>Daily Universe.</i><br><br>The date was November 16, 1985--just over two months ago. We made history. Television covered it, the print media published it, and in the best Clint Eastwood fashion, we made Beano Cook's day. BYU booed its own quarterback.<br><br>One of America's truly distinguished philosophers, Josiah Royce, wrote:<br><br><i>Loyalty is for the loyal man not only a good, but for him the chief amongst all the moral goods of his life, because it furnishes ... him a personal solution</i>[to]<i>the hardest of</i>[all]<i>human ... problems, the problem: "For what do I live?"</i>[<i>The Philosophy of Loyalty</i>(New York: Macmillan Co., 1908), p. 57]<br><br>It is loyalty--loyalty to true principles and true people and honorable institutions and worthy ideals--that unifies our purpose in life and defines our morality. Where we have no such loyalties or convictions, no standards against which to measure our acts and their consequences, we are unanchored and adrift, "driven with the wind and tossed," says the scripture (James 1:6) until some other storm or problem or appetite takes us another direction for an equally short and unstable period of time. The older I get--which isn't old enough yet--the more I believe Professor Royce must have been right. "For what do I live?" is, in a sense, the inquiry every LDS missionary invites his or her investigator to make. If there is honest consideration of that question, then eternal truth has a fighting chance to bless the children of God. And such matters of loyalty and honor are important at BYU, for "to make [young people] capable of honesty," according to John Ruskin, "is the beginning of education." Samuel Johnson said it even better, "Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful" (Emerson Roy West,<i>Vital Quotations</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968], p. 177).<br><br>Let me go back to Robbie Bosco. There are a lot of reasons why that booing incident bothers me. First of all it bothers me that any BYU fan would boo anybody for any reason. If someone can explain to me the Christianity of that, I invite you to do so quickly. Obviously it bothers me that such an experience would be seared by Mr. Cook into the entire national memory as<i>the</i>most regrettable moment of the entire collegiate football season.<br><br>It bothers me that we would do this to a fellow student, a neighbor, a friend, a convert to the Church in this case. Not to mention, of course, that he also led us to two of our greatest years in BYU football history, including two conference championships, two post-season bowl games, a victory in the famed Kick-Off Classic, one undefeated season, and a national championship.<br><br>It bothers me that a very small handful of individuals could cast a cloud over a very fine game (which, by the way, we went on to win against a team that would end up fifth in the nation), and also cast something of a cloud over the whole season and, at least for me, cast a bit of a cloud over BYU football itself. At the same time I'm confident that this small handful of rabid fans on virtually every other day of the week are probably pretty decent folks who wouldn't think of speaking so shamefully to anyone's face but who somehow get caught up--or get caught down, as the case may be--in the fever of a game and watch their boorish behavior increase in direct proportion to the anonymity of the crowd and their own safe distance from a blitzing linebacker. Someone once said that no individual snowflake ever felt any responsibility for an avalanche. Maybe that is true in some activities on our campus as well.<br><br>What I wish to ask of you today is to be the kind of person who stands loyally by the principles and people and institutions to which you have declared allegiance, and that probably have given you most of the blessings you enjoy. In that sense what I say here has very little to do with fans or football or Beano Cook, whoever he is. The booing of a fellow human being is probably soon forgotten (except, perhaps, by the booee), so we apologize to Robbie and all others who have received unchristian treatment at our hands and move on to ask the larger question: "If every BYU student had exactly the same sense of loyalty I have, what kind of school, or church, or nation, or world would ours be?"<br><br>How much pressure is too much pressure to remain true? How much disappointment is too much disappointment to stand firm? How far is too far to walk with a discouraged friend, or a struggling spouse, or a troubled child? When the opposition heats up and the going gets tough, how much of what we thought was important to us will we defend and how much, in that inevitable tug and pull of life, will we find it convenient to give away?<br><br>As with so many abstractions that need to be made concrete, our homes and families are very good settings for an initial application. Would we, for example, stand by a younger brother or an older sister in times of despair or pain? Would we defend to the death our parents if they really needed our help? Even if our prayers are embarrassingly skimpy, don't we at least pray for the members of our family? I assume that those questions are easy to answer, because we say something like: "Well, I love them," or "I owe it to them," or "They would do the same thing for me."<br><br>Yet what we so often fail to remember is that we<i>should</i>feel that way about<i>everyone,</i>that "family" is the true Christian appellation for the entire human race. Have we made the Sunday greeting of "Brother Jones and Sister Brown" too common to remember why we say it? Has our hasty reference to "Father in Heaven" grown stale and insignificant? Will we ever widen our circle of influence beyond that already claimed by the Pharisees, who even in their benighted state did not boo other Pharisees? "What reward have ye? ... And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?" (Matthew 5:46–47). In matters of loyalty we all have a long way yet to go.<br><h2><b>Your Brother's Brother</b></h2><br>The late Alvin R. Dyer faced something of this challenge when he was a bishop many years ago. He had a member of his ward who said that smoking was the greatest single enjoyment he got out of life. He said, "At night I set my alarm every hour on the hour and wake up to smoke a cigarette. Bishop, I love smoking just too much to give it up."<br><br>A few evenings later the man's doorbell rang at 10:00 p.m. There on the doorstep was Bishop Dyer.<br><br>"Well, Bishop, what on earth are you doing here at this hour? I'm ready to go to bed."<br><br>"I know," said Bishop Dyer. "I want to see you set that alarm and watch you wake up and smoke."<br><br>"Good heavens, I can't do that in front of you," the man said.<br><br>"Oh, sure you can. Don't worry about me. I'll just sit in the corner somewhere and be very quiet."<br><br>The man invited him in and they talked about everything Bishop Dyer could conjure up to hold the man's interest. "I pursued every idea and conversation I could think of to keep him speaking. I thought he was going to throw me out a number of times, but shortly after three o'clock in the morning I said, 'Well, heavenly days! You've missed five alarms already. Please forgive me! I have ruined your evening's enjoyment. The night is such a disappointment now that you might as well just go to bed and forget the rest of the alarms this once!'"<br><br>Then note this language:<br><br><i>At that moment</i>[I]<i>felt</i>[in him]<i>a sense of honor and a dignity.... He looked at me with a peculiar smile ... and he said, "All right, I will."</i>[And]<i>he never touched another cigarette</i>[for the rest of his life]. [See Alvin R. Dyer,<i>Conference Report,</i>April 5, 1965, p. 85.]<br><br>How would you describe<i>Brother</i>Dyer's loyalty? Was it loyalty to that inactive man, or loyalty to the members of his ward generally, or loyalty to his office as bishop, or loyalty to the Word of Wisdom, or loyalty to the principle of revelation, or loyalty to the Church, or loyalty to God, or--well, you get my point.<br><br>His<i>Father in Heaven</i>asks Cain, "Where is Abel thy<i>brother?</i>" and Cain fires back, "I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?" (Genesis 4:9; emphasis added). Maybe the answer to that question is--as Professor Chauncey Riddle once said to me--"No, Cain, you are not expected to be your brother's keeper. But you are expected to be your brother's brother."<br><br>Consider for a moment the kind of treachery Cain introduced into the world--the betrayal of family, friends, and fellow citizens. His legacy is a chilling one and his colleagues are legion.<br><br><i>Dante reserve</i>[d]<i>the innermost circle of hell</i>[for this crowd,]<i>for those who</i>[turn against their own].<i>There he has placed Judas, Brutus, and Cassius--the most notorious of traitors--in the three mouths of Satan himself. Revealingly, the poet does not rely on the image of fire for his description of their plight. The souls of traitors are held fast in a lake of ice. Clearly, the worst of sins against</i>[one's]<i>brother</i>[or sister]<i>are those of the frozen heart. Those who are disloyal to others have chosen a life isolated and immobile, a life, in effect, hostile to life, for which the only adequate image is a sunless waste of ice.</i>[William F. May,<i>A Catalogue of Sins</i>(New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1967), pp. 111–12]<br><br>Well, if we are not called upon to defend a member of the family quite so openly as Cain was, perhaps we will have opportunities to defend the Church.<br><h2><b>"True Blue, Through and Through"</b></h2><br>After four years of missionary service in the Hawaiian Islands (begun at age fifteen, by the way), young Joseph F. Smith returned to the mainland and began making his way back to the Salt Lake Valley. But these were difficult times. Feelings toward the Latter-day Saints were running very high. The terrible experience at Mountain Meadows was fresh in the minds of many people. Polygamy had become a national political issue, and at that very hour Albert Sidney Johnston's army was on its way to the Utah territory under orders from the president of the United States. Less disciplined than the U.S. Army were many frontiersmen scattered abroad who vowed openly they would murder every Mormon anywhere they could be found.<br><br>It was back into that world that nineteen-year-old Joseph F. Smith drove his team and wagon. One evening the little company with which he traveled had barely made camp before a company of drunken men rode in on horseback, cursing and swearing and threatening to kill. Some of the older men, when they heard the riders coming, had gone down into the brush by the creek, waiting out of sight for the band to pass. But young Joseph F. had been out a distance from the camp gathering wood for the fire and so was not aware of the potential problem. With the openness of youth he walked back toward the camp, only to realize too late the difficult circumstance he now faced almost totally alone.<br><br>His first thought was to drop the wood and run toward the creek, seeking shelter in the trees in his flight. Then the thought came to him, "Why should I run from [my faith]?" With that compelling sense of loyalty firmly in his mind, he continued to carry his armful of wood to the edge of the fire. As he was about to deposit his load, one of the ruffians, pistol cocked and pointed squarely at the young man's head, cursed as only a drunken rascal can and demanded in a loud, angry voice, "I'm a killer of Mormons, boy. Are you a Mormon?"<br><br>Without a moment of hesitation and looking the heathen directly in the eye, Joseph F., scarcely old enough to be entering the MTC, boldly answered, "Yes, siree; died in the wool; true blue, through and through."<br><br>The answer was given so boldly and without any sign of fear that it completely disarmed this belligerent man. In his bewilderment he put down his pistol, grasped the young missionary by the hand, and said, "Well, you are the-- --bravest man I ever met! Shake, young fellow, I'm glad to see a lad that stands up for his convictions."<br><br>Years later, while serving as the president of the Church, Joseph F. Smith said that he truly expected to take at point-blank range the full charge from the barrel of that man's pistol. But he also said that after his initial inclination to run, it never again entered his mind to do anything but stand up for his beliefs and face the death that appeared to be the inevitable result of such conviction. (Taken from Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Life of Joseph F. Smith</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1938], p. 188–89.)<br><br>Montaigne's ancient cry of the storm-tossed sailor comes to mind: "Oh, Lord, thou shalt save me if thou please; if not, thou shalt lose me; yet Lord will I keep my rudder true" (see Michel Eyquem de Montaigne,<i>Essays,</i>book II, chapter 16).<br><br>But of course it is not enough to be loyal to just any cause. What carried nineteen-year-old Joseph F. Smith so courageously was his answer to the question: "For what do I live?" It was for gospel truth that he stood up to be counted and for which he was willing to die.<br><h2><b>They Did Not Falter</b></h2><br>Brigham Young certainly had repeated opportunities to hold a steady course, particularly in those early and difficult years at the side of the Prophet Joseph Smith. While the First Presidency was away from Kirtland attempting to stabilize the difficult financial circumstances they faced in the winter of 1836–37, a council was called by those who were opposed to Joseph Smith's continuing in his office as prophet and president of the Church.<br><br><i>On this occasion</i>[Brigham Young]<i>"rose up ... in a plain and forcible manner" and told them "that Joseph was a Prophet, and I knew it, and that they might rail and slander him as much as they pleased; they could not destroy the appointment of the Prophet of God, they could only destroy their own authority, cut the thread that bound them to the Prophet and to God, and sink themselves to hell."</i><br><br><i>Some of those present reacted violently</i>[toward Brigham]. One<i>Jacob Bump ... fancied himself a pugilist. While several held him back, he twisted and turned, shouting, "How can I keep my hands off that man?" "Lay them on,</i>"<i>responded Brigham, "if it will give you any relief!"</i><br><br>But the man didn't lay them on. A few nights later Brigham heard a man running through the Kirtland streets at midnight shouting loudly and denouncing the Prophet Joseph. Even at that late hour Brigham jumped out of bed, went into the street and<br><br><i>jerked</i>[the man]<i>round, and assured him that if he did not stop his noise, and let the people enjoy their sleep ... I would cowhide him on the spot, for we had the Lord's Prophet right here, and we did not want the devil's prophet yelling</i>[up and down]<i>the streets.</i><br><br>These were days of genuine "crisis," he reported, "when earth and hell seemed leagued to overthrow the Prophet and the Church of God. The knees of many of the strongest men in the Church faltered." But Brigham Young did not falter, yet before that year was over his own life was in jeopardy for such loyalty. On December 22 he said:<br><br><i>I had to leave to save my life. ...</i><br><br><i>... I left Kirtland in consequence of the fury of the mob, and the spirit that prevailed in the apostates, who had threatened to destroy me because I would proclaim, publicly and privately, that I knew by the power of the Holy Ghost, that</i><br><br><i>Joseph Smith was a Prophet of the Most High God.</i>[Leonard Arrington,<i>Brigham Young: American Moses</i>(New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1985), pp. 56–61 passim]<br><br>And what of Joseph Smith himself? Even as he was being dragged away from his wife and children one more time, he said,<br><br><i>I am exposed to far greater danger from traitors among ourselves than from enemies without, ... All the enemies upon the face of the earth may roar and exert all their power to bring about my death, but they can accomplish nothing, unless some who are among us and enjoy our society ... bring their united vengeance upon our heads.</i>[<i>HC</i>6, p. 152]<br><br>And bring their united vengeance they did. Does a prophet of God deserve that from his "friends?" What does one have a right to expect from those who "enjoy our society?" (Remember that Macbeth's crime against his king is all the more treacherous because Duncan was a guest in Macbeth's house.) Is it possible that each of us who claims the privileges and benefits of the kingdom of God will have our own fiery furnace to pass through in which our loyalty is purified as dramatically as it was for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego? Is there some kind of battleground out there ahead of us, some kind of moral Kirtland or metaphysical Carthage that will yet give us our chance to stand up and be counted, like the 2,000 stripling warriors of whom it was said, "They were ... true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20)?<br><h2><b>Your Word of Honor</b></h2><br>With so much that so many have loyally given to provide us with what we have, perhaps you can imagine my disappointment when from time to time a few who accept the university's opportunity and the Church's significant financial contribution then violate those standards of behavior and propriety and integrity to which each has voluntarily agreed. And lest anyone be mistaken, please be assured that I am not speaking just now of crowd behavior at a ball game. I speak of a few clubs and club members and others who brag of drinking beer and partying like would-be prostitutes and then seem absolutely amazed that they and their groups are in terminal jeopardy at the university. I speak of returned missionaries who violate temple covenants, of a faculty member who violates the tender testimony of a youth, of thieves on a campus that now must post warning signs in "high theft areas" that are a disgrace to everything BYU stands for. I speak of off-campus housing violations that see flagrant abuse of our moral standards where neither those guilty participants nor their roommates display enough integrity to make a wrong circumstance right. Though these may not be committed on the field of battle nor result in the death of a famous figure, they seem to me nevertheless villainy and treachery indeed--dishonesty of a terribly destructive kind.<br><br>Karl G. Maeser, the first president of this university, once wrote:<br><br>[My young friends,]<i>I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape; but stand me on the floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i>[West,<i>Vital Quotations,</i>p. 167]<br><br>At the start of a new calendar year and the beginning of another important academic semester, may I invite you to examine your very soul, to look deeply within your habits and inclinations and measure your loyalties against the divine standard of our Savior, Jesus Christ. How prepared are you for the difficult things you may yet face in acquiring an education or serving a mission or raising a family or defending your beliefs? As preparation for the assault that will yet be made upon your character and convictions, is it hoping too much to see you cherish clear language and clean entertainment and hard work and disciplined behavior? If we were, this very hour, in a fictional foxhole somewhere against an enemy who put our eternal lives at risk, would I be safe in your hands? Would you be safe in mine?<br><h2><b>Sergeant Stewart</b></h2><br>More than thirty years ago about fifteen LDS soldiers crowded into a frontline bunker in Korea to hold a Sunday service. They used their canteen cups and C-ration crackers to bless and partake of the sacrament. Then they held a testimony meeting. One young man introduced himself simply as Sergeant Stewart from Idaho. He was a short, small man about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing about 150 pounds. His great ambition had been to become a good athlete, but coaches considered him too small for most team sports. So he had concentrated on individual competition and had gained some success as a wrestler and a distance runner. Sergeant Stewart related to his fourteen battle-weary brethren an experience he had just had with his company commander, a giant of a man named Lieutenant Jackson who was 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 245 pounds; an outstanding college athlete. The sergeant spoke of him in glowing terms as a tremendous officer and a Christian gentleman, inspiring those who were fortunate enough to serve under his command.<br><br>Shortly before the Church service in which they now found themselves, Sergeant Stewart had been assigned to a patrol under the direction of Lieutenant Jackson. As they moved down near the base of a hill they held, they were ambushed by enemy fire. The lieutenant out in front was<br><br><i>riddled ... by automatic small-arms fire. As he fell he managed to drag himself to the shelter of a nearby rock ... while the rest of the patrol scrambled up the hill to regroup.</i><br><br><i>Since he was next in command, the responsibility now fell upon Sergeant Stewart. He</i>[sent the]<i>largest and seemingly strongest man ... down the hill to rescue the lieutenant. The others would provide him with cover.</i><br><br><i>The man was gone for approximately half an hour, only to return and report that he could not budge the wounded officer--he was too heavy. ... The men started grumbling about getting out of there before somebody else got hit.</i>[Then]<i>someone was heard to say, "Let's forget about the lieutenant; after all, he's just a nigger!" At this point Sergeant Stewart turned to his men, and pulling himself up to his full 65-inch stature, he spoke in very matter-of-fact tones: "I don't care if he's black or green or any other color. We're not leaving without him. He wouldn't leave any of us in similar circumstances. Besides, he's our commanding officer and I love him like my own brother. "</i><br><br>Then he headed down the hill alone.<br><br><i>... When he finally reached</i>[the lieutenant, the officer]<i>was weak from loss of blood, and he assured the sergeant that it was a hopeless cause--there would be no way to get him back to the aid station in time. It was then that Sergeant Stewart's great faith in his Heavenly Father came to his assistance. He took off his helmet, knelt beside his fallen leader and said, "Pray with me, Lieutenant."...</i><br><br><i>"Dear Lord," he pleaded, "I need strength--far beyond the capacity of my physical body. This great man, thy son, who lies critically wounded here beside me, must have medical attention soon. I need the power to carry him up this hill to an aid station where he can receive the treatment he needs to preserve his life. I know, Father, that thou hast promised the strength of ten to him whose heart and hands are clean and pure.</i>I feel that I can qualify<i>. Please, Dear Lord, grant me this blessing."</i><br><br>Then he thanked his Father in Heaven for the power of prayer and the privilege of holding the priesthood. He then put on his helmet, reached down and picked up his fallen friend, cradled him over his shoulders and carried him back up the hill to safety (from Ben F. Mortensen, "Sergeant Stewart,"<i>The Instructor,</i>March 1969, pp. 82–83).<br><h2><b>Remaining True</b></h2><br>Someone else ascended a difficult hill once--with us cradled carefully on his shoulders. But as Christ moved closer and closer to Calvary, his defenders became fewer and fewer in number. As the pressure mounted and the troubles increased, he said:<br><br><i>... There are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. ...</i><br><br><i>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</i>[John 6:64]<br><br>Later, the Roman soldiers and the chief priests came to capture him, "a great multitude with swords and staves," Matthew says. "Then<i>all</i>the disciples forsook him, and fled" (Matthew 26:47, 56).<br><br>Enter Judas with the calculated kiss of betrayal.<br><br>We cannot know exactly what Judas was thinking nor why he chose the path he did. Perhaps he did not think it would end that way. As William F. May said:<br><br>[One who is disloyal]<i>may not</i>[have intended malice]. ...<i>He may even be convinced that he accomplishes a certain good by his actions. In these cases, it is well to be reminded that</i>[some kinds of]<i>betrayal ha</i>[ve]<i>a way of producing results</i>[far]<i>beyond</i>[our] ...<i>control.</i>[A sequence]<i>more savage than</i>[we]<i>intended.</i>[I take a certain stand or make a certain speech toward another],<i>only wanting to see him cut down to size, but I may live to see him get cut to ribbons....</i><br><br><i>"When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.' 'They said, 'What is that to us? See to it yourself'</i>"<i>(Matthew</i>27:3–4).<i>Precisely because everything has been placed beyond the traitor's reach ..., the sense of the irreversibility of it all is overwhelming. There is nothing left to be done. Judas hangs himself,</i>[perhaps]<i>as an act of atonement,</i>...<i>but</i>[also perhaps]<i>because no</i>[act]<i>of atonement--from Judas--is</i>[any longer]<i>possible.</i>[May,<i>A Catalogue of Sins,</i>pp. 118–19]<br><br>Yet it is also here in this hour, in absolute and utter loneliness, that loyalty to principle and love for one's brothers and sisters reaches its most exalted and eternal manifestation. Sweating great drops of blood from every pore and pleading that the cup might pass, yet Jesus remains true, submitting his will to that of his father and determined to do the work of the kingdom. Moments later, with taunts and spit and scorn and jeers, and spikes rending his perfect flesh, principle triumphs over both passion and pain as the saving sibling of us all prays for his brothers and sisters, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>At this crucial time in your life I urge you to give your deepest loyalties to the highest causes in eternity--those contained in the life and mission and message of the Only Begotten Son of God. If we can remain true there, with an eye single to that standard, all other loyalties will fall naturally into place. Inasmuch as we do not sing at the close of these devotionals, perhaps you will forgive me if I quote two verses from two hymns before our benediction.<br><br>To all who wish to know heaven's determination to stand by them in difficult times, we sing:<br><br><i>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose</i><br><i>I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;</i><br><i>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</i><br><i>I'll never, no never, no never forsake!</i><br><br>["How Firm a Foundation<i>," Hymns,</i>1985, no. 85]<br><br>And for the personal strength to stand true, even in such times of personal pain, we sing more privately to ourselves:<br><br><i>He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;</i><br><i>He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat.</i><br><i>Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant my feet!</i><br><i>Our God is marching on.</i><br>["Battle Hymn of the Republic,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 60]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 21 January 1986.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>: Becoming Meek and Lowly in Heart - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
I will never forget the first time Jeff tried to kiss me. We were standing in the entryway of my home when my mother unexpectedly walked into the room and caught him in the act. Jeff, being the fast thinker he is, said, "Hi, Sister Terry. Pat and I were just trading gum."<br><br>Later my mother, in retelling the incident to my father, said, "Jeff's confidence in a difficult situation amazes me. The fact that he can think that fast on his feet will certainly ensure his success."<br><br>My father smiled at me and said, "Confidence is a great blessing to anyone who has it. But Jeff is also smart enough to know what to have confidence in. Both of you need to remember that your greatest strength and surest success will come through<i>humility</i>and dependence upon the Lord."<br><br>I have thought a lot about my father's wisdom, especially now when it seems our society appears to value success and the whole self-image package at almost any price.<br><br>Meekness and lowliness in heart are certainly not characteristics any contemporary young urban professional--an honest-to-goodness "Yuppy"--would want to claim. Instead, it seems that these young men and women want to be regarded as totally confident in manner, dependent upon no one, assertive, and excessively protective of their image of self--in short, one who is<i>always</i>on the move<i>up.</i><br><br>Yet so much that the scriptures teach us suggests that we ought to be on our way<i>down,</i>down into the depths of humility, stripped of our pride and our vanity, and, yes, stripped of a lot of our Yuppy-like materialism. Listen to this from the Savior:<br><br><i>But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</i><br><br><i>For</i>[who]<i>is greater, he that sitteth at</i>[the table],<i>or he that serveth? is</i>[it]<i>not he that sitteth at</i>[the table]<i>? but I am among you as he that serveth.</i>[Luke 22:26–27]<br><br>It doesn't sound as if the Lord has called us to astonish the world by marvelous enterprise, but he has said, "[Come] learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" (Matthew 11:29).<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Council of the Twelve has told us being meek and lowly of heart does not mean being used or abused--or being a "doormat" for others. "Meekness," he says, "is more than self-restraint; it is the<i>presentation of self</i>in a posture of kindness and gentleness, reflecting certitude, strength, serenity, and a healthy self-esteem and self-control" ("Meekness--A Dimension of True Discipleship,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1983, p. 71; emphasis added).<br><br>In a recent episode of "Family Ties," Michael J. Fox's character, Alex Keaton, who is hardly your classic example of meekness and lowliness of heart, was explaining to his younger sister Jennifer why he had agreed to help her with a homework assignment. They were, he said in effect, true Yuppies at heart--solid competitors on their way up.<br><br>"When you were four years old," he told Jennifer, "I watched you making sand castles with your friend Brucie. Brucie made a beautiful castle and your mound looked like the servants' quarters. You were mad that he had made a better castle, and so you told him that the ice cream man was coming. Once Brucie looked away, you crushed his castle."<br><br>"See, Jennifer," Alex said, "you are like me. You will do anything to get ahead, even if it means crushing your best friend's castle. I am proud of you."<br><br>Of course, Alex on that show is something of a spoof, a caricature of materialistic upward mobility. But let's take him at face value for a moment. Why is it so necessary always to be on top of the ladder and to be regarded by<i>others</i>as successful? Why is it so terrible to admit that we do have weaknesses or to admit that we do make mistakes and are not always as competent as we would like to be?<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson warns us that one of Satan's greatest tools is pride, which can "cause a man or a woman to center so much attention on self that he or she becomes insensitive to their Creator or fellow beings" ("This Is a Day of Sacrifice,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1979, p. 34).<br><br>Satan uses that very delicate line between self-confidence and pride to blind us. He can keep us so frenzied in our efforts to protect our self-esteem that we are blinded to the one quality that would assure it--true dependence upon the Lord.<br><br>The Lord reveals his secrets to the meek, for they are "easy to be entreated" (Alma 7:23). Indeed, I have come to realize that my own personal promptings from the Lord most often occur when I have been brought down into the depths of humility and suddenly feel a lot less confident in my own ability and much more dependent upon the Lord. He certainly uses my pain as his megaphone for an otherwise dull ear. I am beginning to see that the very experiences I would have chosen to run away from at the time have really been the major motivational turning points in my life. Perhaps this is the reason President Spencer W. Kimball, who achieved so much success through humility, said he worked on that challenge every single day of his life. He knew that if we were to achieve success in this life and eternal life in the world to come, we would need to become totally dependent upon the Lord.<br><br>When asked how to remain humble, President Kimball offered this formula:<br><br><i>First, you evaluate yourself. What am I? I am the circle. I am the hole in the doughnut. I would be nothing without the Lord. My breath, my brains, my hearing, my sight, my locomotion, my everything depends upon the Lord. That is the first step and then we pray, and pray often, and we will not get up from our knees until we have communicated. The line may be down; we may have let it fall to pieces, but I will not get up from my knees until I have established communication--if it is twenty minutes, if it is all night like Enos. ... If it takes all day long, you stay on your knees until your unhumbleness has dissipated, until you feel the humble spirit and realize, "I could die this minute if it were not for the Lord's good grace. I am dependent upon him--totally dependent upon him</i>." [<i>TSWK</i>pp. 233–34]<br><br>That kind of counsel may not sound like something Alex Keaton can handle, but perhaps the rest of us could give it a try.<br><br>It seems very clear to me that if we can have much more confidence in the presence of God, then we will not be nearly so dependent upon nor need the approval, the acceptance, and the admiration of men. And we remind young Alex what the Lord has promised in return, "I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing--yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth" (D&amp;amp;C 19:38).<br><br>May I share with you the greatest testimony I have of this truth. I have silently watched over the years as the confidence in the young man who once tried to kiss me has turned from youthful courage to perfect faith and total dependence upon the Lord. He has always gone to the Lord for help, but never more than now--and never more than for<i>you.</i>And even though he is getting a bit lumpy, graying at the temples, and retaining more of his laugh wrinkles, his lowliness of heart makes him beautiful to me.<br><br>It is my prayer that we might have eyes that really see how pride can destroy our peace. And that our ears might really hear when he calls, "Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find<i>rest</i>unto your souls" (Matthew 11:29; emphasis added). Of that I bear testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Patricia T. Holland, wife of Jeffrey R. Holland, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 21 January 1986.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
Though my name is Japanese, and my roots are from Japan, I was born and reared in Hawaii. We have Elder Yoshihiko Kikuchi from Japan among the General Authorities. He is the<i>real</i>Japanese General Authority, and I am the imitation one.<br><br>I recently celebrated my forty-fifth anniversary as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When I was baptized as a young man of seventeen, I did not have a knowledge of the gospel, but I knew for a surety that the Prophet Joseph Smith had seen the Father and the Son in a grove of trees in upstate New York. The missionaries taught me that story, and I gained a testimony of its truthfulness.<br><h2><b>There Is a Law</b></h2><br>May I share with you tonight my testimony of how the multitude of blessings from our Father in Heaven through his Son Jesus Christ are available to us all as we obey and keep his commandments.<br><br>In latter-day revelations we find,<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have</i>so<i>much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>To illustrate this point, I am reminded of an experience in Hawaii while I was serving in a bishopric there. I was assigned to the MIA, and at one time we needed a new president for the YWMIA and a new superintendent for the YMMIA. As we met together to consider who should fill the positions, the bishop asked that we kneel in prayer. He petitioned the Lord, seeking inspiration and revelation for this couple.<br><br>After the amen was said, the bishop asked the first counselor if he had any promptings, and he named a serviceman and his wife. The husband was a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood and was not as active as he should be because he had a smoking habit. The bishop asked for my recommendation, and similarly the name of this couple had come very strongly to my mind. The bishop had received the same impression.<br><br>We immediately called the couple to the bishop's office and he stated to the couple that the Lord had called them to be the superintendent and president of the ward MIA. The brother immediately put up his hands and said, "Bishop, thank you for your consideration, but I cannot accept the calling because I have a smoking habit."<br><br>The bishop reminded the brother that the calling was without the cigarette. Then the brother started to tell of his long battle with this habit. For the previous six years he had been trying to overcome this smoking habit. (This was during the Korean War in 1954.) He would abstain from smoking for six months and then would go out on duty aboard ship. In the quiet and lonely hours on deck, he'd be standing in the fantail of the ship, and from the opposite side would come a sailor who would light up a cigarette. That smoke would drift toward his nose, and the temptation was all too great for him to not ask for a puff. After the puff he would feel guilty for breaking his long abstinence.<br><br>This wise bishop, inspired by the Lord, asked his brother if he loved his wife who sat next to him, and the brother was quick to answer yes. "Even to the point of defending her honor with your life if necessary?" he was asked. Without hesitation he quickly said yes again. Then the bishop said to him, "Do you feel the same about your two beautiful teen-age daughters?" And again he answered yes. The bishop then shocked us all by calling this man a big liar. The brother immediately stood up, flexed his big arms and fists, and said, "Nobody calls me a liar in front of my wife. If you weren't my bishop you'd be lying on the floor right now."<br><br>The bishop asked the brother, "Are you really good and mad?" And he replied, "Sure I am." Then this wise bishop said, "Please, listen carefully to what I will tell you." Then he told this serviceman that in one breath he was saying he loved his wife and his daughters so much that he would even defend their honor with his life; yet in another breath he said he could not accept a call from the Lord because a cigarette habit was hampering his progress in this life to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained an elder so he could be sealed to his wife and daughters for time and all eternity in the temple. The bishop said to him, "What if you went to sea duty and your ship was sunk and you died without being sealed to your wife and daughters? And then your dear wife remarried a good man who took her and your daughters to the temple to be sealed to him. What would become of you in the next world? You should go home today, gather your family together, pray about this, and ask the Lord for direction and help."<br><br>The couple left the bishop's office and returned to their Sunday School class. Before the class period was over, this brother came to me and said that he and his wife would like to see the bishop again. As we sat in the office he told the bishop, "I have no desire to smoke again and will accept the calling." He further asked for a blessing to help him to have faith, overcome his habit, and accomplish his goal. We gave him a blessing.<br><br>They served valiantly as a husband and wife team in leading the ward MIA and did a fine job. He was later recommended to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and was ordained an elder. The bishopric and many members of the ward were at the Hawaii Temple to witness the sealing of the husband and wife and their two beautiful daughters. There were many happy tears shed that day.<br><br>The Lord says, "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated" (D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21).<br><br>This serviceman and his family moved from our ward to the naval housing area in the Pearl Harbor Stake. He was called as the second counselor in that stake's YMMIA presidency; still later he was transferred to the Bremerton, Washington, shipyard. One day as I looked at the<i>Church News</i>where they used to publish the pictures of new bishoprics, I saw this brother sitting with a smile on his face and his counselors seated next to him. He had been called as a new bishop! This was about three years after that Sunday when the bishop had talked to him. Surely the Lord is no respecter of persons and will bless all who will order their lives in conformity with gospel principles.<br><br>The Lord also said, "And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you may understand my will concerning you. Or, in other words, I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation" (D&amp;amp;C 82:8–9).<br><br>Then he said, "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, let us follow the example of our Savior and Redeemer, who always was obedient to the will of his Father in Heaven.<br><h2><b>The Straight and Narrow Path</b></h2><br>In his book<i>The Promised Messiah,</i>Elder Bruce R. McConkie said that<br><br><i>Christ came to reveal his Father to mankind. There is no better way to envision who and what the Father is than to come to know his Son. The Son is in all respects as the Father. They look alike; each is in the express image of the person of the other. Their thoughts are the same; they speak forth the same eternal truths; and every deed done by one is the same thing the other would do under the same circumstances.</i>[<i>The Promised Messiah: The First Coming of Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), pp. 17–18]<br><br>Jesus said, "He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me" (John 12:44–45).<br><br>Also, "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 14:6–7, 9).<br><br>The Savior, though he was without sin, set the pattern that we might follow, as he was baptized to take away the sins of the world.<br><br>Nephi, the great Book of Mormon prophet, tells us:<br><br><i>And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness,</i>O<i>then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</i><br><br><i>And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</i><br><br><i>Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</i>[2 Nephi 31:5–7]<br><br>The Savior showed mankind the way, the straight and narrow path, by which we should enter the gate, and we are promised if we endure to the end and keep the commandments after baptism, we can gain eternal life.<br><br>The Lord knew that earthly experience does not come easily, but by hard work and long-suffering. He himself became the author of the plan of salvation through obedience. The sufferings of our Savior were part of his education. The Apostle Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, said, "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him" (Hebrews 5:8–9).<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, who suffered many tribulations during the course of his life, said, "Suffering can make saints of people as they learn patience, long-suffering, and self-mastery" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 168). President Kimball quotes Elder James E. Talmage, who states, "No pang that is suffered by man or woman upon the earth will be without its compensating effect . . . if it be met with patience" (<i>Tragedy or Destiny</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1961], p. 6).<br><br>President Kimball further says, "On the other hand, these things can crush us with their mighty impact if we yield to weakness, complaining and criticism." He quotes Orson F. Whitney, who said:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to</i>. . .<i>the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God .</i>. .<i>and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i>[<i>Tragedy or Destiny,</i>p. 6]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith had gone through many trials and tribulations in his life and pleaded with the Lord for the suffering Saints in his day. The Lord said to him,<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i><br><br><i>Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–9]<br><br>We find in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 42, verses 45, 46, and 47:<br><br><i>Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them;</i><br><br><i>And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter.</i><br><h2><b>"Forgive One Another"</b></h2><br>The Lord gave us many challenges by way of commandments, as he so instructed us through his apostles of old.<br><br><i>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</i><br><br><i>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</i><br><br><i>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</i><br><br><i>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</i>[John 15:10–12, 15]<br><br>Again in latter-day revelation, the Lord spoke through the Prophet Joseph in yet another commandment regarding our responsibilities to share the gospel with others.<br><br><i>That every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.</i><br><br><i>And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man, to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:40–41]<br><br>The Lord is saying that when we see someone fall into sin, we must be kind and fellowship that person back into activity with the pure love of Christ, in meekness and using mild tones.<br><br>Paul, in speaking to the Galatians, teaches us, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted" (Galatians 6:1).<br><br>The Savior, again regarding sin and forgiveness, gave us this--revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br><i>Nevertheless, he has sinned, but verily I say unto you, I</i>,<i>the Lord, forgive sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who have not sinned unto death.</i><br><br><i>My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:7–8]<br><br>When someone crosses our path it's easy, brothers and sisters, for us to say to him, "Forget it, you're forgiven." But when we are reminded of that incident, we sometimes do not remember what we have said and continue to talk about the problem. The Lord reminds us of our responsibility and why we should forgive and forget.<br><br><i>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:9]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I once went into a business partnership with a man who was very astute. I thought because he was a member of the Church he was going to take care of me and teach me as his junior partner. I was so grateful that he was willing to share with me that opportunity of being in business with him. But after three months of work, I found that I was doing most of the work (his participation was very small), and the business was not as he said it was going to be. It was a very sad experience for me, and I became very sour. After a few more months I hardly had any income, so I finally had to dissolve the partnership.<br><br>For about a year after that, I had a bitter feeling within myself. It was not easy for me whenever anyone asked me about this man. I was not complimentary concerning him. After a year of cankering my soul with bitterness, the good Lord blessed me with understanding, and I realized that I must change. Every time someone would ask me about him I'd say, "He's such an astute business man you have to be careful. He's great. He's tremendously<i>akamai</i>, as we say in Hawaii--that is, smart. I would say nothing but the best I could think about him. Soon, brothers and sisters, this good word got back to him. In the past he avoided me; now he would call my name from afar and say "Adney, how's everything?" We became friends. He started sending me Christmas cards of his family in color. I remembered that verse, "Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin" (D&amp;amp;C 64:9).<br><br>The Lord gave us the tenth verse of that scripture, the law of forgiveness, when he said, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10). I think you and I must do this, brothers and sisters. It's not easy, I'm sure. We have recently seen the great disaster of the seven astronauts, and now, through an extensive investigation, they are trying to find out what happened. It's hard when we face a disaster like this, but we must not place blame because the Lord has said, "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10).<br><h2><b>Hate the Sin But Love the Sinner</b></h2><br>There is a great parable in the story of the prodigal son that the Lord gave us for several reasons. I think there's a great story behind it, and I'd like to go over that parable with you tonight and try to glean out some of the points that I think are very important.<br><br><i>And he said, A certain man had two sons:</i><br><br><i>And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.</i><br><br><i>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</i><br><br><i>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</i><br><br><i>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</i><br><br><i>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</i><br><br><i>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</i><br><br><i>I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</i><br><br><i>And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</i><br><br><i>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</i><br><br><i>And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</i><br><br><i>But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</i><br><br><i>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:</i><br><br><i>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</i><br><br><i>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.</i><br><br><i>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</i><br><br>The brother was very angry and would not go in the house. Therefore, the father came out and talked to him. And the older brother said:<br><br><i>Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</i><br><br><i>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</i><br><br><i>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad, for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</i>[Luke 15:11–27, 29–32]<br><br>This parable teaches us several important lessons. First, brothers and sisters, it counsels us to forgive one another, that we should not look on the weak points of the person who has fallen.<br><br>You who are here and have left parents behind to come to this great institution to study and learn and to get an education must remember that you have parents who love you very much. The joy of the father is obvious as he welcomes his son home. I'm sure your parents feel the same, no matter what you do in this life.<br><br>I hope that we will always remember the love of our mothers and fathers. They would do anything and everything for us. We who are now members of this Church and kingdom of God, under the restored principles that have been given to us by the Prophet Joseph, have certain things we must do. We must obey and keep the commandments. It's not easy to walk the straight and narrow path. It's a challenge with the world filled with pornography and all the wiles of the devil. But we should always remember that we have loving parents who are our best friends. Let's confide in them. Let's take our innermost feelings to them, share our thoughts with them, and be unafraid. Sister Komatsu and I have four children, and we know that whatever they do in this life, they are still our children. As the Lord said, I must forgive; I must love.<br><br>When you're far away from home, and I met some of you tonight who are very far from home--from South Africa, and many states in the United States--you are assigned to a ward with a bishop and a stake president. When you're in a dire situation and your parents are not available and you need an answer, you have a bishop. We never set our parents aside for the bishop, but when they're not available, we should go to our bishop. I was a bishop once, and you know a bishop cannot tell a lie--for if he did, the Lord would know it, and he would not be a bishop for long.<br><br>After the bishop has talked to you, perhaps you're still not quite satisfied with what he has told you; then see the stake president. I hope that you will always remember that you must keep the law; you must obey the commandments. We are told that if we endure to the end, the Lord will bless us with eternal life.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee had lost his wife and then, while he was at a stake conference in Hawaii, received a call from the doctor attending his daughter, saying, "President, if you don't come home right away, I don't think your daughter will be alive when you arrive. Please make every effort to come quickly."<br><br>President Lee begged the doctor to try to keep her alive until he could complete his assignment and return home. He had only two daughters, and she was very dear to him. He prayed all night long, petitioning to the Lord, "Please, please, Lord, keep her alive until I can come home." But in the wee hours of the morning he received a call from the doctor who said, "I'm very sorry, President, but your loving daughter has passed away."<br><br>President Lee felt very lonely and sad, yet there was a special witness from the Lord. Searching for solace, he turned to section 58 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.</i><br><br><i>Remember this, which I tell you before, that you may lay it to heart, and receive that which is to follow.</i><br><br><i>Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I have sent you--that you might be obedient, and that your hearts might be prepared to bear testimony of the things which are to come;</i><br><br><i>And also that you might be honored in laying the foundation, and in bearing record of the land upon which the Zion of God shall stand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:2–7]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball often said that we should hate the sin but love the sinner. We should fellowship him who has gone astray and love him back into the fold.<br><br>Recently I interviewed a young lady who needed clearance from a General Authority before she could go on a mission. As she came in, I could see that she was very concerned about the interview. I assured her that she could go on this mission that she had been working toward for the past few years. Then she burst into tears, and they flowed freely down both cheeks. I asked her to tell me about her concerns. She started by saying that during her young teenage years she left home and started a life with her peers, thinking this was what she wanted. After about two and a half years she became involved with drugs and all kinds of worldly ways and was living a life of sex and loose morals. One day, as she groveled in self-pity, like the story of the prodigal son, she decided to return home because she realized that nothing good could come from her life-style.<br><br>Humbly, she returned home to her parents. To her surprise, they took her in and blessed her with medical help and the love that she never appreciated before. After four years of rehabilitation, she had a desire to serve the Lord as a missionary and worked closely with her bishop and stake president to qualify for this calling.<br><br>I told her that when she received her call as a missionary, she would bring into the hearts of her parents unspeakable joy, for their daughter who was lost had come alive again. I told her that all of the years of heartaches she had caused her parents, especially when they knew she was living close by and was steeped in drugs and doing all the things they had taught her were wrong--all of those heartaches would melt and swiftly disappear because now she had straightened herself out and desired to serve her Father in Heaven. When she received her call, there would be no higher honor paid to her parents, especially her mother who brought her into the world and nursed her and nurtured her. I told this young lady that missionary work is not easy, but the joy that she will receive from her labors as a missionary will be an eternal blessing that she will cherish forever and ever.<br><br>Missionaries must not lie. They must not cheat. They must not deceive anyone. They must be honest, clean, and pure. Henry David Thoreau said that "when our thoughts are pure, our spirit automatically flows unto God." And I know that if missionaries will be pure and clean, their spirits will flow unto God.<br><h2><b>Partake of the Blessings</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, many of you are returned missionaries and have gone into the house of the Lord and have made very important covenants with the Lord. Eternal salvation rests upon how you keep those covenants. Those of you who have not had the opportunity should make yourselves available through your bishops and stake presidents for those great, great blessings that come, because we who are members of this, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are the only people on this earth who have such great blessings given to us through living prophets and angels and the servants of God. We need those blessings to gain the presence of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Temple work today is now being carried on like no other time in the history of this Church. The thirty-ninth temple was just dedicated, and there are others announced and in progress. In the isles of the sea there are now five temples. I know the people in Tonga, Samoa, Tahiti, and other isles of the sea are so poor that they could not go to New Zealand or Hawaii to the temple. Now the Lord has made it so easy that no one has an excuse to stay away from the house of the Lord.<br><br>The last days are here, brothers and sisters. I hope and pray that we will make ourselves available to partake of the blessings in the Lord's house.<br><br>In the parable of the prodigal son, the older brother asked the father why he was doing so much for the younger brother when he hadn't done it for the older one. And the father replied, "All that I have is thine."<i>All</i>that I have is yours. If we will endure to the end and search the scriptures and live honorably according to the principles and precepts that we know are true, we have the promise: "For this cause, that men might be made partakers of the glories which were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity" (D&amp;amp;C 133:57).<br><br>I bear you my humble testimony, that if we live the gospel and do everything we can to be honorable, the Lord will bless us and help us on our journey toward eternity.<br><br>You are all here for an education and I read this statement from Thomas Huxley:<br><br><i>Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not; it is the first lesson that ought to be learned; and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly.</i>[<i>Technical Education,</i>1877]<br><br>I bear you my humble testimony that I know that the gospel is true. It has been revealed in these last days in its fulness by living prophets. And we must keep sacred the covenants we make in the house of the Lord, for in these covenants a promise is given to us that we can become gods.<br><br>I bear humble witness that today President Ezra Taft Benson is a living prophet. I think about President Benson working under President Spencer W. Kimball these many years and then, in his eighty-seventh year, being called to be the prophet. Some of us who are in our sixties and seventies feel we're so tired and worn out that we need to retire. We need to go to Hawaii and bask in the sun. But President Benson was called by the Lord in his advanced years to become the prophet.<br><br>I bear you my humble testimony that if we live the gospel and do all we can to be honest with ourselves and with the Lord, these things will bring us the blessings that he has promised to those who are faithful to the end. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Adney Y.

<h1>ere There Is No Vision, the People Perish&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have chosen to title my remarks "Where there is no vision, the people perish" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/29.18?lang=eng#p17">Proverbs 29:18</a>). How can a simple verse in the scriptures influence our present, future, and eternal lives and counterbalance the philosophies of the world? What is our vision of the world today and our vision of religion, and how does it influence and determine our responsibilities as individuals and families?<br><h2><b>How Do We Gain a Vision?</b></h2><br>As we envision the world and religion, we discover rapidly the daily challenges of life: the problems of suffering physically, mentally, spiritually; sorrow and hard work accompanied by questions and doubts; and, finally, death. We also find religions represented by a variety of credos, churches, priesthoods, and a multiplicity of gods to supposedly help us to face, endure, survive, or overcome the difficulties of the world.<br><br>How do we usually gain a vision of things? When we were young we became aware of our surroundings in the world and our religion, and we began to see things as our parents saw them--because they taught us according to their perceptions and understanding. We watched, we listened, we learned, and thus we may say that our first vision of the world, and religion, was predetermined by parents and later by other people, cultures, and locations. We first learned through the vision of someone else.<br><br>We then gained some maturity and wanted to know, to discover, and to experiment--with or without this exterior help--to gain our own vision. We wanted to test the world and religion and what they offer as part of our growth and experience. Using this process, however, some--because of laziness or irresponsibility and being afraid of the possible consequences of that free agency--become prisoners of their environment. Others neglect warnings along the way and, like butterflies ignoring the danger of the flame, burn their wings and forfeit the ability to know for themselves. Many follow the stream of the ways of the world and end up wandering the rest of their lives according to various opinions.<br><br>Only a few finally press their way forward, holding fast to something true that they have discovered for themselves. Does that story sound familiar? Do you identify with it? If not, I refer you to the dream of Lehi (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng">1 Nephi 8</a>), the vision he received of the world, its multitudes and religions, and its influence on his family.<br><br>What was the difference between the sons of Lehi: Laman, Lemuel, and Nephi? On one side, referring to Laman and Lemuel, "They did murmur because they<i>knew</i>not the dealings of that God who had created them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.12?lang=eng#p11">1 Nephi 2:12</a>; emphasis added). On the other side, "Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.19?lang=eng#p18">1 Nephi 2:19</a>). What was the difference? A personal knowledge or testimony through faith.<br><br>Alan W. Jones, a theologian, said:<br><br><i>One of our problems is that very few of us have developed any distinctive personal life. Everything about us seems secondhand, even our emotions. In many cases</i>,<i>we have to rely on secondhand information in order to function. I accept the word of a physician, a scientist, a farmer, on trust. I do not like to do this. I have to because they possess vital knowledge of living of which I am ignorant. Secondhand information concerning the state of my kidneys, the effects of cholesterol, and the raising of chickens, I can live with. But when it comes to questions of meaning, purpose, and death, secondhand information will not do. I cannot survive on a secondhand faith in a secondhand God. There has to be a personal word, a unique confrontation, if I am to come alive.</i>[<i>Journey into Christ</i>(New York: Seabury Press, 1977), pp. 91–92]<br><br>So our purpose today is to search diligently and awaken our human and divine faculties, our hearts, and our minds to a true vision of this world, its multitudes, and religions--that we may understand our role by recognizing and accepting true knowledge and not perish.<br><h2><b>The Process of Learning from God</b></h2><br>Belief or faith exercised in the vision that is given us of a true knowledge of God will bring us salvation; if not exercised, it will bring us damnation. Joseph Smith taught in<i>Lectures on Faith</i>that "three things are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation."<br><br>1. The idea that he actually exists.<br><br>2. A correct idea of his character, perfections, and attributes.<br><br>3. An actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to his will.<br><br><i>For without an acquaintance with these three important facts, the faith of every rational being must be imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding it can become perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness, unto the praise and glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith</i>3:33]<br><br>Now is the time to learn for ourselves about true knowledge and true religion, which is a vision of principles, teachings, and ordinances to gain salvation in this world and in the world to come. Watch Moses who went through this process of learning from the source of true knowledge.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying:</i>...<i>tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be content.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.36?lang=eng#p35">Moses 1:36</a>]<br><br>And the Lord answered and declared: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39?lang=eng#p38">Moses 1:39</a>).<br><br>The Lord continued, saying, "I reveal unto you concerning this heaven, and this earth" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.1?lang=eng#primary">Moses 2:1</a>) and then gave Moses the history of the creation of heaven, earth, man, and woman. The earth was planted with vegetation and life, the stage was set with actors, and life had been established with order, laws, and commandments. The vision was given, and now the drama unfolds. Satan is tempting Eve by offering her the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil by using these words: "Ye shall not surely die; ... and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.10-11?lang=eng#p9">Moses 4:10–11</a>).<br><br>As we consider the results of the transgression as it occurred, we also learn about the changes on the stage. From now on<br><br>1. there would be pain, suffering, sorrow, and hard work;<br><br>2. there would be physical and spiritual death and thus separation from God;<br><br>3. there would be a posterity for Adam and Eve;<br><br>4. there would be a knowledge of good and evil with all its consequences.<br><br>The creation of the heavens, the earth, and the man and woman had taken place. The fall of man and earth had taken place. A third vital element was missing to make the purpose of creation plausible, and that was to provide a way and means whereby man might be saved. The third vital element was the Atonement to ransom man and earth. Man was created to be saved, and salvation comes by having the true vision of the purpose of life in this life, of our Heavenly Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the mission of the Holy Ghost (Articles of Faith 1, 2, 3).<br><br>If we see this and believe it and know it to be true, then we serve and we obey. If we turn to a different vision, the belief changes, the Fall does not make sense, and neither does the Creation nor the Savior. As a result, there is neither motivation nor faith, neither repentance nor covenant.<br><br>Today we live with the results of these three events: the Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement. Whether or not you have a correct vision, whether or not you understand the consequences, whether or not you accept them will make a big difference in the kind of lives you live.<br><br><i>Will D.

He had practiced and provided for the climb but had overlooked his most important need.<br><br>This devotional is just one more way to open some eyes, hearts, and minds--an opportunity to change and adjust our vision and not to overlook the most important need. If you don't care for the word<i>change,</i>you may use the word<i>repent,</i>for it is the same, and to repent is to learn from God.<br><h2><b>Commitment Through Decisions</b></h2><br>In essence, having the correct vision of our needs, we must decide. After the vision of Moses, let's turn to Adam and Eve and receive a vision of their commitment to true knowledge through decisions.<br><br>1. They were free to make decisions. "Thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.17?lang=eng#p16">Moses 3:17</a>). "Wherefore they are agents unto themselves" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.56?lang=eng#p55">Moses 6:56</a>).<br><br>2. They rejoiced about the prospects of their decision. Adam said: "Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.10?lang=eng#p9">Moses 5:10</a>).<br><br>Eve said: "Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.11?lang=eng#p10">Moses 5:11</a>).<br><br>3. They decided to accept the challenges of:<br><br>a. an unpredictable world to be managed;<br><br>b. an unsafe world to be survived;<br><br>c. an unknown world to be discovered;<br><br>d. an insecure world to be endured.<br><br>All these adjectives can be applied to you in this college setting: there are unpredictable teachers in exams, it's unsafe to break the BYU Code of Honor, the prospects after graduation are unknown, and BYU games are never secure!<br><br>4. They made a decision to learn and to be obedient. They "called upon the name of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.4?lang=eng#p3">Moses 5:4</a>). "Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.5?lang=eng#p4">Moses 5:5</a>).<br><br>5. They decided to turn to the Lord for their education. "Their children were taught to read and write, having a language which was pure and undefiled" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.6?lang=eng#p5">Moses 6:6</a>).<br><br>6. They decided to teach their children. "They made all things known unto their sons and their daughters" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.12?lang=eng#p11">Moses 5:12</a>).<br><br>7. They decided to covenant with the Lord. "And Adam hearkened unto the voice of God, and called upon his sons to repent" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.1?lang=eng#primary">Moses 6:1</a>).<br><br>8. They decided to teach the world true knowledge. "And they were preachers of righteousness, and spake and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent; and faith was taught unto the children of men" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.23?lang=eng#p22">Moses 6:23</a>).<br><br>9. They decided to receive the ordinances necessary for their salvation.<br><br>a. Baptism--Adam was baptized (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.64?lang=eng#p63">Moses 6:64</a>).<br><br>b. Receiving the Holy Ghost--Adam was born of the Spirit (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.65?lang=eng#p64">Moses 6:65</a>).<br><br>c. Receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood--"Thou art after the order of him [Jesus Christ]" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.67?lang=eng#p66">Moses 6:67</a>).<br><br>What was the result of all these decisions based upon a true vision and knowledge of God's purpose for man? Were they better prepared to face the challenges of mortal life? It is interesting to see that they literally transformed the unpredictable into the predictable.<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19?lang=eng#p17">D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19</a>]<br><br>They transformed the unsafe into the safe.<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is</i><br><br><i>predicated.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20-21?lang=eng#p19">D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21</a>]<br><br>They transformed the unknown into a sure knowledge of a correct idea of the character, personality, and qualities of a loving God and how to reach him.<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22?lang=eng#p21">D&amp;amp;C 130:22</a>]<br><br>They transformed the insecure into security because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>For God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/3.16?lang=eng#p15">John 3:16</a>]<br><br>Adam and Eve acted this way because they had the correct vision of their future. The plan was predictable, safe, known, secure. They knew that they would never be alone and never be abandoned. "They heard the voice of the Lord ... speaking unto them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.4?lang=eng#p3">Moses 5:4</a>). "An angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.6?lang=eng#p5">Moses 5:6</a>). "The Holy Ghost fell upon Adam" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.9?lang=eng#p8">Moses 5:9</a>). The true knowledge of God and his plan was known by personal experience and by revelation.<br><br>And it was the same process--exactly the same--that was used by their followers and by Lehi and by Joseph Smith and by everyone who accepts the Lord's vision and the challenge to search for himself. Today, in a world of false religions or rampant atheism, where evil is good and good is evil, too many of us become complacent. Too many of us reject or ignore the idea of discipline of mind or any thought attached to that vision of true knowledge because it may take out of life the fantasy or charm or excitement or passion, and life with obedience is dull and gray. Is it taking charm away to scrutinize TV programs or movies or literature? Is it taking excitement out of a football or basketball game to act or appear decently? Is it taking passion out of life to love within the rules rather than choosing what is called "free love?" The examples can be multiplied. Adam shouted with Eve, "In this life I shall have joy" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.10?lang=eng#p9">Moses 5:10</a>). What joy? They knew what they were talking about--the joy of the faithful, having true knowledge and thus knowing why they should be obedient, why they should be disciples of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Having a True Knowledge</b></h2><br>President Marion G. Romney also spoke about the importance of this true knowledge of God.<br><br><i>This world would be, comparatively, a heaven if men could be brought to understand and know the living and true God. They who are able to receive and who do receive the restored truth concerning God are literally transformed by their knowledge of, and faith in, him. They are drawn upward from the carnal state of fallen man, as it were, and brought back, to a degree at least, into the presence of God. They develop unshakable faith in him.</i>...<i>And he never fails them. In him are their hope and their strength. Envy, greed, hate, lust, and unrighteous ambition flee from them. They grow in virtue, patience, brotherly kindness, charity, and love, and their eyes are single to the glory of God. The principal objective in their lives becomes to keep the commandments of God, thus ridding themselves of sin, for they realize that no unclean thing can enter into his presence; and to return into that presence becomes the supreme faith and hope of their existence.</i><br><br><i>Into their hearts comes a great concern for the welfare of their fellow men. They set about not to conquer them, not to take advantage of them, not to gain temporal and worldly power at their expense, but to take to them the glorious knowledge of the living and true God which they themselves possess. This they do that their fellows may experience and enjoy the transformation which has come into their lives.</i><br><br><i>There is nothing other than a knowledge of the living and true God which will give men incentives strong enough to induce them to root out of their lives the wickedness which has brought us to the brink of the cataclysm on which we totter.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1964, p. 51]<br><br>We have inherited a glorious vision of our responsibilities to enjoy a glorious life and eternal life. The vision is clear. There are no interferences, and the Lord concluded as I conclude: "This is the plan of salvation unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who shall come in the meridian of time" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.62?lang=eng#p61">Moses 6:62</a>).<br><br><i>Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God</i>... ;<i>for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.57?lang=eng#p56">Moses 6:57</a>]<br><br>The process of spiritual growth and eternal life is conducted by our own free will, based upon true knowledge and service, and works against the natural inclination to take the easy way or to keep things as they are presented. There is something worse than ignorance--it is to<i>think</i>that you know. As someone has said, when you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. How many see today and will continue to see tomorrow? How many are blind and are unwilling to see? May the testimony of Adam and Eve, the testimonies of prophets and apostles, and my testimony help you to search diligently for yourselves and to know for yourselves as I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, that true religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, exists upon this earth, and that President Ezra Taft Benson is a modern-day prophet to give us correct vision that we may not perish.<br><br>Now is the time to ponder what kind of vision can be ours. What kind of decisions will we make today and tomorrow? May the Lord help us to ponder upon the true history of Adam and Eve and its message. May we receive this vision and not perish. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Charles Didier was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 February 1986.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>re of Needs - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Anciently, the Apostle Paul gave firm assurance that "my God shall supply all your need[s]" (Philippians 4:19).<br><br>Likewise, in latter-day revelation, the Lord himself has declared: "Every man who has need may be amply supplied" (D&amp;amp;C 42:33). As we study man in his many roles and challenges in life, we find that there is not a single one of God's children who does not have many needs. What are your basic needs? All of these can be fulfilled by a loving and beneficent Heavenly Father. Indeed, he wants to fulfill our needs. I would like to share with you today some thoughts on the nature of needs. In so doing it is my earnest desire and prayer that we all become more aware not only of our own needs, but especially of the needs of others.<br><br>As we contemplate this important topic, we find that there are three basic kinds of needs. A need can be a "necessary duty or obligation." It may also be a "lack of something requisite, desirable, or useful." Sometimes it can be a "condition requiring supply or relief," which in the extreme case means the "lack of the means of subsistence."<br><br>Let us consider, then, the nature of needs. This will help us to identify them, and then to fulfill them.<br><h2><b>By Duty or Obligation</b></h2><br>First, there is our need to do certain things, whether by duty or obligation. Of paramount importance here is the need to pray. Even the most primitive of peoples on the earth acknowledge a Supreme Being, a Creator, and try to portray him sometimes in wood and stone. How wonderful that he has identified himself to us, through his beloved son, Jesus Christ. He has revealed himself as our Father in Heaven, who wants us, his children, to keep in touch with him while we are away from home, our heavenly home. Jesus taught us not only the need to pray but how to pray--showing reverence and gratitude, making petition and commitment, praying daily, and in his name. However, the adversary places many obstacles in our paths--such as the spirit of rebellion, feelings of selfishness, and a false sense of spiritual self-sufficiency. These could keep us from humbling ourselves on bended knee. Promptings such as "I won't pray!" "Why should I pray?" "I have no need to pray" can all be overcome. What great blessings come from prayer, which not only brings rich rewards, but is its own reward. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (Luke 11:9).<br><br>I think of the faithful Saints in far-off West Africa who prayed and petitioned five, ten, fifteen years, for the fulness of the restored gospel to be taken to their land. Answers to prayer are not in man's time, but in God's time. Patience, faith, and humble submission are finally rewarded. How wonderful to see the revelatory results of these prayers, blended with the powerful petitions of a prophet of the Lord, Spencer W. Kimball, as the gospel rolls forward among God's children in Africa.<br><br>There are many other duty–needs, of course, as important as prayer. For example, the need to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. This is surely a duty and an obligation, for we owe him a great debt of gratitude. He provided the ransom for each of us. We hear much in these perilous times of hijacking and kidnapping. Millions of people watch the screens and the headlines to see whether the victims will be released through payment of ransom money or some other way.<br><br>In order for us to be freed from the bondage of sin and from the shackles of transgression, we need faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He gave himself, he laid down his life as a ransom. We show our gratitude by our faith, and we show our faith by our thoughts, words, and especially our deeds. Any thinking person would like to make a fresh start, begin a clean sheet, correct past mistakes, and go forward, untrammelled by the past. It all becomes possible by first having faith in Jesus Christ as our personal savior and redeemer, and second, by making the necessary changes to conform with his teachings through the process of repentance. We all have a need to repent and make changes, every day, every month, every year. After repentance a person is ready to be baptized. Baptism is also a fundamental and universal need, for it is the gateway into the Lord's church, the church of Jesus Christ. My thoughts again turn to Africa, which I have been privileged to visit a number of times. Never have I seen so many different Christian churches, all professing Christ but not being in conformity and unity with his teachings--whether of doctrines, ordinances, or ecclesiastical organization. There is always a mass of confusion when men's ideas predominate and the Savior takes second place. There is a need for the cleansing ordinance and unifying bond of baptism.<br><br>I am happy to declare that the light has dawned. I received the assignment to dedicate four small meetinghouses in Cross River State, Nigeria, at Ikot Ebo, Ikot Ekong, Ikot Anang, and Ikot Esen Oku. I had seen them under construction--simple, functional, but beautiful--gleaming white against the brilliant greens of the tropical rain forest. The local Saints had helped when they could, and the sisters deserve special mention for carrying water on their heads for two or three miles to the building sites.<br><br>In each new chapel as we took our places on the stand, we paused to shake hands with the local chiefs who had been invited to attend and to occupy the front seats. They were dignified in their robes, each carrying a chiefs cane. The head chief at each chapel graciously accepted the invitation to address the congregation. Of course they used different words, but they expressed the same powerful sentiments. "You are the light of this community. You have brought us the true gospel. We know you love and care for us, for you serve without pay. Thank you for coming." Did not the Savior exhort us, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). Oh, that we might all be a light to our respective communities.<br><br>In West Africa the good news, the gospel of Jesus Christ, travels fast, for it is shared with members of the extended families who frequently live in close proximity. The people are spiritually ready for baptism; they love the Lord, they help their neighbors, and they sing and pray with all their hearts and voices in praise and gratitude.<br><br>I have been impressed especially with the bright-eyed children as they sing "I Am a Child of God." They are already alert and teachable, but following baptism, when they have received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, their understanding and desire to serve the Lord is quickened. I think of how eager the children were in a little African school in Zimbabwe as we were privileged to go into three classes and give them a spiritual message, testimony, and blessing. These were the same children who had recently seen the Church film<i>Man's Search for Happiness</i>and had written: "This was a wonderful film. This Church should make more films and everyone should see them." Another had said, "Everyone should search for happiness. Happiness comes through overcoming temptation and sin." It is truly a marvelous work and a wonder that such truth-seeking young people in many parts of the world are now hearing and accepting the gospel and are joining the Lord's church through baptism and the laying on of hands.<br><br>There is a great need for every person in the world to have the guidance of the Holy Ghost in their lives. The Holy Ghost helps us in our work and in our studies, protects and warns us, and brings things to our remembrance. This great gift is bestowed upon us following baptism into the Lord's church. It is indeed a duty to seek to have this gift, for we can bring blessings to others and live purposeful lives ourselves when we have the Holy Ghost. Thus it was in the pristine church of Jesus Christ, and so it is in his restored church today.<br><h2><b>"Things Ye Have Need Of"</b></h2><br>Now that we have considered the first kind of need--namely, duties and obligations-- I would like to discuss with you the second kind. These are the needs that represent "a lack of something." Sometimes we do not recognize these, but it is good to have the assurance that our "Father knoweth what things [w]e have need of" (Matthew 6:8).<br><h2><b>A Need for Knowledge</b></h2><br>I will select a few of the many needs, beginning with knowledge, especially knowledge of the Almighty God, and of his beloved son, Jesus Christ. As Paul wrote to the Hebrews: "Ye have need that one teach you" (Hebrews 5:12). The Old Testament prophet Hosea declared, "People are destroyed for lack of knowledge" (Hosea 4:6). Yes, we all need knowledge, and we all need a teacher. The missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are such teachers, who will not only impart facts and share knowledge, but who will also help us to develop wisdom.<br><br>How grateful I am that missionaries from the western United States traveled across the world to teach me and my family in England thirty-five years ago. It was not long after our baptism that a fine local brother who was serving as counselor to the mission president said to me, "Find yourself a teacher." When I inquired of him the significance of this counsel, he expanded it by saying, "Find yourself a teacher who can lift you and inspire and motivate you. But remember, he must be standing on higher ground."<br><br>As the years have rolled by in an unending sequence of experience and service, I have had many such teachers, both in business and church activities. I will mention five only, who will represent those not named. In September 1958 I was introduced to a man with whom I served closely for two years. This was T. Bowring Woodbury, the new president of the British Mission. As he was set apart by President David O. McKay for this important calling, the prophet referred to the opening of a "new era" in Britain with the dedication of the London Temple that very month. "By" Woodbury, as he was affectionately known to his many friends, was a man of vision and valor--these two qualities being essential elements of faith. He imparted of his knowledge and experience to me, and helped me to feel the urgency of the work, and to develop leadership skills. I had many spiritual experiences with him during these two years of close association as we helped to make the promised "new era" become a reality. I became a wiser person.<br><br>At about the same time I began to work closely with a bright young chemical engineer, Dick Morris, in the large company where I was employed as a cost-control accountant. He expanded my vision in another way, regarding the industrial scene, the interrelationship of industrial processes, and of personnel. I gained knowledge, but also wisdom--not only in creating statistical reports, but in interpreting them as a basis for decision making. We came up through the organization together, and he eventually was appointed managing director and then chairman of the board. My role expanded too, into management accounting and business management. He was a great teacher.<br><br>In the early 1960s, I was very privileged to have President N. Eldon Tanner as a teacher when he served as West European mission president, based in England. The lessons he taught me spanned both church and business, for I learned from him as a newly called stake president, as he shared his similar experiences and suggested ways to improve and develop. I learned from his business acumen and integrity when he served as chairman of the board of Deseret Enterprises Limited, the first Church commercial enterprise in Europe. As director and general manager, I was with him often, and am so grateful that he helped me fulfill this need to be taught and lifted.<br><br>Then, during the 1970s and 1980s, I was privileged, along with so many others, to be taught by a prophet of the Lord, Spencer W. Kimball. During my service as a Regional Representative from 1970 to 1975, mission president from 1975 to 1978, and since then as a General Authority, my soul has been lifted as I have been taught from on high through him. This has not only been in meetings and conferences, but in many personal settings. One such time was when I was visiting from England for general conference and I inquired of President Kimball's secretary if could see him. I knocked on the door and his familiar voice said "Come in." I started to open the door, but before it was fully open, he was already at the door. I felt a sense of urgency, and real caring. He took me by the arm, showed me round his office, then sat me down across the desk. "How is the work going in England?" he inquired. I gave a brief report, but he knew already; he was teaching me the principle of stewardship and accountability. Then he reached up to his bookshelves, took down a book, and handed it to me. "Have you read this book?" he asked. As I looked at the title I indicated that I had read some of the book but not all. He smiled, took up a pen, opened the book and wrote a message, and then gave it to me again. I shall always treasure that copy of<i>The Life Story of Heber</i>C.<i>Kimball,</i>the first missionary to England.<br><br>There are many more great teachers--exemplars of whom I could tell--but I just have one more, my dear wife. How much I have learned from her--in charity, in patience, in endurance, in joyfulness. She has lifted me now for over forty years, and has shown me wisdom as we have counseled together, prayed together, laughed together, and cried together. I am grateful for those pearls of wisdom.<br><br>A classic example of one who lacked wisdom was the boy Joseph Smith, who wanted to join a church but was confused as to which one to join. Fortunately, he was a student of the Bible, and found the necessary guidance in the Epistle of James. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5). By his humble and sincere application of the need for prayer and seeking for God to fill his lack of wisdom, the heavens were opened to him, and a pillar of light descended upon him. In the light he saw two glorious personages, and one, referring to the other, said, "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him" (JS--H 1: 17). Joseph was told to join none of the churches, but providing he remained faithful and true he would be the means of restoring to the earth the fulness of the gospel and the church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Sometimes we do not realize what knowledge or wisdom we need, but God knows and we should "ask the Father ... for what things soever [w]e shall stand in need" (Mormon 9:27). You will remember the young man who came face-to-face with Jesus and asked him what he needed to do to have eternal life. Jesus told him to "keep the commandments" (Matthew 19:17), and then he interviewed him as to whether he was keeping them. Apparently he was. The young man then asked a question we all need to ask, "What lack I yet?" In other words, "What other needs do you, our Father in Heaven, see that I have?" The Savior's reply was not one that the young man wanted to hear. Nevertheless, it was important for him to have asked the question. He was told to sell all that he had and follow Jesus. This he felt was too much to ask, for he was a rich young man and had great possessions. Thus, he went away sorrowful. How sad that his meeting with the Son of God should end in this way. What of us? Some of us tend to say, "I keep the commandments, I attend my church meetings, I pay my tithes and offerings, and I live the Word of Wisdom." Then the Lord gives us a real test. Leave the things of the world and give yourself in service. Will we do it? Will you do it when the call comes?<br><br>Why should we respond to such a demand, such a sacrifice? Why did the Savior respond to the great demands upon him as he endured persecution, ridicule, and betrayal? Why did he, the Son of God, respond by sacrificing his very life? He did it because he loved us, and loves us, unconditionally. Why should we respond? "As I have loved you ... love one another," he has challenged (John 13:34). The degree to which we follow him and keep his commandments indicates the depth of our gratitude to him and the sincerity of our love for him. Each of us has different needs, but the gospel fulfills them all. I can truly testify to you today that since becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have had all my needs fulfilled--spiritually, physically, mentally, and socially.<br><h2><b>A Need for Others</b></h2><br>Some of the other needs we may have are the need for friends and family, the need to love and be loved, the need for peace of mind and happiness and purpose in life. Then there is the need for good health, and the need to have spiritual guidance to help us make decisions. The secret of fulfilling almost all of these needs is the realization that we all need each other, and we all need God. The same message that the Lord gave through the Apostle Paul he has given anew through the Prophet Joseph Smith. "The body hath need of every member" (D&amp;amp;C 84:110). President Harold B. Lee expanded this by saying, "The Church hath need of every member ... and every member has a deep need to participate fully in the Church" (Regional Representatives' seminar, October 1971).<br><br>Before I became involved in full-time Church service, I was engaged in the industrial world, and particularly in petrochemical operations. As we set out to manufacture certain products, we would produce many by-products along the way. So it is with life. As we set out to help others in their needs--such help and service being the main product of a Christian life--lo and behold, we find that our needs have been met by the by-products of service.<br><br>Everyone of us has heard the adage "The only way to have a friend is to be a friend" (Ralph Waldo Emerson,<i>Essays: First Series. Friendship</i>), but sometimes we feel deprived of friendship, not realizing the solution lies in our own hands. We need to reach out and indeed be outgoing, rather than inward looking, bound up in our own little world. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a social gospel; Jesus was constantly among the people. His first miracle was performed at a wedding feast; the people were always thronging around him and he spoke to multitudes. He was accused of being a "friend of publicans and sinners" (Matthew 11:19) because he reached out to all. How wonderful that each of us can be counted one of his friends, for he declared, "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you" (John 15:14).<br><br>As I travel to the stakes and missions of the Church, sometimes to far corners of the earth, I am always making new friends. What a marvelous feeling it is, having arrived in a distant country, to be overwhelmed by the sentiment expressed by the Apostle Paul, "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19). We make instant friends through the common bond of the gospel, but that does not mean all of our friends must be Latter-day Saints. Our children have consistently made friends outside of the Church, as well as within the Church. In England, where we lived most of our lives, they were in a minority of one sometimes, in class, school, or even community. Even now that we live in Salt Lake City, an LDS community, they have nonmember friends. Over the years, however, when we had just moved into a new town or a new country, we saw how difficult it was until friendships were established. What a great opportunity you have in this great institution of learning to make friendships that will not only span the years ahead, but will span the oceans and continents. How great is the need to make the most of ourselves, go to places, meet people, socialize, and make friends. How important it is to develop the qualities we desire in others.<br><h2><b>A Paramount Need</b></h2><br>The need for peace of mind is a universal need, for without it there can be no lasting happiness. The gospel of Jesus Christ brings peace and harmony when fully absorbed into our lives. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has again admonished us to have our "feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace" (D&amp;amp;C 27:16). What a great thing it is to be a peacemaker; what a terrible thing to be a troublemaker. Peace of mind is a great blessing to which we are all entitled. "Where there is peace and meditation, there is neither anxiety nor doubt," said St: Francis of Assisi<i>(The Counsels of the Holy Father St. Francis. Admonition 27</i>).<br><br>I remember the day my father died; my mind was somewhat in anxiety and turmoil. I returned home, sat in my favorite chair, and picked up the scriptures to meditate and find peace. I read a little, then closed my eyes, and in my mind's eye I saw my father as a young man, and he was dressed in white. Although he had never become a member of the Church, I knew I would see him in the resurrection, and furthermore, I had seen him as he would appear. My mind was at peace again. When we rely on the Lord, we can have fulfillment of his promise, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: ... Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). He is "The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6).<br><br>The need for happiness is a paramount need--lasting happiness, not fleeting happiness. True happiness comes from knowing one's purpose in life and in fulfilling it. Without purpose there is no direction; there is, instead, doubt and darkness, wandering and wavering. A story is told of a man who was digging a ditch. Someone asked him, "Why are you digging the ditch?" "I am digging the ditch," he replied, "to earn the money to buy the bread to get the strength to go to work to dig the ditch!" Without purpose, one goes in circles, instead of making progress, day by day, year by year, toward that goal established by the Almighty God for us, his children: "immortality and eternal life" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>When I served as a mission president in Scotland, two of our fine missionary sisters taught and baptized a man in his eighties. In a testimony meeting soon afterward, he stood and gave thanks that he now had purpose in life. "I was waiting to die when the sisters knocked on my door," he said tearfully. Before long he was called as counselor in the ward Sunday School presidency, and later as Sunday School president. He had great joy and happiness in his church service and made many new friends. A year or so passed and he came over to Salt Lake City for a visit, made more friends and gained more experiences, and especially, was able to go to the temple for the first time. When he did step from this life a few months after his return to Scotland, what a full and purposeful life he had--and all within two years!<br><h2><b>This Blessing of Guidance</b></h2><br>Finally, on this second kind of need, I would mention the need to have spiritual guidance to help us make decisions. Is there any one in this whole wide world who has no decisions or choices to make? No, not one. It is a major part of life to use that special gift of God--free agency. Personally, I have decisions and choices to make every day. Some are easy to make; others take time. For these major ones I sometimes use a clean sheet of paper, dividing it down the middle. I then head the two sections "for" and "against," and prayerfully list all the reasons I can think of under each heading. Having apparently exhausted my ideas, I then ponder, reading and re-reading. The decision I need to make formulates in my mind and I decide what to do. Then comes the most important step. I kneel in prayer to gain confirmation that my decision is in harmony with my omniscient Father in Heaven. He knows what is right and good for me, and through the Holy Ghost tells me whether I have made a wise choice.<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>What a need we all have for the blessing of such spiritual guidance.<br><h2><b>"Open Thy Hand Wide"</b></h2><br>This leads us then to the third category of need, the kind of need which causes us to look outward and prompts Christ-like feelings of compassion and the desire to help others. I speak of the need that is often qualified by the adjective "dire" or "urgent." It is a condition requiring relief and, in many cases, constitutes a lack of the very means of subsistence. I do not see any here in this situation, but out there, over half the world's population--over half the children of God--live in countries where per capita income is less than $300 a year!<br><br>How wonderful that your fasting and prayers and donations both last Thanksgiving and then last January have brought much relief. The scriptures are replete with references to this great need and how it should be fulfilled. "Open thine hand wide ... to thy needy," the Lord proclaimed through Moses (Deuteronomy 15:11). "Ye do love money, ... more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted," he chided through the Nephite prophet Moroni (Mormon 8:37).<br><br>I have at home a tape-recorded message from the Saints in Ghana, West Africa, that is very special to me. Branch President Ato Dodson says, "The Mormon Church is one big family and came to our aid in these critical times. When my members came around for me to distribute the goods, a lot of them shed tears. They couldn't believe it. Neither could I myself. I discovered that, in the Lord's true Church, all things are possible. The words of Malachi came true that if we are faithful to the Lord, paying our tithes, blessings would be showered upon us. We are very, very grateful and don't have enough words to express our gratitude. We shall never forget such a gesture by our brothers and sisters in the United States. One day we will be self-sufficient through the programs you have given us."<br><br>His Relief Society president, Elizabeth Kwaw, added her feelings: "I just don't know how to express my gratitude for the food aid we have just received. On behalf of all the sisters, I say 'thank you.' For some time we have been very short of food in Ghana and even in our Relief Society homemaking meetings we hadn't the food to prepare. Last week, at our homemaking meeting, we were able to prepare rice pudding with all the ingredients from the food we received from the United States."<br><br>Finally, the elders quorum president, Stephen Kwaw, gave his thanks: "I would like to express my personal appreciation and that of my quorum members for the love that has been demonstrated to us by the food aid. It has been abundantly clear to us, for we have seen the pictures of the love and care that went into the packaging of this food aid to us. The lesson we have learned is to continue to be faithful to the teachings of this Church and endeavor to also have enough in store for future generations to come in other parts of Ghana and Africa."<br><br>I like the account given by Luke in the fourth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:<br><br><i>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul:</i>...<br><br><i>Neither was there any among them that lacked:</i><br><br><i>for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold.</i><br><br><i>And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need</i>[Acts 4:32, 34, 35]<br><br>You, the rising generation, have the great responsibility upon your shoulders to reach out to those in need as never before. Although there are millions of God's children in the depths of poverty, lacking even the means of subsistence, the Lord has declared,<br><br><i>For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare;</i>...<br><br><i>Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 104:17–18]<br><br>The excellent education you are receiving in these critical years of your life is to help you to determine and discern and discover needs, your own needs and those of others. You are also learning how to fulfill those needs, whether they be physical, spiritual, mental, or social needs. Learn well, and live accordingly, and you will enjoy a fullness of life and fulfill the measure of your creation. Above all, have a grateful heart, which will always prompt and motivate you to reach out to others, for "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren," Jesus said, "ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>In these latter-days, the last days before the Second Coming of the Lord, the fulness of his gospel has been restored, with all the laws and ordinances, as prophesied anciently. The very church of Jesus Christ has been re-established on the earth, and the power of God is among us. This is the living church of the living Christ, and he speaks through a living prophet, even President Ezra Taft Benson--a champion of truth and justice, righteousness and love. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Derek A.

<h1>’s Strange Act - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored and grateful to have this special privilege to speak to you choice young men and wonderful young women at this great university today.<br><br>I am humbled as I stand here and subdued as I feel the spirit that radiates from you. To you fine teachers and leaders, I appreciate each one of you. My close association with some of your group who have presided over missions and in other capacities has heightened my love and respect for those who make up this incomparable body of teachers and leaders.<br><h2><b>His Divine Purposes</b></h2><br>If I may, I would like to speak to you today on a subject I have chosen to call the Lord's strange act-- "that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may pour out my Spirit upon all flesh" (D&amp;amp;C 95:4).<br><br>I hope to be able to help identify it for you, and also assist you to see more clearly the vital part each one of us is playing in it, and tell you how I feel we can strengthen and enhance our contribution in this great challenge destiny has brought to us.<br><br>Emerson said, "The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn." Yes, this is a great school. But it is more than a school; it is an ensign to all the world. It is one of the show cases; it is one of the windows through which the world can view the product of the great plan of the Eternal Father. It is one of the display racks of the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The cream of the crop from the homes of faithful Latter-day Saints in this nation and many nations fills these classrooms and halls. Representatives from institutions and corporations in this land, and in many lands, come from afar to seek its products, who are spread like leaven among the nations. Yes, it is more than another school. The tithes of the faithful across the world, including those of the widows and orphans, help provide a sacred feeling that sets this school apart from other schools.<br><br>It has been a source of pride to me as I have traveled in many cities to find graduates of this great university serving in important places--not just as laborers, but as teachers, leaders, managers, professional people--rendering great service to others, not just in areas of their specialties, but radiating a feeling: a warmth of spirit and goodness of life that blesses all who are fortunate enough to come under their influence.<br><br>We--this Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this school--are not just the product of those living now. We are a summation, the total of the lives and efforts of many who have played their special part in their day and in their time in the Lord's<i>strange act</i>to bring about his purposes.<i>As</i>it were, we can stand on their shoulders.<br><br>Spread over many centuries, running like a golden thread in the happenings of the peoples and governments of this earth, the Lord has been bringing to pass his strange act to accomplish his divine purposes in the earth, both here and hereafter.<br><br>Daniel, prophetically looking down through the centuries, spoke briefly of the Lord's strange act and his work in this day:<br><br><i>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</i>[Daniel 2:44]<br><br>In Nephi's great vision the Lord allowed Nephi to view some of the events of his work--his strange act--down through the centuries.<br><br><i>And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.</i><br><br><i>And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I</i>,<i>Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.</i>[1 Nephi 11:27–28,33–34]<br><br>Because the priesthood with its keys of authority was lost to the earth with the death of Jesus and his apostles, the world went into a period it has called the Dark Ages--when the light of education and learning grew so dim, when the practice of medicine was tied with ritual and superstition, when travel was limited, and when the word of God was not really available to the common man.<br><br>This was a dark time. It continued for over a thousand years, but the predetermined plan of the Lord--his strange act--continued to take place as the chosen individuals came to earth in their time and place to play their part in his divine plan.<br><h2><b>"By the Power of God"</b></h2><br>In about 1455 a man named Johannes Gutenberg invented printing from movable type. At the Huntington Library in Pasadena, California, I saw one of the first Bibles printed using Gutenberg's movable type--beautiful work. Some of the word of God was beginning to be available for those who could read.<br><br>Nephi again spoke of what he saw in the vision of the future:<br><br><i>And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land.</i>[1 Nephi 13:12]<br><br>Christopher Columbus gave credit to the Lord for his accomplishments. In a letter to the Spanish hierarchy, Columbus wrote:<br><br><i>Our Lord with provident hand unlocked my mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my emprise called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed. But who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?</i>[Jacob Wassermann,<i>Columbus, Don Quixote of the Seas,</i>trans. Eric Sutton (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co., 1930), pp. 19–20]<br><br>During the voyage, after weeks of sailing with no signs of land, mutiny raised its head. Finally, Columbus promised the captains of the Pinta and the Nina (both of whom wanted to turn back) that if no land was sighted in forty-eight hours, they would turn back. Then he went to his cabin and in his words, "prayed mightily to the Lord." On October 12, the very next day, land was sighted.<br><br>The Lord had held this land of America from being overrun until it was time for it to take its part in his strange act. This is a promised land. The Lord through ancient prophets has said this:<br><br><i>And that after the waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the face thereof.</i>[Ether 13:2]<br><br>Nephi continued to speak of the next part of the Lord's strange act.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many waters.</i>[1 Nephi 13:13]<br><br>The Lord, through his Spirit, moved on men and women--they desired to have his word, they desired to be free to worship according to the dictates of their conscience. The Lord moved on wise men to bring his word to England in the 1500s. William Tyndale, a scholar and a Cambridge and Oxford-trained man said:<br><br><i>If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plow shall know more of the scripture than thou dost.</i>[James Frederic Mozley,<i>William Tyndale</i>(Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1937), p. 34]<br><br>William Tyndale went to the European continent and, of necessity, in secret, began his translation of the Bible into English. When he had completed two-thirds of it, he was betrayed by a supposedly trusted friend, and before he could complete the translation he was burned at the stake. As his last words, uttered just before he expired, he prayed, "Lord, open the king of England's eyes" (<i>William Tyndale,</i>p. 341).<br><br>In the old city of London at Newgate Street and Smithfield Square, there is a plaque on the wall that reads: "A few feet from here John Rogers was burned at the stake, February 4, 1555."<br><br>Three hundred others were also burned at the stake for their part in bringing the Bible into England. John Rogers is a direct line ancestor of mine. The scriptures have greater value and more meaning to me because of the price he and others paid to make them available.<br><br>He was a Cambridge and Oxford man, and was trained in several languages. He was a friend of William Tyndale, and when Tyndale was burned at the stake, he finished the translation of the Bible and published it in 1537 under the name of Thomas Matthews. He brought 5,000 copies of the Thomas Matthews Bible back to England. He preached at St. Paul's Church. Because of the opposition and the fact he was immovable in his defense of the Holy Bible, he was taken to Smithfield Square as a public example and on February 4, 1555, was burned at the stake. His wife and his eleven children, the youngest a babe in arms, journeyed there on the day of the burning, but so hard were the hearts of those doing this sad deed, they were not allowed to speak to him or bid him a last farewell.<br><br>In 1611, King James of England--in answer to William Tyndale's prayer, "Lord, open the king of England's eyes"--appointed seventy scholars from Cambridge and Oxford to prepare what we now know as the King James Version of the Bible.<br><br>Nephi spoke of these ancestors. We see the results of the holy word and the Spirit of the Lord upon them.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I</i>,<i>Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.</i>. . .<br><br><i>And I</i>,<i>Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered</i>by the power of God<i>out of the hands of all other nations.</i>[1 Nephi 13:16, 19; emphasis added]<br><br>Only through the power of God could this have happened. These few colonies were arrayed against a nation whose commonwealth was so extensive, it is said the sun never set upon it. Also, it had the largest and strongest fleet in the world. I repeat Nephi's words: They "were delivered by the power of God."<br><h2><b>The Price They Paid</b></h2><br>I have also stood at Little Boston in England, from where the Pilgrims put out in the Mayflower, a small sailing vessel. I have seen the cells where they were incarcerated, and as I stood there my heart was touched as I thought of the price they paid and the part they played in the Lord's strange act.<br><br>Is it any wonder then why areas like Valley Forge, where General George Washington and his ragged, often hungry and ill-clad men paid such a price that we could live in a free land, have such a sacred feeling, almost as Moses must have felt when he turned aside to see the burning bush and heard these words: "Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5).<br><br>Other such places are in Philadelphia where stands the Liberty Bell and also Constitution Hall, where men, raised up by the Lord himself, brought forth an instrument that places the power of the government in the hands of the people.<br><br>Brigham Young said this regarding the Founding Fathers:<br><br><i>We consider that the men in the Revolution were inspired by the Almighty, to throw off the shackles of the mother government, with her established religion.</i>. . .<i>In thus establishing a new government upon a principle of greater freedom, a basis of self-government allowing the free exercise of religious worship.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>pp. 359–60]<br><br>With the land available and a government established with a constitution allowing freedom of worship and religion, it was then time for the next part of the Lord's strange act to begin.<br><br>He did not go to the learned and famous men of the day to set up his kingdom. As he had done on other occasions, he sent a baby boy--this time to the home of Joseph Smith, Sr., and Lucy Mack. The baby boy grew up almost entirely unschooled by man, but heavenly beings and the Lord himself taught him and guided him through the thirty-eight short years of his life.<br><br>He translated a volume of scripture inscribed on golden plates--a record of the Lord's dealings with the former inhabitants of this American continent--that will ultimately revolutionize religious worship throughout the earth. Through Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Lord restored the holy priesthood with its keys of authority to act in his name. He directed Joseph and Oliver to organize his Church with its saving and exalting ordinances and the priesthood power, which gives the authority to confer the Holy Ghost upon men. This gospel, if received and the power used, will transform hearts and lift men to a higher way of life--both here and hereafter.<br><br>From the moment Joseph Smith went to the Sacred Grove to pray, until he died as a martyr, the power of Lucifer in many forms raged after him to destroy this work the Lord had established as a vital part of his strange act. Joseph was driven and abused, he was tarred and feathered, he was hounded and beaten, and he was arrested forty-eight times on false charges in fourteen short years. He and his people were driven from state to state and, finally, after he had completed his part in the Lord's strange act, he went to Carthage in answer to a summons on a false charge.<br><br>The governor of the state of Illinois, Thomas B. Ford, promised Joseph protection if he would place himself in the hands of the law at Carthage. The governor failed in his promise of protection, and at the hands of a mob Joseph and Hyrum died as martyrs. Following Joseph's death, Governor Ford said, "Thus fell Joe Smith, the most successful imposter in modern times" (<i>HC</i>7:35).<br><br>Governor Ford evidently did not understand whose work this was, nor did he know about the Lord's strange act, for through his prophet the Lord had stated:<br><br><i>No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done</i>. [<i>HC</i>4:540]<br><br>Following Joseph's death, the Saints were driven from their homes to become exiles--almost refugees--stripped of almost all they had. But under the leadership of the Lord, and with the testimonies of the Spirit burning deep in their hearts, they crossed the almost trackless plains to a desert place no one else would have--there to do their part in the Lord's strange act, to set up a kingdom where the principles of his gospel could have place in the lives of men and women until his Church could become strong enough to do its part in his strange act.<br><br>In about 1980 the prophet of the Lord stated, "We are now strong enough to move forth in the world in a major way." It took 100 years to get the first 100 stakes in the Church. In 1930 there were 104 stakes. In the year 1974, when Spencer W. Kimball became the prophet, there were 630 stakes. Eleven short years later, as his time of leadership closed, there were 1,570 stakes of Zion, or an increase of 940 stakes in just eleven short years.<br><h2><b>A Mighty Change in the Earth</b></h2><br>The strange act of the Lord is continuing to move forth. It has been interesting to me to note that from 1805, the year Joseph Smith was born, and the next few years, as the priesthood power again came to man and the light of the gospel broke forth on the people of the earth, many of the great inventions came forth: the reaper, the cotton gin, the sewing machine, the steam engine. And even until today the multitude of new inventions have brought a mighty change in the earth: the telephone; radio; television; the computer; the marvel of space travel that is just in its infancy, together with the marvelous power released with man's efforts in the world of the atom; the exciting future of the laser light world, as well as the great advances in the fields of medicine with the vaccines and miracle drugs that have wiped out many of the dread diseases of the past, which, as plagues, swept many from the earth; the transplanting of hearts and kidneys, even artificial organs; and surely the end is not yet. The greatest books have yet to be written; the greatest inventions have yet to be made.<br><br>In the explosion of knowledge and learning that has come to the earth, we live in a day of scientific and intellectual giants, but we also live in a day of spiritual pygmies. God has largely been forgotten except in name only. The Sabbath, his holy day, has become a pleasure-seeking holiday. As much as man has learned and as wonderful as his accomplishments are, yet spiritually most of our Father's children live in the darkest darkness. The sacred power to initiate new life, which God alone controls and of which he is very jealous, has been prostituted on almost every hand; even life itself is destroyed to hide sins. We live in a world void of peace--men cry peace, yet there is no peace. We live in a time of terror and evil and violence where life is of little value. The souls of men hunger and are not satisfied, and they run to and fro but still cannot find God.<br><h2><b>Doing Our Part in the Lord's Strange Act</b></h2><br>How privileged we are to come forth at this time, to do<i>our</i>part in the Lord's strange act. What a privilege that he should place such trust in us to be an ensign, a spiritual light to all men and women--to play our part in the Lord's strange act so that people, the Lord's children in this entire earth, might see the fruits that come from obedience to his gospel plan.<br><br>Now is our time. We are to be a light to the world--an ensign. We might say we are to be a living, breathing visual aid, a product of the gospel of Jesus Christ for all men to see.<br><br><i>For, behold, I say unto you that Zion shall flourish, and the glory of the Lord shall be upon her;</i><br><br><i>And she shall be an ensign unto the people, and there shall come unto her out of every nation under heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:41–42]<br><br>The Lord has commanded us through his prophets, "Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 115:5).<br><br>Each one of us has a light. We cannot endure on borrowed light. A person must have the light within himself. The Lord has said in our day:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>This great opportunity to play a leading role in the Lord's strange act is open to each one of us. The brightness of our light depends on our thoughts, on our words, on our deeds, and on the amount of the Spirit we have. Shakespeare gave us this insight: "To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man" (<i>Hamlet,</i>act 1, sc. 3, lines 78–80).<br><br>Our new prophet has said:<br><br><i>Therefore, the only measure of true greatness is how close a man can become like Jesus. That man is greatest who is most like Christ, and those who love him most will be most like him.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "Listen to a Prophet's Voice,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1973, p. 57]<br><br>In my humble opinion, this generation of young people--the youth of this day--are, as a whole, the finest group yet sent to earth. I am aware you are much stronger, taller, better looking, and keener than the generation I came in. Your part in the Lord's strange act is to be a visual aid, a living, breathing visual aid--available for the world to see how fine the products of his gospel are--literally beginning to fulfill Isaiah's ancient prophecy.<br><br><i>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</i>[Isaiah 2:3]<br><h2><b>The Lord's Strange Act Will Not Fail</b></h2><br>We live in a day when nothing can be hid--a day about which the scriptures mention speaking from the housetops. Luke knew and prophesied of this day:<br><br><i>For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</i><br><br>. . .<i>and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon, the housetops.</i>[Luke 12:2–3]<br><br>We have experienced some of this already. BYU has had a prominent part in it. Sharlene Wells, BYU student, Miss America: the word, the picture, the story of this choice young woman were surely spoken from the housetops. And there is BYU's football team; millions not only heard, but saw. There was extensive coverage in the area I serve in--North America Northeast with its 140 million people--including full pages of newspaper coverage, articles in magazines with large circulation, and radio and TV broadcasting to millions. Today the BYU Center in Jerusalem has received extensive coverage--written, spoken, visual--almost worldwide on a daily and continuing basis.<br><br>On the other hand, the negative and part-truth messages have access to the same sophisticated media. They too are spoken from the housetops. The film<i>The God Makers</i>makes light of sacred things. The ancient letters and the bombings in Salt Lake City have created doubt and heartache in many lives.<br><br>What trust and what confidence the Lord has had in us to allow us to come at this crucial time in his strange act to play our part of being a light to the world. I am proud of you and thousands of other wonderful young men and women across the earth whom I call the "First Team." The Lord's strange act will not fail. The prophet Daniel gave this assurance:<br><br><i>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,</i>. . .<i>and it shall stand for ever.</i>[Daniel 2:44]<br><br>The strange act will not fail, but some individuals may fall short and be darkened and have their light extinguished by the world. Today I challenge you to commit, or recommit, yourself to excellence, both temporal and spiritual. Live so your light will be one of great brilliance, that you may light the way of multitudes who will find God through your example.<br><br>The fuel for this light is the Holy Spirit--the Holy Ghost, the thing that makes this Church different from any other church. The thing that makes us, as members, different from other children of the Lord is that we have, or can have, this great power of the Holy Ghost in our lives. The people who do have the Holy Ghost operating in their lives are different. The spirit that radiates from their persons is different. There is even a glow in their faces--the flesh in their countenances seems lighted--the gray, dull look is not there. The Holy Ghost will not dwell in an unclean, disobedient tabernacle. The Holy Ghost comes as a gift from God when we comply with the conditions established for his companionship.<br><br>Thus cleansed and committed, this heavenly power can have place in us. It fuels the light we are asked to hold up. The Savior said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).<br><br>Intention to hold up our light is good, but it is not enough; we must really hold it up. We must actually obey and meet all requirements if our light is to be seen--if we do our part in the Lord's strange act. Some might think they can fool their leaders. Some might think they can fool their bishop or their stake president. Some might even fool themselves, but you cannot fool the Spirit. The Spirit is the oil that fuels the light we are to hold up.<br><br>I witness to you that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the son of the living God, our Savior and our Redeemer. We live in a day when nothing can be hid. The word, the account of our every act, will be spoken from the housetops sooner or later.<br><br>In the great plan--the Lord's strange act--the Lord Jesus Christ did not fail. Gutenberg did not fail in his part. Columbus and the Pilgrims did not fail in their parts. The Founding Fathers did not fail. Joseph Smith and the pioneers did not fail. This generation will not fail. There will be some who are too weak and so careless their lights will go out. But may we be true to our sacred commitments made to the Lord--some before this life here--to faithfully do our part in his strange act that we might be an ensign to all, that our light might be one of great brilliance. I dare you to rise up to new levels of obedience, to rise up to new levels of spirituality. Remember the Lord's promise:<br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:63]<br><br><i>I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 82:10]<br><br><i>Give me some men who are Stouthearted Men who will fight for the right they adore.</i><br><br><i>Start me with ten who are Stouthearted Men and I'll soon give you ten thousand more.</i><br><br>[Words by Oscar Hammerstein II, "Stouthearted Men," from<i>The New Moon</i>]<br><br>Remember, the creation of a thousand forests can come from one acorn.<br><br>To each one of you I say thanks for being great. We are proud of you. We are counting on you. I say this in the holy name of Jesus Christ the Lord. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Rex C.

<h1>mith: The Prophet - David B. Haight - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I look out into the faces of you precious young sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father and sense your unlimited potential to "do good unto all men" (Galatians 6:10), I pray tonight that each of you--and that I--will be blessed with the Spirit of the Lord, that what I testify of will strengthen your faith and desire to personally live and be faithful to all the true principles of God's eternal plan of salvation--those keys and powers that have been conferred upon all men during<br><br>these latter days, a fulfillment of the declaration of Paul to the Ephesians "that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him" (Ephesians 1:10).<br><h2><b>The Restoration</b></h2><br>The principles, doctrines, and ordinances of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ have been revealed anew, including a knowledge of the true nature of God--a personal, loving, Eternal Father--and of Jesus Christ, the literal Son of God, of whose divinity there has come another witness in the Book of Mormon. The words of Ezekiel that the stick of Judah (the Bible) shall be joined with the stick of Joseph (the Book of Mormon) as a testimony of two nations have found their fulfillment (see Ezekiel 37:15–22). This I solemnly declare to all of you.<br><br>The authority to act in the name of God, the holy priesthood, has been conferred upon men in our time by those same individuals who held it anciently--Peter, James, and John--apostles of our Lord who were ordained by the Savior himself when he was upon the earth.<br><br>The Church of Jesus Christ has been reestablished. The priesthood of God is again among men. God has revealed himself anew for the blessing of his children.<br><br>As I declare to you, my dear young friends, these divine events--with all the characteristics of the Church of the early apostles, including the personal direction of Jesus Christ, divinely revealed doctrine, divinely chosen leaders, continuous revelation, and the witness of the Holy Ghost to all who obey--I testify that the instrument through whom this divine revelation came was one foreordained--the youthful Joseph Smith--whose faith and desire brought about "one of the most significant religious events in the history of mankind" (Milton V. Backman, Jr., "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/01/joseph-smiths-recitals-of-the-first-vision?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Joseph Smith's Recitals of the First Vision,</span></a>"<i>Ensign,</i>Jan. 1985, p. 8).<br><br>Since my early youth I have believed and carried in my mind a vivid picture of the teen-age Joseph finding a secluded spot, kneeling in the quiet grove, and in childlike faith asking the desire of his heart. He must have felt assured the Lord would hear and somehow answer him. There appeared to him two glorious personages, a description of whom, he said, was beyond his ability to express.<br><br>I have been blessed, as the years have passed, with unusual experiences with people, places, and personal events of an intimate, spiritual nature, and, through the power of the Holy Ghost, I have received an ever-deepening witness and knowledge of this heaven-directed restoration of the Lord's plan of salvation. The events related by Joseph Smith of the Restoration are true.<br><h2><b>The Vision</b></h2><br>Each of you can develop in your bosom an uplifting, sanctifying, and glorifying feeling of its truth. The Holy Ghost will reveal and seal upon each of your hearts this knowledge, if you truly desire. Our understanding, belief, and faith in "the vision" (as we refer to it) of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son appearing to Joseph, thereby ushering in this final dispensation with its great and precious truths, is essential to our eternal salvation. Salvation comes only through Christ. Joseph Smith is the instrument or revealer of that knowledge, divinely called to teach of the terms and conditions of the Father's plan and given the keys of salvation for all mankind.<br><br>The knowledge is mine that God did reveal himself unto Joseph--his witness of this final dispensation. We now know something of the form, features, and even character of that mighty intelligence whose wisdom, creation, and power control the affairs of the universe. God made it known that Jesus Christ is the express image of the Father.<br><br>In Joseph's own words, the brightness was above anything he had ever known. He looked up. Before him stood two glorious personages. One of them, pointing to the other, said, "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (JS--H 1:17).<br><br>It might have seemed inconceivable to young Joseph that he was looking upon God our Heavenly Father and his Son--that the Lord had come to visit and instruct him.<br><br>The Son, bidden by the Father, spoke to the kneeling boy. Joseph was told that all the churches were wrong. They had corrupted the doctrine; they had broken the ordinances and had lost the authority of the priesthood of God. He was told that the leaders of the man-made churches were displeasing to the Lord, that they were collecting money which should be given freely, and that the time for the restoration of all truth and authority had come, including the organization of the Church. Then, to his infinite astonishment, he was told that<i>he,</i>Joseph Smith--young, unlearned, but humble--was to be the instrument through whom the Almighty would reestablish his work in these, the latter days--the gospel never to be taken away again. Such was the glorious beginning of the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Some three years later, as he was beginning to mature, Joseph Smith had another heavenly visitation. This time an angel sent from the presence of God informed Joseph that he was Moroni and revealed to the young man the resting place of a set of gold plates upon which certain ancient inhabitants of America had recorded the history of their peoples. In the course of time, these records were translated by the gift and power of God and published early in 1830.<br><h2><b>A Definite Purpose</b></h2><br>The Book of Mormon is the most remarkable book in the world from a doctrinal, historical, or philosophical point of view. Its integrity has been assailed with senseless fury for over a century and a half; yet its position and influence today is more impregnable than ever.<br><br>The Book of Mormon did not come forth as a curiosity. It was written with a definite purpose--a purpose to be felt by every reader. From the title page we read that it was written "to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations." The message it contains is a witness for Christ and teaches the love of God for all mankind. Its purpose is to bring people to accept Jesus as the Christ. The book tells of the actual visit of Christ to ancient America and records the teachings and instructions he gave in clarity and great power to the people. The Book of Mormon substantiates the Bible in its teachings of the Savior, speaks of Christ more than any other subject, and teaches that our Savior is the Redeemer and Atoner of mankind, constantly emphasizing that he is the central figure in God's plan of salvation. This divine record makes converts to its message and to his Church, which teaches it.<br><br>I have marveled at God's wisdom in bringing forth this ancient record in the manner in which it was accomplished, for it has also become the powerful witness of the divine mission of Joseph Smith. Sunday, November 28, 1841, the Prophet wrote:<br><br><i>I spent the day in the council with the Twelve Apostles at the house of President Young, conversing with them upon a variety of subjects. Brother Joseph Fielding was present, having been absent four years on a mission to England. I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:461]<br><br>Joseph Smith was foreordained to be the duly appointed leader of this, the greatest and final of all dispensations. After the angel Moroni's visit, other heavenly messengers conferred upon Joseph holy priesthood authority, divine keys, power, and revelations from God.<br><br>Not only was the Church organized under inspiration and divine direction, but the necessary body of doctrine for guidance of the Church was revealed. Faith and light were again available to distill the darkness that was upon the earth. Joseph Smith, after seeking and being taught by the Author of Truth, learned that<br><br>1. God is in form like man.<br><br>2. He has a voice; he speaks.<br><br>3. He is considerate and kind.<br><br>4. He answers prayers.<br><br>5. His son is obedient to the Father and is the mediator between God and man.<br><br>6. "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22).<br><br>Though Hebrew scriptures make references to temples and baptism for the deceased, Joseph Smith was the first to have revealed the purpose of temples and salvation for all--including those who have passed on without having received a knowledge of the gospel--along with the eternal marriage covenant and sealing of man and woman as the foundation for exaltation.<br><br>Joseph Smith, speaking at the first conference of the Church in June 1830, spoke of great happiness "to find ourselves engaged in the very same order of things as observed by the holy Apostles of old" (<i>HC</i>1:85).<br><h2><b>Joseph Smith: A Prophet of the Lord</b></h2><br>Under the inspiration of Almighty God, the Church began to flourish. The Lord's promise that a "marvelous work is about to come forth" was being fulfilled in a miraculous way (see D&amp;amp;C 4:1). The gospel message spread rapidly. The missionary spirit was touching hearts. The Book of Mormon was being read. Tens, then hundreds, then thousands joined the Church. The Lord, speaking through Joseph, proclaimed:<br><br><i>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither</i><br><br><i>heart that shall not be penetrated....</i><br><br><i>The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh--</i><br><br><i>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;...</i><br><br><i>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed ... unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:2, 19–20, 23]<br><br>Politicians began worrying over this new phenomenon. Enemies were organizing, and the Prophet's life was becoming endangered. After months of imprisonment in the dark, damp dungeon known as Liberty Jail, a discouraged Joseph cried out to the Lord:<br><br><i>O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?</i><br><br><i>How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, ... behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants,...</i><br><br><i>Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:1–3]<br><br>Then a loving, answering Savior promised Joseph:<br><br><i>The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and hell shall rage against thee;</i><br><br><i>While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.</i><br><br><i>And thy people shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors.</i><br><br>...<i>Thou shalt be had in honor; ... and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce lion, because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:1–4]<br><br>In his last public address to a large congregation in Nauvoo, Joseph said:<br><br><i>I do not regard my own life. I am ready to be offered a sacrifice for this people; for what can our enemies do? Only kill the body, and their power is then at an end. Stand firm, my friends; never flinch. Do not seek to save your lives, for he that is afraid to die for the truth will lose eternal life....</i><br><br><i>God has tried you. You are a good people; therefore I love you with all my heart. Greater love hath no man than that he should lay down his life for his friends. You have stood by me in the hour of trouble, and I am willing to sacrifice my life for your preservation.</i>[George Q. Cannon,<i>Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1907), p. 498]<br><br>This statement is all the more remarkable as the Prophet was still in the morning of life--only thirty-eight years old--and great as he had already become, the zenith of his mental and spiritual powers had not yet been reached. Life was precious to him with all its possibilities of future achievements. Yet he was willing to give it up, willing to forego all the honors that might be his, the greatness that would come to him if he lived.<br><br>"A Prophet," wrote Truman Madsen, "is one who, in fulfillment of his mission, undergoes great suffering, yet through it all, is radiant. A Prophet, in short, is a saint."<br><br>Someone has written:<br><br><i>Nowhere in the long lists of martyrs, save only in the case of Joseph Smith, do we find one who voluntarily went out of his way to die for his faith and people. In that fateful hour when the choice of life or death was to be made, Joseph Smith did not hedge, or sidestep, or seek to save his life, but bravely chose to die, in the hope that his people might henceforth be free to worship God in their own way, and that the testimony which he had borne of a restored gospel might be sanctified [if necessary] by the shedding of his blood.</i><br><br>"Had he been spared a martyr's fate till mature manhood," said Parley P. Pratt, "he was certainly endowed with power and ability to have [influenced] the world in many respects."<br><br>One may pick up the thread of Joseph Smith's life on any day of any year and find incalculable suffering, both his own and the disciples' around him.<br><h2><b>"Be Patient in Afflictions"</b></h2><br>Mormonism was appearing to become, as the scripture says, as a stone cut out of a mountain, without hands and rolling forth to fill the whole earth (see D&amp;amp;C 65:2). Political officials worried about it moving outward and abroad from the immediate locale, illegal charges were leveled, court documents and summons were issued, and vigilantes were formed--at Carthage, the county seat. Joseph and Hyrum were to appear to answer charges against them.<br><br>As Joseph Smith left Nauvoo for Carthage that twenty-fourth day of June, he would have looked for the last time on the city and the magnificent temple that he loved. He knew he would never look upon it again.<br><br>"Be patient in afflictions," he was told, "for thou shalt have many." Later, he said adversity had become second nature, but had only "wafted me that much closer to Deity." Brigham Young said of him that he lived one thousand years in thirty-eight.<br><br>To his companions who were accompanying him to Carthage, he gave these prophetic words:<br><br><i>I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. ... And it shall yet be said of me--he was murdered in cold blood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:4]<br><br>Why did he not turn back? There was time to escape. He was not yet in the hands of his enemies. Friends were at his side who would die for him if necessary. Some suggested he flee across the Mississippi where he would be safe. But he continued to Carthage.<br><br>Joseph must have recalled some of the dangers through which he had passed--like the winter night when a mob broke into his home and with curses and profanity tore him from the bedside of his wife and sick children and dragged him over the frozen ground, kicking and beating him until he was unconscious. When consciousness returned, they stripped him of his clothing and covered his naked body from head to foot with a coat of tar and feathers, forcing open his mouth to fill it with the same substance, then left him on the frozen ground to die of cold and exposure.<br><br>Riding to Carthage he might have recalled the time in Missouri when he and some of his brethren had been betrayed into the hands of their enemies. The leader of the mob convened a court; Joseph and his associates were placed on trial for their lives. They were convicted and all sentenced to be shot the next morning at eight o'clock in the public square in Far West. At the appointed hour they were duly led forth to be murdered, but a dispute among the mob saved them.<br><br>Without even being permitted to bid farewell to their families, they were taken from place to place and exhibited to jeering crowds while the Saints were told they would never see their leaders again. But Joseph cheered his fellow prisoners by announcing that none of them would suffer death.<br><br>"Be of good cheer, brethren," he said, "the word of the Lord came to me last night that our lives should be given us, ... not one of our lives shall be taken" (<i>HC</i>3:200).<br><br>As Joseph contemplated those dreary months of imprisonment in Missouri, he must have recalled the night, when confined in a dungeon, he rebuked the guards. He and his brethren were trying to get a little sleep, but were kept awake by the awful blasphemies and obscene jests of their jailers, who were recounting the dreadful deeds of robbery and murder they had committed among the Mormons. These were no idle boasts, for these awful atrocities had actually been committed. Suddenly, Joseph rose to his feet and, in a voice that seemed to shake the very building, cried out:<br><br><i>Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit! In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you or I die this instant!</i>[<i>HC</i>3:208]<br><br>The effect must have been electric in its suddenness. Some begged his pardon while others slunk into the dark corners of Liberty Jail to hide their shame.<br><br>The power of Jesus Christ, whose name he had invoked in his rebuke, was upon him. His hands and feet were in chains, but these the guards did not see. They saw only the righteous anger in his shining face, and felt the divine power in his voice as he rebuked them.<br><br>But if Joseph's voice was terrible as the roaring lion in his rebuke of the wicked, it was soothing as a mother's voice in comfort to the righteous. In that same name and by the same authority with which he silenced the blasphemies of the guards, he had blessed little children, baptized repentant sinners, conferred the Holy Ghost, healed the sick, and spoken words of comfort and consolation to thousands.<br><h2><b>"Are You Afraid to Die?"</b></h2><br>It was midnight when the wagon journey from Nauvoo ended. Joseph and his brethren entered Carthage, and his fate was sealed. His enemies had awaited their coming with great anxiety. The governor, who was present, persuaded the mob to disperse that night by promising them that they should have full satisfaction.<br><br>The next day, after a hearing, Joseph was released on bail, but re-arrested on a trumped-up charge of treason. Bail was refused and Joseph and Hyrum were placed in Carthage Jail.<br><br>The last night of Joseph's life on earth he bore a powerful testimony, to the guards and others who assembled at the door of the jail, of the divinity of the Book of Mormon, also declaring that the gospel had been restored and the kingdom of God established on the earth. It was for this reason that he was incarcerated in prison, not for violating any law of God or man.<br><br>It was late at night when they tried to get some rest. At first Joseph and Hyrum occupied the only bed in the jail room, but a gunshot during the night and a disturbance led Joseph's friends to insist that he take a place between two of them on the floor. They would protect him with their own bodies. Joseph asked Elder Markham to use his arm for a pillow while they conversed, then he turned to Elder Dan Jones, on the other side, and whispered, "Are you afraid to die?" And this staunch friend answered, "Has that time come, think you? Engaged in such a cause, I do not think death would have many terrors."<br><br>Joseph replied, "You will yet see Wales, and fulfill the mission appointed you before you die" (<i>HC</i>6:601).<br><br>The next morning, the fateful twenty-seventh of June, 1844, three of the brethren left the prison and only four remained--Joseph and Hyrum and two of the apostles, both of whom during the day offered to die for him. The day was spent in writing letters to their wives, conversing on principles of the gospel, and singing. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon the Prophet requested Elder John Taylor to sing the words of "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief."<br><br>This comforting song breathes in every line the very spirit and message of Christ. Only a person who loved his Savior and his fellowmen would have requested to hear these words at such a time.<br><br>When Elder Taylor had finished the song, the Prophet's eyes were wet with tears, and he said, "Sing that song again, will you, John?" (Claire Noall,<i>Intimate Disciple; a Portrait of Willard Richards, Apostle to Joseph Smith--Cousin of Brigham Young</i>[Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1957], p. 440).<br><br>John "replied that he did not feel like singing. He was oppressed with a sense of coming disaster" (<i>Life of Joseph Smith,</i>p. 524).<br><br>"You'll feel better once you begin, and so will I," replied Joseph (<i>Intimate Disciple,</i>p. 440).<br><br>Hyrum also pleaded with him to repeat the song. And Elder Taylor did.<br><br>This time his voice was even sadder and more tender than at first, and when he concluded, all were hushed, but four hearts beat faster for they had carefully listened to the fateful words:<br><br><i>My friendship's utmost zeal to try,</i><br><i>He asked if I for him would die.</i><br><i>The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill,</i><br><i>But my free spirit cried, "I will!"</i><br>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/a-poor-wayfaring-man-of-grief?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;"><i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 29</span></a>]<br><br>The other three heard Joseph murmur as an echo to the song, "I will!"<br><br>The love of Christ was in the song; the love of man was there in that room in the Carthage Jail.<br><br>While this spirit of love and service for men expressed in song and prayer filled the hearts of all within the jail, the mob was gathering. The final details you know.<br><h2><b>Only Love Begets Love</b></h2><br>When the news of the awful crime reached Nauvoo, the citizens were overcome with grief and horror. Probably such universal sorrow had not been known in an American city before. The warm summer sun left them cold and chill. Their prophet and their patriarch were dead. What else mattered?<br><br>When the wagon carrying the bodies was still a long way off, the entire population of Nauvoo went out to meet it. No greater tribute was ever paid to mortal man than was paid that day to Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Such universal love from those who knew them best could never have been won by selfish and designing men. Only love begets love. Once when Joseph had been asked how he had acquired so many followers and retained them, he replied, "It is because I possess the principle of love. All that I offer the world is a good heart and good hand."<br><br>Sariah Workman, an early immigrant, wrote: "I felt a divine influence whenever I was in his presence."<br><br>John Taylor, who was wounded at Carthage and later became prophet, said of him:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><br>I leave each of you my love and testament that God, our Father, lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God, crucified for the sins of the world "to cleanse it from all unrighteousness; that through him all might be saved" (D&amp;amp;C 76:41–42).<br><br>He is our Redeemer, our Lord, our King. His kingdom is again established on the earth. In the year 1820, God, our Eternal Father, and his son Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith, who was foreordained to be the instrument of the Restoration, which is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This Church, by divine direction, is preparing the world for his second coming--for he will come again. This I humbly declare in his holy name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>David B.

<h1>he King: Live Pure, Speak True, Right Wrong - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am happy to be with you. I couldn't refrain from drafting an elegant speech for you this morning, but I think I shall be able to resist reading it--or most of it--though I will try to extract from it some references to good literature, and to the best literature, as a base for what I wish to share.<br><br>What I would like to say is what I would wish my children to hear or have heard, or my grandchildren to hear when they are ready. It matters what we say and how we say it. One cannot be cavalier about thirty minutes, or twenty, or fifteen, of anybody's time.<br><br>I have thought this morning of a story about an old sea captain who was feared because of his tyrannical approach. He disapproved of almost everything, including his first mate. When the first mate came back from shore leave one night slightly inebriated, the captain entered into the daily ship's log: "This day the first mate returned to the ship drunk."<br><br>The first mate resented that but there was nothing he could do about it. However his day came. He was officer of the watch and the captain was ashore. When the captain returned to the ship that night, the first mate entered into the log: "This day the captain returned to the ship sober."<br><br>It matters what we say and how we say it!<br><br>Speaking of grandchildren, I was approached this weekend by a sweet lady who told me she was ninety years old. That relieved me a little because I was expecting her to say, as I regularly hear older people say now, "I have been listening to you since I was a little girl." That thought captivates me, and in some cases may be true. As long as BYU keeps replaying old tapes, galloping senescence may be withheld in a measure from current observation. In my case eternal youth has been perpetuated by the replaying of a speech or two given here so many years ago that I haven't the slightest idea what I said.<br><br>Another person approached me at a conference and said, "We used to love to hear you speak about your children. Why don't you start speaking about your grandchildren?" I will indulge her and myself, and share with you one simple report about two grandchildren.<br><br>Our oldest daughter and her husband and five children came to live with us for a few months because they suffered, the misfortune of having their house damaged by a fire. So, while it was being repaired, we had the marvelous blessing of getting to know the family a whole lot better. So much better that what may be one of the few triumphs of my life occurred at four o'clock one morning when a little boy came to me--not to his mother or father or grandmother, but to me--awakened me and said, "Gwandpa, I frowed up." Somehow that had become apparent to me already!<br><br>I went with him to the bedroom where he and his brother had been sleeping and saw with marvel and amazement that this lad has the most significant propulsive capacity I have ever observed. After I had completely evacuated the room of most of its contents, reclothed and relocated two little boys who were staggering around sleepily after they had had a shower, and gone back to my own room marveling--after all that occurred, I lay in my bed chuckling. That was a great experience, full of good cheer and some laughter and appreciation.<br><br>Several days passed. Then, at the breakfast table one morning, the older boy, who had previously given his thanks and hugs, was sitting by his younger brother, who was still struggling with the rudiments of language. It was the latter who spoke. Between mouthfuls of cereal he said, "Gwandpa, I think you are the greatest man in the whole world." I said, "Well, maybe not the greatest, Mark--certainly one of the best looking, but maybe not the greatest." But he didn't laugh. He said, "And the goodest."<br><br>Do you know, somehow that little fellow came to feel and respond to something very important--that in serving and being served you really do learn to love each other, both she or he who serves and they who are served.<br><br>I commend that to you--the good cheer and the sense of delight in being able to help someone who really needs help, as they needed help that night. There are a lot of people who would prosper from learning what little Mark, the masterful philosopher, got out of that experience. He related it a bit over generously to one who was involved, but the principle is real and good.<br><h2><b>What Do You Wish For?</b></h2><br>Let me share with you something I read recently. It was a note written by the mother of Steve Howe, reprinted in Sunday's newspaper. You may know that he was a major league baseball pitcher of considerable skill and affluence and future who is now struggling to get back into baseball after having lost his place because of reputed drug use. His mother said:<br><br><i>It's easy to place blame where there is no blame. We have five children and we have one cocaine addict. I would die for my kids. But I will not take the blame for his addiction, any more than his father should. You know what I think Steve's problem is? Everything he ever said he wanted to do, he's done. He's any ordinary kid who got everything he ever wished for. All his dreams came true. And it wasn't enough.</i>["Quotes,"<i>Deseret News Magazine,</i>2 March 1986, p. 3]<br><br>I admire Mrs. Howe's understanding of the principle of agency and her scripture-like attribution of accountability where accountability is due. I know nothing personally of these individuals and make only this comment: I cannot help wondering what Steve wished for and dreamed of in his quiet hours. I doubt he ever dreamed or wished to be in the position he is in. Does anyone ever really aim for failure or for self-destruction or the vitiation of potential?<br><br>Again, I certainly do not judge or write off Steve Howe. I hope he comes back in lots of wonderful ways. But I simply emphasize what a wise man once said: "He who picks up one end of a stick picks up the other. He who chooses the beginning of a road chooses the place it leads to." And I will add another wise line, that "Not failure, but low aim, is crime."<br><br>I cannot fail to wonder whether anybody ever opened to Steve a sense of what can be because of who he is and to whom he belongs and what is in him of potential and power and capacity. I wonder if he ever dreamed--really dreamed--of giving the kind of service I have watched many his age or younger (perhaps some sitting among you today) give in the barrios or the refugee camps of Asia. Such a dream would be worthy of his manhood and his capacity. It is a good thing to be capable of being a major leaguer, but there are some major objectives that are more important than baseball or basketball or any other sport.<br><br>Dreams and wishes and desires matter but they do not themselves take us to achievement. What we really want to accomplish, to do, to have, to be, will be achieved on the basis of our day-by-day effort. And the dream coming true will be the consequence of our putting to work the capacities we have to take advantage of the opportunities around us while they are yet there.<br><br>Today let me take a theme from great literature, the theme of a young hero who had ambitions, a dream, a desire, and whose example may be stimulating to some of you. I hope so.<br><h2><b>Gareth's Quest</b></h2><br>In Tennyson's<i>Idylls of the King</i>is the story of Gareth and Lynette. Gareth was "The last tall son of Lot and Bellicent," says the poem, a prince much loved by his mother who desired to protect him from the fate she feared, which was that he become like his father who was ill and had no will to live, and like his brothers who were at the Round Table but who had not the qualities nor character of Gareth. He too desired to be a knight, but he had nobler dreams also. His mother wanted him to stay at home and enjoy the estates and the opportunities of the influential and wealthy. She wanted him, she said, to "follow the deer." He answered:<br><br><i>O mother,</i><br><i>How can you keep me tether'd to you?--Shame.</i><br><i>Man am I grown, a man's work must I do.</i><br><i>Follow the deer? follow the Christ, the King,</i><br><i>Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--</i><br><i>Else, wherefore born?</i><br>[Alfred, Lord Tennyson,<i>Idylls of the King,</i>"Gareth and Lynette," lines 113–18]<br><br>Gareth, through trials and tests, demonstrated his faithfulness and his competence and courage in pursuit of those worthy dreams. He defined in effect not only whom he wanted to follow but his understanding of the path and where it led and what it required: "Live pure, speak true, right wrong."<br><br>I am not interested in the phrases as slogans but in the fact that they are descriptive of the life of the Lord, laid out by him through his teaching and example. He said that we must:<br><br><i>Hold up</i>[our]<i>light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which ye have seen me do.</i>[3 Nephi 18:24]<br><br><i>Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.</i>[3 Nephi 18:16]<br><h2><b>Live Pure</b></h2><br>So we speak of the<i>pure life.</i>What is it? Is it attainable, achievable, realistic? Is it only an idealistic slogan or is it in fact a manner of living and thinking invoked not only by a visionary poet but by many prophets inspired of God and exemplified by the Savior?<br><br>Think about it a moment. Obviously this is what God and Christ desire for us. So one seeking to live a pure life will ask herself or himself, "What does God mean in my life? Is my purpose, my honest purpose, really to know and to do his will? How do my convictions and commitments affect my thinking, speaking, and behavior?"<br><br>Jesus came, it is written, that he might have a feeling of our infirmities. He was tempted in all things like unto us but was sinless. Being reviled, he<br><br><i>reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously</i>[that is, to God]. [1 Peter 2:23]<br><br>The pure life is ultimately the only life worth living and is ultimately realistic and attainable. In these marvelous scriptural records the Lord declares that he will raise up to himself a "pure people, that will serve me in righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 100:16). A little earlier, recorded in that magnificent vision we now have in section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, word is received of great and marvelous works, the mysteries of the kingdom, which the prophet and his companion were told not to write nor to utter.<br><br><i>Neither is man capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood</i>[these great and marvelous works and the so-called mysteries]<i>by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love him, and purify themselves before him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:116]<br><br>Wonderful promises follow. Read from the book of Helaman how a group of people under intense pressures grew in living a pure life, and became something special in the midst of worldliness, pride, and persecution. How did they do that?<br><br><i>They did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</i>[Helaman 3:35]<br><br>Somehow through their own effort and God's blessing they managed to become mature enough--mature in the pattern of the Savior and the Almighty--to yield their hearts. I don't think they became fanatical or cheerless or hard to live with. They became cheerful and gracious and filled with the Spirit. They became purer than they had been. They spoke the truth. And they righted the wrongs done to them or that they themselves were guilty of.<br><br>Dante wrote what Matthew Arnold called the greatest line in literature: "In His will is our peace" (<i>The Divine Comedy,</i>"Paradiso," canto 3, line 85).<br><br>Purity has its highest expression in doing God's will, in unselfishness, self-forgetfulness--attributes of God and Christ. The Almighty has taught us that we have nothing to glory in in worldly wisdom, or might, or riches.<br><br><i>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.</i>[Jeremiah 9:24]<br><br>Purity in this world is not an established accomplishment but a continuing pursuit, a determined commitment. As we blunder or temporarily succumb, we regroup and do better. Self-mastery, self-control, self-command, and strength of will are expressions of desire and commitment to follow the Christ, to do the will of God. None is the product of wishing or of intellect, but of desire, of yielding our hearts to God--preparing us for the fuller entertainment in our lives of that Spirit which<br><br><i>giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:46]<br><br>It must be known that in this quest for purity there is no denigration of the human body, of physical human needs, and of wholesome motivations. One of the glories of the gospel is the revelation that the body is a non-evil component of the eternal soul. "The spirit and the body are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15). Only when the body is in eternal indissoluble combination with the spirit can a fullness of joy be experienced. For us there is no hostility between the spirit and the body. The earthly part needs the guiding blessing of the spiritual. The gratification of physical needs can be an act of sanctification. All things to the Lord are spiritual. He made heaven and earth. There is no capacity in man more godlike than the capacity to create.<br><br>To help us appreciate and seek the pure life there are masterful and marvelous instructions. One that I have loved best for years comes from Psalm 24, which in part reads:<br><br><i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?</i><br><br><i>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</i><br><br><i>He shall receive</i>[she shall receive]<i>the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</i>[Psalm 24:3–5]<br><br>What a beautiful and sweet thing--what a lovely blessing to have available and before us and in our minds as a guide to help us achieve our desires. In this vision is implicit a rejection of that which is proud and unbecoming and mean-spirited in us, and a maturing into that which can be light and wholesomeness and decency and grace and goodness.<br><br>Live pure? Let me give you one example. I interviewed a young man in a mission once who was somebody special. He was a strong and successful missionary. He hadn't always done very well; in fact, he had done very poorly in early high school years. He had picked up a lot of very bad habits and muddied up his conscience and had departed far from the pure life. Then one night he and some of his friends in like condition attended a ward dance because they had heard that a new family had moved into the ward and that there were some pretty girls in the family. Our young man was nominated by his giggling friends to go make the approach when they spotted the new girls. He did. He asked one of them to dance. She agreed and they began. Then he did something he reported to me long years later with a sense of shame. He said that he had made an immoral gesture toward her. She stopped on the dance floor, stepped back from him with hurt and anger and said, "Why did you do that?" He said, muttering, "To impress you, I guess." She said, "You did!" and left the floor.<br><br>His friends were highly amused, and they all left the dance--he seemingly unperturbed. He went home, and his friends went their ways. Secluded in his room he sat for a time pondering and trying to talk with someone he had neglected for a long time. The next day he knocked on the girl's door and apologized in sincerity. She said, "Do you hold the priesthood?" He said, "Yes." She said, "Do you know what that means? Does it mean anything to you? Why don't you honor it?" He said, "I will."<br><br>And from that hour--that moment of her facing him with a purity of conscience and courage and with righteous indignation--from that moment of speaking the truth, he understood. He said, "It took me a long time to get ready to come here. Even when I asked about a mission, I wasn't really ready though I had spent a long time in preparation. But when I was ready I told the bishop. I haven't had any time to waste as a missionary, Brother Hanks," he said, "or any money or any energy. I am here on the Lord's errand, and if I have done any good, that is why."<br><br>Live pure. Speak true.<br><h2><b>Speak True</b></h2><br>Let me share some convictions about speaking true. There are diverse ways to speak true--sometimes in behavior, sometimes the look on our face, sometimes the radiation of our spirit, sometimes in spoken word. I know a young lady and her companions who served helping refugees in Asia, never able to teach a single formal religious discussion because they were honest in keeping camp rules, even though others sometimes did not. After a time a man who had been very unsympathetic to any Mormon helping in the refugee camps, because he thought we were not really interested in anything but aggressive proselyting, wrote a letter, a letter of apology and commendation. I will read a sentence or two:<br><br><i>There is still a great deal of fear among other voluntary agencies that the Mormons are here to proselyte. Even if you don't talk about your religion, your values come across like a ton of bricks and that frightens people. You live what you believe. Therein may lie your problem--especially when it brings such inner strength, peace, and confidence as you girls radiate.</i><br><br>They were<i>speaking true</i>in the way they lived and served and blessed the lives of others. They truly followed Christ in doing good, unselfishly helping those who had desperate needs.<br><br>Emerson said, "I cannot find language of sufficient energy to convey my sense of the sacredness of private integrity."<br><br>To Joseph Smith and his associates the Lord said, "Take upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness" (D&amp;amp;C 18:21).<br><br>The same dangers that have beset men in every age--in Isaiah's day and Ezekiel's and Micah's, and in the day of the Lord on the earth--are challenging us in this day. The prophets inveighed against lip-serving and eye-pleasing formalism and empty ritual at the expense of real love and real worship and real faith.<br><br>Jesus spoke strongly against much loud praying done for the sake of being heard by men, against fasting to be seen of men, against payments of tithes and offerings for the plaudits of men. In each case they have their reward--the being seen and heard, the plaudits of men.<br><br>But this is not real worship or real service or real contribution--only self-centered and empty exhibitionism.<br><br>Real development, real growth, real understanding--the gaining of our lives--come only as we lose our lives in honest love for God, for his work, for his children, expressed in obedience to him and in unselfish interest in them and service to them.<br><br>Years ago I listened to a member of a stake presidency speak in stake conference about his teenage son who had cost his team a volleyball championship by volunteering to the referee that the ball had touched him before it went out of bounds. No one else knew, only he. Yet under that kind of pressure he had spoken the truth. His team lost, the medals and trophies went to the other team. Said the man at the pulpit: "I am not shedding a tear because our kids won or lost a volleyball match. I weep for joy that I have the honor to be the father of a teenage son who under that kind of pressure had the courage to say, 'The ball touched me.'"<br><br>Speak true.<br><h2><b>Right Wrong</b></h2><br>What do we do about the wrongs of which we have been guilty? How do we respond to the wrongs done to us by others, by fate, disasters, war, injustice?<br><br>Jesus gave us the pattern to follow:<br><br><i>Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</i><br><br><i>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</i><br><br><i>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</i><br><br><i>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</i>[1 Peter 2:21–24]<br><br>Paul added this counsel:<br><br><i>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</i>[1 Peter 2:12]<br><br>In last weekend's newspaper was the story of an unidentified teacher who sent two hundred dollars to the school district in his area to pay for some paper, paper clips, and elastics appropriated to his own use over the years. Some of us wouldn't really give much thought to that, would we?<br><br>Why did he do what he did last week? Because he thought about it carefully enough and long enough. The minor monetary value of the paper clips and rubber bands doesn't seem important to him now. To be clean, to feel good, to merit his own self-respect, to be honest--these are the things that matter most to him now. It was vital to him that he correct the wrong. Likely no one else knew.<i>He knew,</i>and he has done what he could to regain and merit his own self-respect.<br><br>When Jesus had written on the ground at his confrontation with those who intended to stone to death the woman taken in adultery and who asked his views on the matter,<br><br><i>he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</i><br><br><i>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</i><br><br><i>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one.</i>[John 8:7–9]<br><br>With her accusers gone, Jesus declared that neither would he condemn her, and bade her "go, and sin no more" (John 8:11). How significant that those who had zealously sought to inflict punishment on her were "convicted by their own conscience" in the compassionate presence of he who had been sent not to condemn the world, "but that the world through him might be saved" (John 3:17)!<br><br>These seem to me to be the central principles that the Lord would like us to learn through his instruction and example. I pray that we do not fail to recognize them in the scriptural account, or to subordinate them to any other lesson or conclusion we may wish to add.<br><br>I have to share with you, as I finish, a letter received from a special human being you may know or perhaps will know because her story, I am told, is being published. I performed a wedding many years ago. A happy marriage followed, children came, and then one day came the announcement that he didn't want to be at home anymore; he had a male friend he would rather live with. On occasional holidays he was invited back home by this very unusual woman who taught her children that he was part of them, that there were many virtuous and lovely things about him, and that he had given them much. She could not justify the thing he had done or understand his problem. But she could help the children feel a sense of individual worth and value because there was much in them that came from the good in him. He came home to die of AIDS, attended compassionately in their own home among his own family. She wrote this:<br><br><i>Dear Brother Hanks:</i><br><br><i>I am writing now because I want to let you know that last Thursday</i>[he]<i>passed away here at my home, a victim of AIDS. He had not been well for a year, but in March he was diagnosed with the disease. He made every effort to maintain his strength, but it was not possible. No one recovers. He wanted to be here with us, and I wanted him to be here. I read Walt Whitman to him and played Beethoven for him and told him how much we all loved him and did what I could to make him as comfortable as possible. Last night the children and I and a few close friends held a private memorial service for him here at my home. It was a wonderful event and we are all able to release him with love. The children will miss</i>[him]<i>a great deal. I will too. He gave a lot to all of us.</i><br><br><i>Somewhere there is a sense to this. I have been granted a great deal of strength to help me through it, and for that I am grateful.</i><br><br>Then she compliments her choice bishop and stake president and friends and others who have supported and sustained her.<br><br>I wake up some mornings remembering her words: "I read Walt Whitman to him and played Beethoven for him." And sometimes I say, "Lord, if today I can approach that kind of Christian quality I will be grateful."<br><br>Follow the Christ. Live pure. Speak true. Right wrong. These are expressions of dreams and ambitions that are attainable and desirable and inevitable if one day we want to live the kind of creative, mature life our Father in Heaven and his son live. I bear testimony they do, and that I desire that quality of life, far as I am from it, for me. And, oh, how much I desire it for you and your children and my children and their children, for therein lies happiness--ultimate joy--here and hereafter. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D. Hanks was a President of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 March 1986.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
Imagine for a moment what it would be like if you were standing at this pulpit in a devotional assembly. I can remember sitting in the audience at the George Albert Smith Fieldhouse on such occasions, as a student twenty-five years ago, and wondering the same thing. As a student I had the opportunity of listening to prophets and apostles such as David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, J. Reuben Clark, Harold B. Lee, Spencer W. Kimball, Ezra Taft Benson, Mark E. Petersen, Marion G. Romney, and LeGrand Richards.<br><br>The overwhelming question that comes to mind is, "What subject can I possibly cover that has not already been addressed so well?" To illustrate my feelings, I can't resist sharing an experience I had in grade school.<br><br>In 1950 I attended Maeser Elementary School here in Provo. Under the banner of "progressive" education, an experiment was conducted where the fifth and sixth grades were combined. I was a fifth grader. In front of me sat a sixth grader. In addition to the fact that she was a year older than I, she had a superior intellect. I can remember how she always finished tests before I did and with more accuracy.<br><br>On one particular Friday morning it was "show and tell" time and the assignment fell on myself and my nemesis sitting in front of me. I worked feverishly on my project and came to school all excited, carrying my treasure in a brown paper sack. As I arrived, there was a pickup truck backed up to the entrance of the school, and there was the sixth grader and her mother carrying in item after item of collections from the Far East or some exotic place they had visited the previous summer. At the conclusion of her excellent presentation our teacher, Mr. Bowen, said, "We will now be honored to hear from Glenn."<br><br>Apprehensively I reached under my desk, picked up my sack, walked to the head of the class, and pulled out a bottle of frog eggs. I was crazy about those frog eggs that day and feel positive about what I have prepared for you today--but then, everything is relative.<br><h2><b>Agency and Inspiration</b></h2><br>Being a glutton for punishment, I have chosen a subject that, most likely, has been addressed scores of times in devotional assemblies. I will speak on the elusive balance of academic, or intellectual, pursuits and learning to rely on the promptings of the Spirit. How can we avoid relying too much on the intellectual while ignoring the Spirit, or expecting spiritual solutions while ignoring our own power to reason things out for ourselves?<br><br>First we'll review a doctrinal base from the scriptures and modern-day prophets, and then look at some examples on the subject. You are all aware of the great insight the Lord gave us on this subject when he told Oliver Cowdery why he failed in his attempt to translate the Book of Mormon.<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>Of this scripture Elder Bruce R. McConkie has commented,<br><br><i>Implicit in asking in faith is the precedent requirement that we do everything in our power to accomplish the goal that we seek. We use the agency with which we have been endowed. We use every faculty and capacity and ability that we possess to bring about the eventuality that may be involved.</i>. . .<br><br><i>There's a fine balance between agency and inspiration.</i>["Agency or Inspiration--Which?"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1972–1973</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1973), pp. 110, 113]<br><br>President Marion G. Romney put it this way:<br><br><i>When confronted with a problem, I prayerfully weigh in my mind alternative solutions and come to a conclusion as to which of them is best. Then in prayer I submit to the Lord my problem, tell him I desire to make the right choice, what is, in my judgment, the right course. Then I ask him if I have made the right decision to give me the burning in my bosom that He promised Oliver Cowdery.</i>. . .<br><br><i>When we learn to distinguish between the inspiration that comes from the Spirit of the Lord and that which comes from our own uninspired hopes and desires, we need make no mistakes.</i>["Q and A,"<i>New Era,</i>Oct. 1975, p. 35]<br><br>This doctrine is so simple and straightforward one might feel guilty admitting he has had difficulty in its application. How do we determine when enough homework has been done and, consequently, we have a right to a spiritual confirmation? How can we become a master at knowing when we have received a spiritual witness? I will try to define the elusive balance of the intellectual approach versus the spiritual approach by giving examples of two extremes.<br><h2><b>Intellectual Versus Spiritual</b></h2><br>On one side of the spectrum is the person within or without the Church who sees very little need to call upon the Lord because this person is a scholar. He wants to be independent and free in his thinking and not tied to absolute truths that the gospel tells us do exist. He may spend his life chasing down every intellectual loose end. All counsel from general or local authorities is taken with a grain of salt because, after all, their knowledge is so minimal compared to that which the scholar has amassed.<br><br>The other end of the spectrum is just as dangerous and is probably a greater threat to the majority of this audience. A person on this end of the spectrum thinks like this: "I know the Church is true and I have received the gift of the Holy Ghost. I am a worthy member of the Church and, therefore, have access to the Spirit." When faced with a problem he will pray for an answer, and the first thought that comes to mind is canonized. I would propose that an idea or solution that comes without appropriate reasoning is nothing better than a hunch. There are times of instant inspiration, but they are rare and usually involve an emergency.<br><br>There is a sentence used in Church circles that sends a chill up my spine. It's a perfectly good sentence that packs a spiritual wallop when used by someone who has been acted upon by the Spirit, but unfortunately is too often used by those who have wandered off-center in the spectrum. I've heard it said in my ward, at Church headquarters, and I have said it myself. The sentence that turns me cold is this: "I feel real good about it." Every time I hear it, I see a red flag go up. It's a perfectly good way of expressing a feeling of the Spirit, but far too often the literal translation is "I haven't done my homework." Some very bad decisions have been made by people who "feel really good" about something they have failed to reason out in their minds.<br><br>With those two extremes in mind, I would now like to give some examples that might help us inch our way into the center of the spectrum or toward that elusive balance.<br><h2><b>"Now, Go Get It!"</b></h2><br>Approximately five years ago I learned a great lesson while laboring as the new managing director of the Welfare Services Department of the Church. We were at a critical stage in the history of welfare. It was time to go through an agonizing reappraisal of the program in light of current world conditions. The specifics are irrelevant to this discussion except to say I was beside myself with worry and concern.<br><br>After praying for a solution, I had a terrific thought: "Glenn, you have access to the Quorum of the Twelve and to a member of the First Presidency." What a resource! I called for appointments and met one-on-one with these great men. I poured out my concerns and added my feelings that we were at a stage where further revelation on the subject was necessary. Then I sat back with my yellow notepad and Cross pen and waited for pearls of wisdom.<br><br>I received a total of one pearl from all of those interviews: "Brother Pace, I commend you for your concern and conscientiousness in finding solutions to these weighty matters. I, too, have some deep concerns and anxieties, and you are absolutely right, we do need revelation. Now,<i>go get it!"</i><br><br>Who, me? I was an employee of the Church, not a General Authority, but I had the responsibility to bring forth well thought-out recommendations to the Brethren that could be confirmed, modified, or rejected in the appropriate forums. It was my obligation and right to receive inspiration, but it came with intense, agonizing study, research, and meditation.<br><h2><b>"Ye Were Past Feeling"</b></h2><br>Next let's see what we can learn about balance from the recent fuss about historical documents. The lessons on straying off-center are vivid. Let me ask you a soul-searching question. Would the discovery of any document, no matter how contradictory to what you believe to be true, shake your testimony? It may raise some intellectual questions, but if it shakes your testimony, I would submit you don't really have one. The intellectuals of our day may point at those who cannot and will not be shaken and accuse them of "blind faith." This type of accusation only serves as an indictment to those intellectual giants and proves them to be spiritual pygmies. They have not yet learned there is an avenue to truth greater than intellect and more certain than the five senses. They have left unexplored the most glorious of all avenues to truth--direct revelation from heaven.<br><br>Does all this mean we should have no interest in history? I love Church history. I'm thankful we know the locations of the Sacred Grove, Hill Cumorah, the Jackson County temple site, Nauvoo, Adam-ondi-Ahman, Liberty Jail, and the other Church sites. My joy when visiting these sites is intensified by knowing the history behind them. However, the most lasting impressions obtained by these visits is what is<i>felt</i>there, rather than what is remembered.<br><br>Two years ago my wife and I visited some of these sites. Two experiences come to mind that have relevance to this search for balance. In Jackson County we sat on the lawn within the boundaries of the future Jackson County temple. It was sunset. We were alone. We talked of history. We talked of prophecies of the future. But we remember most the sweet, peaceful, spiritual witness that Jesus Christ stands at the head of this Church and that Joseph Smith is what he claimed to be, a prophet of God. No amount of historical research alone can bring to pass that spiritual witness. It comes only when we become attuned and learn to recognize spiritual things. However, the spiritual witness was intensified by our knowledge of what has happened and what will happen there. That evening we found the elusive balance.<br><br>The next day we strayed off-center. We went to Adam-ondi-Ahman, part of a sacred past and destined to be included in a sacred future. Knowing this history helped us understand the significance of the land. We had a history book that told of an altar of Adam and of the Nephites--this book told the exact location. We didn't know at the time that subsequent research had given rise to some questions on the exact location. We arrived one hour before sunset, and in search of the precise location of the altar we drove to and fro, becoming more frustrated by the minute.<br><br>We climbed over fences, walked through fields, stampeded cattle, and soon found ourselves in a very vile mood. Fortunately, we came to our senses and drove to a knoll just in time to watch the sunset and enjoy the spirit of the place. Again, the Lord blessed us with a spiritual experience that can be recalled vividly upon reflection.<br><br>How often do we get so involved in the search for historical and archaeological details that we fail to take advantage of spiritual experiences right before our eyes? The same historical knowledge that can intensify spiritual experiences can destroy spirituality when we stray too far off-center.<br><br>A complete testimony was never intended to be gained through history, except through that kept by prophets and coming forth as scripture. A saving testimony will never come from a spectacular historical or archaeological find. If the Lord meant for our testimonies to be based on physical, historical evidence other than scripture, he would send Moroni with the golden plates. We would then send them to the FBI, and experts on golden plates would give them scientific tests. What would be the verdict? Opinions would vary.<br><br>While I was on my mission, the question I dreaded most was "Where are the golden plates today?" I didn't enjoy the looks we got when we answered, "The angel took them back." I didn't comprehend then what I know now. If my companion and I had been able to take Moroni and the plates from door to door, our converts would not have increased. If Moroni had stood between us suspended in the air, without a confirmation of the Spirit the whole experience would be explained away as a trick of mirrors or some other deception.<br><br>Do you remember what the Lord told Joseph regarding Martin Harris' desire to see the plates? "Behold, if they will not believe my words, they would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were possible that you should show them all these things which I have committed unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 5:7).<br><br>There is no other way to gain a testimony but through the promise of Moroni. You can rely on nothing else. Spiritual manifestations are generally reserved for the spiritually mature, not so much as a trial of faith as to assure they are not mocked. One must become adept at recognizing the Spirit before a spiritual manifestation can be a sanctifying experience. We have numerous scriptural examples of how pointless a physical manifestation can be without the accompanying receipt of the witness of the Holy Ghost. Conversion comes not by physical manifestations from heaven.<br><br>Laman and Lemuel observed many miraculous manifestations such as that recorded in 1 Nephi 3:30–31:<br><br><i>And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.</i><br><br><i>And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?</i><br><br>Nephi couldn't believe this and said, "Ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt?" (1 Nephi 4:3). Here we have an example of knowledge being of no eternal value because the Spirit is absent.<br><br>Nephi put his finger on Laman and Lemuel's problem in 1 Nephi 17:45.<br><br><i>Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling.</i><br><br>Even in heavenly manifestations we must acquire the ability to recognize the Spirit and feel the experience as well as see and hear it. Were it not so, Satan could thoroughly confuse us with his own demonstrations. Despite all the spectacular manifestations received by the Nephites and Lamanites at the birth of the Savior, within a short period of time doubts crept into the minds of those who were not converted.<br><br><i>The people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen--</i><br><br><i>Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people.</i>[3 Nephi 2:1–2]<br><br>If a witness of the Spirit is necessary to discern the validity of a visit by an angel, how much more vital that witness is in more subtle situations.<br><h2><b>Recognizing a Witness of the Spirit</b></h2><br>I will spend the balance of my time on how we can acquire the ability to recognize a witness of the Spirit. Even as I speak, I know it's impossible to convey an understanding of this phenomenon. We must make the discovery privately and individually.<br><br>First, remove from yourself the guilt feelings you have experienced when you have fallen on your spiritual behinds. Have any of you ever been certain you have received a spiritual witness only to have subsequent events prove you were in error? Have any of you had a spiritual witness you dismissed as indigestion, only to find out you blew it? Have any of you ever heard a General Authority admit he's had problems too?<br><br>We have more patience with our failures in learning to ski than we do in learning how to recognize the Spirit. When we fall going down the slope, we get up, laugh at ourselves, and try again. When we have a failure in recognizing the Spirit we feel great guilt and are reluctant to go forward. It's natural to have spiritual setbacks. It's OK. It's all right. Stay with it.<br><br>We all know it takes years of practice to become a professional athlete and a price must be paid. However, we expect to be overnight successes in spiritual things.<br><br>Joseph Smith said,<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it,</i><br><br><i>you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ Jesus.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 151]<br><br>Please note he said, "You may grow into the principle of revelation." To become proficient in basketball one practices shooting countless shots. By repeating successful approaches and changing failures, the player gets the uncanny ability of knowing as soon as the ball leaves his hands whether the shot will be good or not.<br><br>In spiritual things we need to learn exactly when we have had a witness of the Spirit and be able to recognize a counterfeit thrown at us by Satan or self-imposed by our own ambition and desire. How many of you young men have told your girlfriends, "I have received a spiritual witness that you are to be my wife?" In some cases I would suggest that the witness is more a desire than a manifestation. If you receive that witness, put it to the test. Ask her to marry you. If she says yes, you were right. If she says no, you were wrong. But keep your witness to yourself. She is perfectly capable of receiving her own revelation--even if she hasn't been on a mission and you have.<br><br>What does a spiritual confirmation feel like? It's the feeling you have when you read the Book of Mormon. It's the feeling you have when you talk of heavenly things with your parents or a valued friend. Learn to recognize it. Learn to follow it.<br><h2><b>Only the Truth</b></h2><br>If it were possible, I would lay down a formula for instant and certain success. One of the reasons it is so hard to enjoy consistent success is that the variables change each day. We are in tune more on one day than on another. We are more emotionally vulnerable on one day than on another. Satan works harder on us on one day than on another. However, with all the variables there is one constant. The Spirit witnesses only the truth.<br><br>If your success ratio for recognizing the Spirit is low, ask yourself these questions:<br><br>1. How well am I living the commandments?<br><br>2. Am I studying the scriptures in order that I might be more attuned to spiritual things?<br><br>3. Am I praying with real intent?<br><br>4. Have I done my homework and gone to the Lord with a well thought-out solution?<br><br>5. Have I learned to recognize a stupor of thought?<br><br>6. Can I honestly say "thy will be done," and am I willing to take "no" for an answer?<br><br>Students, don't fail to invest adequate time learning things of the Spirit while at this university. I'm not speaking of required religion classes, although I heartily endorse them. I'm speaking of learning how to recognize and obtain revelation. It's a lifetime course, but you don't have to wait until graduation to receive benefits. The rewards are immediate. Close in on the elusive balance between intellectual pursuits and that of learning to recognize the promptings of the Spirit. There is a balance, and it is incumbent upon each of us to find it. I pray that you will be successful in your attempt to find the elusive balance and that you will be successful in learning to recognize the Spirit when you feel it. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Glenn L.

<h1>mith: “A Choice Seer” - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am aware that my wise and gentle friend Elder David B. Haight spoke about the Prophet Joseph a month ago. Please bear with me, therefore, as I seek to place the spotlight on the Seer in yet a different way on this Easter Sunday, during which our rejoicing is made more resplendent by the revelations and translations concerning Jesus that came to us through Joseph.<br><br>My appreciation is expressed to President Jeffrey Holland, Dean Robert Matthews, Professors Hugh Nibley, Jack Welch, Truman Madsen, Richard Anderson, Dean Jessee, and others for sharing knowledge with me that has been so helpful. These men do their part to slow the process of my becoming intellectually arthritic.<br><h2><b>The Prophet Joseph Smith</b></h2><br>Whenever we talk about the Prophet Joseph Smith, it is important to remember what he said of himself: "I never told you I was perfect; but there is no error in the revelations which I have taught" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 368). He was a good man, but he was called by a perfect Lord, Jesus of Nazareth! Joseph received his first counsel from God the Father, "This is My Beloved Son.Hear Him!" (JS--H 1:17). Joseph Smith listened carefully to Jesus then and ever after.<br><br>Ages ago in the Great Council, Jesus was the prepared but meek volunteer. As the Father described the plan of salvation and the need for a Savior, it was Jesus who stepped forward and said humbly but courageously, "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27; see also Moses 4:2). Never has anyone offered to do so much for so many with so few words!<br><br>It is through the Prophet Joseph Smith, whom the resurrected Jesus called, that we learn these things, and so much more, about Jesus--long before Bethlehem and well beyond Calvary. Whenever we speak of the Prophet Joseph Smith, therefore, it should be in reverent appreciation of the Lord who called him and whom Joseph served so well.<br><br>From Joseph Smith, one unlearned and untrained in theology, more printed pages of scripture have come down to us than from any other mortal--in fact, as President Holland has pointed out, more than the combined pages, as available at present, from Moses, Paul, Luke, and Mormon.<br><br>But it is not only a matter of impressive quantity, it is also a qualitative matter, since dazzling doctrines came through the Prophet, including key doctrines previously lost from the face of the earth, a loss that caused people to "stumble exceedingly" (1 Nephi 13:34). "Plain and precious" things, because of faulty transmission, were "kept back" or "taken away" (see 1 Nephi 13:34, 39–40), and thus do not appear in our treasured Holy Bible.<br><br>What came<i>through</i>Joseph Smith was<i>beyond</i>Joseph Smith, and it<i>stretched</i>him! In fact, the doctrines that came through that "choice seer" (2 Nephi 3:6–7) by translation or revelation, are often so light-intensive that, like radioactive materials, they must be handled with great care!<br><br>By the way, it appears that in the process of translating the Book of Mormon in the spring of 1829, Joseph was moving along at the rate of seven to ten current printed pages a day. This is but one illustration of how blessed that "choice seer" was. Although Joseph could translate the words of the Book of Mormon, "The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them" refers to a mind-set that is with us to this day, belonging to more than Professor Anthon (see 2 Nephi 27:20 and JS--H 1:64–65). In contrast, among an increasing number of mortals, Joseph is, as foreseen, "esteemed highly" (2 Nephi 3:7).<br><br>In 1833 Joseph was told not only that Jesus was with God premortally, but that:<br><br><i>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:29]<br><br>What a stunning parting of the curtains so that man could have a correct view of himself! The silence of centuries was officially broken. As the morning of the Restoration began to break, the shadows of false doctrines began to flee. Man's view of himself could become clearer, unimpeded by the overhanging of "original sin." We are accountable to a just God for our actual and individual sins--not for Adam's original transgression.<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto Adam: Behold I have forgiven thee thy transgression in the Garden of Eden.</i><br><br><i>Hence came the saying abroad among the people, that the Son of God hath atoned for original guilt, wherein the sins of the parents cannot be answered upon the heads of the children, for they are whole from the foundation of the world.</i>[Moses 6:53–54; see also D&amp;amp;C 93:38 and Articles of Faith 1:2]<br><br>A stretching view of the universe was also made possible. Note what accompanied a wondrous witnessing of the resurrected Jesus:<br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--</i><br><br><i>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:23–24]<br><br>In June 1830 came "this precious morsel," which expands our perspective about this planet, described by Maimonides as "a speck among the worlds" (see Hugh Nibley,<i>Old Testament and Related Studies</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986], p.139).<br><br><i>And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.</i>. . .<br><br><i>For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</i>[Moses 1:33, 39]<br><br>Even as our view of the universe was greatly enlarged, our view of human history was made much more intimate and familial:<br><br><i>Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called .</i>. .<i>the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto him: I have set thee to be at the head; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and thou art a prince over them forever.</i><br><br><i>And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation.</i><br><br><i>These things were all written in the book of Enoch, and are to be testified of in due time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:53–57]<br><br>This startling and informing revelation came, by the way, in the midst of verses otherwise concerned with chronologies, genealogies, and duties.<br><br>Let others, if they choose, make jokes about our first parents, Adam and Eve, or regard them as mere myths. As a result of the Prophet Joseph Smith's revelations, we are blessed to know much more about "things as they really were, are, and will be" (see Jacob 4:13 and D&amp;amp;C 93:24)!<br><br>Latter-day Saints expectantly await the book of Enoch as being among the "many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God" that God "will yet reveal" (Articles of Faith 1:9). As Professor Robert Matthews has observed, through Joseph Smith we received eighteen times as much as is in the Bible concerning Enoch. Without the Restoration, we would not even know there was a City of Enoch!<br><br>While others wonder if their mortal existence is absurd and pointless, we know otherwise about God's purposes, which he described before declaring, "This is the plan of salvation unto all men" (Moses 6:57–63). The process is a stern test:<br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i>[Abraham 3:25]<br><br><i>Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.</i>[Mosiah 23:21]<br><br>How marvelous it is that these and so many other precious truths, just as prophesied, are "had again" among the children of men (Moses 1:41). No wonder there can and should be times for openly<i>enjoying</i>the faith as well as<i>defending</i>the faith.<br><br>These restored truths came fully formed. Joseph Smith did not receive such truths through Solomon Spaulding, Ethan Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, or any others to be advanced by those desperate for any explanation other than the correct one. In 1850 Joseph's devoted helper, Phineas Young, wrote to Brigham Young in praise of Oliver Cowdery. Phineas wrote that the rebaptized Oliver Cowdery was now dead, but no one should forget his last testimony in which he said of Church headquarters in the West, "There was no salvation but in the valley and through the priesthood there." Oliver knew the source of the truths and priesthood which were restored through Joseph and the later<i>locus</i>of the presiding priesthood power. (see Phineas Young to Brigham Young, April 25, 1850, Brigham Young Collection, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)<br><br>There is a legal doctrine meaning "the thing speaks for itself." The Everest of ecclesiastical truth built from the translations and revelations of the Prophet Joseph Smith speaks for itself as it towers above the foothills of philosophy. Even so, most will ignore it. Still others will reject the Restoration, supplying their own alternative explanations, just as some did who once heard thunder instead of the voice of God (see John 12:27–30). However, in a happy day ahead, "They that murmured shall learn doctrine" (Isaiah 29:24; 2 Nephi 27:35). This suggests that doctrinal illiteracy is a significant cause of murmuring among Church members.<br><br>The Restoration responds resoundingly and reassuringly to the key human questions and provides the firm framework of our faith. Do we actually live in an unexplained and unexplainable universe? Is there really purpose and meaning to human existence? Why such unevenness in the human condition? Why so much human suffering?<br><br>The marvelous truths of the Restoration respond to these questions and are highly global, highly personal, and even galactic in their dimensions! Identity exists amid immensity. We are enclosed in divine purposes! There is no need for despair! No wonder the restored gospel is such "good news."<br><br>These and other revelations came to us through an inspired prophet, Joseph Smith. His spelling left something to be desired, but how he provided us with the essential grammar of the gospel!<br><h2><b>The Restoration</b></h2><br>Our present appreciation of the restored gospel lags embarrassingly far behind the stretching significance of its doctrines and theology. So far as our exploring the terrain of truth opened up to us by the Prophet Joseph is concerned, we have barely reached the Platte River, and it is time for us as a people to move on!<br><br>The Prophet is that "choice seer" of whom ancient Joseph spoke (2 Nephi 3:6–11), a major spiritual benefactor of the world. His salvational impact ultimately will be enormous, as the demographics of this dispensation alone assure (see D&amp;amp;C 135:3).<br><br>Like another prophet, Joseph served "notwithstanding [his] weakness" (2 Nephi 33:11). "Out of [Joseph's] weakness he [was] made strong" (2 Nephi 3:13). At one point, when he was translating the fourth chapter of 1 Nephi, Emma was acting as his scribe. Joseph reportedly encountered the words about the wall around Jerusalem (see 1 Nephi 4:5). He apparently paused and asked Emma if, in fact, there was a wall around Jerusalem. She replied in the affirmative. Joseph hadn't known (see<i>The History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,</i>1896, reprint [Independence, Missouri: Board of Publication, 1967], 4:447). According to Emma, when she and Joseph were interrupted during his translating, Joseph would later resume on the very sentence from which he had left off (see<i>Saints Herald,</i>1 October 1879, pp. 289–90; see also Parley P. Pratt,<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938], p. 62).<br><br>We naturally would like to know about that process of translation. In October 1831,Joseph Smith was asked by his brother Hyrum, at a conference held in Orange, Ohio, to give a firsthand account concerning the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. The Prophet replied "that it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon; and. . . it was not expedient for him to relate these things" (<i>HC</i>1:220). Since Joseph, who knew the "particulars," chose not to describe them in detail then, we cannot presently be definitive about methodology. But we can and should savor the supernal substance of the revelations and translations, which combine to prove to the world "that the holy scriptures are true" (D&amp;amp;C 20: 11; see also 1 Nephi 13:39–40).<br><br>Joseph Smith's time and place was one of religious fervor: "Lo, here!" and "Lo, there!" is Christ (JS--H 1:5). Ours is an age when, instead, the historicity of Christ is increasingly questioned. This condition only increases the relevance of the Restoration with its affirmation of Jesus' reality and his resurrection.<br><br>While Jesus declared that the scriptures "testify" of him (John 5:39), he neither expected nor received much coverage in secular history. Therefore, it is no surprise for studious Christians to learn that the secular history of that meridian period is nearly silent about the ministry of Jesus. Three secular writers, each writing after Jesus' crucifixion, touched slightly upon Christ. Tacitus (about A.D. 55–117), thought by many to be the greatest Roman historian, wrote only this: "Christus . . . had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilatus"<i>(Annals of Tacitus</i>15:44).<br><br>Suetonius (about A.D. 70–140), a Roman who wrote about the lives of various Caesars, called Jesus "Chrestus" and provided a sentence linking Chrestus to civil disturbance. Yet even this brief mention may contain a possible chronological error. (see<i>The Lives of the Caesars,</i>trans. J. C. Rolfe [Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1914], 5:51–52).<br><br>Josephus (about A.D. 37–95), in his<i>Antiquities,</i>wrote a few lines about the founder of Christianity, but later interpolations may cloud his meager lines (see, for example, 18:3). How important it is, given these conditions, that the New Testament not stand alone as evidence for Christ!<br><br>Joseph Smith was also an eyewitness of the resurrected Christ. Yet, as with all true disciples, Joseph went through a process of<i>proving, reproving,</i>and<i>improving,</i>while simultaneously serving as the human conduit through whom God chose to give his word to this generation (D&amp;amp;C 5:10).<br><br>The period of adversity commencing in Richmond Jail and continuing in Liberty Jail from 1 December 1838 until the first week in April 1839 provides a special window through which we can see the process of revelation and personal consolidation under way. Elder B. H. Roberts called the jail the "prison temple" (B. H. Roberts,<i>A Comprehensive History of the Church</i>[Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1930], 1:526). Ironically, this period of enforced idleness, grim though the conditions were, was perhaps the only time in the Prophet's often hectic adult life when there was much time for reflection.<br><br>The dungeon at Liberty Jail had inner and outer walls which, combined, were four feet thick. Loose rocks were placed between the walls to thwart any attempt at burrowing through. Unjustly arrested and unjustly confined, Joseph and his companions tried twice to escape but failed. As thick as those walls and that door were, and as securely as they kept the Prophet and his fellow prisoners in, the walls were not thick enough to keep revelation out!<br><br>During his stay in Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith received some of the most sublime revelations ever received by any prophet in any dispensation, known now as sections 121 and 122 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Therein are divine tutorials by which the Lord schooled his latter-day prophet--probably the most tender tutorials in all of holy writ now available.<br><h2><b>A Special Relationship</b></h2><br>Joseph Smith was probably first made intellectually aware of the special relationship he had with ancient Joseph, whom we commonly refer to as Joseph in Egypt, when the Prophet Joseph translated the third chapter of 2 Nephi. It was not until Liberty Jail, however, that the record indicates any public affirmation of this unusual relationship. In one of his last letters from Liberty Jail, Joseph wrote, "I feel like Joseph in Egypt" (<i>The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith,</i>comp. Dean C. Jessee [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1984], p. 409). It was not an idle comparison, for it reflected an important verse in the third chapter of 2 Nephi. Ancient Joseph spoke of the latter-day seer, saying, "And he shall be like unto me" (2 Nephi 3:15).<br><br>When Joseph Smith, Jr., was given a blessing by Father Smith in December 1834, an extensive portion of that blessing informed modern Joseph of his special relationship to ancient Joseph (see Joseph Smith, Sr., blessing, 9 Dec. 1934, Church Historical Department, 1:3–4).<br><br>The comparisons between the two Josephs, of course, reflect varying degrees of exactitude, but they are, nevertheless, quite striking. Some similarities are situational, others are dispositional. Some are strategic, such as ancient Joseph's making stored grain available in time of famine (see Genesis 41:56), while modern Joseph opened the granary of the gospel after years of famine.<br><br>First, both Josephs had inauspicious beginnings. Initially, they were unlikely candidates to have had the impact they did on Egyptian history and American history, respectively.<br><br>Both had visions at a young and tender age (see Genesis 37:2–5 and JS--H 1). The visions brought to both men hate from their fellowmen (see Genesis 37:5–8 and JS--H 1:21–26). Both knew sibling jealousy. Modern Joseph had to contend with a mercurial brother, William, whom Joseph forgave many times (see HC 2:353–54).<br><br>Both Josephs were generous to those who betrayed them. Ancient Joseph was generous to his once-betraying brothers whom he later saved from starvation (see Genesis 45:1–15).<br><br>Both prophesied remarkably of the future of their nations and the challenges their governments would face (see Genesis 41:29–31 and D&amp;amp;C 87).<br><br>They both knew what it was to be falsely accused, and they both were jailed.<br><br>Both, in their extremities, helped others who shared their imprisonment, but who later forgot their benefactors. In the case of ancient Joseph, it was the chief butler (see Genesis 40:20–23). Joseph Smith worried over an ill cell mate, Sidney Rigdon, who was freed in January 1839. The Prophet rejoiced. Three months later, the Prophet inquired "after Elder Rigdon if he has not forgotten us" (<i>Writings,</i>p. 399).<br><br>Both Josephs were torn from their families, although ancient Joseph suffered through this for a much, much longer time.<br><br>Very significantly, both were "like unto" each other in being amazingly resilient in the midst of adversity. This, in each man, is a truly striking quality.<br><br>Both were understandably anxious about their loved ones and friends. Ancient Joseph, when his true identity became known, inquired tenderly of his brothers, "Doth my father yet live?" (Genesis 45:3). From Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph Smith, with comparative awareness, wrote, "Doth my friends yet live if they live do they remember me?" (<i>Writings,</i>p. 409).<br><br>Indeed, these two uncommon men had much in common, being truly "like unto" each other!<br><h2><b>In the Prison Temple</b></h2><br>The "prison temple" involved a time of obscurity, adversity, irony, and testimony. W. W. Phelps had briefly faltered, being part of the betrayals that had placed Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. Joseph was, at the time, indignant over Brother Phelps' failures. Yet later on, Joseph was generous. The next year, 1840, when W. W. Phelps pled for readmission into the Church, Joseph Smith, who pledged from jail to act later "in the spirit of generosity," wrote a powerful and redemptive letter, the closing lines of which were, "Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, For friends at first, are friends again at last" (<i>HC</i>4:164; see also pp. 162–63).<br><br>No wonder a grateful Brother Phelps, soon after Joseph's June 1844 martyrdom, wrote the text "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 27).<br><br>The ironies in Liberty Jail are many. Though deprived of his constitutional rights, Joseph Smith therein praised the glorious U.S. Constitution. Then, after the misery of Missouri, Joseph declared with inspired anticipation:<br><br><i>I am willing to be sacrificed . . . maintaining the laws &amp;amp; Constitution of the United States if need be for the general good of mankind.</i>[Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, comps. and eds.,<i>The Words of Joseph Smith</i>(Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980), p. 320]<br><br>While being grossly abused by some biased political, judicial, and military leaders who wrongly used their powers Joseph received a glorious revelation. A sizable portion of that revelation, D&amp;amp;C 121, contrastingly sets forth the style and substance the Lord wants from his leaders that diverges so sharply from the ways of the world (see D&amp;amp;C 121:34–46).<br><br>Though Joseph was jailed nearly five months, more than four of these in Liberty Jail, he was told by the tutoring Lord that these things shall be "but for a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 122:4; see also D&amp;amp;C 121:7). Though Joseph was suffering, the Lord reminded him that he was not suffering as much as Job had (see D&amp;amp;C 121:7–11). Only the Lord can compare crosses, and on that particular occasion he did (D&amp;amp;C 122:8).<br><br>The conditions in Liberty Jail were grim. The food was scanty and often consisted of leftovers from the jailer's table brought to them in a basket where chickens slept at night and which was often not cleaned. When the prisoners were permitted to cook, they had to endure smoke. It was also a particularly cold winter. The constant darkness bothered the prisoners' eyes. Joseph wrote about how his hand actually trembled as he penned his next-to-last letter to Emma (see<i>Writings,</i>p. 409).<br><br>In the midst of this stark obscurity and incessant difficulty, and with twelve thousand of Joseph's followers driven from the state of Missouri, the enemies of the Church probably felt that they had destroyed Joseph's work. Yet in the midst of all this deprivation, affliction, and obscurity, Joseph received the Lord's stunning assurance that "the ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name" (D&amp;amp;C 122:1).<br><br>How inspired and audacious a prophecy for any religious leader, let alone one on the obscure nineteenth-century American frontier. Meanwhile, Joseph's contemporary frontier and religious leaders have since become mere footnotes to history. But not Joseph!<br><br>Joseph, earlier in his imprisonment, had special assurances of which he later wrote,<br><br><i>Death stared me in the face, and . . . my destruction was determined upon, as far as man was concerned; yet, from my first entrance into the camp,</i>. . .<i>that still small voice, which has</i>so<i>often whispered consolation to my soul, in the depth of sorrow and distress, bade me be of good cheer, and promised deliverance, which gave me great comfort. [Writings</i>(November 1839), p. 443]<br><br>However, Joseph was not unmindful or unaware of how grim things looked. With unusual empathy he observed from his prison temple: "Those who have persecuted us and smitten us and borne false witness against us . . . do seem to have a great triumph over us for the present"; then, "[But] Zion shall yet live though she seemeth to be dead" (<i>Writings,</i>pp. 375, 382).<br><br>It was from Liberty Jail that Joseph, more than once, testified that through God "we received the Book of Mormon"<i>(Writings,</i>p. 399), "that the Book of Mormon is true," and "that the ministering angels sent forth from God are true" (<i>Writings,</i>p. 407).<br><br>It was soon after his release from Liberty Jail that the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke about how the Book of Mormon was "the keystone of our religion" (<i>HC</i>4:461).<br><br>After the Liberty Jail experience, the Prophet gave fervent public testimony about the Book of Mormon to a congregation of about three thousand in Philadelphia. When Sidney Rigdon, in his remarks on that same occasion, seemed to neglect the Book of Mormon in favor of citing the Bible, Joseph took the pulpit and declared, "If nobody else had the courage to testify of so glorious a message from Heaven, and of the finding of so glorious a record, he felt to do it" (<i>Words,</i>p. 45). The atmosphere, according to one present, was electric.<br><br>This is not to say that Joseph had not earlier been clear and declarative regarding the Book of Mormon. For instance, in an 1834 sermon, Joseph observed, "Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion?" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 71).<br><br>Sharing the jail with Joseph was his brother Hyrum, ever faithful at Joseph's side. We have yet to pay Hyrum his due. Alas, we have little from his pen, but his actions spoke for him. However, on 16 March 1839, he wrote from Liberty Jail to a Sister Grinnal who was nursing Hyrum's wife, Mary Fielding, to his daughter, Lovina, and to a girl, Clarrinda. To Clarrinda he wrote:<br><br><i>Let mother give you one of the Books of Mormon &amp;amp; write your name in it. I want you to seek every opportunity to read it through. Remember me both night and morning in your prayers.</i><br><br>To Lovina he wrote:<br><br><i>You may have my small Book of Mormon. You must try to read it through. Pray for your father that the Lord may help him to come home.</i>[Letter used with permission of Elder Eldred G. Smith, in whose possession it is.]<br><br>In the extremity of jail, Hyrum, so much at the center of things, joined Joseph in stressing the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Significantly, Joseph was released from the bondage of Liberty Jail 6 April 1839, and a few days later was allowed to escape from his captors. As you know, April 6 is the date of Jesus' birth. It is also the date of birth of his latter-day church (D&amp;amp;C 20:1). Additionally, the time of Joseph's release from the bondage of jail is often part of the season of Passover when our Jewish friends celebrate ancient Israel's deliverance and subsequent release from bondage in Egypt.<br><br>By the way, after Jesus' ascension when Herod "stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church," he killed James, the brother of John, with a sword. When Herod saw the people's approval, he had Peter imprisoned, thinking to bring him to the people after Easter. But Peter was helped by the Lord to escape from prison during this same spring season (see Acts 12:1–5). Easter time is filled with rich remembrances.<br><br>The day the Prophet Joseph ended his bondage in Liberty Jail, 6 April 1839, involved yet another significant event. Heber C. Kimball recorded in his journal that on that day<br><br><i>the following words came to my mind, and the Spirit said unto me, "write," which I did by taking a piece of paper and writing on my knee as follows:</i>. . .<i>"Verily I say unto my servant Heber, thou art my son, in whom I am well pleased for thou art careful to hearken to my words, and not transgress my law, nor rebel against my servant Joseph Smith, for thou has a respect to the words of mine anointed, even from the least to the greatest of them; therefore thy name is written in heaven, no more to be blotted out for ever, because of these things.</i>" [<i>Words,</i>p. 18]<br><br>Note how much importance the Lord attached to our being loyal to his servants! It is no different now.<br><br>With regard to the ministry of Joseph Smith, there are significant expressions of divine determination. In each of these examples, the Lord issued his declarations using the word "shall." The books of scripture that were to come through the "choice seer"<i>"shall</i>grow together" (2 Nephi 3:11–12; emphasis added). The books of scripture that came through Joseph Smith are joined with the Holy Bible, especially now with the new recent publication of the four standard works.<br><br>Another promise was given in the same chapter: those who would try to destroy the work of the latter-day seer<i>"shall</i>be confounded" (2 Nephi 3:14; emphasis added). This promise continues to be kept.<br><br>Joseph also received another<i>shall</i>promise, which likewise has never been revoked: "Thy people<i>shall</i>never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors" (D&amp;amp;C 122:3; emphasis added). This continues to be true today.<br><br>Furthermore, the central tutorial theme in Liberty Jail was also a promise: "All these things<i>shall</i>give thee experience, and<i>shall</i>be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7; emphasis added).<br><br>Joseph Smith, Jr., was that "choice seer!" All the "shall" promises about him shall be fulfilled, as the "ends of the earth shall inquire after [his] name" (D&amp;amp;C 122:1).<br><h2><b>A Choice Seer</b></h2><br>Brigham Young, who was not easily impressed by anyone, observed that before he met Joseph Smith, he was searching for just such a seer:<br><br><i>The secret feeling of my heart was that I would be willing to crawl around the earth on my hands and knees, to see such a man as was Peter, Jeremiah, Moses, or any man that could tell me anything about God and heaven.</i>. . .<br><br>. . .<i>When I saw Joseph Smith, he took heaven, figuratively speaking, and brought it down to earth; and he took the earth, brought it up, and opened up, in plainness and simplicity, the things of God; and that is the beauty of his mission.</i>[<i>JD</i>8:228, 5:332]<br><br>On another occasion, Brigham said, "I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith" (<i>JD</i>3:51). Significantly, Brigham's last mortal words were, "Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!" (Leonard J. Arrington,<i>Brigham Young: American Moses</i>[New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1985], p. 399).<br><br>We have obligations to the Lord's prophets, past and present, which include being fair, posthumously or presently, concerning their words. The "choice seer," Joseph, reminded the Church in an epistle (December 1838) from jail that, "our light speeches from time to time. . . have nothing to do with the fixed principle of our hearts" (<i>Writings,</i>p. 376). Should we not distinguish between the utterances of the moment and considered opinions? Do not all of us wish for that same understanding on the part of our friends, hoping they, "with the breath of kindness," will "blow the chaff away"?<br><br>We are wise to follow, therefore, the example of Lorenzo Snow rather than that of Thomas B. Marsh. Marsh let himself become so preoccupied with the imperfections in the Prophet Joseph Smith that he found himself disaffected and out of the Church for a season. Lorenzo Snow said he had observed some imperfections in the Prophet Joseph Smith, but his reaction was that it was marvelous to see how the Lord could still use Joseph. Seeing this, Lorenzo Snow--later President Snow--concluded that there might even be some hope for him!<br><br>One of the great messages that flows from the Lord's use of Joseph Smith as a "choice seer" in the latter days is that there is indeed hope for each of us! The Lord can call us in our weaknesses and yet magnify us for his purposes.<br><br>In the 1834 blessing, Father Smith promised Joseph, "Thou shalt fill up the measure of thy days" (Joseph Smith, Sr., blessing, pp. 3–4). The Lord likewise reassured the Prophet in Liberty Jail, "Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less" (D&amp;amp;C 122:9). It proved to be so. However, the Prophet was conscious of the pressures of time upon him. President Brigham Young, who visited Joseph in the prison temple, noted that Joseph told him, more than once, that he, Joseph, would not live to see his fortieth year<i>(Wilford Woodruff's Journal,</i>July 28, 1844 [Salt Lake City: Kraut's Pioneer Press, 1982]).<br><br>In the 1834 blessing, Joseph was promised that during his ministry, "Thy heart shall be enlarged" (Joseph Smith, Sr., blessing, pp. 3–4). An enlarged Joseph wrote from Liberty Jail,<br><br><i>It seems to me my heart will always be more tender after this than ever it was before.</i>. .<i>for my part I think I never could have felt as I now do if I had not suffered the wrongs that I have suffered.</i>[<i>Writings,</i>pp. 386, 387]<br><br>In the 1834 blessing, the Prophet Joseph was promised, "Thou shalt like to do the work the Lord thy God shall command thee" (Joseph Smith, Sr., blessing, pp. 3–4). How often that intrinsic satisfaction sustained the Seer, when extrinsic conditions were so unsatisfactory!<br><br>On 4 April 1839, Joseph wrote his last letter to Emma from Liberty Jail "just as the sun [was] going down" while peeking through the "grates of this lonesome prison. . . with emotions known only to God" (<i>Writings,</i>p. 425). Such was Joseph's view of a temporal sunset that evening. But what a view of eternity he had and gave to us!<br><br>Joseph, as B. H. Roberts wrote, lived "in crescendo!" Looking back upon his busy, task-filled years, the Prophet said near the end, "No man knows my history. I cannot tell it: I shall never undertake it. I don't blame anyone for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself" (<i>HC</i>6:317). Thus, even in his adversity, Joseph had unusual empathy for those who lacked his special perspective.<br><br>This empathy extended beyond Joseph's own time and circumstances. He actually saw his prison sufferings as helping and expanding him "to understand the minds of the Ancients"<i>(Writings,</i>p. 387). A linkage was felt with their "afflictions," so that, said Joseph, "in the day of judgment . . . we may hold an even weight in the balances with them" (<i>Writings,</i>p. 395). How else could Joseph take his rightful place, "crowned in the midst of the prophets of old" (<i>Hymns;</i>1985, no. 27)?<br><br>I gladly and gratefully testify that Joseph was and is a "choice seer," a prophet of God!<br><h2><b>The Lord and His Servants</b></h2><br>Now may I close my message by bringing to the fore again, Jesus of Nazareth, who as the resurrected Lord and Savior called Joseph Smith. Let us focus on a particular part of the Atonement that makes the celebration of Easter possible.<br><br>A short while before Gethsemane and Calvary, Jesus prayed, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour." Then, as if in soliloquy, he said, "But for this cause came I unto this hour" (John 12:27). The awful weight of the Atonement had begun to descend upon him. We next find him in Gethsemane.<br><br><i>And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</i><br><br><i>And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy.</i>[Mark 14:32–33]<br><br>The Greek for "very heavy" is "depressed, dejected, in anguish." Just as the Psalmist had<br><br>foreseen, the Savior was "full of heaviness" (Psalms 69:20). The heavy weight of the sins of all mankind were falling upon him.<br><br>He had been intellectually and otherwise prepared from ages past for this task. He is the creator of this and other worlds. He knew the plan of salvation. He knew this is what it would come to. But when it happened, it was so much worse than even he had imagined!<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, this was not theater; it was the real thing. "And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him" (Mark 14:35). Only in the Gospel of Mark do we get this next special pleading, "And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me" (Mark 14:36). When Jesus used the word "Abba," it was a most personal and intimate familiar reference--the cry of a child in deepest distress for his father to help him in the midst of this agony.<br><br>Did Jesus hope there might be, as with Abraham, a ram in the thicket? We do not know, but the agony and the extremity were great. The sins and the grossness of all mankind were falling upon someone who was perfectly sinless, perfectly sensitive. This pleading to the Father included the doctrine he had taught in his ministry as Jehovah to Abraham and Sarah. "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" (Genesis 18:14). He had taught it in his mortal messiahship: "All things are possible to him that believeth" (Mark 9:23). Hence, this resounding plea. And then came that marvelous spiritual submissiveness: "Nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:36).<br><br>Luke wrote that at a particular point, an angel appeared to strengthen him. I do not know who that angel was, but what a great privilege to be at the side of the Son of God as he worked out the Atonement for the whole human family!<br><br>Jesus bled at every pore, and the bleeding started in Gethsemane. He was stretched to the limits. Later, when Jesus was on the cross, the Father, for reasons that are not completely apparent, withdrew his immediate presence from his son. The full weight fell upon him one last time, and there came the great soul cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34).<br><br>Through that marvelous Prophet Joseph, in the book of Alma, we learned that Jesus not only suffered for our sins, but, in order to perfect his capacity of mercy and empathy, he also bore our sicknesses and infirmities that he might know "according to the flesh" (see Alma 7:11–12) what we pass through and thus become the perfect shepherd, which he is.<br><br>This is Jesus' Church, and Joseph was his prophet, and all the prophecies pertaining to his second coming will be fulfilled just as surely as all pertaining to his birth and early ministry were fulfilled.<br><br>He is our Lord, he is our God, and the day will come, brothers and sisters, when the veil will be stripped away, and you and I will see the incredible, spiritual intimacy that prevails between the Lord and his servants. Moses in the Sinai before the Exodus was on an exceedingly high mountain with Jesus--Jehovah. Not many centuries later, on the Mount of Transfiguration, Moses was again with his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Someday we will see the interlacings of the lives of the Lord, his prophets, and our own. It is all part of Father in Heaven's glorious and wondrous plan of salvation--about which we know so much that matters through that remarkable Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! Praise to Jehovah for loving us and leading us and atoning for us. Praise to God the Father. Whenever we learn finally to love him, we must remember that he loved us first. Out of his love he has given to us this remarkable plan of salvation.<br><br>May God send us on our way with hearts brimming with joy for what we know. May we search the scriptures, follow their commandments, and rejoice in them. This is my prayer for myself and for you on this Easter evening, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A.

<h1> Promise: Our Time - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the music, the prayer, and the opportunity to be here with you tonight. Before this meeting I had the chance, along with my family, to visit with your stake presidencies, their wives, and a number of your leaders. I was struck with how much they care about you and the high hopes they have that I might be able to help you tonight. I can't do that, of course, unless I am given utterance by the power of the Holy Ghost. I hope you will add your faith to mine that I may be given that blessing.<br><br>You need to know I am deeply grateful that you are here and that you are giving me your attention. I know how rare attention is. You may have had the experience I have had of noticing that not very many people during a conversation listen carefully to the other person. Generally they are focusing on what they said last or what they will say next. Just think how remarkable it is, then, that you are sitting here, listening to me, with no hope that you can say anything, at least for the next thirty-five or forty minutes.<br><br>That offer of trust is all the more remarkable to me because I know something of the hurry and pressure you've felt today. Even though it is early in the term, you probably made a list, either on a scrap of paper or in your mind, with the title "Things to Do Today." Even with only a week into the term, you probably had more things on that list than you could hope to complete. You may have even subdivided the list, the way I do sometimes, into categories like "Things Nice to Do," and "Things I Must Do," or even "Emergency: Must Be Done Today." Somehow your being here made it through the list, and I am grateful.<br><br>Since I know something of the anxiety the pressure of time creates in your life, I would like to share with you what little I have learned in my life about how to handle that feeling of hurry. It could help you in your life.<br><h2><b>A Problem of the Heart</b></h2><br>It's important to be sure we agree on the nature of the problem. Time passes at a fixed rate and we can't store it. You can just decide what to do with it or not to do with it. Now, if you will look honestly at your own performance over the last few days, you will notice a paradox. At the very time you were making those lists, feeling hurried, wondering how you could get everything done, you were wasting time. That happens because your self-disgust at wasting time and the increasing fear of deadlines spur your list making. It may even inspire you to go out and buy another daily planner, thinking maybe that's the cure. But suppose your new and better planner listed some of the things you spend your time with, as if you wrote down what your actions were instead of your intentions. It might read like this: "Talk about cars with the guy I meet at the laundromat," or "Sleep through my alarm and miss my first class," or "Stay at a friend's house even though he turns on a degrading television show."<br><br>Even a moment's reflection will help you see that the problem of using your time well is not a problem of the mind but of the heart. It will only yield to a change in the very way we feel about time. The value of time must change for us. And then the way we think about it will change, naturally and wisely.<br><br>That change in feeling and in thinking is combined in the words of a prophet of God in this dispensation. It was Brigham Young, and the year was 1877, and he was speaking at April general conference. He wasn't talking about time or schedules or frustrations with too many demands upon us. Rather, he was trying to teach the members of the Church how to unite themselves in what was called the united order. The Saints were grappling with the question of how property should be distributed if they were to live the celestial law. In his usual direct style, he taught the people that they were having trouble finding solutions because they misunderstood the problem. Particularly, he told them they didn't understand either property or the distribution of wealth. Here is what he said:<br><br><i>With regard to our property, as I have told you many times, the property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same. This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father; all the rest is what he may be pleased to add unto us. To direct, to counsel and to advise in the disposition of our time, pertains to our calling as God's servants, according to the wisdom which he has given and will continue to give unto us as we seek it.</i>[<i>JD</i>18:354]<br><br>Time is the property we inherit from God, along with the power to choose what we will do with it. President Young calls the gift of life, which is time and the power to dispose of it, so great an inheritance that we should feel it is our capital. The early Yankee families in America taught their children and grandchildren some rules about an inheritance. They were always to invest the capital they inherited and live only on part of the earnings. One rule was "Never spend your capital." And those families had confidence the rule would be followed because of an attitude of responsibility toward those who would follow in later generations. It didn't always work, but the hope was that inherited wealth would be felt a trust so important that no descendent would put pleasure ahead of obligation to those who would follow. Now, I can see and hear Brigham Young, who was as flinty a New Englander as the Adams or the Cabots ever hoped to be, as if he were leaning over this pulpit tonight. He would say something like this, with a directness and power I wish I could approach: "Your inheritance is time. It is capital far more precious than any lands or stocks or houses you will ever get. Spend it foolishly, and you will bankrupt yourself and cheapen the inheritance of those that follow you. Invest it wisely, and you will bless generations to come."<br><br>There is more than one way to spend time foolishly, as you know. You may sleep it away or play it away. But the real bankruptcy, the bankruptcy that will cheat all those who come after you, comes after the idleness and the thoughtless seeking for thrills. When you choose to see or hear filth portrayed, for instance, you may at first feel you have just spent some time. But if you persist, you will find that beyond time wasted you have allowed Satan to draw you toward sin and then into it. And then you will have incurred debts far beyond the time spent, debts that will burden and diminish every minute of existence that follows, unless and until you find the healing balm of the atonement of Jesus Christ through repentance, which takes pain, and time--sometimes a great deal of time and sometimes a great deal of pain.<br><h2><b>Your Royal Inheritance</b></h2><br>Oh, what Brigham Young would want for you, and what I pray you may have, is a heart that wants to invest your inheritance--time. There is a spiritual reality that, if you can see and know it is real, will not only lift your heart to invest your time wisely, but will lead you to do it well.<br><br>It's worth doing, not only because you have life ahead, but because you have eternity ahead as well. You might say, "Wait a minute, now. Surely the problem of investing time is just a problem for this life. Surely one reward for investing my time well here will be to be freed of that concern there." Well, here is one report suggesting your reward for investing your inheritance well here will be to get to do it forever. President Wilford Woodruff gave this report in general conference in 1896.<br><br><i>Joseph Smith continued visiting myself and others up to a certain time, and then it stopped. The last time I saw him was in heaven. In the night vision I saw him at the door of the temple in heaven. He came to me and spoke to me. He said he could not stop to talk with me because he was in a hurry. The next man I met was Father Smith; he could not talk with me because he was in a hurry. I met half a dozen brethren who had held high positions on earth, and none of them could stop to talk with me because they were in a hurry. I was much astonished. By and by I saw the Prophet again and I got the privilege of asking him a question.</i><br><br><i>"Now," said I, "I want to know why you are in a hurry? I have been in a hurry all my life; but I expected my hurry would be over when I got into the kingdom of heaven, if I ever did."</i><br><br><i>Joseph said: "I will tell you, Brother Woodruff. Every dispensation that has had the priesthood on the earth and has gone into the celestial kingdom has had a certain amount of work to do to prepare to go to the earth with the Savior when he goes to reign on the earth. Each dispensation has had ample time to do this work. We have not. We are the last dispensation, and so much work has to be done, and we need to be in a hurry in order to accomplish it."</i><br><br><i>Of course, that was satisfactory, but it was new doctrine to me.</i>[<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 288-89]<br><br>Where did that feeling of hurry come from? It came from a confidence built from investing time as if it were precious to us, to God, and to God's children. If you will listen carefully, you will feel that as you remember the words of a living prophet.<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson described who you are in the priesthood session of conference less than a month ago. For a moment he addressed himself to the Aaronic Priesthood boys, but he was talking to all of you, and to me. Did you listen and feel it, or did you pay little attention because he used almost the same words prophets have used since the Prophet Joseph? That's a hazard, by the way. Because prophets speak for God, and because God is consistent, they say the same things, over and over.<br><br>If you look for novelty, you will gain one of the great benefits of following a living prophet. For instance, prophets before Noah hadn't built arks, and it was important to heed the new message to get in it. But the people who didn't get in it were drowned because they laughed at the old message every prophet had repeated over and over since the days of Adam. It was simple and it was familiar. Here it is:<br><br><i>Hearken, and give heed unto my words;</i><br><br><i>Believe and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even as our fathers, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made manifest; and if ye do not this, the floods will come in upon you.</i>[Moses 8:23-24]<br><br>Those who survived recognized truth in a message as old as time. Without that, the novel message would have been of no worth. Can you see and feel the truth in these familiar words of President Benson about what your inheritance of time is worth? Listen to what he said, almost it seems in passing, as he began to speak. The words are close to those you've heard before.<br><br><i>Young men of the Aaronic Priesthood, you have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose. It is not by chance that you have been reserved to come to earth in this last dispensation of the fulness of times. Your birth at this particular time was foreordained in the eternities.</i><br><br><i>You are to be the royal army of the Lord in the last days. You are "youth of the noble birthright."</i>["To the 'Youth of the Noble Birthright',"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 43]<br><br>When I heard those words I thought of a boy with a noble birthright, but lacking what many of you have. He was born on November 22. Thirteen days later his father was buried. He was named and blessed by the bishop of his ward, Edwin Wooley. The name he was given by the bishop was Heber Jeddy Ivins Grant. Bishop Wooley said of the occasion, "I was only the instrument in the hands of his dead father ... in blessing him." The bishop later remarked, "Heber Grant is entitled to be one of the Apostles, and I know it" (<i>The Presidents of the Church,</i>ed. Leonard J. Arrington [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986], p. 212).<br><br>People then and since have called Heber J. Grant a "child of promise." He was. But his departed father didn't make the promises to the child. His Heavenly Father did. Your Heavenly Father did--the same Father who chose you to come into this time and place to hold, honor, and nurture those who hold his power.<br><br>Bishop Wooley felt Heber had a right to be an apostle, as his father had been. You have a right. You are a royal child of God, a child of promise, chosen from among many to be here and to have your royal inheritance, time in the fulness of times.<br><h2><b>Investing Our Time</b></h2><br>One young man changed forever my feelings about the value of this gift, and what it means to be a child of promise. Bob Allen was an undergraduate at Stanford University when I was his bishop. He left his schooling to serve a mission in Japan. He came back to school, took up his studies, and lived as many of you do, in a world of too many demands and too little time.<br><br>One day I was sitting at my desk in the graduate school of business at Stanford, head down, struggling with the blue books and papers that bear down on your professors as much as they do on you. The door was open into a hallway. It must have been late because the hall was dark, and I expected no one. Suddenly I sensed someone was standing motionless in the doorway. I looked up and saw two people. They were standing side-by-side, looking at me and smiling. I remember to this hour that their faces seemed to shine. Suddenly, Bob Allen stepped between them and, smiling as broadly as they were smiling, said, "These are two new bishops from Japan." They could speak little English, but I could tell they loved Bob Allen and, because of something he must have told them, they loved me.<br><br>After a few awkward minutes of trying to talk with them through Bob, they left. I thought then, as I have many times since, how remarkable it was that he had found time to spend days with those young men from Japan.<br><br>Within a few years I left Stanford for Idaho. I'd heard little of Bob, except that he had graduated from Stanford and had been accepted at the University of Utah medical school. Then I got a phone call from a Stanford friend. He told me Bob had been killed. He told me that Bob's parents would grant me the chance to say a few words at his funeral. Just before the service I met with friends, Bob's and mine. I asked to know more about how the accident had occurred.<br><br>Bob had been killed mountain climbing, climbing through clouds and storms to find a way of escape for his companions on the mountainside. I felt impressed to ask one who had been there, "What was he doing in camp on the climb?" He said Bob had taken his missionary lessons, in Japanese. He'd studied them again the night before his death. Now, of all the things you might decide to study at night, on a mountain-climbing trip, in the summer before medical school, why would you choose that? Well, I think I know why Bob did. I think he would have heard the words of President Benson and known they were true, the words he lived by: "You have been born at this time for a sacred and glorious purpose."<br><br>I spoke in a sacrament meeting in Tokyo ten years later. The person who introduced me mentioned I had been at Stanford. Two young people, a couple, rushed to me after the meeting and said, "Did you know Bob Allen? We love him." Just a few months ago I was in Tokyo again. Of all the excellent presentations made to me, one seemed most remarkable. I asked to see the man who made it. He was introduced, and then he said, "We have met before, at Stanford University." He was the young man, now older, who had stood with his fellow bishop in my office door. He told me about his life, and the life of the other man, now a great leader in Japan. In that moment I learned again, in my heart as well as in my head, what it means to have a royal inheritance of time, and how a child of promise who believes the promises can invest it--even just a little of it--to produce returns for eternity.<br><br>Because of that moment I've come to understand something that happened to me long ago. I must have been in my early teens. It was morning, because I can remember the light coming through the small basement window. And I was in a hurry, another sign of morning. I don't know whether I had been praying, but I felt, not heard, a voice. It was an impression, which I knew then was from God. It was this thought, and close to these words: "Someday, when you know who you really are, you will be sorry you didn't use your time better." I thought then that the impression was odd, since I thought I was using my time pretty well, and I thought I knew who I was. Now, years later, I am beginning to know who I am, and who you are, and why we will be so sorry if we do not invest our time well.<br><h2><b>One of the Covenant People</b></h2><br>Nephi saw us. He knew who we really are. Do you remember what he saw, recorded now in the fourteenth chapter of 1 Nephi? "And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few" (verse 12). Nephi knew that not many would have what we have, the gospel of Jesus Christ. But look at what else he saw, what else he knew about you and me:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.</i>[1 Nephi 14:14]<br><br>That's who you are. You are a child of promise, one of the covenant people in the last days. You've been given time, how much you don't know, in the period that Nephi saw. You not only have the promises, you know what they are, and you know when God offers a promise, and when you accept it on his terms, he always keeps his promises. You remember from another place in the Book of Mormon: "For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled" (Mormon 8:22).<br><br>One of the things that makes you a child of promise is that you know God's promises, and you know their purpose is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. You will invest your time wisely if you value the promises. And you will value the promises when they work in your life and in the lives of people you love. And they will work when you invest your time in accepting them and offering them to others. And real investment of time happens only with sustained effort motivated by faith.<br><br>You will gain confidence in your ability to invest your precious time well by gaining three other confidences. First, you must gain confidence that God keeps his promises. Second, you must gain God's confidence that you will always keep the promises, not that you choose to make but that he asks you to make. And third, you must help others gain confidence that God keeps his promises.<br><br>You can gain confidence that God keeps his promises by trying them. That's why I so appreciate those commandments to which God has attached an explicit promise. I see those commandments as schoolmasters. And I try to put them high on my list of things to do, because I know their value for changing my heart and building my power to invest my time. You probably did it today, perhaps unconsciously.<br><br>One of those commandments with promise came to the top of my list a week ago. I was in California, in a situation often the case when I am on assignments, when it appeared I would not have the opportunity to partake of the sacrament. I thought of the promises. And because I was not on a conference assignment and because I knew some ward schedules in the area, we got to the Palo Alto First Ward sacrament meeting.<br><br>I chose not to spend my time, but to invest it. When that young priest blessed the sacrament, I thought of John the Baptist and Joseph Smith. I thought of what it means to live in a time where the promise that young man made for me was authorized by God. He said if I remembered the Savior and kept his commandments, I would always have his Spirit to be with me. Because I made that promise in faith, and kept it, I've had a remarkable week. God kept his promise, made by his servant. I hope those two young men in the Palo Alto Ward know that God honored the promise they spoke. God knows who they really are, and so do I. I hope they do.<br><h2><b>Seeking the Kingdom First</b></h2><br>If President Benson has been successful in helping us sense who we are, there are a whole series of things you will be adding to the top of your lists of things to do, if they weren't already there. Reading the Book of Mormon thirty minutes a day, paying tithing, paying a fast offering, and keeping the Sabbath will all be there. And when you carry out those commitments with faith, you will quickly come to know that God keeps his promises.<br><br>Now, you might say, "But Brother Eyring, you've just made my problem worse. Now, I've added new tasks to my list and I've put them at the top. If my worry before was that I might fail in my work, now I'm even more worried. You know that at least some of the people I'll compete with when I get out of here will put work first and spiritual things last, or never. Will I always be second-rate in my work if I'm a child of promise?"<br><br>You can take comfort. Whenever I've had unusual success in a financial investment I've started with great partners. Although you are very much the junior partner, you have been invited to invest your time not alone but with God. Here is the promise he has made:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[Jacob 2:18-19]<br><br>That seems to me a remarkable promise and a reassurance. The requirement is that you seek God first. This evening there may be little time left when you're done with the studies some of you may have left to complete before the first class tomorrow. Suppose the first class is mathematics and you have a long problem set due. You may be tempted to try the straight spiritual approach--take no thought and hope you will be given a completed problem set in the hour you need it. I recommend against it--not that I doubt the ravens could deliver you the finished work, but there is a better way, as I read in the book of Jacob.<br><br>I'd go back to your room and start with the Book of Mormon. I'd read it long enough that I began to feel hope in Christ. For me, that always happens. Now, even though that is only a start toward obtaining the full hope in Christ spoken of in Jacob, some of the promise begins to work in me. My motives change. I start to want different things. I may even write a letter to someone I've thought of suddenly, or make a phone call. But I'm changed two ways. First, I've been moved to action, to read the Book of Mormon with real intent and then to try to serve God, and serve him well. And second, I'm determined to solve those math problems for the power learning can confer. It may not confer riches, but it will give me the power to liberate the captive. My sons who are here wish I'd sought a little harder, worked a few more problem sets, and been qualified now to administer relief to them as they are afflicted with their own math problem sets.<br><br>My experience has been that the promise in Jacob is true. When I have sought the kingdom first, I have been directed to seek other things later. And whatever intensity and singleness of heart I brought to my service to God has been extended into whatever else I have been led to seek. Seek seems to be the key word. That is a far cry from "put in your time." If you invest your time with faith and great energy, the promise by the Lord in Jacob is sure.<br><br>The fact that God promises our motives will be changed and shaped to better ends as a reward should also direct the way you invest your time. You know your lists of things to do may not even include tasks of the greatest importance to God. You may have had the experience, as I have had, to pray over alternative courses of action and be told the alternatives you are considering don't even address what really matters.<br><br>Now, you need to add tasks to your lists that will give God confidence you will keep the promises he asks of you, not that you choose for yourself. That could test you some, since you may have always favored the scripture that suggests you should do some things without being commanded. But even there, it's crucial to feel a desire that what you choose is what God would want, particularly when you are so important and rare a servant to him. You want his confidence in you as much as you need your confidence in him.<br><h2><b>Coming to Know His Will</b></h2><br>One of the great promises attached to prayer with real intent, scripture study, teaching the gospel, visiting the sick, and in all ways seeking God is that you come to know what he wants. If you invest long enough, you can qualify for perfect confidence from God. The scriptures describe that happening. Nephi, the son of Helaman, earned that promise and its fulfillment.<br><br>You remember that he and his brother, Lehi, left their positions to take up the ministry. And Nephi struggled and met rebuff, as some of you have. But he persevered. The Lord spoke to him when he was discouraged but still diligent:<br><br><i>And now, because thou has done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary, to my will.</i>[Helaman 10:5]<br><br>The promise to you and me in the last days is not that the power of God will be poured out on us to do whatever we think is best, but to do what is God's will. And the promise is that after seeking him and serving his children with unwearyingness, we will come to know his will. The promise is not just that I will have the power to do what's on my list of tasks, but that I will know what to put there. On those occasions when I have known what should be there, I've found myself glancing at it as a source of joy, not of anxiety.<br><h2><b>The Greatest of All Returns</b></h2><br>Finally, our capacity for investing time well will hinge on our desire to offer others the chance to gain confidence in the promises of God. We've talked about investing time, guided by the promises of God and by our wanting what he wants. What he wants is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man, so much of your time will be invested with the return to come to others. You can take that as a source of great optimism.<br><br>First, and perhaps less important, the returns finally do come back to you, particularly when you focus on giving instead of getting. You remember the promise in Luke:<br><br><i>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</i>[Luke 6:38]<br><br>But even better you have the promise of Abraham. That guarantees what in financial investments you'd call compounding. An investment compounds when every return goes to work, without your doing anything further to produce more returns. Offering the gospel has the same effect, because of the promise made to Abraham, and to you. Abraham was promised both that his seed would hear the gospel and that they would take it to others. Missionaries, mothers, and home teachers invest time that will compound forever.<br><br>Now you may object this way: "I go out and make my visits and call on people, but I don't see any results." Another latter-day prophet helped me with that. President David O. McKay said this:<br><br><i>Man is a spiritual being, a soul, and at some period of his life everyone is possessed with an irresistible desire to know his relationship to the Infinite.</i>...<i>There is something within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical and live in a higher and more beautiful world.</i>[<i>True to the Faith,</i>comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 244]<br><br>Even people who seem careless and uninterested in spiritual things will at some time reach out to know who they are and who God is and whether they are a child of God and whether there really are promises. You won't know when, but it will come.<br><br>Some of you have invested months and years trying to offer people you love the gospel of Jesus Christ--to people who have not yet accepted it. Take heart. Alma the Younger, when he came to the point of extremity, remembered the words of his father and it saved his eternal life. God may yet bless you with that greatest of all returns for the investment of your time, that the words of truth you spoke will be remembered in that moment of spiritual yearning by the person you loved enough to offer the most precious thing you ever received.<br><br>Well, we have talked about investing your inheritance, the time that God has given you, and the power you have to dispose of it wisely. Tonight and tomorrow and the next day you and I will ask God what to do with our time. I promise you that he will answer those prayers, because he is in need of servants to reach out to his children. Don't be surprised if he asks you to reach out to them with kindness and with the gospel of Jesus Christ. You can be confident that the promises he has made will be fulfilled. He will, through you, touch the hearts of others, if not always on the timetable you would choose. And they will then, in turn, be touched and reach out to others, multiplying the effects of your investment of time and effort and faith.<br><br>Now, I haven't solved the problem of your busy schedules. You will still feel you are in a hurry and you will still find yourself not reaching the end of every list. In fact, you may find your list changing and even growing larger. But you can have peace and confidence in your choices.<br><br>I pray you will feel that peace and that you will feel gratitude for having been blessed with the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, with living prophets, and with the sure promise of the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I pray you will have confidence in God's promises, gain his confidence, and offer to others the promises you have as a child of promise.<br><br>I bear you my testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith by the power of God restored all the ordinances and covenants that give direction and certitude to your lives. I bear you my testimony that Ezra Taft Benson is a living prophet of God. I am blessed to meet with him frequently, and I have felt the power of his prophetic calling. I pray we may have his sense of urgency to invest all of the time God may grant us in carrying out whatever task God may give us as his child of promise. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Henry B.

<h1>st—Focused Beatitudes - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
According to my dictionary the word "blessed" is a very positive adjective meaning "enjoying happiness," "enjoying the bliss of heaven," and "bringing pleasure or contentment." If these expressions are true, there is an apparent strong contradiction between the blessings we seek in today's success-oriented world and the blessings the Savior refers to in the eight beatitudes that open the great Sermon on the Mount. Blessed are the poor? Blessed are those who mourn? Blessed are the meek? Blessed are those who hunger and thirst? Blessed are those who are persecuted? These are startling and attention-grabbing contradictions. Who needs problems if these are blessings? These declarations are not quiet philosophical stars in a summer night. Rather, the Beatitudes of Christ are lightning bolts and thunder claps of spiritual surprise! Please review them with me as a list of Christ-like attributes we should each seek to develop.<br><br>The first beatitude in the Bible says,<i>"Blessed are the poor in spirit,</i>" and the Book of Mormon version adds,<i>"who come unto me."</i>We can all agree that being poor economically is not usually a desired blessing, but the Savior is talking about something entirely different. He is talking about humility and subjecting oneself to the Lord in all things. The most powerful scripture we have on this attitude is from Mosiah 3:19, where King Benjamin gives us a definition of the ideal latter-day saint as one who<br><br>. . .<i>becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i><br><br>In comparison to the Father, from whom all blessings flow, we are indeed poor in spirit--we are spiritual paupers, beggars even--and we must humble ourselves before God in every situation of life.<br><br>I would like to use a short version, as I remember it, of the famous Hugh B. Brown parable to illustrate submission. When he was young, President Brown had a nice yard in front of his home with a lawn, flowers, shrubs, fruit trees, and shade trees. There was a currant bush he had carefully trimmed to be in an attractive shape and to produce the best fruit. Noticing that it had started to branch out again, he went for the pruning shears. As he approached the currant bush, he seemed to hear it say, "Oh please, Mr. Gardener, don't cut me back, I'm just getting started and I want to be big like the shade trees."<br><br>President Brown responded, "No, my little bush. I am the gardener here and I have planted thee to be a source of fruit and an adornment in this part of my garden, and I am going to prune thee back to size."<br><br>Many years later President Brown was a full colonel in the Canadian forces in France in World War I. He could see the possibility of an illustrious military career. He wanted to become the first LDS general since Book of Mormon times. He was competent and well prepared. The next vacancy as a general should have been his, but when the vacancy occurred, he was called in by his superiors and told, "We are promoting someone else over you." In effect they were saying, "There has never been a Mormon general in his Majesty's Royal Forces and there probably never will be."<br><br>He retired to his quarters, crushed with disappointment, and knelt in prayer asking fervently, "Heavenly Father, why couldn't my prayers have been answered? Haven't I lived up to my covenants? Haven't I done everything I was supposed to do? Why? Why?"<br><br>And then he heard a voice, an echo from the past, saying, "I am the gardener here. You were not intended for what you sought to be." Humbled, President Brown then prayed for humility and patience to endure the pruning and to grow as the Lord would have him grow.<br><br>I translated that story for him on a tour of South America. He told me afterwards, "Bob, I know if I had continued in that direction I would never have developed the way the Lord wanted me to so I could eventually serve him as an apostle and in the First Presidency."<br><br>Yes, it is a desired virtue to be able to humble ourselves, to seek out God and come unto him in all humility, and to accept and overcome whatever tribulations and trials and testings that come into our lives. Yes, it is a blessing to become "poor in spirit before the Lord."<br><h2><b>Blessed Are They That Mourn: For They Shall Be Comforted</b></h2><br>I imagine that of all the Beatitudes, this would appear at first glance to be the most unusual and contradictory. At the least it is a very strong paradox. How can it be a blessing to be in mourning? To mourn is to show grief or pain at the death of a loved one. To mourn is much more profound than to just be sad. It is a deep, agonizing, penetrating, intense pain that cannot be hid from the world, nor from God, nor can it be eased, nor pacified, except with comfort and consolation from God through the Holy Ghost. Why would the Savior then say it is a blessing to mourn?<br><br>It may be that pain and suffering from the death of loved ones is really an essential and important part of our mortal experience, just like our own death is inevitable some day. There seem to come a maturity and a deeper dimension and a more profound understanding when we are left behind. The reality of death obliges us to face the question of the reality of the spirit world and the hope of the resurrection. It is through suffering that one discovers the difference between those things that are important and that which is unimportant in the eternal perspective.<br><br>It might be that it is a blessing to become more fully aware, through the death of a loved one, that God's ways are not our ways and that we must trust him in that fact. One of my favorite stories with roots in Islamic traditions illustrates that especially in death we need to look for the hidden purposes of the Lord, which, when understood, turn to comfort and blessings.<br><br>It seems that Moses, being in heaven, wondered about the work of a certain angel who was departing for earth. He asked the angel if he might accompany him on his errand. The angel responded, "Nay, thou wouldst not be able to stand that which thou wouldst see." Moses insisted, so the angel placed a condition. "No matter what thou wouldst see, thou must remain silent." Moses agreed and the two came to earth.<br><br>They left the borders of dry land and went far out over the sea, even beyond sight of land, where they found some humble fishermen in their boat fishing. The angel, unseen, broke the boards of the keel, the boat sank, and the fishermen drowned. Moses started to protest but the angel declared, "Thou must remain silent."<br><br>Next they came upon an Arab boy walking through the sands of the desert. Unseen, the angel breathed in the boy's face; his blood froze, and he fell to the earth, dead. Moses started to protest but the angel silenced him, "I told thee that thou wouldst not stand what thou wouldst see. Thou must remain silent."<br><br>Then the two came upon a poor home where lived a widow and her two sons. Their only means of survival was the produce from their small garden, protected against the wind and sands of the desert by a tall adobe wall. To Moses' surprise the angel pushed the wall over, crushing the vines, melons, and cucumbers, which the family sorely needed. Moses could not stand it any longer. He erupted. The angel silenced him and said, "Thou canst go with me no longer. Thou must return. But first, lest thou misjudge Allah who has sent me, I will explain. The fishermen would soon have been captured by a pirate boat approaching over the horizon, and been enslaved, tortured, and killed. This way they die in the profession they loved. The Arab boy would soon have fought with another mother's son, killing the latter. This way the second boy lives and this one dies blood guiltless. The widow's husband, before he died, hid a fortune in the base of the adobe wall. Now the boys, rebuilding the wall, will find the fortune, invest it wisely, and prosper. But thou didst doubt. Thou canst go with me no longer."<br><br>When we can see the Lord's purposes fulfilled in that which gives us sorrow, the Holy Ghost can give us full consolation, and the atonement and resurrection truly become to us the cornerstone of our faith. In the midst of mourning one discovers deeper dimensions of love, friendship, and brotherhood. In the midst of mourning, one determines if his faith is a social decoration or if it is an essential ingredient upon which his whole life is based. It is in the midst of mourning that one discovers the personal closeness of his Heavenly Father and his Savior Jesus Christ and the comfort of the Holy Ghost. As President McKay used to say, "Man's extremity is God's opportunity" (John Flavel [c. 1680], see Burton Stevenson, comp.,<i>The Home Book of Quotations</i>[New York: Dodd, Mead &amp;amp; Company, 1956], p. 1430). We will be blessed in mourning and be comforted as we reflect on eternal marriage, eternal families, eternal values.<br><h2><b>Blessed Are the Meek!</b></h2><br>In the greatest sermon ever preached the Savior declared, "Blessed are the meek for they shall<i>inherit</i>the earth," to which a modern skeptic has quipped, "That would be the only way the meek would get anything!"<br><br>I use that little bit of humor to illustrate that in today's fast-paced, success-oriented world, the quality of meekness is not universally admired. We don't usually think of successful executives as being meek, nor can we mentally accept the idea of a successful quarterback on a winning football team being meek. In fact, success in anything seems to involve quite the opposite of meekness.<br><br>Webster's dictionary gives two commonly accepted definitions of the word "meek":<br><br>(1) deficient in spirit and courage, and<br><br>(2) not . . . strong.<br><br>No way do I want to be looked upon as, nor can I imagine myself as being "deficient in spirit and courage." Those are negative attributes that I want no part of--likewise, "not . . . strong." All my life I have tried to "be strong." One of my favorite slogans for success is, "Plan, Simplify, and<i>Be Strong.</i>"<br><br>In the minds of many, the term "meek" means to be submissive, passive, mild, retiring, bashful, soft, lowly, placid, etc. The mental image of a "meek" person is that of a compliant doormat, Casper Milquetoast, who is so timid and unassertive that he accomplishes nothing, does nothing, seeks nothing, and contributes nothing to the world he lives in. Is this weak interpretation of meekness really what the Savior had in mind? I do not think so. I believe there is another better interpretation of the word "meek" in Spanish. Please allow me to share it with you.<br><br>I was visiting a huge estancia (ranch) in Argentina with over 100,000 acres of lush pampa. They had 20,000 head of cattle on the ranch and over a thousand head of beautiful horses--some for the gauchos to ride, but most were thoroughbred polo ponies that they trained and sold all over the world.<br><br>In the course of the afternoon's conversation I asked the distinguished estanciero (owner) if we would see a rodeo where the gauchos would be breaking wild horses like our western cowboys. The owner was aghast. "Not on this ranch you won't," was his emphatic answer. "We would never break a horse. We don't want to break his spirit. We love them and work patiently with them and train them until they are meek or 'manso.'" He said, "Our meek (or 'manso.') horses are still full of fire and spirit, but they are obedient and well trained. They lose nothing of their speed or maneuverability. A polo pony has to be the finest horseflesh on the face of the earth. They are lightning fast and superbly maneuverable to follow the run-and-gun type of game that world-class polo is. The horse cannot be timid or afraid of anything, but must be obedient and superbly well trained."<br><br>I can see a great spiritual application now to the meaning "manso" or "meek." I don't feel the Savior wanted us to be doormats to be walked on. I prefer to think he meant that we should be<i>obedient</i>and<i>well trained.</i>You can be strong, enthusiastic, talented, spirited, zealous, and still be "meek" by being obedient and well trained. I can seek to be that kind of a meek person and be proud to have that as my goal--obedient and well trained--and still coexist in the success-oriented world in which we live.<br><h2><b>Blessed Are They Which Do Hunger and Thirst After Righteousness: For They Shall Be Filled with the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>All who hunger and thirst for righteousness are striving to reach higher spiritual planes. President McKay said, "Man is a spiritual being. . . . There is something within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical and live in a higher and more beautiful world" (<i>CR,</i>Oct. 1928, p. 37).<br><br>How many of us are striving for the higher spiritual levels as though we were hungering and thirsting for it? To hunger and thirst for something is to really strive and struggle, work and sacrifice for it. My father-in-law crossed a strip of desert on horseback as a young man--sixty miles with no water. He planned to meet a wagon train midway to replenish his water, but they were delayed two days in starting and he met no one else. His tongue swelled up, his throat was parched, his dog died, and the horse keeled over. He thought he was going to die. He finally made it, but, in listening to the story, I can feel the intense, agonizing, thirsting desperation for moisture, just like a man held under water gasps for air.<br><br>The highest blessings of the gospel are not for the fainthearted, lukewarm, coolly rational, theoretical philosopher, nor for the intellectually curious. The highest blessings are for those stouthearted souls who are on a noble quest, a crusade for greater personal righteousness. They<i>hunger</i>and<i>thirst</i>for righteousness.<br><br>One of the best facets of this beatitude is that one need not have reached spiritual perfection nor sainthood to receive the blessings that are promised. The blessings seem to come from being involved in the search for the higher way. When we want to be better, to be more pure, to be more virtuous, then we are blessed. No one should think for a moment that just wishful thinking without effort is going to produce any blessings, but if we develop that hunger and that thirst that is sincere, the door to higher stairs will be opened and we can then climb them.<br><br>The blessings are immeasurable. Remember the woman of Samaria at the well. The Savior told her, and it applies to all of us,<br><br><i>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</i>[John 4:14]<br><br>Jesus also said, "I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst" (John 6:35).<br><br>Hungering and thirsting for a higher spiritual life lifts one above the dark storms of this mortal existence that plague many of us. Working and striving to become temple-recommend worthy, with the goal of entering those hallowed halls, is a soul-satisfying quest with blessings all along the way. Hungering and thirsting to be ready, worthy, and prepared to serve a full-time mission and to let your voice sound out as with the trumpet of an angel lifts one to spiritual heights seldom achieved before in the life of a young person.<br><br>The pathway to perfection is long and narrow, but each step brings rewards, beautiful experiences, and enhanced hope of even greater things to come. The early goals of serving a mission and marriage in the temple soon are replaced with the longer-term goals of raising a family in righteousness and serving valiantly until the end. Yet at all stages of life the real goal is righteousness, and everything else takes its place within that all-encompassing arc. When we hunger and thirst for righteousness, we become increasingly strict with ourselves. We impose on ourselves higher goals and loftier standards than even our leaders place for us. The Savior talked of higher and stricter laws by saying, "Ye have heard. . . thou shalt not kill; . . . But I say, thou shalt not even be angry." And "Thou hast heard, thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, thou shalt not even look upon a person of the opposite sex to lust after them lest thou hast already committed adultery in thine heart" (see Matthew 5:21–28).<br><br>I was much impressed lately with Rabbi Silver's approach to fasting. I had asked him about the traditional Jewish fasts from sunset to sunset. He said, "In order to make sure, we fast twenty-five hours by the clock. It is difficult to know exactly when the sun sets, so we solve that by adding an entire hour." I am afraid that many Mormons shave a few hours off the twenty-four hour period rather than adding some just to make sure. The difference is in the attitude--a more generous fast offering, a more generous tithe, more generous home teaching rather than the minimum of one visit per month. To hunger and thirst for righteousness is to go beyond the mark, not to just barely reach a minimum.<br><h2><b>Blessed Are the Merciful: For They Shall Obtain Mercy</b></h2><br>Usually when we think of mercy we think of the relationship between justice and mercy. We all want the Lord not to judge us with justice, but rather with mercy. None of us wants to be punished according to our sins. We all want the Lord to be merciful, to overlook our imperfections, to take into account the efforts we have made and how far we have progressed<i>lately.</i>The Old Testament is full of references about the mercy we hope God will show toward us, now and at the day of judgment.<br><br>But the Savior in the Beatitudes introduces another element. He seems to be talking about<i>us</i>showing mercy in order to obtain mercy from God. The principle here is that we will be judged with the same measure that we apply to others. If we are generous to others, the Lord will be generous with us.<br><br><i>If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</i><br><br><i>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</i>[Matthew 6:14–15]<br><br>The master forgave the head servant that owed him ten thousand talents, but that same servant would not forgive his fellow servant that owed him only 100 pence. The master, upon finding this out, declared, "O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?" (Matthew 18:32).<br><br>The quality of mercy is to temper the strict, severe sentence with generous interpretations and understanding of extenuating circumstances, or, like the infinite mercy of God, simply cancelling any and all punishment because the person asks for forgiveness and promises to follow Christ. God's mercy seems to come from his unlimited and unconditional love for us. Our mercy to others should likewise come from our unlimited and unconditional love for others. Love of this sort does not come solely because they deserve our love. This kind of love comes from our serving and sacrificing for<i>them.</i>For example, our Heavenly Father loves us, not because we deserve it but because he has given and sacrificed for us. Our Savior Jesus Christ loves us, not because we deserve it but because he has given so much and sacrificed for us. Our parents love us, not because we deserve it but because they have given so much and sacrificed for us. In order for us to love others, we must give and sacrifice for them. The more we give and the more we sacrifice, the more we will love them and forgive them their weaknesses, and the greater will be our tendency toward mercy. Unfortunately, some young people do not understand this. When they don't love their parents or brothers and sisters or roommates, they tend to think it is because parents or others have not earned their love or do not deserve it. It is the other way around! If you do not love someone as much as you should, it is because<i>you</i>have not yet given enough nor sacrificed enough for your parents or for that brother or sister or roommate. This is why those homes "blessed" with a parent suffering from an incurable disease or "blessed" with a handicapped sibling are so full of love--i.e., everyone is serving, giving, sacrificing, and that generates greater love.<br><br>Just as mercy is a fundamental ingredient in the relationship between God and man, our Savior obviously expects that mercy will be a fundamental ingredient in the relationship between us and our neighbors.<br><br>God so loved the world that he gave us his Only Begotten Son. Jesus so loved the world that he gave his life, and he suffered for our sins. Oh, what love! Oh, what mercy! Can we not find the way to be merciful to all those about us?<br><h2><b>Blessed Are the Pure in Heart: For They Shall See God</b></h2><br>There are two parts to this beatitude. The first part is to really understand what is meant by "pure in heart," and the second part is to really understand what is meant by "seeing" God.<br><br>In Spanish, the term "pure in heart" is translated "clean of heart" (limpios). That is closer to the original Greek text. It means no stains, no dirt, no marks. In other words, it is the opposite of dirty. It is a physical interpretation, as if talking of clean clothing just laundered. It could also refer to clean water, with no contamination. It is used with regard to ceremonial cleanliness after baptism or after leaving the temple. Other interpretations refer to being clean of guilt, clean of bad habits, clean of pollutants, etc.<br><br>Our English version of "pure" has a definitely moral and spiritual tone to it. It might be more a matter of integrity, or innocence, or righteousness.<br><br>But in either case, pure or clean, we can see that the Christian ideal for us is to be both cleansed by ritual, repentance, and obedience and to be pure of heart in our actions, our words, our thoughts.<br><br>From studying the scriptures one of the strongest interpretations of being pure or clean of heart has to do with sexual purity. "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45). Alma tells us we will be judged for our actions, our words, and our thoughts. Sexual impurity is rampant in the world we live in, and it attacks first in thought, then in word, and then in action. The defense against Satan is to control our thoughts, control our words, and control our actions. For this reason the Lord and his servants warn so often and so strenuously against pornographic material of any media. No one can be clean and pure and involved in such staining, tarnishing, corrosive, degenerating influences.<br><br>It is probable that this beatitude requiring we be clean and pure of heart requires the greatest degree of self-examination of all the Beatitudes. It really means, "Blessed are those whose thoughts are pure and clean and untainted by ulterior motives or conflicts of interest or anything spiritually degrading." This person's heart must be absolutely genuine and sincere. The self-examination must be honest and humbling. All pride and self-gratification must be eliminated.<br><br>The second and most startling part of this beatitude is the statement "For they shall see God." We are all aware of similar promises in the scriptures, and we believe that each can have his own dreams, visions, and manifestations. My favorite is Doctrine and Covenants 88:68:<br><br><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and</i>[but]<i>it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.</i><br><br>There is also the possibility that the "to see" means "to perceive." In fact, I checked in my desk dictionary, and here is what I found. To see: to perceive by the eye; to have experience of such as "to see army service"; to discover or to come to know; to form a mental picture; to visualize in one's mind; to perceive the meaning or importance of something; to be aware of, to imagine the possibility of; to call on,<i>to keep company with,</i>etc.<br><br>Only one definition out of ten meant to see by the eye.<br><br><i>Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</i><br><br><i>And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh;</i><br><br><i>For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:20–22]<br><br>I firmly believe it makes little difference whether the "seeing" is physical or spiritual. The important part is to commit oneself to a course of purification that will lead to God through having a purer, cleaner heart, remembering always that after we have done all we can do, Christ is really the one who, through his atoning sacrifice, makes us clean before our Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>Blessed Are the Peacemakers: For They Shall Be Called the Children of God</b></h2><br>In Spanish this beatitude is a little different. It says, "Blessed are they who<i>seek</i>peace"--peace makers versus peace seekers. The English Book of Mormon version has more action in the verb. The person is making peace, producing peace wherever he or she is--the home, the office, the classroom, the neighborhood, church, or governmental positions--making peace all around. The Spanish interpretation could imply that the person seeks peaceful settings or environments. In this case, although both are admirable, I really like the English version the best.<br><br>I have had two daughters in Israel studying with BYU Semester Abroad. In every letter home they used the word "Shalom" several times. I understand from them that "Shalom," or peace, has two principal meanings. The first is a greeting in which you wish or pray that the person you are addressing may enjoy well-being, happiness, tranquility, a kind of peace. The second is a term describing good personal relations, friendship, and constant goodwill between two people.<br><br>Paul and Peter and others writing the letters included in the New Testament begin and end most of their epistles with the saying, "Grace be unto you and<i>peace</i>from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." The term "peace" is used almost one hundred times in the New Testament and seems to always be closely identified with Christ as the Prince of Peace. The Savior had no material wealth to give to others, but he frequently gave them blessings of peace--a kind of legacy. In this beatitude, those who are blessed are not particularly those who love peace but rather those who<i>seek</i>peace and who<i>produce</i>peace. The blessed ones are those who are the doers of the word, not just passive listeners.<br><br>Sometimes we look upon this war-torn world with its open strife, terrorism, and tension between nations, and long for peace. We honor statesmen and diplomats who are peacemakers. It seems, however, that the Savior was not talking about that kind of peace. He said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation:" prefacing that statement with, "In me ye might have peace" (John 16:33). He said: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). The Savior was not talking about peace between nations achieved after a military victory or even with bilateral agreements worked out by the leaders of the two nations (not peace like the world gives), but rather he referred to the peace that comes to a person's heart when he or she lives the commandments, comes unto Christ with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and repenting and with faith, enters into the waters of baptism, receiving the peaceful, comforting spirit of the Holy Ghost. We achieve inner peace when we feel our lives are in order in the sight of God.<br><br>Many<i>homes</i>are torn with strife, tension, and virtual individual war between husband and wife, between parents and rebellious children, between siblings motivated by jealousy or pride. Blessed is that person who comes to find, through prayer and counseling and reading from the best books, and through personal changes and sacrifices, the ways that they can contribute to peace in the home. No home can be a dwelling place for the Spirit of the Lord if it is torn by lack of peace. No home can be a celestial home unless peace is felt from the moment every person enters the door, be it a member of the family, a guest, or a casual visitor. Order, cleanliness, beauty, etc., are all a part of creating an environment of peace, but even more important is the daily practice of prayer, scripture reading, love, kind words, and the gospel in action in every way.<br><h2><b>Blessed Are They Which Are Persecuted for My Name's Sake: For Theirs Is the Kingdom of Heaven</b></h2><br>This beatitude is often referred to as the blessing of the martyrs. In the days of the New Testament, the meaning of "witness" and "martyr" was virtually synonymous. Bearing testimony always has brought persecution. We need to remember Paul said he had seen a light and heard a voice, and in response to that<i>testimony,</i>the people heaped up ashes on their heads, tore the seams of their garments, and said, "Kill him!" And they would have had it not been that he was a Roman citizen. Stephen could have continued preaching like many pagans as a kind of entertainment in the central squares, but when he looked up into heaven and bore his<i>testimony:</i><br><br><i>. . . I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God,</i><br><br><i>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,</i><br><br><i>And cast him out of the city, and stoned him.</i>[Acts 7:56–58]<br><br>Joseph Smith was not murdered for political or economic reasons. He bore his testimony that he had seen the Father and the Son, and a mob with painted faces attacked and killed him and his brother, Hyrum. The Savior was not crucified for the Sermon on the Mount, nor for walking on water, nor for healing the sick. The one thing the populace could not take was his<i>testimony</i>that he was the Son of God.<br><br><i>. . . Again the high priest asked him, . . . Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</i><br><br><i>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</i><br><br><i>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</i>[Because he testified!] [Mark 14:61–64]<br><br>Bearing witness is courageous, and the faithful have always done it--in the Old and New Testament, in the Book of Mormon, and in the early days of the Church.<br><br>There were a number of reasons why the early Christians were persecuted: Christians were different, they tended to separate themselves physically by living in communities or neighborhoods together. They had different morals. The pagans looked upon the Christians as a despised Jewish cult; the Jews looked upon the Christians as apostates and rebels. The secret meetings of the Christians to preserve the sacredness of some ordinances as well as to avoid attracting attention brought suspicion that the Christians might be doing something strange or immoral in their meetings. The worship of Caesar was a test of political loyalty and good citizenship, and becoming a Christian made the person appear as a traitor and apostate heretic.<br><br>It is inevitable that the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints find themselves looked upon by many just about the way the Christians were looked upon by different aspects of society at the meridian of time.<br><br>Where will persecution come from in the future? I do not know, nor does it concern me. It may come because of not giving the priesthood to women; keeping temples sacred and not open to the public; not aborting babies or limiting family size to control the population; political, economic, or professional jealousies; appearing to criticize the life-style of the gays and the unmarried living together; or because the Word of Wisdom places us in opposition to the tobacco, brewery, and distillery lobby, coffee and tea lobbies, or other self-interest groups.<br><br>The prophets have said that in the last days persecution will come again. But this time we have the absolute assurance that persecution will not destroy the Church nor its doctrines. This time no unhallowed hand can stop the work. From Joseph Smith we are told that<br><br><i>. . . the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:540]<br><br>The Beatitudes are a formula for a Christ-like life. They are a beautiful formula to lift ourselves to a higher level of living. I pray that each one of us might truly understand the Beatitudes and the in-depth interpretations of them and make them a part of our lives. I pray for the Lord's choicest blessings upon each and every one of you in your homes, in your studies, and in your church callings and positions. May the Lord bless you as servants of Christ. May the Lord bless you, each and every one, as saints. I pray for these blessings to be upon you and testify that our Heavenly Father is in his heaven--he lives, he loves us. I testify that Jesus Christ lives, resurrected, glorified, exalted; he stands physically at the head of this Church that bears his name. His spokesman here on the earth today is the living prophet Ezra Taft Benson. And everything we teach and preach--the doctrines, the covenants--are all true. I testify of this humbly, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert E.

<h1>Give unto You - Robert D. Hales - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to be with you at a fireside this evening. I have pondered what message would be helpful and meaningful for you in your life at this special time of learning and preparation for the future. May the Spirit be with us as we discuss some gospel teachings is my prayer.<br><h2><b>To Strengthen Our Faith</b></h2><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, in a 1966 talk entitled "Tragedy or Destiny," said:<br><br><i>I am positive in my mind that the Lord has planned our destiny. We can shorten our lives, but I think we cannot lengthen them very much. Sometime we'll understand fully, and when we see back from the vantage point of the future, we shall be satisfied with many of the happenings of this life which seemed so difficult for us to comprehend.</i><br><br><i>We knew before we were born that we were coming to the earth for bodies and experience and that we would have joys and sorrows, pain and comforts, ease and hardships, health and sickness, successes and disappointments; and we knew also that we would die. We accepted all these eventualities with a glad heart eager to accept both the favorable and unfavorable. We were undoubtedly willing to have a mortal body even if it were deformed. We eagerly accepted the chance to come earthward even though it might be for a day, a year, or a century. Perhaps we were not so much concerned whether we should die of disease, of accident, or of senility. We were willing to come and take life as it came and as we might organize and control it, and this without murmur, complaint, or unreasonable demands. We sometimes think we would like to know what is ahead, but sober thought brings us back to accepting life a day at a time, and magnifying and glorifying that day.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Tragedy or Destiny,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>March 1966, pp. 216–17]<br><br>Ten years ago I was left alone to ponder this very idea in the stark white, sterile environment of a hospital room. My dear wife, Mary, had just been wheeled away to have an operation. My first response was to pray for her to be returned to me alive and well. My first prayer was almost one of a demand for her return because of the good life she had lived, her husband and children needed her loving care, and because in some way, because of our lives of service, her return to health was a debt owed us. Upon concluding the first prayer a heavy feeling lay upon me. There was not the feeling of peace, comfort, or reassurance I had anticipated. What was wrong? Why hadn't I been comforted? Why did I still have so much fear?<br><br>After a few minutes of apprehension and deliberation, I knelt to pray again for a second time. This time, however, my prayer was one of acknowledging the Lord's hand in our lives, giving thanks for the many blessings we had received together as companions in over twenty years of marriage, and expressing that I would accept the outcome of the operation to be in God's hands and that his will would be done. After concluding the prayer, I was ready to accept the will of God as it affected Mary's life and mine.<br><br>At the conclusion of the prayer a sweet, comforting spirit of peace rested upon me--not because I was assured of Mary's safe return to health, but because of the assurance that I would accept my Heavenly Father's will and trust in him and in his son Jesus Christ to be given the strength to meet the trials of this mortal probation.<br><br>After a few more minutes of reflection, I felt the need of more spiritual strength. I reached for my Bible that was on the bed stand and casually thumbed through it, stopping at the book of Job, and began to read, preoccupied at first and then studying more and more intently because my searching questions were being answered.<br><br>The book of Job is a profound poem, yet hard to understand, outlining the challenges of life. Job was a good man, almost perfect. One day Satan appeared before God to tell him of the sinful ways of his children on earth. God said to Satan, "Did you notice my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him--a perfect and an upright man who never sins" (see Job 1:8).<br><br>Then Job was tested in similar ways that we must be prepared to be tested in this mortal probation: (1) physical possessions (house, cattle, children); (2) physical health (boils from head to toe); (3) mental health (depression): "Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I [was born]? I should have slept: then had I been at rest" (Job 3:11, 13), "So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life" (Job 7:15); and (4) false accusations from friends who told Job he must deserve his pain and tribulations as God's punishment for his sins. Job's wife urged him to curse God, even if it meant he would be struck dead. But Job did not let these events destroy his testimony.<br><br>"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly" (Job 1:22). As I studied Job in the hospital room, I found the key to enduring the trials and tribulations of this life is not to place blame on God the Father or his son Jesus Christ. Our trials and tribulations must be used to strengthen our faith. Job testified, "And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold" (Job 19:26–27).<br><br>Elder Orson F. Whitney wrote:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God .</i>. .<i>and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i>[Quoted by Spencer W. Kimball, "Tragedy or Destiny," p. 211]<br><br><i>Being human, we would expel from our lives physical pain and mental anguish and assure ourselves of continual ease and comfort, but if we were to close the doors upon sorrow and distress, we might be excluding our greatest friends and benefactors. Suffering can make saints of people as they learn patience, long-suffering, and self-mastery.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball;<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1972), p. 98]<br><br>After a few hours my sweetheart was returned to the hospital recovery room--our crisis now a learning experience. I have often pondered what I would have done if she had departed this frail existence to leave me alone in this cold and dreary world without her love.<br><h2><b>Trust in the Lord</b></h2><br>What are you going to do when faced with a tragedy? Can you prepare yourself and learn from Job, too? What is the real meaning of "If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30)? What preparations must you make in order to be comforted in times of trial and tribulation?<br><br>You must learn to "trust in the Lord with all thine heart" (Proverbs 3:5), for "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). The Savior is the Prince of Peace. What beautiful words of hope, peace, and comfort.<br><br>The hymn "How Firm a Foundation" teaches us:<br><br><i>In every condition--in sickness, in health,</i><br><i>In poverty's vale or abounding in wealth,</i><br><i>At home or abroad, on the land or the sea--</i><br><i>As thy days may demand, so thy succor shall be.</i><br><br><i>Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,</i><br><i>For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.</i><br><i>I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,</i><br><i>Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.</i><br><br><i>When through the deep waters I call thee to go,</i><br><i>The rivers of sorrow shall not thee o'erflow,</i><br><i>For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,</i><br><i>And</i>sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.<br><br><i>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose</i><br><i>I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;</i><br><i>That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</i><br><i>I'll never, no never, no never forsake!</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 85; emphasis added]<br><br>I am touched this evening to have in attendance a father of seven children whose sweetheart passed through the vale after a sudden illness just a few weeks ago--sweet Linda, thirty-two years of age, a devoted daughter, wife, and mother, taken home to our Father in Heaven for some inexplicable reason. The funeral was beautiful as Linda's husband, daughter, and parents spoke of her love and talents. No one charged God foolishly. The testimonies and examples were powerful and strengthened our faith.<br><br><i>Individually, we should thank God for the examples of those about us who battle and conquer daily challenges that are intense, real, and continuing. There are some persons who in our human eyes seem to have more than their share of trouble, as we measure, but with God's help they are made special. They will not break. They will not yield.</i>[Marvin J. Ashton, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/11/adversity-and-you?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Adversity and You</span></a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, p. 60]<br><br><i>Now, we find many people critical when a righteous person is killed, a young father or mother is taken from a family, or when violent deaths occur. Some become bitter when oft-repeated prayers seem unanswered. Some lose faith and turn sour when solemn administrations by holy men seem to be ignored and no restoration seems to come from repeated prayer circles. But if all the sick were healed, if all the righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, the whole program of the Father would be annulled and the basic principle of the gospel, free agency, would be ended.</i>["Tragedy or Destiny," pp. 180–210]<br><br><i>Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</i>[Job 1:22]<br><br><i>He that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><br><br>For after much tribulation come the blessings. [D&amp;amp;C 58:2–4; emphasis added; see also 103:12]<br><br><i>If we say that early death is a calamity, disaster, or tragedy, would it not be saying that mortality is preferable to earlier entrance into the spirit world and to eventual salvation and exaltation? If mortality be the perfect state, then death would be a frustration, but the gospel teaches us there is no tragedy in death,</i>[if we die in faith]. ["Tragedy or Destiny," p. 179]<br><br>"He that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed" (D&amp;amp;C 42:48). Apparently the Lord did not consider death always a curse or tragedy, for he said: "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 63:49).<br><br><i>Life goes on and free agency continues, and death, which seems such a calamity,</i>[is part of an eternal]<i>blessing.</i><br><br>...<i>I am grateful that even through the priesthood I cannot heal all the sick. I might heal</i><br><br><i>people who should die. I might relieve people of suffering who should suffer. I fear I would frustrate the purposes of God.</i><br><br>...<i>Suffering can make saints of people as they learn patience, long-suffering, and self-mastery. The sufferings of our Savior were part of his education.</i>["Tragedy or Destiny," pp. 179, 211, 210]<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</i><br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</i>[Hebrews 5:8–9]<br><br>Again the Savior has promised that to worthy members the Holy Ghost would be a comforter in times of sickness and death.<br><br><i>Many have borne witness of the comforting spirit that has attended them in times of sorrow, helping them to find peace and understanding.</i><br><br><i>A few weeks ago it was my privilege to meet two wonderful women, close friends, who had lost their husbands in a tragic airplane accident. Did I find them in despair and deep mourning? No, indeed. I have never witnessed greater courage and strength. They both bore witness to the fact that they had truly felt the comfort of the Spirit, that they knew there was a purpose in the call that had been given to their husbands, and that they had an assurance that all would be well with them and their families as they lived close to the Church and kept the commandments of the Lord.</i>[Franklin D. Richards,<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1973, p. 171]<br><br>...<i>Could the Lord have prevented these tragedies? The answer is yes. The Lord is omnipotent, with all power to control our lives, save us pain, prevent all accidents, drive all planes and cars, feed us, protect us, save us from labor, effort, sickness, even from death. But is that what you want? Would you shield your children from effort, from disappointments, temptations, sorrows, suffering?</i><br><br><i>The basic gospel law is free agency. To force us to be careful or righteous would be to nullify that fundamental law, and growth would be impossible.</i>["Tragedy or Destiny," p. 178]<br><br>"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted" (Matthew 5:4; see also 3 Nephi 12:4; D&amp;amp;C 101:14). "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" (John 14:18).<br><br><i>The Holy Ghost is the</i>Comforter.<i>(John 14:26–27;</i>Teachings,<i>pp. 149–150.) This name-title is given to the third member of the Godhead to signify his mission of bringing solace, love, peace, quiet enjoyment, and comfort to the saints. Scriptures setting forth the consolation and encouragement which spring up in the hearts of the righteous by the power of the Holy Ghost frequently speak of him as the</i>Comforter.<i>Moroni, writing of "the visitation of the Holy Ghost," says that this</i>"Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love."<i>(Moroni 8:26.)</i>[<i>MD,</i>p. 148]<br><br>And in 1 John we learn that "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).<br><br>Many of you in attendance tonight may face a similar test of faith in the future. Will you be prepared? How will you respond? There are so many ways we may be tested: the death of a loved one, the birth defect of a child, an accident paralyzing a loved one, our own illness, failure to reach a goal in life, being single and lonely, being married and experiencing divorce, having friends betray a trust.<br><h2><b>Understanding the Vision</b></h2><br>Leo Tolstoi's story of Martin Avdeitch teaches a beautiful lesson on how to deal with sorrow in our life. Martin had experienced a great deal of tragedy in his life. His two oldest children passed away. Later, his wife became ill and died, leaving Martin alone with his little son Kapitoshka, the only bright spot remaining in his life. Then Kapitoshka suddenly became ill with a high fever and died within a few days.<br><br>Martin was devastated and had a hard time dealing with the sorrow and tragedies he had encountered. One day an old man came into Martin's shop and convinced him he must pull himself out of his depression and sorrow. He told him that he must first get a copy of the New Testament and study it. Then he must<i>turn his thoughts away from himself and attend to the needs of others.</i><br><br>Martin took the old man's advice and immediately went out and bought a copy of the New Testament. He found it fascinating--so much so that he often read until the oil burned from his lamp at night.<br><br>One evening he pondered over the message found in Luke 7, beginning with verse 44:<br><br><i>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</i><br><br><i>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</i><br><br><i>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</i>[Luke 7:44–46]<br><br>As he thought about how he had treated others, he fell asleep. He was awakened by a voice telling him that the Savior was coming to visit him the next day.<br><br>When morning came, Martin arose early and started his work. He watched out the window of his shop as people passed. While he was working--and watching--he noticed an old soldier who had been hired to clean the snow away. The old soldier looked tired and cold. Martin tapped on the window and motioned him to come in. The old man was nearly frozen. Martin offered him hot food and shelter to warm himself. He also shared with him his feelings about the happiness reading the holy scriptures had brought into his life.<br><br>After the old soldier left, Martin once again set about his work in his shoemaking shop. He continued to look out the window for his guest. He soon noticed a young woman who stopped outside his shop to try to bundle her tiny baby to protect him from the cold. She was poorly dressed for the extreme cold outside and had very little protection for the child. Martin invited her in and cared for the baby while the young woman ate some warm soup. As she left, he provided her with an old coat and enough money to buy a new one. Both mother and baby were warm and protected from the cold when they left for their journey home.<br><br>Martin cleaned the dishes and went back to work near the window. It wasn't long before he saw an old woman who had been selling apples. As she set her basket of apples down to adjust a large, awkward sack she was packing, a young boy came by and grabbed an apple. The old woman, having been on her guard from years of experience, grabbed the boy by the scruff of the neck. As the two were struggling, Martin dashed out to help. Through his efforts not only did the old woman and the boy stop their fighting, but by the time they left the boy offered to carry the large sack to the old lady's home, and she rewarded him with a big red apple. They walked together down the street--talking and laughing as they went.<br><br>Martin went inside. It was getting late so he cleaned his shop and put his tools away. He thought he saw shadows in the dark corner of the room but decided the dim lamplight was playing tricks on him. He opened the New Testament and began reading and pondering why his guest had not arrived.<br><br>Suddenly he heard a voice call out his name, saying, "Martin, Martin, dost thou not know me?"<br><br>"Who art thou?" said Avdeitch.<br><br>"Even I," whispered the voice again, and out from the dark corner stepped the old soldier. He smiled at Martin--then he was gone.<br><br>"It is I," whispered a second voice, and the young woman and her child stepped out from the dark corner of the room. She and the baby smiled at him--then they suddenly disappeared.<br><br>"And it is I," whispered a third voice as the old lady and the boy with the apple stepped out, smiled, and were gone.<br><br>Martin rubbed his eyes, looked down at where his New Testament had fallen open, and read: "For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in." And further down the page he read: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:35, 40).<br><br>Then Martin Avdeitch understood that the vision had come true, and his Savior had in very truth visited him that day, and that he had received him. This story outlines an important way to prepare ourselves to meet a tragedy: by reading the scriptures to strengthen ourselves and by turning our thoughts away from ourselves and attending to the needs of others.<br><h2><b>Learning to Love</b></h2><br>Another beautiful example is found in the life of Thomas Moore. Why do many of us "go it alone" and deny those who love us most the joy and blessings that come from sharing? The principle of helping one in need is well expressed in the touching love story of Thomas Moore, a famous nineteenth-century Irish poet, who, when he returned from a business trip, found his wife had locked herself in her upstairs bedroom and had asked to see no one. Moore learned the terrible truth that his beautiful wife had contracted smallpox, and her milky complexion was now pocked and scarred. She had looked at herself in the mirror and demanded that the shutters be drawn, and that she never see her husband again. Thomas Moore did not listen. He went upstairs to the darkened room and started to light the lamp. His wife pleaded with him to let her remain in darkness alone. She felt it best not to subject her husband to seeing his loved one with her beauty marred. She asked him to go.<br><br>Moore did go. He went downstairs and spent the rest of the night in prayerful writing. He had never written a song before, but that night he not only wrote words but also composed music. As daylight broke, Moore returned to his wife's darkened room. "Are you awake?" he asked.<br><br>"Yes," she said, "but you must not see me. Please don't press me, Thomas."<br><br>"I'll sing to you then," he said. Thomas Moore sang to his wife the song that still lives today.<br><br><i>Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,</i><br><br><i>Which I gaze on so fondly to-day:</i><br><br><i>Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,</i><br><br><i>Like fairy-gifts fading away,</i><br><br>Moore heard a movement in the corner of the darkened room where his wife lay in loneliness. He continued:<br><br><i>Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,</i><br><br><i>Let thy loveliness fade as it will,</i><br><br><i>And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart</i><br><br><i>Would entwine itself verdantly still.</i><br><br>The song ended. As his voice faded, Moore heard his bride arise. She crossed the room to the window, reached up and slowly withdrew the shutters, opened the curtain, and let in the morning light (from Galen Drake,<i>Guideposts,</i>Sept. 1957).<br><br>I would like at this time to thank my wife for opening up the shutters and letting in her light and her life and sharing it with me. I would not be here today without her love and companionship.<br><br>When we are marred spiritually or physically, our first reaction is to withdraw into the dark shadows of depression, to blot out hope and joy--the light of life that comes from knowing we are living the commandments of our Father in Heaven. This withdrawal will ultimately lead us to rebellion against those who would like to be our friends, those who can help us most, even our family. But worst of all, we finally reject ourselves.<br><br>Those who are alone and lonely should not retreat to the sanctuary of their private thoughts and chambers. Such retreat will ultimately lead them into the darkening influence of the adversary, which leads to despondency, loneliness, frustration, and to thinking of oneself as worthless. After one thinks of himself as worthless, he then ofttimes turns to associates who corrode those delicate spiritual contacts, rendering their spiritual receiving antennas and transmitters useless. What good is it to associate with and ask advice of someone who is disoriented himself and only tells us what we want to hear? Isn't it better to turn to loving parents and friends, who can help us reach for and attain celestial goals?<br><br>Having almost lost my dear companion a decade ago, I determined not to have any regrets in the remaining years we had together. Whittier wrote of Maud Muller: "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: 'It might have been!'" (<i>Maud Muller</i>[1856], stanza 53).<br><br>One of the great tragedies in our lives is to look back and say, "But for my actions, this might have been."<br><br><i>My Regrets</i><br><i>Are not for things I've done</i><br><i>But for the things I meant to do.</i><br><i>The violets I picked and failed to send;</i><br><i>Words of love I did not give a friend.</i><br><i>The call I should have made at sorrow's door;</i><br><i>Comforts that I could have sent the poor.</i><br><i>The Letter that somehow I did not pen.</i><br><i>Chances lost will never come again.</i><br><i>These are my regrets...</i><br>[Mildred T. Pettit]<br><br><i>I expect to pass through this world but once. Any good therefore that I can do, or any kindness that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.</i>[attributed to Stephen Grellet, see Burton Stevenson, sel. and arr.,<i>The Home Book of Quotations</i>(New York: Dodd, Mead &amp;amp; Company, 1934), p. 1493]<br><br>It has been said that each of us has enough strength to endure another's tragedies, tribulations, and sorrows. We all know that in this mortal probation we must prepare for tragedies that may directly affect our lives in a number of ways:<br><br>1. By having a deep, abiding faith in God our Father and in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, trusting in their mercy in all our doings without charging God foolishly.<br><br>2. By being spiritually strong, by being obedient, and by having the Holy Ghost to guide us, comfort us, and bring peace to our souls. This would include regular prayer and study of the scriptures as individuals, companions, and family.<br><br>3. By acquiring personal accountability for our actions, not blaming others for our mistakes, failures, opposition, or unexplained trials. Hopefully, walking the gospel road less traveled means we can look back without regrets for our actions. Living gospel principles may bring loneliness in terms of our todays and tomorrows, but it can reward us with blessings of eternity.<br><br>4. We need to reach out to those who have experienced a tragedy in their lives. In this way we learn from their example of faith and strength. Also, in the same way the Savior thought of his mother's care in the closing moments on Calvary, we learn we must reach out and help when we are hurting.<br><br>5. The last point on meeting adversity in our lives comes from Victor E. Frankl, author of<i>Man's Search for Meaning.</i>He relates his experience in surviving two concentration camp experiences where all vestiges of human rights were taken from the inmates. Frankl is fond of quoting Nietzsche: "He who has a<i>why</i>to live can bear with almost any<i>how.</i>" In the concentration camp every circumstance conspires to make the prisoners lose hold of the purpose of life. All reasons for living are taken away through beatings, fear, poor nutrition, captors, and mental mind games. What alone remains is "the last of human freedoms"--the ability to "choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances." The prisoners were all average men, but some, at least, by choosing to be "worthy of their suffering" proved, by serving against unsurmountable odds, man's capacity to rise above outward fates, whether they be deserved or undeserved, explained or unexplained, just or unjust, or from sources unknown--good or evil.<br><br>Harold S. Kushner, at the end of his book,<i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People,</i>said,<br><br><i>In the final analysis, the question of why bad things happen to good people translates itself into some very different questions, no longer asking</i>why<i>something happened, but asking</i>how<i>we will respond, what we intend to do now that it [the tragic event] has happened.</i>[<i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i>(New York: Schocken books, 1981), p. 147; emphasis added]<br><br>Are you capable of forgiving and accepting in love a world that has disappointed you by not being perfect, a world in which there is so much unfairness and cruelty, disease, poverty, crime, earthquake, flood, and accident? Can you forgive the world's imperfections and love life because it is capable of containing great beauty and goodness, and because it is the only world we have? Are you capable of forgiving and loving the people around you, even if they have hurt you and let you down by not being perfect? Can you forgive them and love them because there aren't many perfect people<br><br>around, and because the penalty for not being able to love imperfect people is condemning oneself to loneliness? Are you capable of forgiving and loving God even when you have found that his world is not perfect and free from pain and travail? He may have let you down and permitted bad luck, wickedness, and cruelty in his world--permitting some of those things to happen to you. Can you learn to love and forgive him, as Job did, despite the tests of our faith he asks us to endure?<br><br>The capability, through repentance, to forgive and the ability to love are God-given gifts to enable us to live our lives fully and to help others live bravely and meaningfully in this less than perfect world.<br><br>If we can apply these preparations to meet life's challenges and tragedies, our yesterdays will seem less painful; and you will not be afraid of your tomorrows.<br><br><i>I know that my Redeemer lives.</i><br><i>What comfort this sweet sentence gives!</i><br><i>He lives, he lives, who once was dead.</i><br><i>He lives, my ever living Head.</i><br><br><i>He lives to bless me with his love.</i><br><i>He lives to plead for me above.</i><br><i>He lives my hungry soul to feed.</i><br><i>He lives to bless in time of need.</i><br><br><i>He lives to grant me rich supply.</i><br><i>He lives to guide me with his eye.</i><br><i>He lives to comfort me when faint.</i><br><i>He lives to hear my soul's complaint.</i><br><br><i>He lives to silence all my fears.</i><br><i>He lives to wipe away my tears.</i><br><i>He lives to calm my troubled heart.</i><br><i>He lives all blessings to impart.</i><br><br><i>He lives, my kind, wise heav'nly Friend.</i><br><i>He lives and loves me to the end.</i><br><i>He lives, and while he lives, I'll sing.</i><br><i>He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.</i><br><br><i>He lives and grants me daily breath.</i><br><i>He lives, and I shall conquer death.</i><br><i>He lives my mansion to prepare.</i><br><i>He lives to bring me safely there.</i><br><br><i>He lives! All glory to his name!</i><br><i>He lives, my Savior, still the same.</i><br><i>Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:</i><br><i>"I know that my Redeemer lives."</i><br><br><i>He lives! All glory to his name!</i><br><i>He lives, my Savior, still the same.</i><br><i>Oh, sweet the joy this sentence gives:</i><br><i>"I know that my Redeemer lives!"</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 136]<br><br>In closing, may I give my testimony of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ--the Prince of Peace. I testify that if we will put our trust in the Lord and live obediently so that we might have the comforting spirit of the Holy Ghost, we shall find joy and peace in this mortal probation. That we might live our lives in such a way that we may endure to the end and return back into the presence of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert D.

<br>
<h2><b>The Great Love Story</b></h2><br>From my point of view, one of the greatest love stories of all time has never been recognized as such even though it is filled with romance. In fact, when you first read the story, you would probably not recognize it as a love story at all. The reason we pass over this story so easily is that in order for us to recognize love, we must first have a great understanding in our own hearts of what love really is. Love is a peculiar attribute. It very seldom appears suddenly like a mushroom. Usually it grows slowly like a bud that unfolds and develops into a beautiful flower.<br><br>In order to love something you have to get to know and understand it. For instance, the way we learn to love a sunset is to study sunsets carefully. We then learn to observe how one color blends into another so beautifully and harmoniously. Then we recognize how clouds add character to the scene and how the rays of the sun shining behind those clouds highlight them and give variety and beauty to the view. The more you watch sunsets, the more you appreciate and learn to love them.<br><br>This is the way you young mothers learn to love a child. Being with that child so much and serving and watching over the child so carefully causes you to love it. You overlook its faults and appreciate its virtues. Service to another person or to a cause is an excellent way to develop love for that person or cause. But love doesn't always have to grow so slowly. Love can blossom very suddenly. The particular love story I am talking about began suddenly and has been blossoming brightly for thousands of years. This love story is found in the Bible in the book of Genesis and is the story of Adam and Eve.<br><br>When Adam was placed on the earth he was a perfect physical and mental specimen made in the likeness and image of God. But Adam had a basic weakness. He had no memory of where he came from or of what he had known before he was placed on the earth. Here on the earth he was required to learn everything from scratch. After Adam was created, the Lord God said: "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make an help meet for him" (Genesis 2:18). God did not say "helpmate" or "helpmeet," but used that good, solid, Anglo-Saxon word "meet" that means of the same worthiness, the same intelligence, the same quality or nobility, worthy to stand beside the man as a fit companion and helper.<br><br>So Eve was created and became Adam's companion and was married and sealed to him as his wife. Remember they were created as perfect beings without blemish or sin and were immortal. At that time death had not yet entered into the world. Therefore they were bound together in a marriage union that was to endure for all eternity. Now comes the great love story.<br><br>When Adam saw Eve, that glorious being who had been sealed to him as his wife, he was filled with love for her, for she had been taken symbolically from his rib next to his heart. She was not taken from his head to stand over him, nor from his breast to go before him, nor from his back to walk three paces behind him, nor from his foot to be trodden upon. She was taken symbolically from his side--close to his heart to stand by him as a noble companion.<br><br>As his heart filled with love for her, he said: "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man" (Genesis 2:23). What Adam meant by these words can be paraphrased thusly: "I love her with all my heart. She is as important to me as life itself. She is as vital to me as my own flesh and bone. I treasure her as I do my own body--as much as my own life. Without her life would be meaningless. I love her!"<br><br>And the Father then answered and said to Adam: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). What God meant by these words was as if to say: "Adam, you are absolutely right. You two shall remain together forever to begin your own family on earth and to become one indeed in everything you do in an eternal companionship, never to be broken." As Jesus later explained this eternal type of marriage, he said:<br><br><i>For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</i>[Matthew 19:5–6]<br><br>Considered in that light, when one speaks of the Father, meaning God the Father, one also speaks of the Father's wife (our Heavenly Mother), for they are one flesh. We use this same expression on earth. When, for instance, we speak of the Bensons, the Hollands, or the Burtons, we speak of a pair. If these married partners were as perfect as our Heavenly Parents are, these couples would act and do things as a team, working together in perfect harmony and oneness--literally as one flesh. I personally believe that the word "Elohim" (a plural word) is a title and includes this connotation of oneness, even though when I write or speak of God the Father, I speak of a living, single being, but realize in my heart that they make up a heavenly pair.<br><h2><b>A Holy and Eternal Order</b></h2><br>One of the things that concerns us as General Authorities about marriage, and particularly about temple marriage and sealing, is the light-mindedness with which some of our Church members enter into this holy and eternal order. It appears that too many people now enter into temple marriage with the idea that it is pretty much like any other type of marriage. People today tend to regard all marriage lightheartedly without remembering that a civil marriage is an arrangement invented by man, which therefore includes man's imperfections. A temple marriage, on the other hand, is performed under special priesthood authorization and with authority from God. It is therefore a holy ordinance that should be taken very seriously. It is an eternal marriage meant to last forever.<br><br>Many Church members fail to understand the sacredness of this temple marriage covenant. It is as if they say: "If this marriage doesn't work out, we can make a change. If I tire of my partner, I can get a cancellation of this sealing and try it again with another companion!" If we enter into a celestial marriage with that attitude, whatever love formed the basis for that relationship in the first place will sooner or later change to dislike or perhaps even hatred. Then unhappiness and sorrow will rob the marriage partners of the great joy and comfort that Adam and Eve found in each other when they were sealed unto this holy order and took that calling and ordinance with appropriate seriousness.<br><br>The question becomes: "How does this dislike and hatred originate in a marriage?" To understand how this change can come about, we must observe the great difference between the attitudes and actions of Jehovah and Satan. This difference represents the difference between love and hatred. Jesus did not think only of himself, but caught the greater view of true love that the Father held. Jesus thought not only of his own interests, but also of others and what his actions might and could do for them. He didn't seek just his own advantage. He was unselfish and accepted the Father's plan of salvation not only for himself, but also for the whole family of God's children.<br><br>Jesus knew the Father's plan was vital for the growth and development of mankind. He even offered to give his own future mortal life as a Savior for us; thereby we might all return to the presence of our Heavenly Father and Mother. Back in their presence we could regain our places in God's eternal family, but would be added upon through this earthly experience. We could return to God with perfected, resurrected bodies, having gained greater light and knowledge through experiences received during mortality. This advantage would enable us, during the eternities, to grow to become more like our Father and Mother in Heaven, possessing greater light, greater knowledge, greater experience, and greater skills. In other words, Jehovah believed implicitly in the Father's plan and advised us as intelligent spirits to do likewise.<br><br>Hatred begins with selfishness; hence, Lucifer thought only of himself. He thought he knew more about life than God the Father did. He felt he had a better and safer plan than the Father had proposed.<br><br>Not willing to offer himself as a Savior under the Father's plan, Lucifer wanted to be God himself. In his arrogance and vanity he wanted to force us to be righteous, whether or not we wanted to be. He felt that since he had developed what he thought was a better, safer plan, why of course no Savior was needed. And since he, as a Son of the Morning, was the author of this new plan, he wanted full credit for it. As for the Father's plan, his advice to the spirit children of God was: "Believe it not."<br><br>That refusal to believe and accept the Father's plan is the course Lucifer followed and was what he persuaded those spirits to do who listened to him. Lucifer's plan was refused by the Father because it took our agency and freedom away from us. This freedom of action was our most precious possession and one for which we were willing to fight to retain. This plan of negativism is the satanic gospel that Lucifer is preaching today and that so many are deceived into accepting. People who do so fail to see its traps and pitfalls. It is a gospel of opposition, of tearing down, destroying, denigrating, and of making things ugly. It is contention, dissension, and wickedness that tear apart marriages and families.<br><br>Satan's plan is just opposite from the Father's plan of salvation. Since the Savior sustained and adopted the Father's plan, it is the only wise and correct plan for us to consider. It is a positive, effective plan that all of us should follow. Jesus says simply: "Believe!" It is the difference between positive and negative things--between the beautiful and the ugly, between love and hatred, between joy and sorrow, between success for all eternity or eternal unhappiness. It is something for us to consider seriously in courtship and marriage.<br><br>If we are to understand the importance of a temple marriage, we must first understand and believe with all our hearts that we are spirit children of God. It is imperative to realize that we are all of divine origin, that God is real and that he lives. If we can have that absolute faith and assurance in God the Father, we can then know with certainty that God will do everything he can to bless us. If we will only keep our covenants with him, he will provide for our eventual return into his presence.<br><br>Our heavenly parents want us back with them. That is their goal, their work, and their glory. We must have hope and faith in that divine plan in order to live righteously, keeping the covenants that make that return possible. Failures may come, disappointments may arise, some opportunities may be lost, but if only we maintain faith in God's love and try as best we can to recognize and repent of whatever mistakes we make, we can return to the presence of God. That is the promise God gives us.<br><br>The second thing to remember is that Jesus Christ is our Anointed Savior or Redeemer. He loves each of us so much that he gave his life to atone for our sins if we repent and sanctify ourselves. This means that whenever we make a mistake we must admit it and renew our covenants by recommitting ourselves (with the help of Jesus Christ, of course) to keep those covenants in the future; to make restitution for those sins through service to others in order to pay back for the damages caused by breaking the law; and finally, to forsake whatever evil was done, and with the help of God never return to these or similar acts of disobedience. If Jesus is a god of love--and he truly is--then such a course of action must be the foundation for both courtship and marriage. The true love of Christ involves service to others in which a person is willing to give a part of himself to serve and help others. Such service is the complete opposite of selfishness and manifests the true spirit of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father expects each of us to be wise. If you choose a partner for a decision as important as eternal marriage, you should not rush into such an important covenant without knowing your partner as thoroughly as you reasonably can. Many people think only of exciting romantic concepts they get from books and movies without realizing that such a romance is often selfish. All too frequently it is the opposite of true love. To marry a person you have known only a short time is most unwise. That person's faith, as well as your own faith, first needs to be tested. Is that person honest and reliable in keeping his or her commitments? In other words, can he or she be trusted? This is an important question in marriage, for to be trusted is greater than to be loved.<br><h2><b>Mature Preparation</b></h2><br>My special assignment for the past six years has been to assist the First Presidency in recovering people who have transgressed. In doing so I have come to comprehend causes that lead to transgression. What are they? Generally they are various personal indulgences based on selfishness. One of the greatest of these is the use of pornography. The use of pornography is a basic sin that leads to self-abuse, homosexuality, fornication, adultery, child and spouse abuse, incest, rape, and cruelty. No love ever develops out of pornography, only self-gratification.<br><br>To protect yourself against such evils you have to stay clean yourself and have a clean partner. You should get to know something about the history of your partner and his or her family. You have to observe what habits and ideals that person has, and what experiences that person has had. You should know something about the environment in which that person was raised. It is well to know as much as you reasonably can about your future partner, for you will be playing for keeps. Although repentance is possible, it must be sincere and requires a considerable period of time to make that change permanent.<br><br>There is a rather strange circumstance that I observe all too often in marriage situations. Namely, if a woman divorces a man for physical abuse, it seems that each following marriage is with partners who have that same failing. If she divorces an alcoholic husband, all too often her next partner has the same problem. We might say that such a person is a "born loser." It is not so much that particular trait as much as it is that a person all too often does not change his or her way of thinking. Nor does a person often change concepts and habits. Repentance begins in a person's mind by changing his manner of thinking. Firm commitments must be made and a complete determination to change must take place in a person's mind before any change can be made in his actions.<br><br>If you marry a person who has difficulty with honesty, or with the Word of Wisdom, thinking to bring about a reformation in that person's life through marriage, it is seldom successful. If repentance is to occur, that change must begin before the marriage takes place, not after. What change takes place must be so complete there is little likelihood that former traits or habits will reoccur in marriage. Marriage is probably the most important decision we make in life, and one should give it prayerful thought and careful consideration before taking such a step.<br><br>Another cause for unhappiness in marriage is the immaturity of those who enter into the marriage covenant. When people marry too young, they are not prepared physically, mentally, or financially for the strains that come as children are added to the family. The duties and responsibilities of parenthood bear down on the marriage partners. No marriage can succeed if the husband is unable because of lack of education or job experience to take care of his family financially. No marriage can succeed if the wife has had no experience or training in how to care for a home and children or how to solve homemaking problems and lacks the maturity to learn. Marital happiness comes from maturity and experience. No amount of professed love, physical attraction, or romantic inclination can bring happiness to a home where the husband cannot provide a living, or where the wife cannot prepare a good, nourishing meal, or where the husband (and/or the wife) does not know how to face emergencies that come because of illness, loss of a job, accidents, or financial strain.<br><br>You must realize it is better to solve serious problems before marriage than to try to resolve such problems after marriage. If you start out right with mature preparation for the marriage venture, it can be a glorious, wonderful experience. If you start out wrong because of lack of proper preparation and mature experience, marriage can be a disaster. One thing I have noticed in handling numerous cases is that divorce seldom solves marriage problems.<br><h2><b>Searching for Solutions</b></h2><br>The heartbreak that comes from the breakup of a family is one of the greatest tragedies in our modern world. The traumatic effect that divorce has on children is almost impossible to assess. Children of divorced parents often become so resentful that their own lives are filled with unhappiness when they become adults. When it comes time for them to marry, their chances for a successful marriage are frequently handicapped by their remembrance of the difficulties, quarrels, resentments, and patterns they saw in their parents.<br><br>When children who have been physically abused marry, they frequently abuse their own children physically. The same is true for mental abuse. Children suffering from incestuous relationships all too often themselves turn to incestuous activities when they marry. A boy who sees his mother physically abused will all too often physically abuse his own wife in turn. Parents seldom realize the impact and the very often serious consequences such reprehensible behavior has on the actions of their children. It does materially and emotionally affect their lives.<br><br>Divorced wives find it difficult to provide for their children. Financial settlements are often inadequate to care for a family. When a mother has to find work to support her children, resentment and sorrow come to her and to the children too. Wives and husbands who are too quick to divorce an errant spouse through an unforgiving attitude all too often bring only added grief to themselves and to their families.<br><br>Husbands who are indifferent and careless and thereby cause divorces, or husbands who desert families and divorce their wives, find that the second and subsequent families only add to their financial and emotional burdens. If it is difficult for a man to finance his first family, his financial well-being is not aided by incurring additional financial obligations as a result of subsequent marriages. Court costs and lawyer fees sap the financial resources of even rich men and are disastrous for the ordinary family. Divorce is often a no-win option and can seldom be relied on as a solution to marital problems.<br><br>My personal burden in marriage counseling is to try to find a solution to the problem of hatred. Unforgivingness is a horrible sin. People are so intent on vengeance for past or imagined wrongs that they do horrible things to each other. Indifferent silences and/or unkind words can often cut deeper than swords. If we look for faults in someone, we can always find them. But the added problem is that these faults seem to grow and multiply the more we think about them. Resentment leads to tearful frustration and to the most hurtful kind of words and actions. Oh, if people could only learn to forgive!<br><br>I refer often to these following verses in Doctrine and Covenants 64:8–10:<br><br><i>My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</i><br><br>I believe this means that it is a greater sin not to forgive one another than it is to commit some of those sins for which people are disfellowshipped or excommunicated from the Church.<br><br>The Lord continues his teaching: "I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men" (D&amp;amp;C 64:10). I thus have an answer for those who refuse to forgive themselves and who make themselves miserable by continually talking about their own sins. They say: "I just can't forgive myself for the things I have done." I reply to them: "O you wicked person! Do you think you are more holy than the Lord himself? If he is willing to forgive and forget if you will only repent, shouldn't you be willing to forgive yourself now that you have repented for your sin?"<br><br>We must remember the love of Jesus as he tried to teach us how to be kind one to another. He said:<br><br><i>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</i><br><br><i>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</i>[Matthew 6:14–15]<br><br>When, oh when, will we learn that love can overcome hatred and that kindness and humility really can restore love?<br><h2><b>Have Faith!</b></h2><br>Now one piece of advice to those of you who have never had a companion through no fault of your own, or to those of you who have lost companions in death or through divorce or desertion: Do not despair or think that all is lost! Remember that you are children of God. Have faith in your Heavenly Father. Don't worry about what will happen to you after death. Don't worry about who will have inheritance of your children who are born in the covenant. People make themselves miserable over such questions that cannot be answered at present because earth life is not yet over. Death does not end our possibilities for solutions to often very difficult present problems.<br><br>When people tell you that all such problems must be solved during earth life, just ask them this question: "Why then are we to have a thousand years of peace before the final judgment is made?" I think it will be during this period of time that under the direction of a loving Father in Heaven and a devoted, loving, understanding Savior--who will be our advocate with the Father--that all these problems will be worked out to our best advantage. Those great men and women who will be officiating on earth in the power of the holy priesthood will be in constant communication with the heavens. Directions can then be given to those on earth to make necessary adjustments in the temples through which all these marital and other problems can and will be solved.<br><br>The present solution is a simple one. Have faith! As Jesus said so positively: "Believe!" Remember that God loves you enough to have given his Only Begotten Son to atone for your sins if you will just try, try, try to repent! Jesus in his great mercy was willing to give his life for you because he loved you enough to make that atonement for you if you will only repent. No matter how desperate your personal situation or your marital problems may appear to be to you, there are solutions possible if you will just keep the faith!<br><br>I testify of the divine nature of these teachings, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Theodore M.

<h1> Thee, O God, for a Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>A Newfound Hope</b></h2><br>One of the thrilling experiences of traveling the length and breadth of this Church is to hear new members in the uttermost bounds sing with enthusiasm, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days." During the past couple of years it has been our privilege to be in such places as the outback of Australia where aborigines are being led out of a primitive existence into a new way of life; in faraway New Guinea where curiosity about a new faith, just five years ago, has rapidly developed into several successful branches accommodating more than a thousand new members; in a refugee camp in Southeast Asia where thousands are clustered in quest of political freedom. We don't do proselyting work in those camps, but there were a few observing our sister missionaries who were working as social workers in the camp who recognized their difference, kindness, and gentleness. Thousands of these refugees have accepted the restored truth that promises not only political freedom, but a<i>total</i>freedom, for the truth shall make them free.<br><br>There is a poverty-stricken village near Coimbatore, India, where everything looks bright for the first time because there is newfound hope in a church led by a living prophet.<br><br>Then there's that coconut atoll in the middle of the South Pacific where the people's tradition of happiness and faith has been added upon and been given even deeper meaning and a new purpose for living.<br><br>Finally, we have been to a remote mountaintop of South America where some of the sons and daughters of Father Lehi are being tenderly led back to the Church of their forebears.<br><br>Yes, hundreds of new voices are being added each month to the worldwide chorus of the Lord's faithful, singing with great sincerity, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet."<br><br>How thrilling it was to sustain a new prophet in general conference. Thousands of us raised our right hands in unison as a special Book of Mormon scripture was reenacted, "A choice seer will I raise up" (2 Nephi 3:7).<br><h2><b>In True Prophet Fashion</b></h2><br>How remarkable is the Lord's process of preparing and calling his key leaders. No two prophets have been exactly alike. Each has his unique gifts and talents, each has his special mission to perform, each has been able to conform to the Lord's will based on his own particular preparation.<br><br>This point was made so well by Elder Boyd K. Packer, who related this touching parable during the transition that took place at the death of President Harold B. Lee and the sustaining of President Spencer W. Kimball.<br><br>A brand-new locomotive is all ready for its initial run. It is perfect in every detail--bright, shiny, well lubricated, and with a full head of steam. This locomotive bears the name "Church Correlation." President Harold B. Lee, who had dedicated the final fifteen years of his ministry to the perfecting of Church correlation, was poised with his foot on the first step all ready to pull himself into the driver's seat when all of a sudden a kindly hand fell upon his shoulder and a voice said, "No, Harold, you have done a superb job getting things ready, now I want Spencer to drive it." And Spencer W. Kimball put Church correlation into motion.<br><br>Dr. David L. Clark, one of our prominent Church educators in Wisconsin, has made the following observation about calling prophets:<br><br><i>In the dark stillness of the almost empty temple, a voice called "Samuel,</i>"<i>and Samuel replied, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant hears,</i>"<i>and a prophet was called. In the solitude of a New York woods, a young boy asked for help, and in reply the Lord answered, "This is my beloved Son, hear Him,</i>"<i>and the first prophet of the last dispensation was called. Different times and different prophets, but the history of God's dealings with His people is marked by the calling of prophets for essentially the same purposes whether 2,600 years ago, in 1820, or in 1986.</i><br><br><i>The fact that prophets perform prophetically and that people's need for such promptings is continuous does not mean that all prophets have been formed in the same mold. A prophet's position in the society that needs him may range from that of outcast to King, from principal priest to a voice in the wilderness. Even the manner of call to the position may differ from one generation to the next. Joseph Smith's call as a prophet came in answer to a request; Samuel's call came as a surprise. Jeremiah, one of the giants of Judah, was eighteen years old when the Lord put forth His hand and touched Jeremiah's mouth and said, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth and have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."</i>[David L. Clark, first counselor in Madison Wisconsin Stake. Excerpts from stake conference address delivered 24 May 1986]<br><br>Prophets have been most anxious to share the will of God with all the people. They have also felt an obligation to attack the evils of society. After hearing President Ezra Taft Benson in our recent general conference, there can certainly be no doubt where we stand as a people relative to the many character-corroding influences that are so rampant in the world today. President Benson has raised his voice both frequently and fearlessly against every evil practice. Some of these evils are so blatant that the victims are subdued with one lethal blow. But perhaps we should regard with equal concern those evil influences so subtle, so gradual, that we are gently led away hardly realizing what is happening. The subtle influence of evil must surely be among Satan's most powerful tools.<br><br>Too often prophets have been turned away, shunned, and even harmed by those offended by their teachings. It is recorded that Jeremiah spent some twenty-three years in what seemed to be a futile effort--a voice in the wilderness--but how great will be his eternal reward for the valiant effort he made against such overwhelming odds. In true prophet fashion he refused to give up. No one really knows whether he even knew at the time about the sympathetic ear of one we call Father Lehi, one who was listening during those years of struggle. Certainly Jeremiah knows now about Father Lehi, and you can be sure he is receiving his reward in full measure for all that followed that led a chosen people to a promised land and left the world its greatest legacy, the Book of Mormon.<br><h2><b>Prophets of All Times</b></h2><br>To complicate the lives of true prophets, there have been false prophets along the way helping the adversary to fill his role as spoiler and enemy of truth--often using half truths as the most effective weapon. Jeremiah had his Hananiah. In our day, Brigham Young had James Strang, also several others, attempting to cloud the issues of truth and right. The great common denominator of false prophets seems to be their obsession to tear down and destroy, with practically no effort to give hope or enlightenment. This has been so evident during the past couple of years.<br><br>Without dwelling on the negative too much, perhaps we should mention Samson in particular as one who may have been foreordained but who, apparently, through his free agency, made some unfortunate decisions and failed to mature as the Lord expected him to. According to Brother Clark once more, I quote:<br><br><i>Samson could not be characterized as prophet, priest or king, yet, if our record is accurate, his birth was preceded by the appearance of an angel who declared that Samson would be dedicated to God's service, possibly as prophet, at least as judge and perhaps as priest. Service was not in Samson's mind. He ignored most of his heritage, trampled tradition, and instead of dedicating himself to deity, desecrated that which was most sacred, his calling. He pursued his own selfish interests, caused trouble and death wherever he went and finally died while destroying a handful of Israel's enemies, and in doing so gained his only reputation, that of a roaring Rambo of sorts, a folk hero. In reality, his life was wasted in self-indulgence, a life that missed the mark of self-mastery and failed in a sacred call to serve.</i>[David L. Clark, 24 May 1986 Stake Conference Address]<br><br>Prophets have been traditionally unpopular except among their own flock. A few like King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon enjoyed unusual popularity and brought peace to the land for many years. The fate of prophets has been grim at best. Several have been stoned to death. Jeremiah was left to die in a dungeon before he was rescued. Today we reflect with sadness on the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith. David L. Clark describes the Prophet Joseph as:<br><br><i>One foreordained as a "Choice Seer" to be raised up, but unlike Samson who failed in his calling, our first latter-day prophet did not fail in his call. He magnified his role as religious leader and prophet. He challenged the ecclesiastical authority of his day and questioned the political motivation of the secular authority, just as Jeremiah and Samuel the Lamanite. His message was uncomfortable to society at large and often was difficult for his own flock. His message was criticized, as have been the messages of most prophets, and when his message was too uncomfortable, he was abused and finally killed. And what did he accomplish? His ecclesiastical success is measured by 6 million members 156 years after the Church was organized, and his prophetic success is measured by how you and I live our lives, how we treat our neighbor, our brother, our God, and ourselves. Our successor prophets have been effective in different manners, each filling the need of the hour differently but in characteristic, prophetic ways.</i>[24 May 1986 Stake Conference Address]<br><br>Modern prophets down to President Benson have been criticized by ecclesiastical and secular authority because their messages were uncomfortable. Uncomfortable messages, perhaps so, but always the epitome of truth and<i>never,</i>I repeat<i>never,</i>subject to compromise. This Church is his church and is not subject to the capricious wishes of society or to meet a convenience of the day.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph's martyrdom was publicized on the front page of New York's leading newspaper. The account of what happened at Carthage Jail that day was fairly accurate. However, the final sentence read as follows: "Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, is dead--Thus ends Mormonism." If this Church had been the product of Joseph Smith's imagination, that would have indeed been the end. There is no doubt. But being the Church of Jesus Christ makes it another matter. Oh, that the editor of that newspaper could see into our day to witness a thriving church of 6 million members, 30,000 missionaries, 1600 stakes, and 39 dedicated temples. Oh, that he could know about a church that changes lives--a church that leads out in literacy, in educational pursuits, in Sabbath-day worship, in caring for its needy, and in so many ways demonstrating to the world the value of following those true Christ-like principles advocated by living prophets.<br><h2><b>Modern, Living Prophets</b></h2><br>Before closing, please allow me to share a personal story or two that might help to illustrate the effect that modern prophets have had on my life.<br><br>In what was then called the Hollywood Stake in Southern California, I was performing my duties as a young deacon assisting with the sacrament service each weekend. Our new chapel had just been dedicated. It was beautiful. We were so proud. We even had a separate sacrament alcove behind the bishopric seats on the stand. Bit by bit we tried to enhance our sacrament service. Red velour drapes were installed to be drawn apart at the precise psychological moment. Smaller drapes revealing a picture of the Last Supper were drawn just before the sacrament prayers were given. All of the deacons wore white shirts and black bow ties. And last but not least, we had worked out a system of musical chimes to signal the opening of the drapes and the sacrament prayers. It was the most beautiful and dramatic sacrament presentation ever devised in any dispensation. Even the stake president was impressed--so much so that he invited President Heber J. Grant to come and see the Church's new "Hollywood" version of the sacrament. President Grant accepted the invitation and witnessed what turned out to be our final presentation. We were taught in unmistakable, but kindly, terms what the sacrament service should be. I'll never forget that lesson. It was valuable not only to me, but to everyone else in that ward and in that stake.<br><br>While attending the Missionary Training Center in Salt Lake City, my companion and I went to the Church cafeteria (the Lion House) for lunch on our first day. We noticed several General Authorities eating lunch together, and we made our way quietly to the rear corner so we could see but not be seen. The next person through the cafeteria line happened to be the prophet, President Heber J. Grant. After paying for his food, he started toward the other General Authorities and then noticed out of the corner of his eye two greener-than-green missionaries sitting back in the corner. He changed his direction and shared his lunch period with us just to set us at ease, just to commend us on our new calling, and to share some stories about his own mission. How thoughtful! How kind! The scripture came immediately to mind, "But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matthew 23:11).<br><br>President George Albert Smith toured our mission in New Zealand when I was serving there as a young man. Soon after his return home, a personal letter came addressed to me from President George Albert Smith. He was asking my forgiveness as he had failed to extend a special greeting to me from my cousin who worked in the Church Office Building. His letter was so kind, so thoughtful, so gracious, and so typical of the seven modern-day prophets that I have had the privilege of meeting and being with. Each has demonstrated that great common denominator of Christ-like love, courtesy, and consideration for all.<br><br>While I was serving as mission president in New Zealand, President Spencer W. Kimball came to tour the mission. We were immediately impressed by his efficiency and by his overwhelming anxiety to "Do It!" As we previewed the tour schedule, he noticed that provision had been made for an occasional brief detour to visit a historic site or to stop and view one of the scenic attractions for which New Zealand is so famous. He took out his pen, and one by one he crossed out the diversions with a comment like "We will be too busy for that" or "Perhaps we could see this some other time." Then, all of a sudden, Sister Kimball spoke up and said, "Spencer, my brother Henry Eyring traveled halfway around the world to see the famous Waitomo Caves that you have just crossed out." Without hesitation, President Kimball said, "I think we will write that one back in, and this might be nice, too." You see, even prophets need a loving companion to help them keep a proper perspective.<br><br>Without vision the people perish. Consider this partial list of significant happenings of the past ten years or so<i>.</i><br><br>The priesthood power and authority was made available to all worthy male members of the Church at the appropriate time.<br><br>Regional Representatives were called to assist in the details of Church administration in a rapidly expanding worldwide Church.<br><br>Consider how the establishment of General Authority Area Presidencies worldwide is an outgrowth of what used to be Area Supervisors and then, later, Executive Administrators.<br><br>Think about the important decision to strengthen the priesthood line for carrying out the work of the Church rather than to depend so heavily on the traditionally large auxiliary boards of yesteryear?<br><br>Then, too, there is the decision involving the auxiliaries that was a part of the more significant and far-reaching Church correlation program. Herein all teachings and activities were organized and harmonized into a unified master plan designed to bless the members of the Church more abundantly.<br><br>Soon after the correlation program was introduced came the consolidated meeting plan. Many millions of dollars are being saved as Saints worldwide have been willing to share building and classroom space.<br><br>For more than a century members heard prophecies about temples one day dotting the land, and now all of a sudden in our day we jumped from seventeen temples to the currently announced total of forty-seven temples, thirty-nine of which have been dedicated.<br><br>May our voices ever blend with thousands of new members in the tops of the Andes, in New Guinea, in Africa, and in the islands of the sea as we all join in the spirit of one of our very favorite hymns, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us in these latter days." I testify to the truth of this work and of living prophets in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Robert L.

<h1>wels and Royal Purple - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>True Crown Jewels</b></h2><br>Royal weddings and state occasions are top news items in our world. The reason for that is that people in general, of nearly every nation and culture, enjoy the show, pomp and ceremony that these occasions feature. A conspicuous aspect of many of these occasions is the use of crowns and crown jewels, of royal purple, and other finery.<br><br>The use of crowns themselves is an ancient custom that seems to have four somewhat interrelated origins. Some crowns were first helmets, part of personal military gear. As the rank of the person increased, the helmet tended to become more elaborate, sometimes losing all pretense of being a protective device and serving solely to signify to all the high rank of the wearer. We see an example of this in the "scrambled eggs" on the visor of a naval officer's cap.<br><br>A second antecedent of the crown is found in the laurel wreaths that were anciently bestowed as honors on the heads of successful athletes. These were later bestowed on persons receiving honor and status of many kinds. The garlands became stylized, and we are probably seeing a version of the garland in the festive headbands some modern people wear.<br><br>A third antecedent of the crown is the religious headdress worn in many different cultures to suggest the possession of authority. These are represented in the modern world by the rather massive crown used in the coronation ceremony of the Pope.<br><br>A fourth related item is the bridal garland that is part of the traditional marriage regalia in many cultures.<br><br>All of these cultural streams converge in the regal headdress so familiar as part of the courtly trappings of European aristocracy, including crowns, coronets, and tiaras, each often festooned with precious gems according to the wealth and rank of the possessor. The investment of a fortune in such items has been deemed desirable to set the wearer apart from those of lesser status. Sometimes the common people of a nation are insulted if their leaders are not appropriately bedecked; they seem to take a vicarious pride in such ostentation. All of this provides the show and pageantry of which some people are so fond and that attract worldwide attention. Ordinary people tend to mimic royalty by wearing jewelry and expensive clothing even though they cannot indulge in crown jewels and royal purple. The highlight of some commoners' lives is to live and look like the nobles and the wealthy for a moment, perhaps to be "queen for a day."<br><br>Though the world is awed and carried away by the royal show of jeweled crowns and royal purple, it is important to remember that in the restored gospel frame of reference, those worldly indulgences are counterfeits of something good and spiritual. Crowns are counterfeits of true priesthood authority. Purple robes and other rich and royal vestments are counterfeits of the robe of righteousness that every person may wear and bear through faith in Jesus Christ. The jewels that are so costly and outwardly beautiful are counterfeits of the true concepts and principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ that make a life of righteousness possible. These precious jewel concepts, when properly cut and polished, become instruments through which the light of Christ is translated into understanding and good deeds in the life of a Saint.<br><br>Let us now turn to an examination of some of the precious jewels one may find in connection with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Like natural jewels, these concepts that pertain to godliness are first found rough and irregular, mixed with things of lesser value. The deposit to which we turn to seek out these treasures is the scriptures. The fullness of the scriptures is itself a treasure, but within the scriptures are some ideas that stand out as precious guiding lights when properly uncovered, shaped and polished, and installed in our system of thinking.<br><h2><b>The Concept of Fear</b></h2><br>An example of a real and eternal jewel is the concept of fear as found in the scriptures. As we turn to instances where the word "fear" is used, we see that fear is commended and commanded. In Deuteronomy 6:13 we read, "Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name." Samuel tells the children of Israel in 1 Samuel 12:14–15,<br><br><i>If ye will fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God:</i><br><br><i>But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers.</i><br><br>We see plainly from these scriptures and many others like them that the servants of God are to fear him.<br><br>But turning to other scriptures, we read passages such as the following in the same chapter in 1 Samuel just quoted:<br><br><i>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart;</i><br><br><i>And turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people.</i><br><br><i>Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</i><br><br><i>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.</i>[1 Samuel 12:20–24]<br><br>How is it that a prophet of God would tell the people both to fear and not to fear in almost the same breath?<br><br>We see the same problem in Isaiah. Isaiah counsels Israel in Isaiah 35:4: "Say to them that are of a fearful fear, Be strong, fear not: behold your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you." But Isaiah also says, "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread" (Isaiah 8:13). It sounds again as if we are both to fear and not to fear. Without further multiplying examples we can readily conclude that the concept of fear is important but needs to be clarified. But who shall we believe as to the correct concept of fear?<br><br>The one whom we should believe is, of course, the Lord himself. The written scriptures as we have them are our treasure mine. But the treasures do not jump out at us in ready-made splendor. We must search, hypothesize, test, correct, perfect, and live by what we find. The holy scriptures are our raw material; the revelations of the Lord that result from our diligent searching of the scriptures become our jewels, our keys to understanding and to faithful obedience.<br><br>Let us suppose we have made a diligent search of the scriptures, old and new, concerning fear. Having done that we are then in a position to make hypotheses in the attempt to lay out clearly and distinctly the concepts of the scriptures. If we have done our work well, every scripture should be clear and understandable with no contradictions. Great light should be shed on the topic, and it should tie beautifully with other correct concepts.<br><br>May I now share with you the results of my own personal search into the scriptures concerning the concept of fear. Without going through all the detailed steps of the search, I will give only my present conclusions, because every day as I think about the gospel and the scriptures, new light seems to come. A new insight in one area of ideas sheds light and new perspective on every truth hitherto discovered. Thus, one must constantly readjust his thinking to new and grander perspectives as the panorama of the Father's marvelous love for his children slowly takes shape and detail. This is exciting to experience. Of all the experiences a person can have, I suppose that learning the ways of God is perhaps next to the greatest of all experiences. I believe that the greatest experience is to have the privilege of putting those newly learned truths into action, to do the work of righteousness that correct concepts and true understanding make possible.<br><br>May I then share with you my hypotheses concerning fear. Please do not be tempted to believe what I say because I say it. I am not an authority to you. But I am your brother in Christ, and gladly share what I believe in the hope you may hear something that will cause you to make your own diligent search into these matters. For if you search in faith, I believe you will find and be greatly edified. Should you already have made your search, you will be able to compare notes and see where I have both scored and failed. Perhaps then, some occasion of testimony will bring your insights to me that I may then test your hypotheses. Thus may we all grow together in the knowledge of the Lord.<br><br>But on to my hypotheses as illustration of the true crown jewels.<br><h2><b>Fear One</b></h2><br>I see fear as an emotional state, a matter of the heart of man, having much to do with the choices he makes. But it seems from the examples we have already presented that there must be two different concepts represented by the English word "fear," which would explain why we are commanded both to fear and not to fear. I shall begin with the more ordinary variety and will call it Fear One.<br><br>Fear One is closely related to prudence; it is prudence with a powerful emotional charge. When one is prudent, he carefully calculates the results of his actions before doing anything, taking care to avoid results that are not desirable. When that prudence becomes an emotional, compelling force, it turns to Fear One. Examples of Fear One are fear of heights, fear of the dark, fear of spiders and snakes, and most important, the fear of death. I personally have known this fear strongly in the fear of not surviving graduate school and in the fear of not being able to support my family adequately. In many ways this kind of fear is a good thing. Fear of traffic may help a child to be wary of a busy thoroughfare. Fear of falling may temper some desires to climb. But this fear can also become a paralyzing phobia as when a person freezes high on a building and cannot rationally be induced to save himself. I suppose that every human being is well acquainted with Fear One, and that life for many of us is a precarious balance between the strength of desire for results that impel us to action and Fear One, which prevents us from doing many things. When Fear One prevents us from doing things we should not do, that is one thing. But often it also prevents us from doing what we well know we should do. So it is a mixed opportunity.<br><br>I see Fear One well represented in the scriptures. In Deuteronomy 28:58–67, the curse upon wayward Israel is couched in terms of this fear:<br><br><i>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</i><br><br><i>Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</i><br><br><i>Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</i><br><br><i>Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</i><br><br><i>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord thy God.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.</i><br><br><i>And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of the foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</i><br><br><i>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:</i><br><br><i>In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</i><br><br>Fear One has a complement concept in boldness. The more bold one is, the less Fear One one has, and vice versa. The fullness of Fear One is petrification, or the inability to act.<br><h2><b>Fear Two</b></h2><br>We turn now to build the concept of Fear Two by contrast. Fear Two is also an emotional state, a matter of the heart. But where Fear One is a negative emotion, Fear Two is largely a positive one. Fear Two is awe and respect and admiration for God and for his goodness. Fear Two begets reverence and faithful obedience to the commandments of God. Perhaps the clearest contrast between the two concepts of fear is seen in the relationship each has to sin. Fear One causes one to be afraid to sin for fear of the resulting punishment when justice comes. Fear Two, on the other hand, is a fear to sin lest one disrupt the plans and purposes of God in bringing to pass the salvation of all mankind. Fear Two trembles at the very thought of sin, as we see in the words of Nephi:<br><br><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth:</i>O<i>wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted. . . .</i><br><br><i>O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?</i><br><br><i>May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!</i>[2 Nephi 4:16–19, 31–32]<br><br>We see that Fear One is fear of the consequences of sin, fear for one's own skin, fear of the punishment that is surely to follow. It is a selfish fear, a concern only for oneself. Fear Two, by contrast, is fear of sinning, fear of harming others, fear of destroying the beautiful plan of blessing that God has ordained for all of his children here and now. It is not a fear for self, but a sorrow that one is weak and may harm others. It is a fear of thwarting God, of harming other persons; it even extends to plants and animals, which are also God's creatures. Fear Two is a reverence for all of nature, which is God's handiwork. Fear Two is the anguish of soul that causes a person to repent of all sin. Fear Two does not shrink from the penalties due for past sins. It gladly and willingly would suffer tenfold if that would do any good; but it learns that the freedom from sinning is inextricably coupled with the forgiveness for the debt of past sins. Fear Two cannot rest until repentance is complete and sin is done away with in the heart, mind, strength, and might of the person forever. Fear Two is also a concern for the welfare of others, an anxiousness when they will not repent.<br><br>A person driven by Fear One is obsessed with forgiveness of sins, if indeed he does believe in God and in an accounting. Fear One has a natural tendency to hope there is no God, and that there will be no day of accounting.<br><br>The salvation that Fear Two desires is to be free from sinning so that one will no longer inflict wounds on others. It so hungers and thirsts after righteousness that it is willing to forego eating and drinking, sleep and rest, riches and honors, even life itself in the quest for freedom from transgressing against the God it knows and reveres. Fear Two is not a motive open to atheists and agnostics. It is available only to those who have perceived the existence of God through the Holy Spirit and who worship to partake of more of the same.<br><br>Indeed, this Fear Two is a gift of the Holy Spirit, as we see in the account of the reaction of the people to the great sermon of King Benjamin:<br><br><i>And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</i><br><br><i>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</i>[Mosiah 4:1–3]<br><h2><b>The Fear of God</b></h2><br>Now it is possible to call Fear One worldly fear and Fear Two godly fear on the model of the distinction between worldly sorrow and godly sorrow. But if we do that we must be careful to maintain a distinction between Fear One of God and Fear Two of God. As an instance of Fear One of God, Isaiah describes the situation of the wicked of the house of Israel in the last days, when they realize that the prophets were right, that there is a God, and that he is actually visibly arriving on earth to recompense every man for his deeds:<br><br><i>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</i><br><br><i>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:</i><br><br><i>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</i><br><br><i>And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.</i><br><br><i>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty.</i><br><br><i>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</i><br><br><i>For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: . . .</i><br><br><i>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</i><br><br><i>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</i><br><br><i>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</i><br><br><i>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</i><br><br><i>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</i>[Isaiah 2:6–12, 17–21]<br><br>For an example of Fear Two toward God, we turn to Psalms 22:23–31:<br><br><i>Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</i><br><br><i>For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</i><br><br><i>My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</i><br><br><i>The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</i><br><br><i>All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.</i><br><br><i>For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governor among the nations.</i>. . .<br><br><i>A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</i><br><br><i>They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.</i><br><br>Thus we see that Fear One sees God as terrible and threatening, whereas Fear Two sees God as marvelous and wonderful, the object of adoration.<br><br>This difference between Fear One and Fear Two of God is reflected in an interesting passage in Isaiah that is also represented in the Book of Mormon. In Isaiah 29:13–14, the Lord himself laments that men have only Fear One for him, and therefore he will restore the true gospel to them that they might again worship in spirit and truth:<br><br><i>Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</i><br><br><i>Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</i><br><br>When men teach the fear of God to other men, they usually do it by preaching hellfire and damnation, or purgatory and limbo. Or they may portray God as a terrible and unloving being, sometimes as completely impersonal. Such may generate wariness and prudence but can never become the heartfelt adoration of Fear Two, which comes only as a gift of the Holy Spirit. To know God is first to know his Spirit.<br><br>If we know his Spirit, the thing that Holy Spirit teaches us is the nature and attributes of God in the pattern revealed in D&amp;amp;C 93:19–20:<br><br><i>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</i><br><br><i>For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.</i><br><br>That grace begins with fear of and for God. It seems to me that it does not really matter whether one begins with Fear One or Fear Two. What does seem to matter is the reaction. Either Fear One or Fear Two can come as a gift of the Holy Spirit. When received as this kind of gift, the receiver is turned toward repentance. In repentance and faith, Fear One always turns to and becomes Fear Two. The basic issue seems to be, when one fears, does one turn to God through the Holy Spirit or does one turn away and harden his heart? We read in Proverbs 1:7: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction." With either Fear One or Fear Two as a beginning, the humble servant of God progresses from grace to grace until Fear One grows into Fear Two, and Fear Two grows into a perfect love for God and for all of God's creatures. We read in 1 John 4:15–18:<br><br><i>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</i><br><br><i>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</i><br><br><i>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</i><br><br><i>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</i><br><br>This passage from John presents us with a problem. If perfect love casts out fear, is it Fear One or Fear Two that is cast out? Or is it both? I will venture an interpretation. My belief is that John was referring only to Fear One when he says perfect love casts out fear. One clue that this is his meaning is the phrase "fear hath torment." Fear One indeed has and is torment. But Fear Two has no torment, unless you wish to call the agony of hating one's own sins a torment. I deem John to be saying that when one accepts God's love and the redemption from sin and sinning that eventually attends the faithful, he ceases entirely to have any Fear One, for anything. I believe that same idea is reflected in D&amp;amp;C 63:17, where the Lord speaks concerning the fate of those who covenant with him and then deliberately go on and die in their sins:<br><br><i>Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the fearful, and the unbelieving, and all liars, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, and the whoremonger, and the sorcerer, shall have their part in that lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</i><br><br>Now we know that only the sons of perdition suffer the second death and that only those who take the covenants in this life can become sons of perdition. Therefore, it seems urgent that anyone who has taken the covenants needs to press on in the gifts of the Spirit until their trust in the Lord is great, until they can acknowledge his hand in all things, until they know there are no accidents of nature, until they know that not a sparrow falls without the Lord being aware of it, until they know that all things work together for their good for they who love the Lord. Then there is nothing to fear in the sense of Fear One.<br><h2><b>The Perfecting of the Soul</b></h2><br>If, then, we walk in the Spirit of the Lord, the Lord will lead us in the paths of righteousness, and in that path nothing can harm us in any eternal way--that is to say, in any important way. Wicked men may prey upon us, disease may fell us, war may ravage us, but through all of this we will know that the Lord is working out his eternal purposes. Though these may indeed hurt our body, if we love God they can in no way hurt our eternal spirit. Therefore we endure them without Fear One, knowing that the Lord is master of all, that he is fully mindful of our predicament, and that he is but using our faith and suffering to work out his eternal purposes for all of his other children as well as for us. Thus we will have no Fear One, no gripping concern for the future welfare of ourselves or of our loved ones, for we rest content to do our part in the Lord's great drama. Thus does love of God with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength, serving him in all things in the name of Jesus Christ, cast out all Fear One.<br><br>My hypothesis is that a righteous being maintains Fear Two always. Fear Two forms a tension with the pure love of God. We see on the one hand the enormity of sin and the inability of God to look upon sin with the least degree of allowance because of his justice. That is in appropriate tension with the love and mercy of God on the other hand. Fear of sinning stretches against love of God. I see this tension as the power by which a righteous being keeps himself eternally on the straight and narrow path of righteousness.<br><br>The righteous, those who are impassioned and motivated by Fear Two, see sin as a devastating destruction of the happiness of mankind. They recognize that God has prepared a celestial heritage for every human being, one that can be claimed in all important aspects even here in mortality. They come to realize that the potential of every human life is to do great good through our Savior in establishing and maintaining that celestial society to which all men are invited. They see that sin, which is selfishness, is the great destroyer of the blessings of mankind, and it even causes God himself to suffer. The terrible thing about sin is not that one has to pay for sin, as the believer in Fear One would have it, but that I cause everyone else to suffer here and now when I sin. He who understands Fear Two knows that he is hating God and each of his fellowmen when he transgresses the commandments of God. Such a one would far rather suffer himself than cause the least of these, his brethren, to suffer because of his own weaknesses. Thus he strives for perfection by making every sacrifice necessary to love the Lord God with all of his heart, yearning to receive it.<br><br>My conclusions about fear, then, are that Fear One is human fear of being hurt, and it fears God and sin because of the possibility of being brought to justice and thus having to suffer. Fear One is selfish, an attempt to protect one's own skin. Fear Two is godly fear, a gift of the spirit, a sense of awe and gratitude at the goodness of God and the life opportunity he has given. This awe and reverence makes one tremble at the very thought of sinning, or hurting someone else. The fullness and perfection of Fear Two is the perfecting of the soul through the sacrifice of repentance unto a perfect man, even to the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ. A person who has Fear Two is the God-fearing man of the scriptures, one who reverences God through faithful obedience, striving to love purely, even as God does.<br><h2><b>The Riches of Eternity</b></h2><br>Those are my conclusions about fear. These ideas are very precious to me; they are some of my jewels. But do not mistake them for the main point of my discourse with you today. The conclusions about fear are my conclusions, and are intended to be illustrative only. My main point concerns crown jewels and purple robes, if we may return to where we began. My belief is that the concepts and principles of the restored gospel have virtually infinite worth compared with the paltry dust of gold, silver, jewels, and expensive clothing. He who knows the ways of God has the riches of eternity, for having that knowledge, he can live the gospel of Jesus Christ and thus fulfill the work of righteousness. Those who lack that knowledge seem to know their lack and adorn themselves with that which has no life and cannot save. One beauty of the truths of the restored gospel is that they are not a limited resource. One does not need to deprive someone else to gain them. In fact, as they are shared, all grow richer.<br><br>We may all seek and obtain these riches by a simple process. The Father has ordained that we should have written scriptures. If we hunger and thirst after righteousness, these scriptures will be delicious to us. But the main thing we learn from them is that there is more. The fullness of the gifts of the Spirit, including all of the mysteries of godliness, are ours if only we will relinquish selfishness and begin to live by every word that proceeds forth out of the mouth of God. Through personal revelation we may share a fullness of all that the Father has, even unto eternal lives, but we must begin with a knowledge of him and his ways.<br><br>We may go to the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, in mighty prayer, fasting, scripture study--searching the words of the dead prophets but especially the words of the living prophets--pondering, piecing, hypothesizing, experimenting, feeling, thinking, and trying with all the power we have to search out the ways of God. I bear you my testimony that this is a very rewarding process.<br><br>The true jewels are of immense benefit to us. Even as light shines on earthly jewels and reflects visible light of pleasing color and brilliance, even so do the true concepts and precepts enable us to reflect the light of Christ into noble thoughts, clear ideas, and goodly deeds. Through correct gospel concepts and principles we receive and assimilate the riches of eternity. Through them we minister to our stewardship. Using them and the power of the priesthood, we have the ability to work mighty miracles unto the salvation of souls. In place of the purple robes of earthly royalty, we may enjoy the garment of the wedding feast when Christ comes as the bridegroom. Our wedding garment is the invisible sacrifices we make to keep our covenants and to minister to the poor and the needy out of the abundance that the Lord has given to each one of us. The true robes are the robes of righteousness, and they are spotless white, not royal purple.<br><br>We are saved no faster than we gain knowledge of the ways and goodness of our God. It is my prayer that we shall all be diligent in obtaining the true riches, that there will be no regrets when our eyes are opened in death and we realize that our whole life we lived in the hand of God. I believe that we shall then see that he was trying to bless us and help us all the while so we would not need to try to comfort ourselves with crown jewels and royal purple. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Chauncey C.

<h1>k of Joseph and the Stick of Judah - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We live in a glorious time in the history of the world when much of God's word has been restored, when living prophets are upon the earth again, and when many ancient treasures are available to all who will read them. Joseph the Patriarch, the son of Jacob, prophesied of one in the last days who would be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in bringing forth much scripture to bless his people. "And his name shall be called after me," said this ancient Joseph,<br><br>...<i>and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</i>[2 Nephi 3:15]<br><br>I give you my testimony of this Joseph, the Prophet of the Restoration. I know that he was a prophet of God. Of course this record that he was to bring forth to bring the Lord's people unto salvation is the Book of Mormon. Ezekiel, the exile prophet, foresaw the coming forth in the latter days of this book of scripture that had slept in the dust. He referred to it as the stick of Joseph. He foretold that the Saints of the latter days would combine it with the ancient stick of Judah, the Bible, and that the two would become one in their hand.<br><br>I will take these words of Ezekiel as my theme today and share with you some of my experiences of the past eighteen years as a student and teacher of these two great books of scripture.<br><h2><b>The Words of the Prophets</b></h2><br>In the middle 1970s I experienced something that awakened my interest in the Hebrew Scripture, or as we often refer to it, the Old Testament. I heard Elder Packer deliver a wonderful sermon in the Marriott Center in which he discussed the gifts of the Spirit. As he spoke I began to have an experience not unlike what he was discussing. In particular, I learned that I should begin to study Hebrew in order to be prepared for opportunities that may come.<br><br>I have dropped into a number of Hebrew classes in the past twelve years. I haven't given the language the time it needs and I am certainly not fluent, but I have learned enough to have received a great deal of enjoyment and edification from Hebrew Scripture and to gain a great love for the language, culture, and people of Judah. Through it I have discovered a marvelous source of insight into the Old Testament--the Soncino Bible. This is a Jewish publication with the Hebrew text on the right, corresponding English text on the left, and rabbinical commentary from the Talmud and other sources at the bottom. I seldom read it but what I find some great treasure. One very good way to learn about the ancient prophets of the stick of Judah is from the rabbinical commentators and through considering some of the Hebrew words. One really doesn't need much skill in Hebrew to gain at least some benefit from this. Even a few words are a good start. And even without any knowledge of Hebrew one can learn a great deal from the commentary. The rabbis have considered, contemplated, debated, and pondered the words of the prophets for many years, and they give us contact with the ancient traditions.<br><br>Consider, for example, this footnote to Zechariah 1, verse 20, where in our King James Version it speaks of four carpenters who come in the day when the Lord will comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem. These four come to "fray" the four horns or powers or nations that have scattered Judah. The Soncino English translation calls them "four craftsmen," and in the footnote "four smiths." I quote from the footnote:<br><br><i>These represent the agencies by which the enemies of Judah will be overthrown ... the four craftsmen represent builders and artisans who will take a leading part in the rebuilding of the Temple. ... In the Talmud (Sukkah 52b), the four craftsmen are identified with the Messiah the son of David, the Messiah the son of Joseph, the prophet Elijah, and the Righteous Priest</i>(Melchizedek). [A. Cohen, ed.,<i>The Twelve Prophets: Hebrew Text, English Translation and Commentary,</i>(Bournemouth, Hants: the Soncino Press, 1948), p. 276]<br><br>The Jews know who Elijah and Melchizedek are, and Christians know that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, son of David. But only one who knows about Joseph Smith, the prophet of the Restoration, will have an idea of who this fourth craftsman is, the messiah or anointed one who is the son of Joseph. I had often heard there was an ancient Jewish tradition about Messiah ben Joseph, the Lord's anointed in the latter days who would die at the hands of an angry mob, but before this I had never seen a reference to that tradition.<br><br>Or consider this that I recently read in Holtz's book,<i>Back to the Sources.</i>The Hebrew word<i>tzedakah,</i>which is usually translated as charity, comes from the root meaning justice and righteousness. It is related to the word<i>tzedek</i>found, for example, in the name Melchizedek, or<i>Melchi-tzedek,</i>meaning King of Righteousness. That gives one new ways to consider Mormon's great discourse found in Moroni 7 about how faith in Christ will bring one to have hope, and finally charity, and also Paul's discourse on charity in 1 Corinthians.<br><br>The Hebrew text of the Bible is filled with wordplays that do not come through in translation. Many of them add substantially to the meaning and joy of the scriptures. For example, Psalm 119 is much more interesting in Hebrew. It is an acrostic consisting of twenty-two sections of eight verses each, with all eight verses in the first section beginning with<i>aleph,</i>the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, all eight in the second section beginning with<i>beth,</i>the second Hebrew letter, and so on.<br><h2><b>"Mine Ancient Covenant People"</b></h2><br>Two and a half years ago I had an experience that I consider by itself to be repayment many times over for my meager offering in beginning to study this language of the ancient scriptures. I have, through my academic work, become close friends with a well-respected scholar who is also a rabbi. He has been very kind to me and has given me a number of professional opportunities. I learned from one of our mutual acquaintances that he is also an accomplished Hebrew scholar and student of the scriptures.<br><br>When I was in Baltimore in January 1984, I met with him about a joint writing project, and he invited me over to his home to spend the Sabbath. It was a profound experience, almost like a dream. I found that my friend is a collector and scholar of Judaica, with a very large home library of Hebrew texts centuries old (some on scrolls), ancient menorahs, seder plates, mezuzahs, etc. I think he was almost as surprised and elated as I was to find that a Christian could have such a consuming interest in these things that he loves so much. But as he told me about Kaballa, Yom Kippur, the ancient tabernacle and temple, the Shekinah (that is, the divine presence in the Holy of Holies), and the feasts and the holy days, I could see in it all the light of the doctrines of the Restoration. I kept thinking of Brother Nibley's description in one of his classes of Abraham and Sarah's hospitality for the weary traveler. My friend Aron and his wife, Sarah, prepared the dinner as their son Jonathan and I visited, and then we all rejoiced together in four hours of eating, dialogue, and singing. We discussed the Hebrew Scripture, the ideas that engage us, and the concerns of our lives. Occasionally we would sing; Aron would break forth with a hymn in Hebrew, would pass me the hymnbook pointing to the words, and we would all join in. The evening ended much too soon, but I will always remember it as one of the great experiences of my life, the culmination of many years of trying to comprehend "the law and the prophets," learn a few words of Hebrew, and understand the Lord's ancient covenant people. I came away from the experience not only with a deep love for Aron and Sarah and their son and an appreciation for the depth of their faith, but with an increased feeling of gratitude for the restored gospel and an additional testimony of its truthfulness.<br><br>This past November I was again near Baltimore for a convention, and again I was invited for Sabbath. This experience was every bit as great as the first. I joined with Aron as we faced the east and he recited, and I tried to read, Hebrew prayers and other scriptures, many of which I recognized from my study of the Law and the Prophets. And then, as we were ready to begin the Sabbath meal, he placed his hands upon his son's head and gave him a father's blessing. A number of times that evening I could feel the Spirit of the Lord present. I was amazed at the spiritual power of the law of performances, the schoolmaster to bring the Jewish people to the Messiah. I believe that it will indeed bring them to the Messiah.<br><br>This time we had many things to discuss, with it being just a few months since the difficulties connected with the BYU Jerusalem Center. Among other things I tried to explain to him how our beliefs differ from the rest of Christianity, especially our beliefs about the Jews and the scattered remnants of the house of Israel. For many of the Jews, the name "Christian" is associated with centuries of suffering and persecution at the hands of a Christianity gone awry. I told him about some of the prophecies found in the Book of Mormon concerning Judah and the house of Israel, and about something else important that I had recently read. Nephi had a vision of those dark medieval days of persecution and he said:<br><br><i>And also for the praise of the world do they destroy the saints of God, and bring them down into captivity.</i>[1 Nephi 13:9]<br><br>George Reynolds and Janne M. Sjodahl give this commentary on the word "saints" in that verse:<br><br><i>This refers, probably, to the Jews. The Jews, as a people, chosen by God and consecrated to his service, are called "saints.</i>" [<i>Commentary on the Book of Mormon,</i>vol. 1 (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1962), p. 114]<br><br>The persecutors foreseen by Nephi were to be enemies of all the saints of God, beginning with the children of Israel.<br><br>Last year I bought a book entitled<i>Back to the Sources,</i>edited by Barry Holtz. It is a collection of contemporary Jewish writings about the great books of Jewish tradition, such as Torah, the Prophets, Talmud, Midrash, Kabbalistic texts, the teachings of the Hasidic masters, etc. I read a number of things in that book that I wanted to discuss with Aron, but especially one particular thing almost seemed to jump off the page at me. On page 23 Holtz says,<br><br><i>There has been a kind of ongoing prejudice against the Jewish texts that is almost theologically inherent in Christianity itself. ... The Hebrew Bible was called the "Old" Testament (a term never used in traditional Jewish sources) to contrast it with the fully realized "New" Testament. The effect of such an approach is to undercut the validity</i>in its own terms<i>of the Jewish Bible, but more than that there is the implication that Jewish creativity must have ended with the "Old" Testament. ...</i><br><br><i>Thus any Jewish writing after the Bible is seen as necessarily insignificant. Judaism can have no contribution because, according to this view, it has been surpassed by the new religion and its teachings. Hence the persistence of Jewish literature--and Judaism itself--becomes a kind of ongoing embarrassment for Christianity. Perhaps that is why the Church burned the Talmud in the Middle Ages--as an attempt to deny the very existence of a living Jewish tradition.</i>[<i>Back to the Sources: Reading the Classic Jewish Texts</i>(New York: Summit Books, 1984)]<br><br>Aron believed me when I told him that we are worlds away from the rest of Christianity on this issue. We don't have this adversarial relation to Judaism. The traditions and the texts are not an embarrassment for us, but rather a source of edification, a connection to our roots. We believe that the religion Jesus taught was a restoration of something very ancient and pure, and that it ceased to exist upon the earth after the death of the apostles.<br><br>I quoted to Aron from 2 Nephi, chapter 29, where Nephi prophesies of the Gentiles of America in the latter days. Nephi foretells that they will reject the Book of Mormon when it shall come to them, and then he answers the Gentiles by telling of the great debt owed to the Jews for their pains in bringing the ancient scriptures to us:<br><br><i>And because my words shall hiss forth--many of the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.</i><br><br><i>But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?</i><br><br><i>O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.</i>[2 Nephi 29:3–5]<br><br>As we discussed these things, Aron became very thoughtful and spoke slowly and deliberately. He said that this was a very important thing for his people to know.<br><br>In the spirit of Nephi's admonition, I am thankful to the Jews for all they have brought forth for our edification. I am also thankful for the inspiring example of the spiritual life of so many of the faithful among them. The Sabbath for Aron and his family is a great joy. It is a delight, as Isaiah said it should be. We have been told by the Lord in Doctrine and Covenants 59 to celebrate the Sabbath in this same spirit. They look forward to it for the whole week as a celebration of the things of the Spirit. And learning to the faithful of Judah is a<i>mitzvah,</i>a divine commandment. Study for traditional Jews was not a mere intellectual endeavor; it was an act of devotion. They saw themselves as performing a holy act ordained by God. Learning has always been seen as a lifelong process in the world of traditional Judaism. The theme of this book,<i>Back to the Sources,</i>is that for a time in America many of the Jews were abandoning their traditions and not studying the traditional books, but in recent years there has been a great surge of renewed interest in these sources, a return to their roots.<br><h2><b>By the Mouths of the Prophets</b></h2><br>In<i>Mormon Doctrine,</i>Elder Bruce R. McConkie spoke of two gospels, both of them true:<br><br><i>Two true gospels are spoken of in the revelations and have been revealed to men as occasions have warranted; one is</i>the fullness of the everlasting gospel,<i>the other is the</i>preparatory gospel. [<i>MD,</i>p. 333]<br><br>We have been speaking about the preparatory gospel and about some of the records that have come to us from Judah. Now I would like to speak for a few minutes about our own tradition as Latter-day Saints and the stick of Joseph or the Book of Mormon, which contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel.<br><br>In this past April conference President Benson called upon us as a Church to return to our roots, to regularly and diligently study the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Now we not only need to</i>say<i>more about the Book of Mormon, but we need to</i>do<i>more with it. Why? The Lord answers: "That they may bring forth fruit meet for their Father's kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion.</i>" [Ezra Taft Benson, "Cleansing the Inner Vessel,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 5]<br><br>If we have the words of life from the Book of Mormon within our hearts and minds, they will grow within us and give guidance to our lives that we may do those things that will strengthen and build up the kingdom of God on the earth. If we don't have this we will not bring forth fruit.<br><br>On a Saturday afternoon shortly after this April conference, I was in my office at BYU trying to catch up on some of my academic work when I remembered President Benson's words. I started once more at the beginning of 1 Nephi. Within minutes I was immersed in one of the great scripture reading experiences of my life. I had never before noticed how much spiritual power is found in even the first chapter of the first book of Nephi. Chapter one by itself is a powerful scriptural document.<br><br>In this first chapter one can see a foreshadowing of the great teachings of the Book of Mormon concerning the scattering and the final redemption of the house of Israel. The record begins in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah:<br><br>...<i>And in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.</i>[1 Nephi 1:4–5]<br><br>In what then follows, we read of Lehi being called to prophesy to the Jews, comparable to the call of Isaiah in Isaiah, chapter 6. We read of his vision of the Father and of the hosts of heaven:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen.</i><br><br><i>And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.</i>[verses 7–8]<br><br>Can you imagine that? Numberless concourses of righteous, redeemed, celestial men and women with their voices raised in hymns of praise unto the Father. He also saw in vision Jesus and his twelve apostles:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day.</i><br><br><i>And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.</i>[9–10]<br><br>He then saw them go forth upon the earth, and Jesus came and stood before him and gave him a book to read in which Lehi received his prophetic burden to deliver to the Jews concerning the impending destruction of Jerusalem:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And he read saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.</i>[12–13]<br><br>But he saw much more than this vision of immediate impending doom, and what he saw caused him to rejoice:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!</i><br><br><i>And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him.</i>[14–15]<br><br>He must have seen the whole picture of the great saga of Israel and their eventual triumph in the last days. He must have seen the indomitable spirit of the faithful of Judah in their diaspora, how God would be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they should come, how their faith, their scriptures, their great and joyful traditions, and their holy days would be a comfort to them in their many years of tribulation. He must have seen their "labors and pains and diligence in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles" and seen Judah's eventual joyful triumph at the great Second Coming of the Messiah.<br><br>In 2 Nephi, Lehi's son Nephi tells his people about these marvelous latter-day events. He first reads to them from Isaiah.<br><br><i>Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</i><br><br><i>Shake thyself from the dust; arise. ...</i>[2 Nephi 8:24–25]<br><br>And then he comments:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel--</i><br><br><i>That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.</i><br><br><i>Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.</i>[2 Nephi 9:1–3]<br><br>The day will come when the Jews will be restored to the fold of God, and until that time God speaks to them by the mouths of the prophets. The faithful among Judah today love the words of the prophets and study them diligently. God still speaks to them through these holy men of old.<br><h2><b>The Promise of Eternal Life</b></h2><br>The promises of the Lord are not only given to nations, but also to individuals. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that<br><br><i>the ancients, though persecuted and afflicted by men, obtained from God promises of such weight and glory, that our hearts are often filled with gratitude that we are even permitted to look upon them.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 65]<br><br>This doctrine of promises has a great deal to do with how one obtains eternal life. The Book of Mormon teaches clearly, both by precept and also by examples from the lives of the Nephite Saints, how one can obtain promises from God.<br><br>Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.</i>[<i>HC,</i>4:461]<br><br>That is true. There is no other book upon the earth that is clearer in teaching the principles of how one gains eternal life than this restored stick of Joseph. Nephi's soul delighted in plainness, and the whole Book of Mormon is characterized by that kind of clarity in explaining the fundamental doctrines of the gospel.<br><br>In the third chapter of the Gospel of John, verse 5, we read these words of Jesus to Nicodemus:<br><br><i>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</i><br><br>Few scriptures have been misunderstood more than this one. The doctrine of spiritual rebirth and how one obtains eternal life through the Atonement is one of the "plain and precious truths" spoken of by Nephi that has been lost from the Bible, and there is a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding in the Christian world about it. But it is clearly taught in the Book of Mormon, and once one understands it, the relevant passages in the Bible take on new life and become clear.<br><br>President Marion G. Romney, in an October 1963 conference address, drew upon a number of scriptures from the Book of Mormon that explain this doctrine, and then gave this summary:<br><br><i>While conversion may be accomplished in stages, one is not really converted in the full sense of the term unless and until he is at heart a new person. "Born again" is the scriptural term.</i>[<i>CR,</i>Oct. 1963, p. 23]<br><br>He explains that one is not necessarily converted just because he or she holds membership in the Church, and furthermore, that<br><br><i>being converted, as we are here using the term, and having a testimony are not necessarily the same thing either. A testimony comes when the Holy Ghost gives the earnest seeker a witness of the truth. ... Conversion, on the other hand, is the fruit of, or the reward for, repentance and obedience. ...</i><br><br><i>Conversion is effected by divine forgiveness, which remits sins. The sequence is something like this: An honest seeker hears the message. He asks the Lord in prayer if it is true. The Holy Spirit gives him a witness. This is a testimony. If one's testimony is strong enough, he repents and obeys the commandments. By such obedience he receives divine forgiveness which remits sin. Thus he is converted to a newness of life. His spirit is healed.</i>[<i>CR,</i>Oct. 1963, p. 24]<br><br>We have a number of examples of this process in the Book of Mormon. One example is the record of Enos. As Enos begins the story, he already had a testimony of the gospel. His father Jacob had taught him in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. His conversion experience begins with his contemplation of the words of his father:<br><br><i>Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.</i><br><br><i>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it</i><br><br><i>reached the heavens.</i><br><br><i>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</i><br><br><i>And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.</i><br><br><i>And I said: Lord, how is it done?</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. ... Wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.</i>[Enos 3–8]<br><br>This has a great deal to do with the statement of Joseph Smith quoted earlier about the promises that were given to the ancient Saints. Enos first received the promise that he himself would be blessed, and then, as he continued to pray, he obtained more promises from the Lord--first for his brethren, the Nephites, and then for the Lamanites. This conversion experience came relatively early in his life, but then years later, after a lifetime of following the voice of the Spirit and fulfilling the commandments of God, he tells us of another kind of promise that he received of the Lord:<br><br><i>And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest. And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father.</i>[Enos 27]<br><br>Explanation of these principles by which one obtains eternal life are found in the teachings of the Resurrected Christ to the Nephites in 3 Nephi, chapter 11, and also in chapter 27. There he refers to them as "my doctrine" and "my gospel." But they were also given to Nephi, the son of Lehi, many years earlier, as found in 2 Nephi, chapters 31 and 32. Nephi refers to them as "the doctrine of Christ" and "the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" (2 Nephi 31 :21).<br><br>The fundamental principles in these discourses are what we all know as the first principles and ordinances of the gospel. I quote now from Nephi:<br><br><i>Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</i>[2 Nephi 31:17]<br><br>This is the gate by which one enters the earthly kingdom of God. But this is only the beginning:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 31:20–21]<br><br>This message to press forward with steadfastness and feast upon the word of Christ is the same as the counsel of our prophet to lengthen our stride, cleanse the inner vessel, and diligently study the Book of Mormon. If we are to receive the words of the Father giving us the promise, "Ye shall have eternal life," as Nephi describes, we must do these things and endure to the end.<br><br>As Nephi had taught these things to his people, they seemed to have difficulty understanding what they were to do after they had entered in at the gate in order to obtain the promise of eternal life. So he told them again in chapter 32, verse 3, that they should continue to<br><br><i>feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i><br><br>And he further said,<br><br><i>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</i>[verse 5]<br><br>These are the fundamental principles of the higher law for which the Law of Moses was a precursor. They are taught in a number of doctrinal discourses and with many examples from the lives of the people of the Book of Mormon. We have sampled but a few. In Doctrine and Covenants 20:9, the Lord said of the Book of Mormon that it contains "the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jews also."<br><br>We are blessed beyond measure to live in a time when all of these things have been restored, when the priesthood of God and the ordinances of his holy temple are upon the earth again. I know that the gospel is true. I am grateful for the heritage we have in these valleys of the Rocky Mountains, for the Prophet Joseph Smith and his successors, for the restoration of the keys of the priesthood and the fulness of the gospel, and for the scriptures that bless our lives, the stick of Joseph and the stick of Judah. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce L.

<h1>nts—A Choice Gift of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear fellow students, I am honored to speak to you this summer morning and approach this assignment with a humble heart and pray for the Spirit of the Lord to guide me in the things I say to you.<br><br>You have made a very wise choice in determining to further your education; I commend you all for attending this great university. For many of you I am sure it must have been a difficult choice because of attractive alternatives in life or possibly because of the lack of funds. But you chose wisely, and I counsel you to have the courage to continue to pursue your goal, regardless of obstacles that may be placed in your path.<br><h2><b>The Greatest Teacher</b></h2><br>You have many outstanding teachers in this important university, but today I would like to refer to the greatest teacher of them all, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Jesus did much of his teaching by the use of parables. In teaching in this manner he used familiar illustrations, such as farmers, seeds, sowing weeds and thorns, harvests, shepherds, sheep and wolves, and many other illustrations familiar to those he was teaching.<br><br>A beautiful example is the parable of the sower:<br><br><i>Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</i><br><br><i>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</i><br><br><i>Some fell upon the stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</i><br><br><i>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</i><br><br><i>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</i><br><br><i>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</i>[Matthew 13:3–8]<br><br>This parable given by the Savior provides one of the great lessons of life. We are also told that "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Galatians 6:7).<br><br>In the parable given, the sower had a choice to make--whether to prepare the soil for the seed or take a chance and sow the seed without preparing the ground, hoping that the seed would fall on good ground. He was, however, careless and chose to take a chance, sowing without preparing the soil. Some seeds fell by the wayside and were eaten by the birds. Some fell among thorns and were choked out. He learned that sowing where birds ate and where thorns choked was not profitable. Had he prepared the soil before sowing, he could possibly have reaped one hundredfold. This sower truly witnessed the truth of the statement that "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." The choice he made before sowing commenced determined to a large extent the harvest he was to reap.<br><br>Of course, we all have our free agency, and as the poet so ably expressed:<br><br><i>Know this, that ev'ry soul is free</i><br><i>To choose his life and what he'll be;</i><br><i>For this eternal truth is giv'n:</i><br><i>That God will force no man to heav'n.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 240]<br><br>Each of us has the opportunity and responsibility of deciding what we will do and what we will be.<br><br>Through modern revelation, God's relationship to man has again been clarified. I ask you to seriously consider the fact that the life of your earthly body is your spirit and that God the Eternal Father is the father of your spirit.<br><br>What a tremendous effect this has in the lives of those who accept this doctrine. Our Father in Heaven loves each and every one of us and is interested in our welfare and growth and development. In fact, it is his work and glory "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Again, let me say that we know not only that we have a spark of divinity within us, but that we are actually spirit children of our Heavenly Father and that every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God (see D&amp;amp;C 46:11).<br><br>With this relationship, we are thus blessed with many talents and possess great possibilities. The Savior set our greatest goal for us when he said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). To become perfect requires growth and development, and as we contemplate perfection, we recognize that growth is the greatest phenomenon of this existence.<br><br>This Church teaches the value and necessity of eternal progression. We progressed in the premortal existence, and it is our responsibility and opportunity to progress in this estate and throughout all eternity. During his earthly ministry the Savior gave two parables dealing with the requirement that we must develop the talents with which we are endowed. These parables are the parable of the entrusted talents and the parable of the pounds.<br><br>The talent was an ancient weight and money unit.<br><br>The dictionary defines talent as "the abilities, powers, and gifts bestowed upon a man; natural endowments; thought of as a divine trust. A natural capacity or gift."<br><br>The parable of the entrusted talents was given to the Savior's apostles, and in it the Savior told of a man who was about to leave on a long trip and who, therefore, called his servants together and gave them his goods. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. To each man he gave according to his ability.<br><br>While the master was away, the one that received five talents put them to use and made five more talents. The one that received two talents put them to use and made two more. But the one that received the one talent hid it in the ground.<br><br>After a period of time, the master returned and asked for an accounting. Unto the servants that had doubled their talents the master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:23).<br><br>The master called the servant that hid his talent and did not multiply it a slothful servant, and said he would take the one talent from him and give it to the servant that had ten talents.<br><br>Whereas, the parable of the entrusted talents was given to his apostles, the parable of the pounds was given to a mixed multitude on the Savior's last journey from Jericho to Jerusalem (see Luke 19), and although there are some differences in the two parables, in essence they teach the same truths and principles.<br><br>From the man endowed with many talents more was expected than from the men with lesser talents, yet all were expected to multiply such talents as they were given. In each parable, although relatively little was expected of the men given one talent or one pound, each failed to use his talent. Good use of the talent on the part of the man given one talent was just as important and necessary as on the part of the men given two and five talents.<br><br>In this dispensation the Lord has been equally direct in his charge to his children. He has told us that he has given us many things, "For the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talents, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold" (D&amp;amp;C 82:18).<br><br>He has admonished us that "Of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3). He also says,<br><br><i>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of men. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2–3]<br><br>And then we are charged, "Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known" (D&amp;amp;C 60:13). The Savior evidenced little regard for the slothful servant. He expects us to work and to use our initiative. These scriptures clearly emphasize our obligations to use and develop the gifts and talents we have been blessed with--or shall we say to develop the spark of divinity within us? Human experience confirms the soundness of this doctrine.<br><h2><b>How To</b></h2><br>All of us should be concerned about<i>how</i>to best develop our gifts and talents. First, we should recognize our talents and make up our minds to pay the price necessary to develop them. The price to be paid in developing talents includes among other things faith, study, and persistence.<br><br>In developing faith we must never overlook the fact that we are spirit children of God the Eternal Father and that our Father in Heaven will assist us in developing our talents as we do our part. One way in which he will assist us is to open up opportunities for us to use our talents.<br><br>Some recognize their talents, but we are told they do not use them because of the fear of men.<br><br>Fear destroys faith and deprives us of many blessings. This is clearly brought out in a revelation when the Lord said,<br><br><i>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 67:3]<br><br>We must therefore overcome fear. The Lord has told us that if we are prepared, we shall not fear (see D&amp;amp;C 38:30).<br><br>Preparation involves study, and we are also counseled to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). President Benson has specifically suggested that we study the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Eternal progress involves continual study. Increased learning gives us confidence, and confidence engenders faith, and faith banishes fear. I therefore encourage you to never cease to study--this being an important part of developing your talents. We should appreciate that talents are developed by use, and they will not grow and multiply unless they are used.<br><br>This principle was clearly taught in the Savior's parables. As we develop our talents, we should develop the spirit of sharing or giving, not only with those who are closest to us but with all of God's children. Remember the words of King Benjamin: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). The Lord wants us to enjoy our talents, but he also expects us to use them for the enjoyment and benefit of others and to build the kingdom of God.<br><br>Today we hear much about the need of challenges for the youth as well as for our senior citizens. Despite the fact that we are living in a troublesome period, we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, a most wonderful period in the history of the world--yes, in a new era of growth and development. Opportunities today, for young and old, exceed those of any other age.<br><br>We should be grateful to live at this particular time when the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the people of the earth so abundantly. One of the important and distinguishing features of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that its affairs are administered by the lay members of the Church rather than by paid clergy.<br><br>I have been told by some of my nonmember friends that the thing about the Church that has impressed them the most is that it gives every person a chance to serve regardless of his age. How true this is.<br><br>The Church in reality is a vehicle for the growth and development of God's children. The priesthood quorums, Primary, Young Women, Sunday School, Relief Society, and other Church organizations in their various activities and programs, all contribute to the development of their members' talents and provide opportunities for them to be shared with others.<br><br>Thus, as stated, exciting and challenging leadership opportunities are afforded men, women, and children of all ages to become involved in interesting and worthwhile projects. This is not only a great opportunity, but likewise a responsibility for Church members because the future growth of the Church is dependent upon the development of leaders--leaders for the general Church administration as well as for missions, stakes, wards, priesthood quorums, auxiliaries, and other Church organizations and activities.<br><br>Talents may be developed in many areas of teaching, speaking, missionary work, music, drama, dancing, athletics of many kinds, Scout work, genealogical work, temple work, welfare programs, compassionate service, and many other fields that might be mentioned--all contributing to the development of talents and leadership.<br><h2><b>Do You Feel Inadequate?</b></h2><br>Frequently, when a person is asked to accept a position in the Church he is prone to say, "Oh, I can't do that. I haven't as much experience or education as someone else who may have been serving." But with our faith, study, work, and prayer, the Lord will make it possible for us to accomplish things that seem impossible.<br><br>Our measuring stick should not be someone else's accomplishments but our own capabilities. Are we truly doing our best? Are we anxious to develop our talents to the greatest degree and use them in building the kingdom of God? When a person does this he develops his talents, is happy, and grows in knowledge and spirit. The Lord will make you equal to every task you are called upon to perform as you do your part.<br><br>President Heber J. Grant used to frequently use this quote: "That which we try to do, and persist in doing, becomes easy to do, not because its nature is changed, but because our power to do is developed" (Josiah Gilbert Holland [Timothy Titcomb, pseud.],<i>Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs</i>[New York: Charles Scribner, 1859], 291). President Grant exemplified this principle throughout his entire life, and his persistence no doubt played a great part in many of his accomplishments.<br><br>As a young man I was thrilled and inspired by the stories of this great Church leader--how, even though seemingly lacking in some talents, through determination and persistence he developed outstanding skill. As a boy he was a very poor penman, and his teacher criticized his writing, saying it was almost impossible to read. This was a challenge to President Grant, and he practiced writing hours upon hours until he finally became an expert penman.<br><h2><b>Magnify Each Talent</b></h2><br>Recently I listened to a new convert tell in a meeting how he had three Church assignments. First, he put the flag up each day in front of the chapel. He then briefly explained the meaning of the flag to him. Second, he kept the hymnbooks in repair. Here he mentioned how these hymns were so inspiring and contained much doctrine and prophesy. He briefly referred to the hymn "O, My Father" and its reference to a Mother in Heaven. Third, he was a home teacher and explained what this service can mean to both the teacher as well as to the person being visited and taught.<br><br>This man enjoyed and appreciated these three opportunities to serve and was blessing the lives of others as well as magnifying his talents.<br><br>Sometimes we hear of someone thinking his or her assignment is not very important. This reminds me of a young man who gave his intended wife a diamond engagement ring. In doing so, he remarked, "It isn't very big." Whereupon she replied, "It's as big as we make it." There are no unimportant callings in the Church.<br><br>This is a time of preparation for some other assignment and responsibility. We will be given increased opportunities and responsibilities as we serve with an eye single to the glory of God. We will be magnified and our talents will be increased--yes, even a hundredfold (see D&amp;amp;C 82:18). As we develop our talents and share them in serving our fellowmen, we will find great peace, happiness, joy, and contentment, as well as growth and development.<br><br>As previously stated, we are living in a troublesome period, but we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, when, in my opinion, the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out on the face of the earth more today than ever before.<br><br>I am grateful that my spirit was reserved to come to this earth at this time--in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This dispensation was opened by one of the greatest manifestations of the Godhead ever made to man when God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared to the boy Joseph Smith. Through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness was restored, the power to act in the name of God was restored, and God's church was reestablished upon the earth with apostles and prophets guiding and directing the affairs of the kingdom of God on the earth today.<br><br>I bear you my witness that our beloved prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, is guiding this Church under the direction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Most of you have this same testimony. What a tremendous effect this knowledge has in the lives of those who accept his doctrine. We know that our Father in Heaven loves us and is interested in our welfare, growth, and development. Yes, he has said, "This is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>May we live the gospel principles and follow the counsel of our leaders, and may the choice blessings of our Father in Heaven be with you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Franklin D.

<h1>l Go, I&#039;ll Do, and I&#039;ll Be: Three Steps To a Monumental Life - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear fellow students, I am thrilled to be with you on this memorable occasion and to share it with my sweet companion, Dantzel, my father, Marion C. Nelson, and other members of our family. I should like to pay tribute to you and to those unseen who are similarly sacrificing that you might be here. All are here to learn. Some may also be happy for a temporary escape from diapers and dishes. But batteries do need to be recharged, and such regeneration comes from all that goes on in such a marvelous week as you have before you.<br><br>Last month a major focus of attention was the Statue of Liberty for her one hundredth anniversary and the celebration of her remodeling. While most monuments are erected to people or specific events, this one is indeed unique. Lady Liberty commemorates an ideal. But this and other monuments can teach us very important lessons about life.<br><br>Those lessons are linked to your theme of the week, "The Process of Becoming." They are also embraced in the words of the song we have sung, "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 270). Within its text are several powerful commitments to action, including I'll go (where you want me to go), I'll do (thy will with a heart sincere), and I'll be (what you want me to be).<br><br>By applying these concepts to personal development, each one of us here today can help build a monumental life. Through the process of becoming, you may go, do, and be a living monument. A monument requires a base to support the vertical shaft of its statement. The Statue of Liberty has a splendid 89-foot pedestal erected on a 65-foot star-shaped base.<br><br>A monumental life also begins with a broad base of understanding. This is one reason you are here today--to learn and acquire information and inspiration that will strengthen your pedestal of preparation. But you know that knowledge itself is rarely monumental. Just as pancake batter cannot make pancakes until exposed to heat, more than knowledge is required to mold a monumental life.<br><br>Three steps in the process of forging a monumental life from its base are neatly tucked in the verses of our song--I'll go, I'll do, I'll be. These three statements constitute the outline of my message.<br><h2><b>I'll Go</b></h2><br>Step one is "I'll go." But before we go anywhere, it is good to consider where we have been. Life's journey did not start with our first mortal breath. Prior to our birth, we were with God as his spirit children. We walked with him, talked with him, and knew him. We shouted for joy with the prospects of a journey to planet Earth to gain a physical body and to experience unique challenges here. I suspect we were terrified, at first, when told we would forget Father, friends, and facts we formerly knew so well. I can believe we were calmed when informed our Father in Heaven would provide prophets and scriptures to guide us and would provide a means whereby we could communicate with him through prayer and the spirit of revelation. But still we may have been a bit insecure when we learned that faith--faith to believe the intangible--was the key to success in our journey. Faith was to be the critical component in our safe return to our Father in Heaven. Few have had better insight than did Abraham, who recorded,<br><br><i>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</i><br><br><i>And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</i><br><br><i>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i>[Abraham 3:22–25]<br><br>Once here, the journey through life for each of us may include other travels in order to meet our personal rendezvous with destiny. Father Lehi and Mother Sariah departed from the wealth and security of Jerusalem to trek for many days across hot desert sands to the eastern shores of the Red Sea. Then Lehi asked his sons to return to Jerusalem to get the brass plates of Laban. What did that assignment entail?<br><br>If we were to compare that trip to our own area, we would have walked a distance nigh equivalent to that from Provo to St. George, across scorching sand with no freeways, no air conditioning, no cold drinks. Then how would you like to be asked to walk all the way back to Provo, tackle a tough assignment, and then walk back to St. George? No wonder Laman and Lemuel murmured! That was the setting for this matchless statement by Nephi:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>You know the story. They eventually returned with the brass plates. Even Mother Sariah had complained when her sons were required to make this long, hazardous journey. Shortly thereafter, they were told by their father to return<i>once again</i>to Jerusalem, this time to get Ishmael and his family. Perhaps each young man felt a bit better about it this time, knowing there was the possibility he might be rewarded with one of the daughters of Ishmael to become his wife. This rugged discipline was but prologue to their going subsequently all the way across what we now know as the Saudi Arabian Peninsula to its southeastern shore, where ships were to be built. And this challenge was but prelude to their ultimate destiny--to go across ocean waters to the promised land.<br><br>In fact, much of scriptural history reports requirements of the Lord's prophets and people to go to their particular proving grounds. For David, his destiny with Goliath required him to go to the valley of Elah (see 1 Samuel 17:19). Moses had to go to the heights of Sinai and to the depths of the Red Sea, whose waters had been parted by the power of the priesthood he bore (see Alma 36:28).<br><br>Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and our early pioneer predecessors had to go from the eastern extremity of the United States to Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and then across a hostile environment where they established the mountain of the Lord's house in the top of the mountains (see Isaiah 2:2; 2 Nephi 12:2) at a place we now know as the world headquarters of his church.<br><br>All eight of my great-grandparents, individually converted to the Church in populous nations of Europe, had to go from their family and the comforts of home to this new land and across its challenging terrain eventually to settle in the little town of Ephraim, Utah.<br><br>Each one of us will have to go to unique testing grounds of faith. For some it may be abroad, or on missions, for preparation or assignment far beyond comforts of home, family, and friends. For others, particularly you busy young mothers or fathers, your appointment with destiny is within the walls of your home. Your enemy is neither hot sands of the desert, nor smoking guns of foes in pursuit, but heated efforts of the adversary to undermine your marriage and/or the sanctity of your family unit. For the monument of your life to rise from its pedestal of preparation to your appointed site of destiny you must go where the Lord wants you to go. Wherever it is, go. Go with the same faith that allowed you to leave your heavenly home in the first place.<br><h2><b>I'll Do</b></h2><br>Step two is "I'll do." These words remind me of the development of the song "I Am a Child of God." When lyricist Naomi W. Randall first composed the words to this hymn, they read, "Teach me all that I must<i>know,</i>to live with him some day." Before he became President of the Church, President Spencer W. Kimball suggested that the word "know" be changed to "do." President Kimball, explaining why he wanted the change, said, "To know isn't enough. The devils know and tremble; the devils know everything. We have to do something" ("New Verse Is Written for Popular Song,"<i>Church News,</i>April 1, 1978, p. 16).<br><br>As President Kimball implied, some foes of righteousness may actually know more than many of us here know. To know isn't enough. Even today, a few very knowledgeable physicians still smoke cigarettes. They know better. Some Latter-day Saints know about such divine laws as chastity, tithing, or honesty, but experience difficulty in doing what the law requires.<br><br>There are more things to do in life than there is time available in which to do them. That means choices need to be made. Choices are often facilitated by asking well-focused questions. Some may be thoughtfully tendered in prayer.<br><br>Joseph Smith recorded his question: "My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join" (JSH 1:18). The unexpected answer: "Join none of them" (JSH 1:19).<br><br>Such a question, asked with determination beforehand to do whatever is learned, will bring heavenly direction.<br><br>For example, near the end of the Book of Mormon is this challenge: "If ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent [meaning you intend to do], . . . he will manifest the truth of it unto you" (Moroni 10:4). Intent is an important part of the formula that preceded testimony, which brought many of us into the Church.<br><br>How did we get the Word of Wisdom? Joseph first asked an important question. In answer to fervent prayer with intent<i>to do</i>the revealed will of the Lord, section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants was received by revelation.<br><br>What preceded the vision of the redemption of the dead? President Joseph F. Smith pondered (not just read) the writings of Peter (see D&amp;amp;C 138:1–5). Pondering the scriptures is done with an inquiring mind.<br><br>What predated the revelation on the priesthood received by President Spencer W. Kimball in 1978? Extended meditation and intelligent inquiry, prayerfully posed in the holy temple.<br><br>Now, I notice your Campus Education Week program lists over eleven hundred offerings, and before you can start to<i>do,</i>you must ask, "What do I want to do?" Then you may properly select those classes that will help you do those things that are uniquely yours to do. That question involves your purpose and your destiny.<br><br>Can you summarize the goal of your life and state it in a simple sentence as did the Savior? He said, "My work and my glory--[is] to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Counsel from President Joseph F. Smith was concisely stated: "The important consideration is. . . how well we can. . . discharge our duties and obligations to God and to one another" (<i>GD,</i>p. 270).<br><br>Should that concept not be part of your greatest goal, if you truly believe in God and believe you are one of his children preparing to return to him? And if it truly is your objective, can there be any action appropriate for you to do other than to keep his commandments?<br><br>This was the plea of the Savior, who reported, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 7:21). Another writer so recorded this inquiry: "Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46). James admonished: "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" (James 1:22). King Benjamin also confirmed this concept. He said, "If you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10).<br><br>One of life's interesting challenges is that while you are doing one thing, you are not doing other things. So while you are here at Campus Education Week, you are not elsewhere, thereby assuming some risks. Partners, children, and other interests are among those at risk. Sister Nelson and I have occasionally taken leave from an engagement saying, "It's time for us to go home now and see what our children are doing and tell them to stop."<br><br>There is also a risk of discouragement when you return to your usual routines. During this week you will meet many wonderful people who are all on their best behavior. You will meet skilled teachers who have prepared well for countless hours and who successfully make it seem as though their lesson simply rolls out with such apparent ease. But don't forget, their lives' efforts are represented in that service. When you return home to cobwebs and dust and your own pile of problems that haven't gone away during your absence, don't be dejected because you were not sufficiently braced for the reality of your reentry.<br><br>Remember, educational opportunity is not confined to time or place. There is nothing magic about an institution, be it Harvard, Stanford, MIT, BYU, or any other. Personal motivation is more essential to education than campus setting. Fortunately, those of you here this week have both, and I admire you. But exciting, entertaining, charismatic teachers are not nearly as fundamental to the attainment of your goals as are your desire and your determination.<br><br>If the most important things in life are to know God and to keep his commandments, then to heed his prophets and abide their teachings should be among our most important educational objectives. In a way, the very repetition of the teachings of prophets may have sounded monotonous through the years. The pleadings of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and Abinadi have not differed significantly from those of President Lee, President Kimball, or President Benson. Surely, when measured by eternal standards, teachings of the prophets are more important and enduring than the latest findings of competent researchers, even if these findings were both discovered and taught by use of modern technology and teaching aids.<br><br>Success at the end of this week will be determined largely by individual desire to learn. When you crave learning as much as you want to satisfy pangs of hunger, you will achieve your desired objective. When you return home, you will want to continue to satisfy your hunger and thirst for righteousness and the word of God on your own.<br><br>I was with Elder Mark E. Petersen in the Holy Land in October 1983, during his last mortal journey. Elder Petersen was not well. Evidences of his consuming malignancy were so painfully real to him, yet he derived strength from the Savior he served. Following a night of intense suffering, aggravated by pangs of his progressive inability to eat or to drink, Elder Petersen addressed throngs assembled at the Mount of Beatitudes to hear his discourse on the "Sermon on the Mount." After he recited "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness," he departed from the biblical text and pleaded this question: "Do you know what it is to be really hungry? Do you know what it is to really be thirsty? Do you desire righteousness as you would desire food or drink under extreme conditions? [The Savior] expects us to literally hunger and thirst after righteousness and seek it with all our hearts!"<br><br>I was one of the few present on that occasion who knew how hungry and thirsty Elder Petersen really was. His encroaching cancer had deprived him of relief from physical hunger and thirst. So he understood that doctrine. He withstood the trial. He thanked the Lord who lent him power to preach his last major sermon at the sacred site where his Lord Jesus had preached.<br><br>Counsel was given by another prophet who said, "Feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted" (2 Nephi 9:51). Nephi added: "If ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end. . . : Ye shall have eternal life" (2 Nephi 31:20). Even though Elder Petersen was deprived of full physical feeding, he continued to feast upon the words of his Savior. He endured to the end, and I know he earned that promised reward.<br><br>To facilitate your feast, may I share a personal pattern of scriptural study that may also be helpful to you? I have marked my new LDS edition of the King James Version of the Bible to highlight enrichment material from three alternate translations. I have colored those little letters above the biblical text that draw attention to corresponding footnotes below, which I have colored with little round dots. Those citations from Hebrew I have marked with blue circles over both the cross-referenced superscript letter and the corresponding footnote below. The Old Testament comes to us primarily from the Hebrew language or those languages closely associated with Hebrew.<br><br>The New Testament comes to us primarily from the Greek language. Thus, frequently the alternate translation from the Greek adds significantly to a better understanding of the New Testament. The little superscript letters and corresponding footnotes from Greek I have marked with green circular dots.<br><br>For those passages clarified by excerpts from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, I have marked the little superscript letters and corresponding footnote citations with red circular dots. Now, whenever I turn to a page of scripture, I can immediately spot those special insights provided by this enrichment material.<br><br>The importance of these enhancements was taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who made this interesting statement: "Our latitude and longitude can be determined in the original Hebrew with far greater accuracy than in the English version" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 290). But more about that later when we get to the third step of our discussion.<br><br>I note from the program that many course offerings are classified under "parenting," which, of course, includes grandparenting. I think it's time to tell a story about grandchildren. I should like to honor all who are grandparents here today and ask them to stand and be recognized. Would all grandparents please arise? What a marvelous sight!<br><br>Now, while you continue to stand, will those who are not yet grandparents stand as well, as I think you all need a little rest. You can stand while I tell you a true story--a one-on-one encounter between one of our grandchildren and her grandmother. It occurred during one of those special moments when they were alone. Grandmother asked our seven-year-old granddaughter, "Do you think I look younger with my glasses on, or with them off?"<br><br>The granddaughter replied, "Well, try them on, and now, try them off." Her grandmother complied. Our granddaughter then said, "Do it again, Grandmother. First put them on, and then take them off." And so her grandmother again demonstrated. Finally, the granddaughter, after asking her grandmother to repeat the exercise a third time, said conclusively, "Grandmother, its older either way."<br><br>Sensing that her candor may have exceeded her diplomacy, our granddaughter then added, "Grandmother, have you tried Oil of Olay?"<br><br>Thank you. Now, as you return to your seats, I notice there are eight courses offered under the classification of aging.<br><br>Each time I go to the barbershop, I see the sheet that has been swirled about me has collected clippings that are grayer and scantier than the time before. But seriously, I give thanks for the aging process. Yes, I am grateful to be alive to participate in it. Our bodies are such magnificent creations. The healing power in each one of us causes broken bones to heal and cuts and bruises to repair themselves. Contemplate what would happen if you could create a chair that would repair its own broken leg, or if you could make stockings that would mend their own runs. If you could do that, literally, you could create dynamic life that would perpetuate itself infinitely.<br><br>Our bodies, capable of self-repair, would do the same thing, were it not for aging. Life on this earth would be without end and without hope of eternal life with our father, mother, and loved ones, if the healing process responded in this marvelous way to all injuries and illnesses. That hope we had in the beginning, to return to our Father in Heaven, would be but a baseless dream were it not for the assurance provided by the aging process. Alma so taught his son Corianton: "It was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would<i>destroy</i>the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8; emphasis added). Be grateful for the privilege of aging and all that it provides.<br><br>These marvelous bodies deserve our best daily care. So, as you consider optional courses on fitness and sports, health, and self-improvement, may you remember that no code of health can compare with section 89 in the Doctrine and Covenants for brevity, content, and efficacy.<br><br>Things do go wrong with these bodies from time to time. Lady Liberty and those of us eager to prolong useful life can appreciate help provided by necessary and timely repairs. And we should remember the remarkable principle revealed by our Creator to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies" (D&amp;amp;C 84:33).<br><br>Those choosing courses on family, human relationships, marriage, parenting, and time management--keenly aware of pressures of priority at home, at work, and in the Church, would do well to remember this revelation: "Thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family" (D&amp;amp;C 23:3). Thus, service in the Church is not competitive, but is essential to anneal our families.<br><br>As we review these things to do, we see they eventually lead us to that third step of our discussion today--"I'll be."<br><h2><b>I'll Be</b></h2><br>"To be" involves the "Process of Becoming." That is the theme of your Campus Education Week.<br><br>The word<i>becoming</i>appears in the standard works in only nine verses of scripture. Two of those references pertain to the Lord's becoming who he was (see Mosiah 15:3; 15:7). A third verse pertains to the mortal body and its becoming spiritual and immortal at the time of the resurrection (see Alma 11:45).<br><br>All six remaining verses employing this word refer to the ongoing battle of the flesh<i>becoming</i>subject to the spirit. We feel this every day as carnal temptations of the flesh contend with our deeper desire for spiritual supremacy (see Mosiah 15:5, 16:3; 27:25; Alma 12:31; 13:28; Helaman 3:16).<br><br>In this world of carnal competition for our fidelity, the "process of becoming" necessarily involves self-mastery--supremacy of the spirit over appetites of the flesh. We sang, "I'll be what you want me to be." Question: What does the Lord really want you and me to be?<br><br>He has given us the answer definitely and repeatedly. In the Sermon on the Mount he taught his disciples, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>My little red circular dot at Matthew 5:48 draws attention to a footnote where I find an even stronger statement from the Joseph Smith Translation: "Ye are therefore<i>commanded</i>to be perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (JST Matthew 5:50; emphasis added).<br><br>To his disciples on the American hemisphere, the resurrected Lord so proclaimed this divine injunction: "I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect" (3 Nephi 12:48).<br><br>How do we explain these similar but significantly different statements? Between the time of his Sermon on the Mount and his sermon to the Nephites, the sinless Savior had become perfected by his atonement.<i>"Perfect"</i>in Matthew 5:48 comes from the Greek word<i>teleios,</i>meaning "complete," and is derived from the Greek word<i>telos,</i>which means "to set out for a definite point or goal." Thus, this scripture conveys the concept of conclusion of an act. Therefore,<i>perfect</i>in this scripture also means "finished," "completed," "consummated<i>,"</i>or "fully developed," and refers to the reality of the glorious resurrection of our Master.<br><br>Before his crucifixion Jesus so taught, "Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected" (Luke 13:32).<br><br>His atonement provides that the body, once corruptible, now may become incorruptible. Our physical frame, once capable of death and decay, now may become immortal and beyond crumbling deterioration. That body presently sustained by the blood of life (see Leviticus 17:11) and ever changing, may one day become sustained by spirit--changeless and incapable of death any more.<br><br>So the admonition "to be perfect" should not cause depression among us. To the contrary, it should bring us great joy and jubilation. The Lord knew that the procedure would be long and challenging. So he added this word of encouragement:<br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, they</i>[the best gifts]<i>are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him</i>that seeketh so to do;<i>that all may be benefited.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:9; emphasis added]<br><br>Those who are really<i>seeking</i>to do his will are recipients of his blessings, for he knows the intent of our hearts.<br><br>As he concluded his ministry among the Nephites, Jesus issued this powerful challenge: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>I know from long experience as a teacher that a sure way to lose students is to use long or numerous quotations. Attention is easier to maintain through amusing stories. I have not been called as an apostle to entertain, but to teach the word of the Lord. You, too, are disciples as well as teachers and students. I know you can stay with me as we climb the hill of enlightenment through direct study from the scriptures. Fasten your mental seat belts and let us see how much we can learn about these two little words,<i>I am.</i>Are you with me?<br><br>These two words,<i>I am,</i>the simplest words in all scripture, appear in the New Testament in the Greek language as<i>ego eimi.</i>In the original text of the Old Testament,<i>I am</i>is read in Hebrew as<i>hayah.</i><br><br>Let our jargonal journey begin with John 8:58. Inquisitors once asked Jesus if he had seen Abraham. "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am." (In the Greek text these two special words are<i>ego eimi</i>.)<br><br>My green-dotted mark at the superscript "b" before "I am" draws me down to this green-dotted footnote: "The term I AM used here in the Greek is identical with the Septuagint usage in Ex. 3:14 which identifies Jehovah."<br><br>Now, what does that mean? Let's turn to Exodus 3. To get the frame of reference for verse 14, let's start with verse 11. The scene is on Mt. Sinai. A dialogue is taking place between Jehovah and Moses. I presume Moses was suffering some kind of identity crisis (at verse 11) when he said unto God:<br><br><i>Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</i><br><br><i>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</i><br><br><i>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</i><br><br><i>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</i>[Exodus 3:11–14]<br><br>In the Hebrew language of the Old Testament,<i>I am</i>comes from the word<i>hayah.</i>Translated into English it means "to be," or "existence," and applies as well to the future as it does to the present tense. Indeed, this verse could be translated, "I will become what I will become." Here, to Moses, the premortal Messiah is proclaiming not only one of his names, but choosing a word that could literally imply the redeeming role he was yet destined to fulfill.<br><br>Two other facts about the word<i>hayah</i>are of interest: (1)<i>hayah</i>is the Hebrew root from which the word "Jehovah" is derived; and (2) it is closely related to the Hebrew term<i>havah,</i>and shares in common two of three characters.<i>Havah</i>means "to be" as does<i>hayah,</i>but it also has the connotation "to breathe."<br><br>Are there hints hidden in the deep meaning of God's reply, recorded in Exodus 3:14? We know the treasured truth that the Lord God Jehovah, creator of heaven and earth under the direction of the Father, revealed to Moses one of the Lord's special names. This word may have intimated his role in the eternal existence of man, including the inception of the breath of life into his nostrils, to man's potential immortality. All this was to be made possible through the atoning sacrifice which he, Jesus the Christ, was to be sent to the earth to effect.<br><br>Now let us look at selected verses from the New Testament. In Mark 14:61–62: "Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am." Next from John 4:25–26: "The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he."<br><br>In your Bible, the last word of that verse,<i>he,</i>is printed in italics, meaning that the King James translators added that word for clarification of meaning. In the Greek text, the sentence contains these two words:<i>ego eimi,</i>(I am). The words of Jesus in this passage could be translated, "I am [is] speaking to you."<br><br>Let's turn to John 8:28:<br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</i><br><br>Here again, King James translators added the word<i>he</i>after<i>I am</i>and italicized it to note their honest addition. But the Greek New Testament records: "Then shall ye know that<i>ego eimi</i>(I am).<br><br>Yes, before Abraham was, Jesus was "I am,"<i>hayah</i>in Hebrew or<i>ego eimi</i>in Greek. Under the Father's plan, Jehovah, Creator, God of this world, Savior and Redeemer, was indeed the Great I Am. Although this phrase, the<i>Great I Am,</i>does not appear in the text of the King James Version of the Bible, it is evident that the Prophet Joseph Smith understood this concept well. Three times he recorded this wording in the Doctrine and Covenants, in verse one of sections 29, 38, and 39.<br><br>I'll conclude our scriptural sojourn by returning to Christ's challenge to us: "What manner of men ought ye to be? . . . even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>So, my brothers and sisters, be inspired by such an example and by great monuments, and consider your living a monumental life. During this education week, enlarge your pedestal of preparation, and then ultimately build on these three fundamental steps: (1) I'll go. Go with faith to the arena of life's challenge. (2) I'll do. Do whatever you can to erect a shaft of righteous, endeavor that will remain even beyond your days. (3) I'll be. And "be not weary in well doing" (2 Thessalonians 3:13; see also Galatians 6:9), but "let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator" (1 Peter 4:19).<br><br>Be not discouraged when imperfections of yours and of your loved ones seem more than you can bear. And please, "continue in patience until ye are perfected" (D&amp;amp;C 67:13).<br><br>Then you may be, as the Lord pleaded, "even as I am." You will be numbered among his elect and will be known of him at the glorious advent of his Second Coming.<br><br><i>There is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.</i>[Alma 38:9]<br><br>By so learning and living, your life will become monumental, not only as a tribute to your own accomplishment, but as an everlasting credit to him who created you. God bless you to go where he wants you to go, to do his will with a heart sincere, and to be what he wants you to be, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.

<h1> Bricks Without Straw - Vaughn J. Featherstone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>The Kind of People We Are</b></h2><br>In the Second World War, just prior to the United States' involvement in it, Hitler had conquered--or at least the German armies had conquered--Belgium and France, and most of the European nations had fallen. The night skies were filled with bombers over Great Britain. From Scotland on down to London, the bombs were dropped constantly. Britain had staggered to its knees, and I suppose they thought surrender was imminent--at least Hitler did. He announced it would be just a matter of days or hours before Great Britain would surrender. The next day Winston Churchill went on radio and said, "What kind of people do they think we are?"<br><br>I'd like to ask that question about the Church members and then respond to you as I lead into what I have to say to you tonight. I have a very good friend, and his granddaughter had leukemia. She was only four. The Sunday before she died on Thursday, they were in sacrament meeting together, and this little girl was sitting by her mother. As they passed the bread and water, this little girl looked up at her mother and said, "Mom, is there a Heavenly Mother?"<br><br>Her mother said, "Of course, why?"<br><br>"Well, I wish Heavenly Father would put Heavenly Mother in charge of the sacrament, and then instead of bread and water we would have little cookies and milk."<br><br>Up in Canada Sterling Spafford's granddaughter was on a bus. (I believe it was up in Canada. He is the mission president up there.) A man right across the aisle from his granddaughter was smoking up a storm. His little granddaughter crossed the aisle and sat by him. Then she looked up at him sternly and said, "You shouldn't smoke."<br><br>He pulled the cigarette out of his mouth and said, "Says who?"<br><br>She said, "Well, Smokey the Bear and Holy the Ghost."<br><br>In President Daines's stake down here we have a man by the name of David Seamons, and his wife, Ann, is on the Young Women general board. Some woebegone, ill-thinking soul last Christmas subscribed to<i>Playboy</i>magazine for this wonderful family. It came in January, and they were offended. As I understand the story, Brother Seamons called up the circulation department and told them they were members of the Church and didn't appreciate the subscription and that they would like to know who subscribed for them. The subscription department wouldn't tell them who it was. Then Brother Seamons told them, "Don't send us anymore. We don't want your magazine. We refuse to accept it."<br><br>Well, the next month the second copy came. Chris Seamons, their eight-year-old boy, took things into his own hands. He wrote a letter to<i>Playboy,</i>and these are the exact words:<i>"Playboy,</i>I think the magazine you sent us was quite uncalled for. I think your magazine is quite perverted. If you send us another one, I personally will take action." You just have to admire a kid like that. The best part is that on the back of the envelope he put, "Please send back my stamp."<br><br>I supervised the Southeast Area until August 15. I am indebted to a friend in the South for this verse, and I thought a lot of the sweet sisters here today might appreciate this.<br><br><i>At sweet sixteen I first began</i><br><i>To ask the good Lord for a man.</i><br><i>At seventeen, I recall,</i><br><i>I wanted someone strong and tall.</i><br><br><i>At Christmas I reached eighteen,</i><br><i>I fancied someone blond and lean.</i><br><i>And then at nineteen I was sure</i><br><i>I'd fall for someone more mature.</i><br><br><i>At twenty I thought I'd find</i><br><i>Romance with someone with a mind.</i><br><i>I retrogressed at twenty-one</i><br><i>And found college boys more fun.</i><br><br><i>My viewpoint changed at twenty-two</i><br><i>When one man only was my cue.</i><br><i>He broke my heart at twenty-three,</i><br><i>So I begged for someone kind to me.</i><br><br><i>Then begged when I was twenty-four</i><br><i>For anyone who wouldn't bore.</i><br><i>Now Lord, that I am twenty-five,</i><br><i>Just send me someone who's alive.</i><br><br>As I get into what I'd like to discuss tonight, I'd like to first confess my weaknesses in front of this congregation. My schooling is limited. I love the Lord with all my heart. I suppose we all walk through life and make some serious mistakes, but I know the sacred responsibility that I have tonight.<br><h2><b>How We Build Our Bricks</b></h2><br>You remember in the days of Moses that he went before Pharaoh. He took Aaron with him and demanded in the name of the Lord God Jehovah that Pharaoh let his people go. Pharaoh refused. He would not let them go--in fact, he disciplined them by taking away the straw from the bricks they were making. The tally of bricks remained the same, but the people had to go out into the fields and cut the stubble of what was left of the straw and try to mix it in.<br><br>As all of you know, straw is put into bricks and other kinds of mortar or similar materials to cause an adhesiveness to take place. Today I would like to use building bricks without straw as my theme. We live in a generation when many of our young people attempt to build bricks without straw. In Moses' day straw was essential in making bricks that would not crumble and crack when a little bit of pressure was applied. We live in an unusual time and there is pressure being applied.<br><br>I would like to remind you of something regarding David. You remember this wonderful, young David who went into the field of battle, and his brothers taunted him for the naughtiness of his heart for not tending the sheep. David said, "Is there not a cause?" (1 Samuel 17:29). Then, as conditions developed, he found out about the giant of Gath, Goliath, and the challenge being made. This young lad, David, probably the youngest in the entire camp of all Israel, said, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?" (1 Samuel 17:26).<br><br>Well, you know the rest of the story. I don't know if all of you have ever seen a slingshot. Actually, it is a piece of leather about sixty inches long that has a pocket at one end--one end is looped around your finger, the other end is loose so you can let go of it. When you think about it, really, Goliath didn't have a chance. You can imagine what David did all day long. There could not be anything more boring than tending sheep. He probably found a pile of rocks to sit on and then shot at every knothole, every leaf, any object. He became quite expert.<br><br>As David came down off the mountain, Goliath said, "Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves?" (1 Samuel 17:43). And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. Then David, who was but a youth of fair countenance, responded in words that cause the soul to thrill:<br><br><i>Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</i><br><br><i>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</i>[1 Samuel 17:45–46]<br><br>I suppose Goliath had never been spoken to like that in his life. I imagine he was wrought with anger and began to lumber (I don't think he could run) toward David, and David came full tilt down off the mountain. The scriptures say, "David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine" (1 Samuel 17:48). Well, the battle was short.<br><br>David continued to walk in the ways of God and, as Samuel the prophet had so anointed him, one day he became the king of Israel. We must always be careful when we walk in high places or have special privileges, because there are some things that make it difficult to maintain purity. I am talking of high places out in the world. We can suffer serious consequences if we are not careful.<br><br>François René de Chateaubriand said, "In days of service all things are founded, in days of special privilege they deteriorate, and in days of vanity they are destroyed." There may have been several weaknesses that crept silently into David's life as a king, a conqueror, with many wives and concubines. In 2 Samuel, chapter 11, verse one, we find an interesting quote. In a time when "kings go forth to battle" David stayed home and "sent Joab." If he had understood the French phrase<i>noblesse oblige--</i>my position demands it of me (a free translation)--he would have gone to battle and may have saved himself. He had little to do and his energies were not used to the limit.<br><br><i>And it came to pass in an evening tide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</i><br><br><i>And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</i>[2 Samuel 11:2–3]<br><br>It sounds as if even the servant was trying to warn David to leave this woman alone, that she had a husband--Uriah. The king in his authority overrode the servant and sent for Bathsheba. What a different story it would have been if he had gone down and run around the palace a dozen times, had done a hundred pushups, or had gone in unto one of his wives or concubines. Also, what a different story it would have been if when the messenger was sent from David to Bathsheba she had said, "I saw the king looking down upon me, and I know what he has on his mind. Would you mind just telling him that I am married to Uriah and he is out fighting for Israel. Tell him I am contented and happy." She had, I guess, a degree of vanity in her heart and responded to the summons.<br><br>In verse four, a very devious thing happened. It is only one simple sentence, "And she came in unto him, and he lay with her." In verse five we begin to understand the consequences, "And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child."<br><br>David was being entangled into deeper, more far-reaching transgression. And it seems without repentance that is always the case. It is like quicksand that carefully drags us down to death.<br><br>Without going into great detail, David sent for Uriah, who was with the armies that David should have been leading. If Uriah returned home, thought David, and slept with his wife, he would assume the child was his and the sin would still be covered. David had Uriah report, and then he sent food and drink to Uriah's home. But Uriah, knowing brave men were dying on the field of battle, could not indulge himself in desires of the flesh. He must have been quite a man of honor. This frustrated David's plan all the more, and finally, David's goodness and character had deteriorated so far that he had Uriah deliver a sealed message to Joab. "Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die" (2 Samuel 11:15). Could this be the same David who had a heart like unto God's own heart? Joab must have wondered. Obediently he "assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were" (2 Samuel 11:16), and Uriah was killed.<br><br>What a tragic consequence sin brings. Think for a moment with me of the temptations thrust before David. He must have found Bathsheba exciting, beautiful, and desirable. His physical arousal took over the reason of his mind and the whisperings of the Spirit. President McKay said that no act is ever committed except it is first justified in the mind. David lusted, desired, and fulfilled the pleasures he had imagined. There is pleasure, excitement, and even satisfaction in sinning. If this were not so, who would sin? But there is also a consequence and a day of accountability for transgressing. Think for a moment of all the lusting and physical pleasure that Satan laid before David, and it was probably all fulfilled. Then cometh another day and another time, a look back in retrospect, and a day of settlement. Satan never gives us even the tiniest thought of the consequences of the transgression or the harvest of the sinner.<br><br>Listen to David's words from Psalm 38 if you want to have an idea of what repentance really is. I never understood it like I have since knowing David's heart when he was ready to repent.<br><br><i>For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</i><br><br><i>There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</i><br><br><i>For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</i><br><br><i>My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</i><br><br><i>I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</i><br><br><i>For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</i><br><br><i>I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</i><br><br><i>Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</i><br><br><i>My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</i><br><br><i>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off....</i><br><br><i>But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth....</i><br><br><i>For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</i><br><br><i>For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</i>[Psalms 38:2–11, 13, 17–18]<br><br>David's heart had returned. Oh, what a blessing it would have been to David if only he had known in the beginning what he knew in the end.<br><br>What a contrast to Job's life. Satan, who was jealous of Job, said to the Lord:<br><br><i>Doth Job fear God for nought?</i><br><br><i>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</i>[Job 1:9–10]<br><br>A great truth is taught here. The Lord hath made a hedge about each one of us and our homes and all that we have on every side. The hedge comes from keeping the commandments and walking in God's path.<br><h2><b>The Role God Would Have Us Fill</b></h2><br>When the mantle rests upon priesthood leaders, they are different than they were before. I am a different man now. I know the feeling. I felt it when I had the mantle of the North America Southeast Area, and I have had overpowering impressions since I have been the president of the Utah South Area. Imagine being president where there are four temples of the Church involved (Jordan River, Manti, St. George, and Provo), along with the Utah State Prison, 225 stakes, and BYU.<br><br>I can't tell you the excitement I feel. I am wonderfully proud of BYU, as I know you are here tonight. BYU is supported by the tithing funds of the Church, and we do not accept any kind of government aid at this institution. With rare exception, our administrators, professors, and staff are among the best in their fields. This is especially true of President Holland and his wife. What a wonderful time to come to BYU. This great man with the heart of a boy, this very wise Yale graduate, with all the things that matter, is as pure and spiritually in tune as anyone I know. No other university can make such claims. That is, we have a prophet and the twelve apostles on the board of directors of the Church Educational System. Our law school is moving up in prominence, and although not yet generally recognized, it is one of the very few best in the nation. Our department of religion is without parallel. We must understand that this is where the strength of BYU rests. It is the religious training and instruction taking place in your lives that will prepare you, and those who follow, for your foreordained roles. Some will be called in the future to serve in the Council of the Twelve and the First Presidency. Others will be called as mission presidents, stake presidents, and bishops. The sisters will be called into general presidencies, general boards, and walk with their husbands in high places in their priesthood roles. BYU must prepare a generation to walk into the period of the millennial reign of the Master.<br><br>We have professors who know, who understand, practice, and teach the true and only gospel of Jesus Christ. The BYU department of religion will be kept pure. The classes will be taught by men and women who revere the prophet of God, whose teachings are doctrinally pure, who understand all of the standard works, who practice what they preach, and who have a special knowledge of what God would have them do for the university students. We must fulfill the role God would have us fill--that of preparing men and women to lead the kingdom, who will preside over it in purity, with doctrinal soundness, and with great charity and meekness. As Moses had Jethro, so we have BYU to prepare and counsel you for your future destiny.<br><br>I would like every member of every elders quorum and Relief Society presidency, high council, and stake presidency to listen closely. Please make every effort to have every student at BYU, every professor, and every leader attend every devotional at the Marriott Center during the year. They may receive much other education, but I promise you that what they will receive during this one hour each month will bless their lives for eternity. Feed at the feet of the prophets and apostles and holy men of God.<br><br>The athletic program at BYU will be an example to the world and the NCAA of true integrity. We are so proud of this institution. We have men like LaVell Edwards and Ladell Anderson who coach the more dominant athletics, and other men and women in all fields of sports and competition, who are true to the core and still know how to win. To men and women of this caliber, even more important than winning is the fact that this church not be embarrassed by the conduct of the athletes--that discipline, character, and personal integrity be developed and maintained. There are some things more important than winning--and character, integrity, honesty, and loyalty are those virtues.<br><br>It has been my dream to someday have BYU invited to play in the Rose Bowl, and that year have New Year's Day be on Sunday. Then our BYU leaders would say to the NCAA, "We will play in the Rose Bowl, but it would have to be on Saturday or Monday." Can you imagine the message that would give to the world?<br><br>Priesthood leaders "hear" again. We have a standard for the Lord's university. Contracts have been signed, agreements made and approved. Off-campus housing will be expected to comply. We need to have the priesthood leaders monitor this and help. We need to be more loyal to the Church, to help institute and bring about the practices appropriate for this great school. The administration will do all they can, but I see as the great strength of BYU the priesthood leaders and all those who are serving in different callings.<br><br>If we are here and the world is here, and next year they move to a lower standard and we follow behind, we are no better than they are. I think the Lord expects us to stay planted here, and it doesn't matter how far the outside world leads us; we need to stay where we need to be and plant ourselves there. I hope you will become involved in the standards and have more faithfulness and loyalty to your priesthood leaders and to the administration.<br><br>Young women of BYU, just a little bit of counsel: Remember what a "good man" is all about. Beware of young men who may lose their tempers and occasionally slap you around--and there are some. Don't you take it. In his biography of B. H. Roberts, Truman Madsen said, "Men who are fiercest with men are gentlest with women" (<i>Defender of the Faith: the B. H. Roberts Story</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980], p. 96). That has been my experience. There are some things that are unacceptable conduct. You don't have to be with someone like that. If it is that way before you get married, it will be far worse later on.<br><h2><b>Dangerous Thinking</b></h2><br>President Stephen Joel Trachtenberg of the University of Hartford delivered a speech in Connecticut on June 3, 1986. And he discussed some things I thought were fairly impressive. He talked about ways in which thinking might be dangerous. He said:<br><br><i>Way Number One, it seems to me, is that thinking--analysis--the habit of probing deeply into things--can lead to depression.</i><br><br><i>Remember that people who are regarded as not being clever aren't necessarily lacking in brain-power. They just don't make use of the brain-power that they have available. And one of the reasons for that may be that when you inquire carefully into a lot of things that go on in our world, you find that many of them fall short of perfection....</i><br><br><i>So you can't altogether blame folks who, rather than get upsetting answers, simply don't ask questions! They stay reasonably happy by not doing too much reasoning!</i><br><br><i>A second risk of academic high achievement is that there are those who will actually hold it against you--in other words, that it can sometimes lead to a lack of popularity where particular individuals are concerned....</i><br><br><i>The third risk of academic achievement lies, believe it or not, in your relationship to the adult world. I hope it won't come as a tremendous surprise when I tell you that many adults feel quite ambivalent where talented and high-achieving teenagers are concerned....</i><br><br><i>In other words, a typical fear that adults have is that they are on the way to becoming obsolete. That's why dedicated teachers don't necessarily leap to their feet with enthusiasm when one of their students proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that they just made a mistake....</i><br><br><i>A fourth risk of academic high achievement, in my opinion, is despair. Once you've set a high standard for yourself, there</i>have<i>to come moments when you ask yourself: "Can I keep this up?" At the age of 13 or 14 or 15, you ask whether you can keep going at this pace until you're really old--until you're 25, say, or 32. Then, when you've been doing it for 30 or 40 years, you wonder whether you can keep going at this pace until retirement....</i><br><br><i>Finally, there is another risk of academic high achievement that bears some thinking about, which is that it often leads people to transform the world in which they are living, which in turn can cause a good deal of personal upset.</i><br><br><i>Let's say that you are in your teens or early twenties and you work really hard to develop a brand new concept and a brand new range of intellectual or scientific possibilities. Now the world begins to change because you dreamt up the microchip... or genetic engineering... or some altogether new way of looking at the human past.</i><br><br><i>Yes, there are some risks... but they are risks well taken. The benefits are worth the dangers. The eagle flying high always risks being shot at by some hare-brained human with a rifle. But eagles--and young eagles like</i>you<i>--still prefer the view from that risky height to what is available flying with the turkeys far, far below.</i>["Five Ways in Which Thinking Is Dangerous," Stephen Joel Trachtenberg,<i>Vital Speeches of the Day</i>52, no. 21 (August 15, 1986), pp. 652–53]<br><br>Now, just a word about communism--the great satanic, godless society. We live in a day of disinformation. You will read much and you will hear much. Others will be exposed to myriads of philosophies.<br><br>Stuart Clark Rogers gave us this interesting insight when he said:<br><br><i>Tyranny does not always march in the night in hobnail boots. Tyranny today is more likely to jog up to you on a sunny day in a pair of Adidas, and remark pleasantly, "Gosh, old pal, wouldn't it be nice if we could</i>do<i>something for all those people who aren't as clever as</i>we<i>are? Let's protect them from their own foolishness. Let's see to it that they're only exposed to what they really</i>need<i>to know. And let's</i>punish<i>those we</i>think<i>might be able to take advantage of them.</i>["Freedom Needs Advertising: Access to Information, Defense of Our Rights,"<i>Vital Speeches of the Day</i>51, no. 3 (November 15, 1984), p. 89]<br><br>There are two grand keys to discerning disinformation. The first is, "Does it line up with the teachings in the standard works and does it parallel the teachings of the prophets and apostles?" The second is, "Do you feel at peace with the Spirit?" The power of darkness can appear as light. Satan can cause a burning in the bosom. But the two things he can never duplicate are charity (that is, the pure love of Christ), and peace. When peace comes you will know it.<br><br>The prophet Heber C. Kimball said,<br><br><i>We think we are secure here in the chambers of the everlasting hills, where we can close those few doors of the canyons against mobs and persecutors, the wicked and the vile, who have always beset us with violence and robbery, but I want to say to you, my brethren, the time is coming when we will be mixed up in these now peaceful valleys to that extent that it will be difficult to tell the face of a Saint from the face of an enemy to the people of God. Then, brethren, look out for the great sieve, for there will be a great sifting time, and many will fall; for I say unto you there is a</i>test<i>... coming, and who will be able to stand?</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1888), p. 456]<br><br>We live in that day. They are among us. You will hear much from them. And most of what you hear will be disinformation. There will be some who will talk to you about the rights of consenting adults. It may sound reasonable to a young unschooled mind. I think back to how, at election times, I would listen to all the candidates speak, and it all sounded good and right. But over the years I have been able to discern and sift through what I hear. Now I only hear a few voices, and they are the important ones.<br><br>Some will find fault with the Brethren. Not in a major way, but in subtle, little ways, just enough to cause you to say, "I wonder if he is really like that." Some will find fault with the Book of Mormon. They may not feel strongly about Joseph Smith.<br><br>Would you remember that disinformation will come? Those it will come through will usually be friendly people and more subtle than you would ever suppose.<br><h2><b>Avoid Staring into the Abyss</b></h2><br>Elder Maxwell said, "Burnout comes from staring into the abyss of abnormality too long." That is why those who are involved in sin and perversion have a spiritual burnout. They stare into the abyss of abnormality.<br><br>A woman visited my office not too long ago. She found out after several years of marriage that her husband was a homosexual. She was sitting at home one night, and as she sat there talking with him, trying to discover what the problem was, the Spirit blessed her with the knowledge and she said, "I know what the problem is. You're gay." He broke into tears and he said he would repent. Those who will sin will lie, and he continued to sin. The marriage is ending in divorce. He has AIDS. He has infected her with AIDS, and she dares not have her children examined.<br><br>It about broke my heart. She is young and attractive and wants to have more children, but, as she said to me: "Who would marry a woman who has AIDS? I dare not have more children for fear they would be infected."<br><br>I called the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. I was told by the highest officials of that agency that AIDS does not only come from homosexuality, but also comes from indiscriminate heterosexual relationships or any kind of sexual perversion. Please remember that--<i>any kind</i>of sexual perversion. Men most often transmit it to women, but sometimes women transmit it to men. What a tragic thing it would be to make a few mistakes and later suffer these kinds of consequences. Those who get involved in perversions build bricks without straw.<br><br>Satan has been reaping a plenteous harvest. It is more than abundant. Now he has turned his attention to the elect of God. It causes the Brethren to grieve, and it about breaks our hearts when we see the fair sons and daughters being drawn away. We need not bend or buckle. All we need to do is keep the commandments of God, follow the Brethren, pray, and read the scriptures daily.<br><br>Bond yourselves to the prophets and apostles of God. I have always loved them. I have gone down to conferences on Temple Square and have watched the apostles and prophets over the years, and I have come closer to them. For over twenty years I went to the Tabernacle and sat close to the front so I could look into their faces and see what made them great. I know I would give my life for any one of those Brethren just that quick, and I know everyone of them is worthy of the high place to which he has been called.<br><h2><b>This Is What It's All About</b></h2><br>I was in Charlotte, North Carolina, attending a zone conference, and Reggie, a young black university student, came to the conference. He had on a new pair of Levi's that still had the four pieces of thread where the price tag had been. He wasn't doing very well financially. He had bought them for the zone conference and had on a white shirt and tie that I think the missionaries loaned him. In a discussion he said to me, "I was taught two or three discussions. After the discussions they invited me to church. When I got to church Satan met me outside the door and he said, 'You can't go in there. That is a white man's church.' Satan tried to play the 'colors' game on me."<br><br>That was interesting to me because Reggie said he went inside because he knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet, that the Book of Mormon was true, and that he had found more love and caring than he had known before. He said he felt like a poor beggar who had stumbled upon a field of diamonds and wanted to share with everyone he met.<br><br>In the same meeting a nurse said she used to work hard all night. She would go home in the morning to her children--four teenagers. Their hard rock music was terrible. After picking up a six-pack of beer, she would smoke, have her coffee, and go to bed. The house was messy and she could hardly wait to go back to work where she had a little relief.<br><br>One morning the missionaries came to the door and awakened her. She listened to them and things began to change. Now she is a member of the Church and doesn't drink or smoke anymore. The family doesn't listen to that kind of music anymore, and their house is clean. They have family home evening and family prayer, and they all go to church together. That is what it is all about. I think that is when we make bricks with straw in them.<br><br>A couple of years ago, in Texas, a young man drove his motorcycle across the Mexican border. He was going up and down the sand dunes. There was a dune with about a twenty-foot drop, and he went sailing off into space. In the accident the top part of the skull was crushed and almost torn from his head, leaving his brain exposed. It was thirteen hours before help came to him. A helicopter took him to a Houston hospital, and the doctors said he could never live. If the accident didn't kill him, the exposure and infection would.<br><br>They notified the family. He had a younger sister, twenty-five, who was married and had a four-year-old son. This little guy loved his Uncle Dennis. He thought the sun came up, went around his Uncle Dennis, went back down, and that was the day. He thought he was terrific. Uncle Dennis had taken time to take him for rides and play with him and do all the things that are done.<br><br>When the child heard about the accident, that his Uncle Dennis wasn't going to live, he said, "Mom, can we have a prayer?" She answered that they were going to their grandmother's house and the whole family was fasting and going to have a prayer. He said, "I mean, can you and I have a prayer?"<br><br>She said, "Well, I guess so. Sure." They went into the bedroom and she was, about to say the prayer when he asked, "Mom, can I say the prayer?" She told him to go ahead. He said this prayer: "Heavenly Father, Uncle Dennis has been in a terrible accident, and no one expects him to live. But he is my favorite uncle, and I love him. Please don't let him die. Let him live. Okay? In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."<br><br>Well, his mother was really concerned. It sounded like her brother was going to die, so she tried to prepare her son by saying, "Son, if your Uncle Dennis dies, you have to have faith and understand what that is all about."<br><br>He replied, "Mom, Uncle Dennis is going to live."<br><br>"Well, we hope he does, but if he dies you must not lose faith in prayer or in the Lord."<br><br>"Uncle Dennis is going to live." She didn't know what else to say. She went into the kitchen and he followed her in. She was still trying to reason with him when he said, "Mom, do you know that Heavenly Father has a deep, soft, quiet voice?"<br><br>She asked, "How do you know that?"<br><br>He said, "Because when I said, 'Heavenly Father, he's my favorite uncle. Let him live. Okay?' he said, 'Okay.'"<br><br>Uncle Dennis walked into my office not too long ago. I could see where they had sewn him back together. He had a cane in one hand and walked with a slight limp, but his mind was good, and he is going to the University of Utah. He plays golf and the piano. No one would have known that except for the faith of a young man. That is the kind of people we are. We build bricks with that kind of straw.<br><h2><b>"I Couldn't do that to your Mother"</b></h2><br>Let me conclude with this. About a year ago my mother went to the hospital. When I was thirteen my mother and father were divorced, and it was a rough life. I saw her put on heavy men's work boots and go to Garfield's Smelter at eleven o'clock at night and work until seven in the morning so she could be there when the seven children were home. When she came home, she would get us up and send us off to school. When we came home for lunch, she would be up washing, baking bread, or something. When we came home after school, she would be up. I don't know when the poor woman slept.<br><br>One time at school the teacher pulled us into a room, and the nurse was there. The nurse methodically went through each person's hair in the family. We were naive and didn't know what she was doing and went home and told mother about it. She knew. She put on I think the only dress she had in this world and marched down to Hawthorne School. She went into the principal's office and said, "We may be poor, but we're not dirty, and don't you ever search my children for lice again."<br><br>I can't tell you how embarrassed I was when I learned that was what the nurse was doing. Over the years I have watched this great mom work those kinds of hours. She had a heart condition, and we thought she ought to go and have an examination to see if open-heart surgery ought to take place. They were just wheeling her out of the room when as calm and peacefully as she ought to go, she passed away just that quick. The doctor said it was one in ten thousand times that something like that would happen.<br><br>Well, that was on Thursday night. On Friday I was supposed to go to Lakeland, Florida. I didn't tell the Brethren about my mother's passing. I'm sure they would have excused me from the assignment, but I felt I had better go. We were planning the funeral service, and as I got ready to leave, I was hoping the family would invite me to speak. I didn't dare volunteer, but I wanted to say some things about my mom. Just before I left my older brother asked if I would feel all right about being the final speaker at the funeral. I said that I would love to.<br><br>Then I got on the plane and flew to Lakeland. I didn't tell anyone at the conference that my mother had passed away. I was a little tender anyway, and I didn't want them to know. I made it through the first day, and that night after the meetings the mission president came to me and said, "We've got a real problem. We have a missionary that you have to decide whether he stays in the mission field or goes home."<br><br>I interviewed him very thoroughly. He had been involved in some really serious problems, almost breaking up a marriage. He had not committed fornication, but he was far more seriously involved than any missionary ought to be. But he didn't have a repentant attitude. I wanted him to stay in the mission field so badly I couldn't stand it. But I thought he had to have at least a little spirit of repentance. I pled inwardly that he would show me that he wanted to stay. He did want to stay and he would say he wouldn't do it anymore, but he never once said he was sorry.<br><br>Well, I felt really bad about it, and finally, at the end of the interview, I thought I had better send him home. Then I was impressed and said, "Tell me about your dad."<br><br>He said, "Oh, my dad is inactive in the Church. My dad couldn't care less if I'm out in the mission field. In fact, he would like me to come home and would be grateful if I would come home."<br><br>I said, "Tell me about your mom."<br><br>Then he got a little tender and said, "She is the president of the stake Young Women."<br><br>I said to him, "I'm going to let you stay. You don't really deserve to stay, but I couldn't do that to your mother. I couldn't have that happen to this woman who takes your letters around and reads them to the young women in the stake. Maybe you're the only great thing in her life. She probably shares your letters from one ward to the next and is so proud of you. I couldn't have her stand at the bottom of the stairs of the plane and watch you walk off dishonorably discharged from your mission. I'm going to let you stay."<br><br>He said, "Thanks. I appreciate it." Then he walked out.<br><br>The next day, during the last ten minutes of conference, I said, "I apologize if I have been just a little bit tender this morning, last night, and yesterday. My mother passed away and the funeral is tomorrow. She raised seven boys and girls alone without any alimony or child support." I explained a little bit about her life and bore my testimony.<br><br>After the meeting was over this young man came up to the stand. Tears were running down his cheeks, and he ran up to me, put his arms around me, and said, "President Featherstone, now I know why you are letting me stay. It isn't only because of my mom. It is because of your mom." I answered that I guessed it was.<br><br>This woman who only took care of us, raised seven children, I guess was insignificant and not important to everyone else. The only thing she did in the Church was serve as secretary for the Sunday School and Relief Society. She had a temple recommend and went to the temple. We loved, adored, and honored her. At the morning viewing I was standing by the casket, and to this insignificant woman's viewing came President Ezra Taft Benson, President Monson, Elder Haight, Elder Maxwell, and about a dozen of the other Brethren. Many of the others wrote to me. I think if my mother was there it would have humbled her heart to think that those kind of men would come and pay her tribute.<br><br>She taught us in our family that you build bricks with straw--integrity, character, morality. These things are important. I thank God for her great life. May you be blessed. May you understand that I know with everything in my heart and soul that this Church is the Lord's church. I love it. I promise you that if you will abide by its precepts and commandments, you will build straw into the bricks of your life. I testify to you that I know President Benson is a prophet of God. I love him with all my heart. Oh, what a great, exciting president he is! What a wonderful time to live! This man understands world political figures and situations like no one else in the Church living in this time. What a privilege it is for you to walk in his day. What a privilege it is to know that we're coming down to the wrapping-up scenes, and the Lord is preparing you here at this time in your lives for all that you'll do ahead. May God bless you. I love you and call down blessings to be upon you and this great BYU. I love it and am terribly proud of it, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Vaughn J.

<h1>r: &quot;Unless You&#039;re a Mormon&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeff:</b>Before we begin today, I want to put down a widespread rumor. Unfortunately, former BYU president Dallin Oaks and I will<i>not</i>be presenting a live rock concert this month. We know how much you want us, and we know that no other university can claim a rock group out of its last two presidents, but I'm sorry. Holland-Oaks (Hall and Oates) cannot work it into their schedules this fall. Please try not to be too disappointed.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>If you think having a rock star for a president is strange, you ought to try being married to him!<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>For those of you who may be new to BYU, we should explain that time limits are always severe in this welcome back assembly, and most of what we need to say is always beginning-of-the-year business. Sister Holland and I hope you will attend our first devotional next semester when things are more relaxed and we can be a little more parental.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>Speaking of parents, I am reminded that we had many parents of our new freshmen at our home last week, and they repeatedly spoke of "entrusting you to our care." They want so much for you to be happy and safe, and we share that hope. We lie awake some evenings talking long into the night about you. We care about you so much. We love you as if you were our own sons and daughters and want you to have a wonderful year.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Let us begin with a quote and then a story.<br><br>President Reagan recently said in a public address, "A nation's greatness is measured not just by its gross national product or military power, but by the strength of its devotion to the principles and values that bind its people and define their character" (quoted by William J. Bennett, "Completing the Reagan Revolution,"<i>Vital Speeches of the Day,</i>August 1, 1986, p. 611). May I repeat that for emphasis here this morning as we start a new school year. I will take the liberty of inserting some university language. "Brigham Young University's greatness is measured not just by its collective grade point average or its football success, but by the strength of its devotion to the principles and values that bind its people and define their character." Please hold that in the old cerebral cortex for a minute and we will come back to it. Now the story.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>In the summer of 1973, Brother David K. Skidmore received military orders to report for duty in Thailand. Leaving a wife and two small children behind, David hoped to make the year pass as quickly as possible.<br><br>On the evening of his arrival, he was invited to join in a social gathering with his new squadron. He turned down an alcoholic drink for a soda pop and tried to obscure himself in quiet conversation amid the pounding of the music and the layered haze of smoke.<br><br>As he was introduced around, Brother Skidmore eventually ended up standing at the bar with the squadron commander, a colonel. With the officer's arm around David's neck he was a captive, listening to tales of airplanes, daring, and past comrades.<br><br>Soon a signal was given and the men gathered around the bar. The music was turned off and it became very quiet. Everyone was served a small drink of very strong alcohol. When the drinks came to Brother Skidmore, he said quietly, trying to be casual, "No, thank you, I prefer this soft drink."<br><br>The room went silent. "But this is a squadron tradition," the man said.<br><br>Thoughts raced through David's mind: "Why me? Why in front of the whole squadron? Why the very first night?" Trying to sound confident, David explained that he did not drink alcohol but would participate with soda pop.<br><br>With that, the silence deepened, and the commander's arm tightened around his neck and he said, "Lieutenant, I'm ordering you to have this drink. You'll drink it if I have to pour it down you myself."<br><br>David thought of how far he could get if he tried to fight. He envisioned the results, and an unpleasant visit to the wing commander to change squadrons. Again he asked himself, "Why me?" But he gathered his courage amidst the waiting silence and said, "I'm sorry, sir, I will not drink alcohol."<br><br>An electricity filled the air, and David prayed silently with all his heart.<br><br>The colonel leaned back and measured him with his eyes, then replied, "You<i>are</i>going to drink this ..."<br><br>David kept praying.<br><br>Then the colonel added, "... unless you are a Mormon."<br><br>What relief filled a soldier's soul! Of course he was a Mormon! He'd always been a Mormon. Why hadn't he said so earlier? "Yes, sir, I'm a Mormon," he answered.<br><br>The commander quizzed David again to make sure he wasn't simply taking an easy out. Then he said, "A soft drink for this man, please" (David K. Skidmore, "Yes, I<i>Am</i>a Mormon,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1985, pp. 55–56).<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>"Unless you are a Mormon." What should that little caveat mean as we begin another school year? What does it say, in President Reagan's language, of "devotion to principles and values that bind us together and define our character"? Someone once asked, "If in a court of law you were accused of being a Latter-day Saint, would there be enough evidence to convict you?"<br><br>I saw a headline recently that caught my eye. It would have been hard<i>not</i>to catch an eye. It declared across the top of the page, "Moral Rot in America." The writer's contention is that over the past 100 years "there has been a decay in the value[s] of American society, from a moral code that was once [one of the] wonder[s] of the world [into what is now a] black hole of moral relativism" (Allan Carlson, "Moral Rot in America?"<i>Persuasion at Work,</i>vol. 9, no. 6, June 1986, p. l).<br><br>Let me quote another writer, Meg Greenfield.<br><br><i>There has been an awful lot of talk about sin, crime and plain old antisocial behavior this summer--drugs and pornography at home, terror and brutality abroad. Maybe it's just the heat; or maybe these categories of conduct ... are really on the rise. What strikes me is our curiously deficient, not to say defective, way of talking about them. We don't seem to have a word anymore for "wrong" in the moral sense, as in, for example, "theft is wrong."</i><br><br><i>Let me quickly qualify. There is surely no shortage of people condemning other people....</i><i>Name-calling is still very much in vogue. But where the concept of wrong is really important--as a guide to one's own behavior or that of</i>[determining]<i>one's ... side in</i>[a moral issue]--<i>it is missing. ...</i><br><br>...<i>As a guide and a standard to live by, you don't hear</i>so<i>much about "right and wrong" these days. The very notion is considered ... personally embarrassing, since it has such a repressive, Neanderthal ring to it.</i>[Meg Greenfield, "Why Nothing is 'Wrong' Anymore,"<i>Washington Post,</i>Tuesday, July 22, 1986, p. A19]<br><br>Well, life is better than that at BYU because we expect it to be better and work very hard at making it better. But Somerset Maughan reminded us once, "Every good and excellent thing in life stands moment-to-moment on the razor's edge of destruction, and if it is to be preserved it must be defended every hour of your life." We want for you a "good and excellent" life at BYU. We are determined to preserve and defend it. We intend<i>not</i>to be "deficient" or "defective" in speaking here of right and wrong. We speak, like Brother Skidmore, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--or as nonmember guests of it.<br><br>In that spirit we are especially pleased to acknowledge the presidents of our fifteen BYU stakes who join us in welcoming you back to school. They and their vast stake and ward associates help us make this a special place. We honor them in their calling and publicly pay tribute to them today. We are closely linked with them in the work of "strengthening devotion to the principles and values that bind us as a people and define our character." Let us touch on just a few reminders as we emphasize what it means to be a Latter-day Saint at BYU in a new school year.<br><br>Please understand that with a limit on our enrollment there has been increased academic competition for admission to BYU. Concurrent with that and of equal force with it must always be increased emphasis on worthiness and faith for those who would enjoy the privileges here. Such effort on your part will guarantee that BYU's greatness will always be more than grade point averages and football successes, pleasant as those are.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>There is a war being declared on drugs and substance abuse in this country, a war we have always fought at BYU that must be continued. The tragic deaths of gifted young athletes like Len Bias and Don Rogers get our attention because they strike the young, or the rich, or the famous. But far beyond sports figures and rock musicians there is an epidemic of abuse, a Niagara of narcotics taking from us as a nation our ability to control our destiny and guarantee our power.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Drugs will not be tolerated on this campus! Not users, not pushers, not providers, not experimenters. The devastation of lives elsewhere is all the explanation anyone needs for our hardline position here. We include in that ban alcohol, still the most widely abused and most deadly drug (at least in terms of fatal accidents) in the nation. We take this stand firmly, like Brother Skidmore, "because we are Mormons."<br><br>There are other standards that we must keep if BYU's greatness is to be genuine and long-lasting. Be honest. Don't take what is not yours, including answers on another's exam, or a plagiarized essay, or computer software now electronically pilfered in an instant. Be honest--especially with yourself.<br><br>There is too little discipline in most of our housing units, on campus and off. I am asking every landlord and bishop, even now as I ask every roommate, to accept responsibility for the living circumstances and moral climate of our BYU community. Be clean. Don't pet and play and then wonder why there are problems. There is too much sexual transgression in the world, in the Church, and at BYU. Explicit sexual material should not be your entertainment at movie theaters or on TV. We cannot monitor your cable network any more than we can monitor the videos you can rent at three dozen locations within one mile of this building. We are simply stating what you already know to be the standard of a Latter-day Saint. We are asking for a most unusual community, one that is bound by "devotion to principles and values that define our character." We are asking you to stand up and be counted "because you are a Mormon."<br><br>Dress and grooming standards need not preoccupy our time and conversation. These are simple, clearly stated principles and can be understood by everyone. Be neat, be clean, be modest. That is really all we need to say. Shorts are not acceptable wear on this campus for men or women, and never have been. Neither are short skirts or grubby jeans. Almost all of you look absolutely marvelous virtually all of the time. Thank you for that. To those few exceptions we simply say that extreme attire or shabby grooming are not acceptable here. Be the best you can be in every way, including your personal appearance. Let it be "an outward sign of an inward grace." Look and be and speak as educated, civilized men and women. That is part of what it means to be at BYU. Do it "because you're Mormon."<br><br><b>Pat:</b>May I caution the women in the audience not to be so socially conscious or so consumed with dating that you forget what a Latter-day Saint woman stands for and why she is so strongly encouraged to get an education. Marriage is the highest and holiest union we know in mortality--I hope it comes to every one of you at the proper time. But there is too much in our world, especially in those videos my husband spoke of, that screams only of sex appeal and beautiful body--and almost no voice anywhere asking for faith and intelligence and clean, strong women. The world is generally encouraging exactly what the proverbs call "a jewel of gold in a swine's snout"--that is, "a fair woman ... without discretion" (Proverbs 11:22) . Use discretion. Use good judgment. Don't think that your future and your fortune hinges on your face or your figure. Develop<i>all</i>of yourself. If you will be personable and intelligent--and above all, if you will be spiritual--so will the men. Be what the Lord has designed women to be and we will have that celestial community we have been speaking of.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>We need just these kinds of opportunities to be together as such a community, to speak to each other and to remind ourselves of the special nature of our opportunity here. For that reason, we are putting new and greatly increased emphasis on our university assemblies this year. With the approval and blessing of our board of trustees, we have carefully revised and limited the annual forum, devotional, and fifteen-stake fireside calendar. This has been done to accommodate even the busiest of students and faculty members.<br><br>We will advertise these events well, and for the weekday assemblies we will shorten the preceding class by five minutes, and delay the start of the next class by five minutes--all in an attempt to let you come and go from the Marriott Center to even the most distant buildings on campus. We are asking the faculty in those classes to assist us by announcing the speaker and walking with you to these assemblies. We will be closing all but the most essential services on campus for that hour so that as many as possible may take advantage of this special association. I don't want us to be 26,000 "splendid strangers." A few times each semester we want you to be together as family and friends to strengthen our values and bind us as a people.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>As President Ballif has announced, our speaker next week will be President Ezra Taft Benson, Prophet and President of the Church, and chairman of the BYU Board of Trustees. Nowhere else in the Church would college students have such an experience! Surely<i>everyone</i>in the BYU community will want to be in attendance to hear President Benson's message. Please plan to attend each carefully calendared assembly this year. The administration has never worked harder to provide outstanding speakers.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>May I make a special appeal regarding your study habits, and then Pat will comment on one very important aspect of that task. As any glance at our physical plant or faculty strength or course offering will quickly attest, an astronomical investment has been made in your education. You are receiving at BYU what a recent national publication described quite simply as the educational buy of the nation.<br><br>The thousands of dollars of difference in tuition between other private universities and our own comes as a direct benefit to you from hundreds of thousands--millions technically--of silent benefactors, the faithful tithepayers of this Church. These are the offerings of the faithful around the globe, many of whom may never have seen BYU, nor may ever have a child or grandchild attend here. Yet the leaders of the Church care enough about those who<i>can</i>come to make this stunning investment in a handful of students. In addition to all the buildings and the ball games, and surrounding amenities here, every one of you--<i>every one</i>of you--receives the equivalent of several thousand dollars in personal scholarship money each year just for attending. And that is in addition to whatever other financial aid you may also receive from the school. That is given because the Brethren love you and believe in you. They believe you will learn and grow and bless the Church and mankind because of your unique experience here. They believe you will stand proudly and tall when someone asks if you are a Mormon.<br><br>Please take full advantage of this special opportunity that is yours. It will be gone all too quickly. I love fun and Frisbees and fall afternoons, too, but don't let them blunt your primary purpose in coming here--pursuit of a superb education to prepare you for service to God and your fellowman.<br><br>Time matters so very much to me now. I need it so much, and I seem to have so little for the truly important tasks I wish to pursue. Maybe I'm just getting old. In any case I feel--and you will soon enough--the pain of Yeats' lines:<br><br><i>The years like great black oxen tread the world,...</i><br><i>And I am broken by their passing feet.</i><br>[William Butler Yeats, "The Countess Cathleen," 1892]<br><br>Grab the ring as it passes, and then let extra effort shape your special destiny. Study first, study well, study hard,<i>Then</i>play or party or pig out. Make time work<i>for</i>you, not against you. Start papers early. Someone once said there is no such thing as good writing, just good rewriting. Your essays cannot be of the quality we expect, nor can you be taking advantage of your education in the way that I have just been pleading you to, if you leave papers until the night before they are due and then rush toward a deadline with literary meat cleaver in hand. Furthermore, your roommates are<i>not</i>benefited by primal screams at about 2:00 in the morning when the word processor goes on the fritz. Write it early, let it cool. Sleep on it and come back for refinement. Polish your prose and take pride in saying something significant. That takes time.<br><br>Please. Use it or lose it. Study first and play later. Leonardo da Vinci's cry still holds: "O God, [thou] dost sell us all good things at the price of labor" (<i>Notebooks</i>[c. 1500], trans. Jean Paul Richter). Make this year count.<br><br><b>Pat:</b>In that same spirit may I just insert a very personal piece of counsel on a matter that has been a great blessing to us and I believe can be a great blessing to you. While working on his Ph.D. at Yale University, my husband got to know well one of the senior reference librarians who had given him valuable help researching for his dissertation.<br><br>On a whim one day, he said, "Ilene, I need to know how many books we have in either the Sterling Memorial or Beinike Rare Book Libraries that claim to have been delivered by an angel."<br><br>The librarian gave him a peculiar look (but my husband has always received peculiar looks) and said, "I don't know of any<i>books</i>that have been delivered by angels. Swords maybe. Or chariots. But I don't know of any books."<br><br>"Well, just run a check for me would you? It may take a little doing, but I really would like to know. It would help me with some religious writing I am doing." (Now, please understand that Yale has the fourth-largest library in the nation, with nearly 9,000,000 volumes in its collection.)<br><br>Ilene dutifully did some checking. For several days she had nothing to report, but then one day was all smiles as my husband strolled by to his carrel.<br><br>"Mr. Holland, yoo hoo," she said, very unlibrarianlike. "I have a book for you. I found one book which, it is claimed, was delivered by an angel. But it's one from your people," she said. (She always spoke of Latter-day Saints as my husband's people, which probably meant she had him confused with Wilford Woodruff.)<br><br>"But it's one from your people," she said, and she held up a paperback copy of the Book of Mormon. "I'm told you can get them for a dollar."<br><br>"My word," she continued. "An angel's book for a dollar. You would think angels would charge more, but then again, where would they spend it?"<br><br>Well, that's a funny--and true--story, but I wonder if we have considered the majesty of our message to the world. Prophets are not just everyday people, and angels do not visit us often, but of all the books that will be at your disposal this year at the university, only one has been delivered by an angel. President Benson has asked the Church as a whole to renew their reading of this book. We repeat that invitation to the BYU family.<br><br>At a very difficult and challenging time in my life, Jeff gave me a new copy of the scriptures and I began to read the Book of Mormon as I had never read it before. In a very real way that I cannot share today, but which is very personal and very true, it saved my life. I treasured every word, I savored every chapter. I came to know the promise of section 84 in the Doctrine and Covenants--that my mind was<i>not</i>darkened and I was<i>not</i>under condemnation because I had<i>not</i>forgotten the Book of Mormon (see verses 54–57).<br><br>We ask you, every day you are here, to read at least one verse in the Book of Mormon--more if you can--but<i>something</i>from the Book of Mormon to give light to your life: "Light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (D&amp;amp;C 84:45). I promise you miracles if you will do it.<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>Let us close with one final story. It is a BYU variation on Brother Skidmore's experience.<br><br>For more than twenty-five years Ben E. Lewis was the executive vice-president of Brigham Young University. He is now retired. I recently asked him to do something very important for the university for which I wanted to give him a token of modest compensation. He refused the money. I argued with him and told him I was the president and he had to do what I said. He said he was retired and that he didn't have to do anything I said. I shoved the money at him and he shoved it back at me. We argued and then he told me this story.<br><br>He said that following his undergraduate years at BYU (where he was a student body president, by the way) he had received an Alfred P. Sloan fellowship for graduate work at the University of Denver. As part of the Sloan fellowship, he and a handful of other students were regularly taken out into the Colorado business community to meet leaders and executives, and enjoy rather high-level exchange with them. One particular professor always took the group, and they spent many hours together.<br><br>After each day's work with these business leaders, the professor would always stop some where for a beer with the students. Brother Lewis always ordered a soft drink. That led to a lot of conversation over many weeks, and the professor came to introduce Ben<i>everywhere</i>they went--at every business, at every school, to every leader, and to every executive--this way: "This is Ben Lewis," he would say. "He's a Mormon and he doesn't drink beer." Every-where and with everyone it was always the same--"This is Ben Lewis. He's a Mormon and he doesn't drink beer." Over the course of<i>many</i>months that phrase was repeated dozens and dozens and dozens of times. "This is Ben Lewis. He's a Mormon and he doesn't drink beer."<br><br>One day after a field trip to Fort Collins, the professor wheeled the group, up to a pit stop of some kind where, of course, he and the others ordered their beer. Except this time the professor ordered<i>two</i>beers. Ben asked him why. He said, "Because its my birthday and you are going to have a beer with me." "No," Ben said, "I can't have a beer with you, but I do wish you a happy birthday."<br><br>"You<i>will</i>have a beer with me," his teacher said. "At least you must have<i>one sip.</i>It is very important to me, and I ask it of you this one time." And he put a dollar bill on the table. "Drink<i>one sip</i>of beer and that dollar is yours." Brother Lewis said he didn't want to give offense but, no, he would not be able to drink the beer, even for the dollar.<br><br>That conversation, with some increasing tension, escalated until the man had placed $50 on the counter. He was obviously intent on having Ben participate in this unusual birthday party, and he was in a position to do a student considerable academic harm if he were so inclined.<br><br>Like Brother Skidmore, Brother Lewis wondered what to do. He did not want to offend a man who had been particularly kind to him. It was now a very awkward situation, and virtually everyone in the restaurant was aware of some difficulty over at their corner table. One sip would soothe the situation. Surely the Lord would know the integrity of his heart in this matter. Certainly no permanent damage would be done. Furthermore, $50 in 1941 meant a lot to a working student who wasn't at all sure where his next meal was coming from.<br><br>There, a long way from home, as he mulled over this difficult situation and wondered how to handle the problem, words so clear and loud spoken directly to his brain nearly startled him from the table. As audibly as I speak to you, Brother Lewis said he heard the words from an unseen source. "This is Ben Lewis. He's a Mormon, and he drinks beer."<br><br>Then he said there in my office, "I didn't drink the beer, and I can't take the money. I'm a Mormon. This is Brigham Young University. I love it with all my heart. I have given my life to it. I want to give more. I can't take the money."<br><br><b>Pat:</b>May we say it again one last time. "A person's greatness is measured not by her personal wealth or his professional standing, but by the strength of his devotion to principle ... by the values that ... define her character."<br><br><b>Jeff:</b>God bless you to have a beautiful and rewarding new school year. Make it that way because you are Mormons. We love you and care about each one of you very much, including and especially those who may not be members of our Church. We know of the jobs you are taking and the sacrifice you are making to keep yourselves in school. We see you come and go on campus with devotion and faith and hope for the future. We know some of your problems and heartaches. Most of you try so hard to be what you should be. We will forever love you and admire you for that. You are good in your hearts, and we will do our best at this university to also make you wise.<br><br>We love you and measure that love as we measure the greatness of this school--by the profundity and power of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Sister Holland and I testify together of the Savior's life and mission and restored Church in these latter days. We testify of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the prophet Ezra Taft Benson--prophets, seers, and revelators in the grand tradition of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Alma. We testify this morning of God's love for you--and our own--in the blessed name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 9 September 1986.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>titution: A Heavenly Banner - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On the seventeenth day of September 1987, we commemorate the two-hundredth birthday of the Constitutional Convention, which gave birth to the document that Gladstone said is "the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man" (<i>William Ewart Gladstone: Life and Public Services,</i>ed. Thomas W. Handford [Chicago: The Dominion Co., 1899], p. 323).<br><br>I heartily endorse this assessment, and today I would like to pay honor--honor to the document itself, honor to the men who framed it, and honor to the God who inspired it and made possible its coming forth.<br><h2><b>Some Basic Principles</b></h2><br>To understand the significance of the Constitution, we must first understand some basic, eternal principles. These principles have their beginning in the premortal councils of heaven.<br><h3><b><i>The Principle of Agency</i></b></h3><br>The first basic principle is agency. The central issue in the premortal council was: Shall the children of God have untrammeled agency to choose the course they should follow, whether good or evil, or shall they be coerced and forced to be obedient? Christ and all who followed him stood for the former proposition--freedom of choice; Satan stood for the latter--coercion and force. The war that began in heaven over this issue is not yet over. The conflict continues on the battlefield of mortality. And one of Lucifer's primary strategies has been to restrict our agency through the power of earthly governments.<br><br>Look back in retrospect on almost six thousand years of human history! Freedom's moments have been infrequent and exceptional. We must appreciate that we live in one of history's most exceptional moments--in a nation and a time of unprecedented freedom. Freedom as we know it has been experienced by perhaps less than one percent of the human family.<br><h3><b><i>The Proper Role of Government</i></b></h3><br>The second basic principle concerns the function and proper role of government. These are the principles that, in my opinion, proclaim the proper role of government in the domestic affairs of the nation.<br><br>[I]<i>believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them.</i>. . .<br><br>[I]<i>believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life.</i>. . .<br><br>[I]<i>believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 134:1–2, 5]<br><br>In other words, the most important single function of government is to secure the rights and freedoms of individual citizens.<br><h3><b><i>The Source of Human Rights</i></b></h3><br>The third important principle pertains to the source of basic human rights. Rights are either God-given as part of the divine plan, or they are granted by government as part of the political plan. If we accept the premise that human rights are granted by government, then we must be willing to accept the corollary that they can be denied by government. I, for one, shall never accept that premise. We must ever keep in mind the inspired words of Thomas Jefferson, as found in the Declaration of Independence:<i>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.</i><br><br><i>That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</i><br><h3><b><i>People Are Superior to Governments</i></b></h3><br>The fourth basic principle we must understand is that people are superior to the governments they form. Since God created people with certain inalienable rights, and they, in turn, created government to help secure and safeguard those rights, it follows that the people are superior to the creature they created.<br><h3><b><i>Governments Should Have Limited Powers</i></b></h3><br>The fifth and final principle that is basic to our understanding of the Constitution is that governments should have only limited powers. The important thing to keep in mind is that the people who have created their government can give to that government only such powers as they, themselves, have in the first place. Obviously, they cannot give that which they do not possess.<br><br>By deriving its just powers from the governed, government becomes primarily a mechanism for defense against bodily harm, theft, and involuntary servitude. It cannot claim the power to redistribute money or property nor to force reluctant citizens to perform acts of charity against their will. Government is created by the people. No individual possesses the power to take another's wealth or to force others to do good, so no government has the right to do such things either. The creature cannot exceed the creator.<br><h2><b>The Constitution and its Coming Forth</b></h2><br>With these basic principles firmly in mind, let us now turn to a discussion of the inspired document we call the Constitution. My purpose is not to recite the events that led to the American Revolution--we are all familiar with these. But I would say this: History is not an accident. Events are foreknown to God. His superintending influence is behind the actions of his righteous children. Long before America was even discovered, the Lord was moving and shaping events that would lead to the coming forth of the remarkable form of government established by the Constitution. America had to be free and independent to fulfill this destiny. I commend to you as excellent reading on this subject Elder Mark E. Petersen's book<i>The Great Prologue</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975). As expressed so eloquently by John Adams before the signing of the Declaration, "There's a Divinity which shapes our ends" (quoted in<i>The Works of Daniel Webster,</i>vol. 1 (Boston: Charles C. Little and James Brown, 1851), p. 133). Though mortal eyes and minds cannot fathom the end from the beginning, God does.<br><h2><b>God Raised Up Wise Men to Create the Constitution</b></h2><br>In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Savior declared, "I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose" (D&amp;amp;C 101:80). These were not ordinary men, but men chosen and held in reserve by the Lord for this very purpose.<br><br>Shortly after President Kimball became President of the Church, he assigned me to go into the vault of the St. George Temple and check the early records. As I did so, I realized the fulfillment of a dream I had had ever since learning of the visit of the Founding Fathers to the St. George Temple. I saw with my own eyes the records of the work that was done for the Founding Fathers of this great nation, beginning with George Washington. Think of it, the Founding Fathers of this nation, those great men, appeared within those sacred walls and had their vicarious work done for them. President Wilford Woodruff spoke of it in these words:<i>Before I left St. George, the spirits of the dead gathered around me, wanting to know why we did not redeem them. Said they, "You have had the use of the Endowment House for a number of years, and yet nothing has ever been done for us. We laid the foundation of the government you now enjoy, and we never apostatized from it, but we remained true to it and were faithful to God."</i><br><br><i>These were the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and they waited on me for two days and two nights.</i>. . .<br><br><i>I straightway went into the baptismal font and called upon Brother McCallister to baptize me for the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and fifty other eminent men.</i>[<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 160–61]<br><br>These noble spirits came there with divine permission--evidence that this work of salvation goes forward on both sides of the veil.<br><br>At a later conference, in April 1898, after he became President of the Church, President Woodruff declared that "those men who laid the foundation of this American government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits . . . [and] were inspired of the Lord" (<i>CR,</i>April 1898, p. 89). We honor those men today. We are the grateful beneficiaries of their noble work.<br><h2><b>The Lord Approved the Constitution</b></h2><br>But we honor more than those who brought forth the Constitution. We honor the Lord who revealed it. God himself has borne witness to the fact that he is pleased with the final product of the work of these great patriots.<br><br>In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith on August 6, 1833, the Savior admonished: "I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land" (D&amp;amp;C 98:6).<br><br>In the Kirtland Temple dedicatory prayer, given on March 27, 1836, the Lord directed the Prophet Joseph to say: "May those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever" (D&amp;amp;C 109:54).<br><br>A few years later, Joseph Smith, while unjustly incarcerated in a cold and depressing cell of Liberty Jail at Clay County, Missouri, frequently bore his testimony of the document's divinity: "The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner" (<i>HC</i>3:304).<br><br>How this document accomplished all of this merits our further consideration.<br><h2><b>The Document Itself</b></h2><br>The Constitution consists of seven separate articles. The first three establish the three branches of our government--the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The fourth article describes matters pertaining to states, most significantly the guarantee of a republican form of government to every state of the Union. Article 5 defines the amendment procedure of the document, a deliberately difficult process that should be clearly understood by every citizen. Article 6 covers several miscellaneous items, including a definition of the supreme law of the land, namely, the Constitution itself. Article 7, the last, explains how the Constitution is to be ratified. After ratification of the document, ten amendments were added and designated as our Bill of Rights.<br><br>Now to look at some of the major provisions of the document itself. Many principles could be examined, but I mention five as being crucial to the preservation of our freedom. If we understand the workability of these, we have taken the first step in defending our freedoms.<br><h2><b>Major Provisions of the Document</b></h2><br>The major provisions of the Constitution are as follows.<br><h3><b><i>Sovereignty of the People</i></b></h3><br>First: Sovereignty lies in the people themselves. Every governmental system has a sovereign, one or several who possess all the executive, legislative, and judicial powers. That sovereign may be an individual, a group, or the people themselves. The Founding Fathers believed in common law, which holds that true sovereignty rests with the people. Believing this to be in accord with truth, they inserted this imperative in the Declaration of Independence: "To secure these rights [life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness], Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<br><h3><b><i>Separation of Powers</i></b></h3><br>Second: To safeguard these rights, the Founding Fathers provided for the separation of powers among the three branches of government--the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Each was to be independent of the other, yet each was to work in a unified relationship. As the great constitutionalist President J. Reuben Clark noted:<i>It is</i>[the]<i>union of independence and dependence of these branches--legislative, executive and judicial--and of the governmental functions possessed by each of them, that constitutes the marvelous genius of this unrivalled document. . . . It was here that the divine inspiration came. It was truly a miracle.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>November 29, 1952, p. 12]<br><br>The use of checks and balances was deliberately designed, first, to make it difficult for a minority of the people to control the government, and, second, to place restraint on the government itself.<br><h3><b><i>Limited Powers of Government</i></b></h3><br>Third: The powers the people granted to the three branches of government were specifically limited. The Founding Fathers well understood human nature and its tendency to exercise unrighteous dominion when given authority. A constitution was therefore designed to limit government to certain enumerated functions, beyond which was tyranny.<br><h3><b><i>The Principle of Representation</i></b></h3><br>Fourth: Our constitutional government is based on the principle of representation. The principle of representation means that we have delegated to an elected official the power to represent us. The Constitution provides for both direct representation and indirect representation. Both forms of representation provide a tempering influence on pure democracy. The intent was to protect the individual's and the minority's rights to life, liberty, and the fruits of their labors--property. These rights were not to be subject to majority vote.<br><h3><b><i>A Moral and Righteous People</i></b></h3><br>Fifth: The Constitution was designed to work with only a moral and righteous people. "Our constitution," said John Adams (first vice-president and second president of the United States), "was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other" (John R. Howe, Jr.,<i>The Changing Political Thought of John Adams,</i>Princeton University Press, 1966, p. 185).<br><h3><b>The Crisis of our Constitution</b></h3><br>This, then, is the ingenious and inspired document created by these good and wise men for the benefit and blessing of future generations. It is now two hundred years since the Constitution was written. Have we been wise beneficiaries of the gift entrusted to us? Have we valued and protected the principles laid down by this great document?<br><br>At this bicentennial celebration we must, with sadness, say that we have not been wise in keeping the trust of our Founding Fathers. For the past two centuries, those who do not prize freedom have chipped away at every major clause of our Constitution until today we face a crisis of great dimensions.<br><h3><b><i>The Prophecy of Joseph Smith</i></b></h3><br>We are fast approaching that moment prophesied by Joseph Smith when he said:<i>Even this Nation will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces and tumbling to the ground and when the constitution is upon the brink of ruin this people will be the Staff up[on] which the Nation shall lean and they shall bear the constitution away from the very verge of destruction.</i>[In Howard and Martha Coray Notebook, July 19, 1840, quoted by Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, comps. and eds.,<i>The Words of Joseph Smith</i>(Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980), p. 416]<br><h3><b><i>The Need to Prepare</i></b></h3><br>Will we be prepared? Will we be among those who will "bear the Constitution away from the very verge of destruction"? If we desire to be numbered among those who will, here are some things we must do:<br><br>1. We must be righteous and moral. We must live the gospel principles--all of them. We have no right to expect a higher degree of morality from those who represent us than what we ourselves are. To live a higher law means we will not seek to receive what we have not earned by our own labor. It means we will remember that government owes us nothing. It means we will keep the laws of the land. It means we will look to God as our Lawgiver and the source of our liberty.<br><br>2. We must learn the principles of the Constitution and then abide by its precepts. Have we read the Constitution and pondered it? Are we aware of its principles? Could we defend it? Can we recognize when a law is constitutionally unsound? The Church will not tell us how to do this, but we are admonished to do it. I quote Abraham Lincoln<i>Let</i>[the Constitution]<i>be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation.</i>[<i>Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln,</i>ed. John G. Nicolay and John Hay, vol. 1 (New York: Francis D. Tandy Co., 1905), p.43]<br><br>3. We must become involved in civic affairs. As citizens of this republic, we cannot do our duty and be idle spectators. It is vital that we follow this counsel from the Lord: "Honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil" (D&amp;amp;C 98:10). Note the qualities that the Lord demands in those who are to represent us. They must be good, wise, and honest. We must be concerted in our desires and efforts to see men and women represent us who possess all three of these qualities.<br><br>4. We must make our influence felt by our vote, our letters, and our advice. We must be wisely informed and let others know how we feel. We must take part in local precinct meetings and select delegates who will truly represent our feelings.<br><br>I have faith that the Constitution will be saved as prophesied by Joseph Smith. But it will not be saved in Washington. It will be saved by the citizens of this nation who love and cherish freedom. It will be saved by enlightened members of this Church--men and women who will subscribe to and abide by the principles of the Constitution.<br><h2><b>The Constitution Requires our Loyalty and Support</b></h2><br>I reverence the Constitution of the United States as a sacred document. To me its words are akin to the revelations of God, for God has placed his stamp of approval on the Constitution of this land. I testify that the God of heaven sent some of his choicest spirits to lay the foundation of this government, and he has sent other choice spirits--even you who hear my words this day--to preserve it.<br><br>We, the blessed beneficiaries, face difficult days in this beloved land, "a land which is choice above all other lands" (Ether 2:10). It may also cost us blood before we are through. It is my conviction, however, that when the Lord comes, the Stars and Stripes will be floating on the breeze over this people. May it be so, and may God give us the faith and the courage exhibited by those patriots who pledged their lives and fortunes that we might be free, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ezra Taft Benson was President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 16 September 1986.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ubled Faith - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago, Elder and Sister F. Arthur Kay and I arrived on the beautiful and exotic island of Tahiti. Our flight arrived at the Papeete airport at about four in the morning. We were met at the airport by a group of local Church leaders headed by our Regional Representative, Victor Cave. We quickly assembled our bags and headed for the hotel to get what rest we could before the day's activities began.<br><br>Our route took us through the deserted, dimly lighted streets of Papeete. In the dark we saw the faint figure of a man crossing the street in front of Brother Cave's car. He gave the man a lot of room and said to Brother and Sister Kay: "That man is Brother So-and-so. He is hurrying to get to the temple. The first session of the temple doesn't begin until nine o'clock, but he wants to be there well in advance."<br><br>"How far away does he live?" asked Brother Kay. The answer: "Two or three blocks." Brother Cave indicated that the caretakers open the temple gates early, and this man comes in and watches the day begin within the sacred precincts of the beautiful temple in Papeete.<br><br>I marveled at the faith of this simple man who is willing to forgo his sleep and other activities in order to follow this ritual of meditation and contemplation. Some would no doubt say, "How foolish, how wasteful of time that could be spent sleeping or studying." I choose to hope that in these programmed hours of meditation and contemplation this faithful little man is coming to know himself and his Creator.<br><h2><b>Nurturing a Simple Faith</b></h2><br>I should like to speak this evening of the need to nurture a simple, untroubled faith. I urge complete acceptance of the absolutes of our own faith. At the same time, I urge you not to be unduly concerned over the intricacies, the complexities, and any seeming contradictions that seem to trouble many of us. Sometimes we spend time satisfying our intellectual egos and look for all the answers before we accept any. Here at Brigham Young University we are in the pursuit of truth and knowledge. The nurturing of a simple untroubled faith does not limit us in the pursuit of growth and accomplishment. On the contrary, it may intensify and hasten our progress. This is so because our natural gifts and powers of achievement are increasingly enhanced by the endless growth of knowledge. In our belief, it is possible to be even the helper of the Father and of the Son, and to be under their personal tutelage.<br><br>Nephi explained that his brethren had become so wicked and insensitive to the Spirit that they became "past feeling" even though they had seen and heard an angel, and even though God had spoken to them in a still small voice (see 1 Nephi 17:45).<br><br>In contrast, this same prophet Nephi tells us that if we "feast upon the words of Christ ... the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3).<br><br>I have a dear friend with whom I grew up. Although bright and able, he was not a scholarly type. The press of family needs and concerns limited his educational opportunities. He did not graduate from high school. He acquired an old, beat-up truck and began hauling sand and gravel for a few of the contractors. The work was seasonal and not at all productive. The old truck would frequently break down and need repairs.<br><br>In his teenage years he drifted some, but married a good woman and settled down. Their circumstances were economically straitened, but somehow he managed to get a house built on part of the family property. I was bishop and called him to be the Aaronic Priesthood adviser. He took his calling seriously. He literally wore out the handbook, studying it. He had a notebook filled with dates when all of the young men in the ward would reach the age to be advanced in the Aaronic Priesthood. He kept good track of the young men and kept the bishopric informed of their activities.<br><br>Some years after I was released, he became a member of our bishopric. He needed a little nudging to become a full tithepayer, but responded faithfully as he had done before. Subsequently, he became our bishop. He served wonderfully and well. In the meantime, he and an associate had learned how to lay bricks and formed a brick-contracting partnership. The difference between their work and the work of others was in the quality. They did beautiful work. They were in demand. He prospered and became very respected in the community. He became the president of the local water company. After many successful years as a bishop he was called to the high council and served well and faithfully. He is now a man of affairs, respected and honored, although his formal education ended before high school graduation. With the advantage of a college education he, no doubt, would have achieved even more.<br><br>What caused him to succeed? Industry? Thrift? Self-reliance? Yes, but there was more. Conscientiously and untiringly, he sought to know and do the mind and the will of the Lord. He had a simple, untroubled faith.<br><h2><b>"Stick with the Brethren"</b></h2><br>Our religion fosters the opportunity to come back into the presence of the Father and the Son, and it contemplates a future perfection of the human spirit and soul. This is a preferential condition in the hereafter. Why, then, should we be preoccupied unnecessarily with too many mysteries? In fact, the worldwide mission of the Church can be simply stated. It is to perfect the Saints, proclaim the gospel, and redeem the dead.<br><br>President Stephen L. Richards explained it this way: "The immortal soul which is the union of body and spirit becomes invested with the divine nature of our eternal Father and ... Jesus Christ" (Stephen L. Richards,<i>CR,</i>April 1945, p. 30). That investment of the divine nature intensifies and magnifies our gifts and abilities. There is no greater teacher, no greater strength than the divine nature of the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ.<br><br>By this time next week, another general conference will have come and gone. Many may wonder what the Brethren are saying. Many will want to know. Others may not care. Before I had a seat in general conference, I tried to listen, either by television or radio, to the conference proceedings. One Saturday, on the opening of general conference, my youngest son and I went out to hunt ducks on the day the season opened. Of course, we listened on the car radio on the way and took a portable radio to listen in the duck blind. The season shooting began at twelve noon, so we were able to hear the morning's proceedings.<br><br>My son had an assignment in seminary to review the conference messages. We listened faithfully to all of the messages on Saturday morning. The shooting was over by one o'clock, and we listened to the afternoon's proceedings. As we were picking up our decoys and heading back to the car, my son thoughtfully said: "What are the Brethren saying?" He was trying to understand the grand overarching and undergirding messages. What will the Brethren be saying next weekend? The living prophets will be opening the visions of eternity and giving counsel on how to overcome the world. We cannot know if we do not listen. We cannot receive the blessings if we do not follow the counsel given.<br><br>As a young stake president, I had most of the General Authorities as stake conference visitors to our stake. I can tell you that was a great experience! President Hugh B. Brown came to one of our stake conferences just a week before he was called and sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve. We enjoyed his warm spirit and his good humor. As I helped him with his coat and he walked out to his car to leave us, I said: "Brother Brown, do you have any personal advice for me?" His answer was: "Yes, stick with the Brethren." He did not choose to elaborate or explain but left that indelible message: have the simple faith to follow the Brethren.<br><br>My grandmother, Maud Wetzel Faust, used to tell us as little boys about going to general conference when President Brigham Young presided. She also told us about the first train that came to Salt Lake City. Except for the Prophet Joseph Smith, she had known all of the Presidents of the Church up to Heber J. Grant. From her observations over the years, she had this to say: "Those who have turned their backs on the Brethren have not prospered." Then she proceeded to tell of a few examples.<br><br>What caused her to impart this lesson to her grandsons I do not know, but I would certainly wish all within the sound of my voice to have the simple faith to "stick with the Brethren."<br><br>We acknowledge that all Church leaders, past and present--except Christ himself--were human. The critics of the Church are wont to discredit this marvelous work because of the human weaknesses of its leaders. President Gordon B. Hinckley said at your sister campus in Hawaii a few years ago, "To highlight the mistakes and gloss over the greater good is to draw a caricature. Caricatures are amusing, but they are often ugly and dishonest. A man may have a wart on his cheek and still have a face of beauty and strength, but if the wart is emphasized unduly in relation to his other features, the portrait is lacking in integrity." President Hinckley continued speaking of the early leaders of the Church: "If some of them occasionally stumbled, or if their characters may have been slightly flawed in one way or another, the wonder is the greater that they accomplished so much" (Gordon B. Hinckley, BYU–Hawaii commencement address, June 18, 1983). The same is true today.<br><br>In an urgent plea for the Saints to concern themselves with the common things, President Wilford Woodruff had this counsel:<br><br><i>How much longer I shall talk to this people I do not know; but I want to say this to all Israel: Cease troubling yourselves about who God is, who Adam is, who Christ is, who Jehovah is. For heaven's sake, let these things alone. Why trouble yourselves about these things. God has revealed himself, and when the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants is fulfilled, whether there be one God or many gods, they will be revealed to the children of men, as well as all thrones and dominions, principalities, and powers. Then why trouble yourselves about these things? God is God. Christ is Christ. The Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost. That should be enough for you and me to know. If we want to know any more, wait till we get where God is in person. I say this because we are troubled every little while with inquiries from elders anxious to know who God is, who Christ is, and who Adam is. I say to the elders of Israel, stop this. Humble yourselves before the Lord; seek for light, for truth, and for a knowledge of the common things of the kingdom of God.</i>[<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>pp. 235–36]<br><h2><b>Making a Solid Foundation</b></h2><br>To have a simple, untroubled faith you must keep your spiritual innocence. That requires avoiding cynicism and criticism. This is the day of the cynic, the critics, and the pickle suckers. Said President Hinckley, "Criticism is the forerunner of divorce, the cultivator of rebellion, sometimes a catalyst that leads to failure. In the Church it sows the seed of inactivity and finally apostasy" (Gordon B. Hinckley, BYU–Hawaii commencement address, June 18, 1983).<br><br>For some years now I have appreciated sharing a common reception room at the Church Administration Building with David M. Kennedy. I appreciate my personal relationship with him. After having been called to the Council of the Twelve Apostles, I was walking out of the Tabernacle with Elder Kennedy. I said to him: "David, there must be ten thousand men in this Church more able and qualified to serve in the Council of the Twelve than I am." Brother Kennedy: "No, fifteen thousand."<br><br>Brother Kennedy has had a most remarkable career in government, in business, and in the Church. Yet I have found him to be a man of simple faith. He has been secretary of the treasury of the United States, ambassador-at-large, ambassador to NATO, and president and chairman of Continental Illinois Bank. He has also been a missionary, secretary of the mission, bishop, a member of a stake presidency, and now is serving as special ambassador of the First Presidency. The David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies on this campus memorializes his life and his name.<br><br>He has met with a host of kings, presidents, and heads of state in his lifetime. Yet his faith is basic, pure, and unshakable. He knows where he came from, who he is, where he is going, and what is most important in his life. He received this orientation from his father. When young David asked his father, "What are we supposed to be doing here on earth?" his father replied, "We are supposed to be serving God and our fellowman."<br><br>To have a simple, untroubled faith we must accept some absolutes. They are basic. They are to believe:<br><br>1. That Jesus, the son of the Father, is the Christ and the Savior and Redeemer of the world.<br><br>2. That Joseph Smith was the instrument through which the gospel was restored in its fullness and completeness.<br><br>3. That the Book of Mormon is the word of God and, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, it is the keystone of our religion.<br><br>4. That Ezra Taft Benson is, as were each of his predecessor Presidents of the Church, a successor in holding the keys and authority restored by Joseph Smith.<br><br>You may ask, "How can I acquire an untroubled faith and a spiritual assurance that each of these absolutes is true?" This untroubled faith can come by prayer, study, and a submissive willingness to keep as many commandments as we can. Let us be more specific.<br><br>As to the first absolute, the acceptance of Jesus as the Christ, we have two thousand years of teaching and tradition that help the inquirers accept him as their Savior and Redeemer. So this absolute, initially at least, may be the easiest to accept after study, prayer, and trying to follow his teachings.<br><br>The second absolute, the calling of Joseph Smith as the restoration prophet, may be more difficult for the honest seeker to accept. To have a fair appreciation for the greatness of Joseph Smith's mission, we must step back and view the panorama of it all. To me the only logical explanation for the majesty and success of his work is that he saw what he said he saw, and he was what he said he was. What he restored is so complete, so all-encompassing in concept, so majestic and awesome in potential, that only God himself could have been the author and motivating force behind it. The fruits of Joseph Smith's work, so plain for all to see, are also a testimony of the divinity of his work.<br><br>The third absolute, namely, a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, in my opinion comes exactly as Moroni stated, by the power of the Holy Ghost, by asking God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if it is true. The promise then comes: "If ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost" (Moroni 10:4).<br><br>The fourth absolute is essential to enjoy an untroubled faith. It is the proposition that President Ezra Taft Benson is the inheritor of the restored keys as was each of his predecessors since Joseph Smith. Some accept the Savior, the divine mission of Joseph Smith, and the Book of Mormon, but then think that after Joseph's time somehow the Brethren went astray. Many who have thought this have taken others with them, and their efforts have not prospered.<br><br>There is a powerful precedent that comes down through the ages to sustain the succession of authority. After the crucifixion of the Savior, Peter, as the senior apostle, became the President of the Church. Since the restoration by Joseph Smith this practice has been followed in the successions to the Presidency of the Church.<br><br>As each of the apostles has been ordained to the apostleship and Quorum of the Twelve, he is given all of the keys of the kingdom of God on the earth, some of which are to be held inactive until the death of the President of the Church. Upon the death of the President of the Church, the keys rest with the Quorum of the Twelve as a body. When a new President is ordained and set apart, the Council of the Twelve unitedly lay their hands upon his head and activate the keys he has held since he came to the Quorum of the Twelve. It has been so since Peter, James, and John bestowed the keys upon the Prophet Joseph Smith. It was so with President Ezra Taft Benson.<br><br>Because of this transferring of keys and authority, we can truthfully say, since there is ultimate priesthood authority on the earth today, that President Benson has it.<br><br>The acceptance of these four absolutes, together with the ordinances as administered by the Church and obedience thereto, is a solid foundation for the enjoyment of the promise of the Savior, i. e., peace in this life and eternal life in the life hereafter (see D&amp;amp;C 59:23).<br><br>Third from last, like that little man crossing the street in Papeete at 4:00 a.m. hurrying to the temple, we can enjoy an untroubled conscience in the temples of God.<br><br>Next to last, I wish to bear testimony that having a simple, untroubled faith will lift us above selfish, sordid, and greedy aspects of the world.<br><br>Last of all, I bear witness as one of the special witnesses that the Father and the Son did appear to the boy Joseph Smith, and that he was given direction to reestablish the Church upon the earth in its fullness. I also testify of the divine and truthful message of the Book of Mormon. I believe that President Ezra Taft Benson holds all of the keys and authority to administer the affairs of the kingdom of God on the earth, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E.

<h2><b>Wearing His Yoke</b></h2><br>Meekness ranks so low on the mortal scale of things, yet so high on God's: "For none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart" (Moroni 7:44). The rigorous requirements of Christian discipleship cannot be met without the tutoring facilitated by meekness: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly" (Matthew 11:29). Jesus, the carpenter, "undoubtedly had experience making yokes" with Joseph (<i>Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible,</i>vol. 4 [New York: Abingdon Press, 1962], p. 925), and thus the Savior gave us that marvelous metaphor (see Matthew 11:20). Unlike servitude to sin, by wearing his yoke, we truly learn of the Yoke Master in what is an education for eternity as well as for mortality.<br><br>Meekness is needed, therefore, in order for us to be spiritually successful--whether in matters of the intellect, in the management of power, in the dissolution of personal pride, or in coping with the challenges and routine of life. With meekness, living in "thanksgiving daily" is actually possible even in life's stern seasons (Alma 34:38).<br><br>Meanwhile, the world regards the meek as nice but quaint people, as those to be stepped over or stepped on. Nevertheless, the development of this virtue is a stunning thing just to contemplate, especially in a world in which so many others are headed in opposite directions. These next requirements clearly show the unarguable relevance as well as the stern substance of this sweet virtue.<br><br>Serious disciples are not only urged to do good but also to avoid growing weary of doing good (see Galatians 6:9 and Helaman 10:5).<br><br>They are not only urged to speak the truth but also to speak the truth in love (see Ephe-sians 4:15).<br><br>They are not only urged to endure all things but also to endure them well (see D&amp;amp;C 121:8).<br><br>They are not only urged to be devoted to God's cause but also to be prepared to sacrifice all things, giving, if necessary, the last full measure of devotion (see<i>Lectures on Faith</i>6:7).<br><br>They are not only to do many things of worth but are also to focus on the weightier matters, the things of most worth (see Matthew 23:23).<br><br>They are not only urged to forgive but also to forgive seventy times seven (see Matthew 18:21–22).<br><br>They are not only to be engaged in good causes, but also they are to be "anxiously engaged" (see D&amp;amp;C 58:27).<br><br>They are not only to do right but also to do right for the right reasons.<br><br>They are told to get on the strait and narrow path, but then are told that this is only the beginning, not the end (see 2 Nephi 31:19–20).<br><br>They are not only to endure enemies but also to pray for them and to love them (see Matthew 5:44).<br><br>They are urged not only to worship God but, astoundingly, they are instructed to strive to become like him! (See Matthew 5:48; 3 Nephi 12:48, 27:27.)<br><br>In the midst of all these things," they are given a Sabbath day for rest, during which they do the sweetest but often the hardest work of all.<br><br>Who else but the truly meek would even consider such a stretching journey?<br><br>The preceding enumeration is certainly a verification of the crucial role meekness plays in the lives of serious disciples. Thus, if we really learn of the Savior, it will be by taking the yoke of such experiences upon us.<br><br>This is a high-yield, but very severe form of learning. However, there is "no other way." Moreover, when so yoked, we may then get much more learning than we bargained for. Furthermore, to be spiritually successful, Jesus' yoke cannot be removed part way down life's furrow, even after a good showing up to that point; we are to endure well to the end.<br><h2><b>The Key to Deepening Discipleship</b></h2><br>Did Paul not speak knowingly of the "fellowship of [Christ's] sufferings" (Philippians 3:10)? Are we not told that meekness is so vital that God actually gives us certain challenges in order to keep us humble (Ether 12:27)? Did not Peter write regarding how Christians should expect to be familiar with fiery trials (1 Peter 4:12)? Furthermore, as the disciple enriches his relationship with the Lord, he is apt to have periodic "public relations" problems with others, being misrepresented and misunderstood. He or she will have to "take it" at times. Meekness, therefore, is a key to deepening discipleship.<br><br>In the exchange between Jesus and a righteous young man, we see how one missing quality cannot be fully compensated for, even by other qualities, however praiseworthy.<br><br><i>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</i><br><br><i>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</i>[Matthew 19:20–22]<br><br>In this instance the missing meekness prevented a submissive response by the young man; this deficiency altered his decision and the consequences flowing there from.<br><br>There appears to be "no other way" to learn certain things except through the relevant, clinical experiences. Happily, the commandment "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" (Matthew 11:29) carries an accompanying and compensating promise from Jesus--"and ye shall find rest unto your souls." This is a very special form of rest. It surely includes the rest resulting from the shedding of certain needless burdens: fatiguing insincerity, exhausting hypocrisy, and the strength-sapping quest for recognition, praise, and power. Those of us who fall short, in one way or another, often do so because we carry such unnecessary and heavy baggage. Being thus overloaded, we sometimes stumble and then feel sorry for ourselves.<br><br>We need not carry such baggage. However, when we're not meek, we resist the informing voice of conscience and feedback from family, leaders, and friends. Whether from preoccupation or pride, the warning signals go unnoticed or unheeded. However, if sufficient meekness is in us, it will not only help us to jettison unneeded burdens, but will also keep us from becoming mired in the ooze of self-pity. Furthermore, true meekness has a metabolism that actually requires very little praise or recognition--of which there is usually such a shortage anyway. Most of the time, the sponge of selfishness quickly soaks up everything in sight, including praise intended for others.<br><br>Disciples are to make for themselves "a new heart" by undergoing a "mighty change" of heart (Ezekiel 18:31; Alma 5:12–14). Yet we cannot make such "a new heart" while nursing old grievances. Just as civil wars lend themselves to the passionate preservation of ancient grievances, so civil wars within the individual soul--between the natural and the potential man--keep alive old slights and perceived injustices, except in the meek.<br><br>Is there not deep humility in the omnicompetent Christ, the majestic Miracle Worker, who acknowledged, "I can of mine own self do nothing" (John 5:30)? Jesus neither misused nor doubted his power, but he was never confused about its source, either. Instead, we mortals--perhaps even when otherwise modest--are sometimes quite willing to display our accumulated accomplishments, as if we had done it all by ourselves. Hence this sobering reminder:<br><br><i>And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.</i><br><br><i>But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</i>[Deuteronomy 8:17–18]<br><br>Meekness is especially needed to labor in the Lord's vineyard, which involves such lowly work--as the world measures worth. No wonder, as one prophet wrote, the laborers in the Lord's vineyard are comparatively "few." Moreover, the Lord's work is not usually performed on a luxuriant landscape, but, said Jacob, in "the poorest spot in all the land of [the] vineyard" (see Jacob 5:21, 70). The world's Caesars pay little heed to such workers.<br><br>Had Jesus not been meek and lowly when "a great multitude with swords and staves" (Mark 14:43) came to take him, he could have resisted his destiny. Led by Judas, there came "thither" that band of men "with lanterns and torches" (John 18:3). So spiritually blind was the multitude, they actually needed lanterns to see and capture the "Light of the World"!<br><br>Though he was actually the Creator of this world, the earth being his footstool, Jesus' willingness to become from birth a person of "no reputation" provides one of the great lessons in human history. He, the leader-servant, who remained of "no reputation" mortally, will one day be he before whom every knee will bow and whose name every tongue will confess (see Philippians 2:10–11). Jesus meekly stayed his unparalleled course.<br><br>Brigham Young, who stayed his lesser but very impressive course, knew both the fatigue of leadership and the rest Jesus promised. He counseled those less spiritually secure and more anxious about the outcome:<br><br><i>It is the Lord's work. I know enough to let the kingdom alone, and do my duty. It carries me, I do not carry the kingdom. I sail in the old ship Zion, and it bears me safely above the raging elements.</i>[<i>JD</i>11:252]<br><br>In our own time, the late Elder LeGrand Richards was heard by some of us to declare that he did not fret about the Church, because it is the Lord's Church, "so I let him worry about it!"<br><br>Wise secular leaders are not strangers to meekness either. The following episode in the life of George Washington involved potential mutiny:<br><br><i>Washington called together the grumbling officers on March 15, 1783. . . . He began to speak--carefully and from a written manuscript, referring to the proposal of "either deserting our Country in the extremest hour of her distress, or turning our Arms against it.</i>. . ."<i>Washington appealed simply and honestly for reason, restraint, patience, and duty--all the good and unexciting virtues.</i><br><br><i>And then Washington stumbled as he read. He squinted, paused, and out of his pocket he drew some new spectacles.</i><br><br><i>"Gentlemen, you must pardon me," he said in apology. "I have grown gray in your service and now find myself growing blind."</i><br><br><i>Most of his men had never seen the general wear glasses</i>.<i>Yes, men said to themselves, eight hard years. They recalled the ruddy, full-blooded planter of 1775; now they saw .</i>. .<i>a big, good, fatherly man grown old. They wept, many of those warriors. And the Newburgh plot dissolved.</i>[Bart McDowell,<i>The Revolutionary War: America's Fight for Freedom</i>(Washington, D.C.: National Geographic Society, 1967), pp. 190–91]<br><br>The meek leader, having "humbleness of mind" (Colossians 3:12), is not only more easily taught, but he is also freer. Even in routine he is relieved, for instance, of the pressure to be the single or even the chief source of ideas for the group. Nor need he be the sole source of his group's memory. He lets others, too, report what they see by the light of what Samuel Coleridge called experience and history's "lantern on the stern." The meek individual is more concerned with the light on the bow, which shines ahead.<br><br>He need not be afraid to praise, lest someone gain on him. He follows the pattern of rejoicing in the achievements of others as shown so effulgently by the Father and the Son. After all, the meek and lowly Leader did not need advance men or paid demonstrators with bands and banners: "Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon . . . a colt" (Matthew 21:5).<br><h2><b>True Education</b></h2><br>Meekness of mind is not only essential salvationally. It is also vital, of course, if one is to experience true intellectual growth, especially that which heightens his understanding of the great realities of the universe. Such meekness is a friend, not a foe, of true education. Stephen spoke of Moses: "And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds" (Acts 7:22). Though Moses was a learned man, he was the most meek man "upon the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3). So it was that he could and did learn things he "never had supposed" (Moses 1:10).<br><br>As the well-educated Paul warned, the indiscriminate or arrogant approach to learning fails to distinguish between chaff and kernels. Therefore, some are proudly "Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (2 Timothy 3:7). Unsurprisingly, therefore, great stress is deservedly placed upon the need for intellectual meekness--"humbleness of mind."<br><br>Meekness is thus so much more than a passive attribute that merely deflects discourtesy. Instead, it involves spiritual and intellectual activism: "For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments" (Ezra 7:10; see also 2 Chronicles 19:3, 20:33). Meek Nephi, in fact, decried the passivity of those who "will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness" (2 Nephi 32:7). Alas, most are unsearching--quite content with a superficial understanding or a general awareness of spiritual things (see Alma 10:5–6). This condition may reflect either laziness or, in Amulek's case, the busyness usually incident to the cares of the world.<br><br>Intellectual meekness is a persistent as well as particular challenge. Without it, we are not intellectually open to things that we "never had supposed" (Moses 1:10). Alas, some have otherwise reached provincial and erroneous conclusions and do not really want to restructure their understanding of things. Some wish neither to be shaken nor expanded by new data.<br><h2><b>The Chains of Pride</b></h2><br>Just as meekness is in all our virtues, so is pride in all our sins. Whatever its momentary and alluring guise, pride, as Henry Fairlie articulately notes, is the enemy--"the first of the sins" (Henry Fairlie,<i>The Seven Deadly Sins Today</i>[Washington, D.C.: New Republic Books, 1978], p. 39).<br><br>The meek individual may not, to be sure, always fully decipher what is happening to him or around him. However, even though he does not "know the meaning of all things," he knows that the Lord loves him (see 1 Nephi 11:17). He may feel overwhelmed, but, unlike the proud, he is not out of control. In fact<i>,</i>in some moments it is important for us to "Be still, and know that [he is] God" (Psalms 46:10). Even articulate discipleship has its side of silent certitude!<br><br>The "rest" promised by Jesus to the meek, though not including an absence of adversity or tutoring, does, therefore, give us the special peace that flows from "humbleness of mind." The meek management of power and responsibility relieves us of the heavy and grinding chains of pride; however glitzed and polished, they are still chains.<br><br>Meekness also protects us from the fatigue of being easily offended. There are so many just waiting to be offended. They are so alerted to the possibility that they will not be treated fairly, they almost invite the verification of their expectation! The meek, not on such a fatiguing alert, find rest from this form of fatigue.<br><br>Bruising as the tumble off the peak of pride is, it may be necessary at times. Few of us escape at least some of these bruises. Even then, one must next be careful not to continue his descent into the swamp of self-pity. Meekness enables us, after such a tumble, to pick ourselves up--but without putting others down blamefully. Meekness mercifully lets us retain the realistic and rightful impressions of how blessed we are, so far as the fundamental things of eternity are concerned. We are not then as easily offended by the disappointments of the day, of which there seems to be a sufficient and steady supply.<br><br>When we are thus spiritually settled, we will likewise be less apt to murmur and complain. Indeed, one of the great risks of murmuring is that we can get too good at it, too clever. We can even acquire too large an audience. Furthermore, what for the murmurer may only be transitory grumbles may become a cause for a hearer that may carry him or her clear out of the Church.<br><br>The meek are unconcerned with prideful preeminence, including considerations of scale. The lowly are not exercised, for instance, over quantitative considerations. The Lord put that concern to rest centuries ago.<br><br><i>The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:</i><br><br><i>But because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</i>[Deuteronomy 7:7–8]<br><h2><b>With Ears to Hear</b></h2><br>When the Lord declared, "My sheep hear my voice. . . and they follow me" (John 10:27), it was not only an indication of how profound recognition and familiarity would be at work; it also bespoke another role of operational meekness--listening long and humbly enough for such recognition to occur.<br><br>This readiness with ears to hear has been needed in all dispensations, but never more than after the Restoration. The "restitution of all things" (Acts 3:21) ended centuries of deprivation, but the Restoration goes sharply against the grain of heedless secular societies. So, while the truths of the Restoration are "had again," they are useful only "among as many as shall believe" (Moses 1:40–41). Yet those astray include "humble followers of Christ" who err only "because they are taught by the precepts of men" (2 Nephi 28:14). In addition, the adversary's kingdom "must shake" in order that those who will may be If "stirred up unto repentance" (2 Nephi 28:19). The meek understand such realities.<br><br>Meekness also contains a readiness that helps us to surmount the accumulated stumbling blocks and rocks of offense; we can make stepping stones of them and achieve a deeper and broader view of life. Obviously, Philip had such readiness and meekness when he recognized Jesus as the Messiah of whom Moses had spoken (John 1:45). Obviously, Paul had the broad view, too, when he described Moses as having foregone, by choice, the favored life in Pharaoh's court for a life of service to Jesus (Hebrews 11:24–27). Nevertheless, the stones of stumbling and rocks of offense are real. In fact, these offending rocks (see Isaiah 8:14–15) can prove insurmountable, unless we have the facilitating attribute of meekness with its promise of access to the grace of God.<br><br>Even if it stood alone as a benefit, one reason for developing greater meekness is to have greater access to the grace of God. The Lord guarantees that his grace is sufficient for the meek (Ether 12:26). Besides, only the meek know how to draw fully upon his assistance anyway.<br><br>Meekness comes trailing a cloud of other beneficial considerations. The prophet Mormon (see Moroni 7:43–44) observed that without meekness there can be no faith, hope, or love. Furthermore, the remission of our sins brings additional meekness along with the great gift of the Holy Ghost, or Comforter (Moroni 8:26). These supernal blessings are not to be enjoyed for any length of time except by those who are meek. As to genuine joy, it is received by none "save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness" (Alma 27:18).<br><br>Preliminarily, we cannot even have true faith, except we are meek and lowly in heart (Moroni 7:43–45). Thus we are able to enjoy greater faith, hope, love, knowledge, and reassurance. We will thus know the answer to what Amulek called the "great question" (see Alma 34:5)--whether there really is a rescuing and redeeming Christ. It is by the power of the Holy Ghost that we know that Jesus is the Christ, that he lived and lives. Thus it is the meek who receive the great answers to the "great question," rejoicing, therefore, over the "great and last sacrifice" (Alma 34:10).<br><h2><b>Preparing for Eternity</b></h2><br>Since life in the Church illustrates, painfully at times, our own defects, as well as the defects of others, we are bound to be periodically disappointed thereby in ourselves and in others. We cannot expect it to be otherwise in a kingdom where, initially, not only does the net gather "of every kind," but those of "every kind" are also at every stage of spiritual development (see Matthew 13:47). When people "leave their nets straightway" (see Matthew 4:20 and Mark 1:18), they come as they are--though in the initial process of changing, their luggage reflects their past. Hence, discipleship is a developmental journey that requires shared patience, understanding, and meekness on the part of all who join the caravan. Together we are disengaging from one world and preparing ourselves for another and far better world.<br><br>Meekness and patience have a special mutuality. If there were too much swiftness, there could be no long-suffering, no gradual soul-stretching, nor repenting. With too little time to absorb, to assimilate, and to apply the truths already given, our capacities would not be fully developed. Pearls cast before us would go unfound, ungathered, and unsavored. It takes time to prepare for eternity.<br><br><i>For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:12]<br><br><i>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.</i>[2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>The meek are also less likely to ask amiss in their prayers (see James 4:3). Being less demanding of life to begin with, they are less likely to ask selfishly or to act selfishly.<br><br>In so many ways, the wise interplay of our individual agency with God's loving purposes for us is greatly facilitated by our meekness. Were it not so, we would, at best, offer ourselves pridefully to God, but only as we now are--"Take it or leave it," an unacceptable offering. The only individual who might have credibly done that instead meekly submitted himself to the Father's further, shaping will (see Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>Meekness could have rescued proud and fearful Judas even after he had left the Last Supper. He could have slipped back in later, quietly and humbly, rejoining his apostolic colleagues, having belatedly determined not to do the dastardly deed. Meekness can rescue us from ourselves even when we are deep in error, even when others have written us off.<br><h2><b>The Small View Versus Reality</b></h2><br>Meekness enlarges souls, but without hypocrisy. Contrariwise, "littleness of soul" (D&amp;amp;C 117:11) insures that only a small view of reality will be taken. This narrow view prevailed when Cain slew Abel and then gloried and boasted, "Behold, now I am free" (see Moses 5:33). Free? Yes, free to be "a fugitive and a vagabond" in the stretching desert he had made of his own life (Moses 5:39). Both Cain's desire for Abel's flocks and his being offended at the acceptance of Abel's sacrifice played a part in his fall. Moreover, proud Cain "rejected the greater counsel which was had from God" (Moses 5:25).<br><br>The small, myopic view also lends itself, in the Lord's words, to coveting "the drop," while neglecting "the more weighty matters" (D&amp;amp;C 117:8). In all of our getting and grasping we do not seem to grasp, for instance, the implications of this searching question from the Lord:<br><br><i>For have I not the fowls of heaven, and also the fish of the sea, and the beasts of the mountains? Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 117:6]<br><br>No wonder the Lord also reminds us acquisitive mortals, "For what is property unto me?" (D&amp;amp;C 117:4).<br><br><i>I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 104:14]<br><br>One day he will share all he has with the meek. For every one else, whatever their temporary possessions, the Creator's reversion clause will take effect.<br><br>The meek likewise understand still another reality--that, as much as or more than anything else, it is our faith and patience that are to be tried (see Mosiah 23:21). Our trials, however, occur in the context of this precious promise:<br><br><i>Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might .</i>. .<i>becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</i>[Mosiah 8:18]<br><br>Before he became encrusted with power, Saul knew a time when he was "little in [his] own sight" (1 Samuel 15:17). However, meekness did not stay on as his uninvited guest; it quickly departs where it's not wanted. It is so easy for us to become puffed up and to be condescending to others. One devoted public servant who ably served several British Prime Ministers as their private secretary, observed:<br><br><i>Vanity is a failing common to Prime Ministers.</i>. . ;<i>and I suppose it is natural in view of the adulation they receive but to which they are not, like Kings, accustomed.</i>[John Colville,<i>The Fringes of Power</i>(New York and London: W. W. Norton and Company, 1985), p. 79]<br><h2><b>"Meek and Lowly" Men</b></h2><br>Fortunately, we have fine examples of meekness to help us, and I need go no farther than my own Quorum.<br><br>The Acting President of the Council of the Twelve, President Howard W. Hunter, is a meek man. He once refused a job he needed as a young man because it would have meant another individual would have lost his job. This is the same lowly man, when I awakened after a weary and dusty day together with him on assignment in Egypt, who was quietly shining my shoes, a task he had hoped to complete unseen. Meekness can be present in the daily and ordinary things.<br><br>The President of the Twelve, President Marion G. Romney, is also a meek man. The scene was a fast and testimony meeting in his home ward, just after he was first sustained by the Church as a Counselor in the First Presidency. Touchingly, meekly, and tenderly, President Romney said to his beloved neighbors that he could obediently sustain whomever the Lord called, even when the person called was Marion G. Romney. All of us who were there loved him all the more! Meekness can be there even in moments of deserved recognition.<br><br>Sir Thomas More was a victim of injustice and irony. Generously and meekly, just as he was about to be martyred, he said:<br><br><i>Paul .</i>. .<i>was present, and consented to the death of St. Stephen, and kept their clothes that stoned him to death, and yet be they [Stephen and Paul] now both twain Holy Saints in heaven, and shall continue there friends for ever, so I verily trust and .</i>. .<i>pray, that though your lordships have now here in earth been judges to my condemnation, we may yet hereafter in heaven merrily all meet together, to our everlasting salvation.</i>[Anthony Kenny,<i>Thomas More</i>(Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 88]<br><br>Meekness can be present in moments of injustice and crisis at the hands of lesser men.<br><br>Jesus meekly endured the lesser spiritual maturity in the Twelve and in his other disciples. He endured this while helping remedy it. He did this without condescension, without despairing, without cynicism, and without murmuring. We have only to look at his prayers to the Father for and in behalf of his disciples to see how perfect his love is (see John 17). Indeed, when his followers deserved censure, they received teaching. Though he sometimes spoke reproving truth to them, Christ spoke the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).<br><br>What a contrast to us mortals! At times we withhold reproof, time, talent, and knowledge from others in order to retain a seeming advantage, an edge. No wonder there could never be compliance with consecration without meekness. For consecration seeks to share--not to withhold.<br><h2><b>The Serious Disciple</b></h2><br>The full witness often does not come "until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6). Those trials may be very focused. President Lorenzo Snow once said to the Twelve of his day, "Every one of us who has not already had the experience must yet meet it of being tested in every place where we are weak" (Abraham H. Cannon journal, April 9, 1890). Indeed, did not the Lord specifically promise the meek that he would make "weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27)?<br><br>In those instances of available record, the Lord has displayed much gentleness and tenderness in his tutoring of meek individuals. The pattern usually involves his disclosing more about himself, about his work, and what taking his yoke upon us will mean. He thus expands the horizons of the person being tutored. The Lord likewise usually assigns the individual a portion of the Lord's work to do. The disciple's course involves more lab and fieldwork than lectures.<br><br>For the serious disciple, the greater his knowledge, the greater his meekness. The more he strives to become like Jesus and the more he wishes to declare his gospel, the more he rejoices exceedingly when Christ's message is heeded, as did the outreaching sons of Mosiah, who rejoiced that no human soul would perish if they received the gospel.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the Lord's angelic messengers also reflect meek friendship, as did the angel that spoke with Alma:<br><br><i>Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivest thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.</i>[Alma 8:15]<br><br>The meek are such caring realists!<br><br>These patterns of gentleness and tenderness are too striking to be accidental. They are even reflected in the voice of the Lord, even in its very timbre, for his is a pleasant, mild, and gentle voice:<br><br>. . .<i>it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul--</i>[Helaman 5:30]<br><br>. . .<i>yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper.</i>[Helaman 5:46]<br><br>. . .<i>it was not a harsh voice neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center.</i>[3 Nephi 11:3]<br><br>The stunning episode atop the Mount of Transfiguration doubtless involved the same pattern of further disclosing, preparing, reassuring, instructing, and blessing with regard to Peter, James, and John (see Matthew 17:1–9). Though we do not have all of the sacred particulars of what occurred there, Peter, James, and John received special blessings and insights as a result of being atop the Mount of Transfiguration. It was good for them to have been there (Matthew 17:4), but they would not have been in those supernal circumstances except they were sufficiently meek, though further trials and tutoring still lay ahead.<br><br>The pattern of calling, blessing, expanding, reassuring, and endowing are reflective of the generosity as well as the gentleness of God our Father and his son, Jesus Christ!<br><br>Astonishingly, to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, it is clear that the Father and the Son are giving away the secrets of the universe! If only you and I can avoid being offended by their generosity.<br><br>If we would be with them, whether on a mountaintop or forever, we should ponder anew these sobering words: "For none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart" (Moroni 7:44). Besides, can we ever truly and fully accept ourselves until we become more like them?<br><br>That you and I may be meek disciples is my prayer on this special day. I salute you as servants of the Lord Jesus Christ and thank him for being our yoke master, for being meek and lowly, and inviting us to learn of him. It is the only way we can truly learn of him--to take his yoke upon us. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A. Maxwell was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 21 October 1986.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>hings Count - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I deem it a privilege, brothers and sisters, to speak to this audience at this great university. Although I did not attend Brigham Young University, I am a great fan of your president, Jeffrey R. Holland; your faculty; your stakes and wards; your beautiful campus; and your athletic teams. But most of all, I honor the standards taught and lived on this campus. What a great privilege for you to learn and grow in this spiritual and academic atmosphere of truth.<br><br>I have been impressed recently with the thought that this life is made up of little things--little things that count a great deal. I believe that the little things are of great importance in our relationship with ourselves, in our relationships with others, and in our relationship with God.<br><br>The Lord has said, "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><h2><b>Relationship with Self</b></h2><br>Let us first consider our relationship with ourselves. Along with earning good grades, which I know all of you receive, you must take proper care in your life to see that the little things regarding your personal life are in order. You must learn, along with geometry and English literature, to care for your health and your mental well-being. Do you maintain proper exercise that will give you the extra energy and alertness of mind to keep your spirit strong and your attitude positive? Are you wise in your diet? Do you avoid the unnourishing snacks that might keep your stomach full but your health quite empty?<br><br>Our bodies are truly the result of what we eat and the exercise we receive. If we are not wise, these little things can soon catch up with us to become major health problems that will limit our success and contribution.<br><br>President Brigham Young once said, "Let us seek to extend the present life to the uttermost, by observing every law of health, and by properly balancing labor, study, rest, and recreation" (<i>DBY,</i>p. 186).<br><br>Many students feel that proper rest is not an important concern at this time in life. Yet the Lord said, "Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated" (D&amp;amp;C 88:124). Some suffer from too little sleep, and some suffer from too much. This might seem like a little matter to you. But the wise student soon learns the value of regular hours and sufficient sleep.<br><br>I have often thought that some of the most common little things in our lives are the minutes that pass in each hour of the day. For each human being, time is indeed an indispensable resource. It can neither be ignored nor altered. We are compelled to spend it at a fixed rate of sixty minutes every hour. No spigot can be installed to regulate its flow, and no refilling device can replenish its quantity.<br><br>The question is not one of managing the clock, but one of managing ourselves with respect to the time we have. As Peter Drucker, the distinguished management consultant, has said, time is "man's most perishable resource," and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed (see Peter F. Drucker,<i>Management</i>[New York: Harper and Row, Publishers, 1974], p. 70). Each minute is a little thing and yet, with respect to our personal productivity, to manage the minute is the secret of success.<br><br>To these suggestions regarding the little things that impact your physical self, add the encouragement to develop your thoughts along lofty paths:<br><h2><b>The Effect of a Thought</b></h2><br><i>Whenever you cultivate a thought,</i><br><i>Remember it will trace</i><br><i>With certain touch in pictured form</i><br><i>A story on your face.</i><br><br><i>Whenever you dwell upon a thought,</i><br><i>Remember it will roll</i><br><i>Into your being and become</i><br><i>A fiber of your soul.</i><br><br><i>Whenever you send out a thought,</i><br><i>Remember it will be</i><br><i>A force throughout the universe</i><br><i>For all eternity.</i><br>[Anonymous, in<i>A Collection of Inspirational Verse for Latter-day Saints,</i>comps. Bryan B. Gardner and Calvin T. Broadhead (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1963), p. 132]<br><h2><b>Relationships with Others</b></h2><br>With regard to our relationships with others, I often marvel to think of the perfect example that the Lord Jesus Christ provides in all aspects of our existence. If we were to meet him, we would find him refreshingly pleasant and perfect in all his relationships and his dealings with each individual. As we study his life and his teachings, especially those found in our modern scriptures, we learn of divine ways to relate to others and grow from our association with our fellowmen.<br><br>Have you considered his teachings in your relationship with your best friends--your parents? Do you regularly call them or write them a note to express your love and keep them informed of your progress in school and in life? Do you communicate with them simply to say, "I honor you and I value your teachings and example"? The commandment to honor father and mother does not cease when we celebrate our eighteenth, twenty-first, thirtieth, or even sixtieth birthday.<br><br>Do you take the time to remember some of the simple courtesies that are so important in your efforts to build personal regard and graciousness in relationships with others? Do you brethren hold the door for the sisters whenever you can? Do you remember the smile, the compliment, the positive note, and the word of encouragement? We should do these important little things without hesitation. They should be a part of our everyday manner as we groom ourselves socially in these critical young-adult years.<br><br>Lord Chesterfield said, "Trifles<i>,</i>little attentions, mere nothings, either done or neglected, will make you either liked or disliked in the general run of the world" (<i>Forty Thousand Quotations,</i>comp. Charles Noel Douglas [Oyster Bay, New York: Nelson Doubleday, 1917], p. 1822).<br><br>As an illustration of important little things, consider one of baseball's greats as described in the<i>Saturday Evening Post:</i><br><br><i>The guy stands</i>6'4"<i>tall. He weighs 215 pounds. To say he's tough would be an understatement. But he's proved you don't have to drink beer, spit tobacco, laugh at dirty jokes, or curse at the umpires to be a winner in baseball. He's clean as a glass of milk and gentle as a lamb. His name is Dale Murphy.</i><br><br><i>Chuck Tanner, the manager of the 1986 Atlanta Braves, calls Murphy "Mr. Perfect." In eight seasons with the Braves, the 30-year-old Murphy has compiled team career-batting figures exceeded only by the Hall of Famer Hank Aaron.</i>[And let me add that Murphy's career is far from finished.]<i>Tanner and others who have watched, coached, or played with Murphy rhapsodize when asked about the likable father of four young boys who teaches religion to teen-agers in</i>[the]<i>Roswell, Georgia,</i>[ward]<i>during the off-season. "God puts somebody down here like Murphy only every 50 years," Tanner says. "I'm not talking just about baseball, either. I'm talking about him as a person. In my opinion, there is no finer fellow on earth."</i><br><br>[And]<i>Willie Stargell.</i>. .<i>praises Murphy. "He just never has a bad word for anybody."</i>["Dale Murphy: Baseball's Mr. Nice Guy,"<i>Saturday Evening Post,</i>October 1986, p. 48]<br><br>Dale Murphy, along with many others, has learned the importance of little things in his relationships with others. Whether teaching seminary or relating to his team members, he remembers the kindnesses and compassion that endear him to his fellowmen.<br><br>Patience and long-suffering, considered by some to be little things in this life, are some of the crowning attributes in dealing with our fellowmen. Whether it be in athletics, in business, or in our Church associations, if you can acquire these two great attributes, you will find that you really can work with people and have a good influence in their lives.<br><br>Elder Richard L. Evans wrote:<br><br><i>There are battles within ourselves, and battles outside ourselves. The good strives with us</i>. . .<i>and finds itself in competition with the spirit that would tempt us to compromise, to be critical, indifferent, rebellious, to relax our standards, and do what sometime we shall surely regret.</i><br><br><i>And since everyone has his struggles, his better days and worse ones, his good impulses and less worthy ones, his arguments inside himself; since all of us need understanding, forgiveness, encouragement, all of us would well give compassionate consideration to others. One quality of character most needed in this world is compassion for other people. One of the urgent lessons of life is to learn how to live with imperfect people--including ourselves. And if we are not altogether pleased with us, it should be easy to understand why we are not altogether pleased with others.</i>[Richard L. Evans,<i>Thoughts for One Hundred Days,</i>vol. 4, (Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1970), pp. 206–7]<br><br>Henry Ward Beecher said that "every man should have a good-sized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends" (Evans, p. 207).<br><br>I am reminded of one event when compassion for others played less of a role, and the little matter of listening carefully to the coach's direction made a great deal of difference. When I played football for the University of Utah some years ago, we faced the University of Colorado in one important game. They were a very formidable team and the team we wanted to defeat the most. This game would decide the conference championship. Our coach, Ike Armstrong, who was very similar in character and personality to Coach LaVeIl Edwards, said to our large tackle, who was our kickoff specialist, "Do not kick off to Whizer White, because he has made a number of successful runbacks this season for touchdowns on the opening kickoff."<br><br>When the high-arching kickoff football returned to the earth, it landed right in the waiting arms of Whizer White, who was three yards behind the goal line. He ran the full length of the field, 103 yards, for a touchdown. All eleven players from the University of Utah touched him, but none could stop him. A little error on the part of the kicker put us seven points behind.<br><br>The second counsel the coach had given us was not to let Whizer White get beyond the scrimmage line when he carried the ball. "If you do, " he said, "he'll be gone for a touchdown." That seemingly little error became a very big challenge during that football game. On one play he did pass the line of scrimmage and made another touchdown. The score at halftime was 14–0 in favor of Colorado University. We soon learned the meaning of the worn-out complaint, "That's easy for you to say, Coach."<br><br>Five minutes after the beginning of the second half, a heavy snowstorm blew in from the Oquirrh Mountains, and we soon had eight inches of snow on the field. We managed to score a touchdown and an extra point, making the final score 14–7. Two so-called small errors cost us the game.<br><br>Other important little things that merit our attention are the small acts of service we perform for our fellowmen. President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>I have learned that it is by serving that we learn how to serve. When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves.</i>. . .<br><br><i>God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom.</i>. . . So<i>often, our acts of service consist of simple encouragement or of giving mundane help with mundane tasks, but what glorious consequences can flow from mundane acts and from small but deliberate deeds!</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Small Acts of Service,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1974, pp. 2, 5]<br><br>I am grateful to my parents for their careful attention to detail in teaching me to live the principles of the gospel in relation to my fellowmen. My father was totally honest and set a great example for us children. When I was about seven years old, he sent me to the hardware store on an errand. He had given me five dollars, which in those days could buy a great deal. When I returned home, he counted the change I had and discovered that the store clerk had given me one dollar too much. The store was about a mile from our home, but he insisted that I walk back and return the money. This is typical of the lessons of honesty he taught us all during our childhood and teenage years.<br><br>How careful are you in your dealings with your fellowmen? Are you completely honest in your schoolwork? Do you abide by the rules when you have a take-home exam or a closed-book assignment? Do you carelessly allow group work to be evaluated as your personal work when such is not allowed? Is another's computer program represented as your own creation? Such temptations are common. Likewise, the infractions are too common. But any true Latter-day Saint knows the attitude of the Lord toward such behavior. No man is worthy of his priesthood calling and no woman is without blame who consciously cheats or deals in dishonest ways.<br><br>My father also taught me the value of balance in my life. Before my senior year of football and academic pursuits, he encouraged me to go on a mission. He said, "If you don't go now, you'll probably never go." A little over two-and-a-half years later, I found myself newly released from my mission and standing on the streets of Berlin watching the German soldiers board the train to travel to Poland for the Nazi invasion. I was barely able to accomplish my travel home to Salt Lake City because of the immediate eruption of World War II. Had I not followed the advice of my father, I probably would not have had the opportunity to serve a mission.<br><h2><b>Relationship with God</b></h2><br>And now the little things in our relationship with God. In the fashioning of our spiritual bodies, our Heavenly Father took great care to place in each of us every little potential of character, of compassion, of joy, and of knowledge that we would need in our quest for personal growth. The seeds for each godly character trait are in each of us. With that assurance, we are truly able to grow toward godhood as he has commanded us. Do you recall the Savior's words to the Nephites: "What manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>What if your Creator had neglected some little things--had neglected to place within your spiritual makeup some of the necessary traits to obtain the godly nature you strive for? Suppose he had made some minor mistakes and had overlooked placing within you the ability to be honest, compassionate, or loyal. To you, such a matter would seem like an immense disservice. Yet for God it might have been an inconsequential oversight in the creation of so many millions of spirits. But he did not overlook such things. He showed perfect care in the creation of each and every spirit--each unique in specifics but common in potential.<br><br>So it must also be in our early lives. We must give attention to the detail that will help us to grow and develop in our relationship with God. We should heed the words of the prophet Alma to his son Helaman, "But behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6).<br><br>President David O. McKay focused our thinking on the purpose of our earthly existence in 1969 when he said:<br><br><i>Keep in mind that man's earthly existence is but a test as to whether he will concentrate his efforts, his mind, his soul upon things which contribute to the comfort and gratification of his physical nature, or whether he will make as his life's purpose the acquisition of spiritual qualities.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>CR,</i>October 1969, p. 8]<br><br>The desire to acquire spiritual qualities will lead us to be cautious about the little lies that make us dishonest, or about the small infractions of the Word of Wisdom that turn our bodies and spirits away from that which is sacred and worthwhile.<br><br>The same desire will cause us to pray a little longer and to be a little more forgiving of our neighbor's faults. We will love more and criticize less. If we seek personal growth in a Christ-like direction, we must make as our life's purpose the acquisition of these spiritual qualities.<br><br>Certainly one of Satan's prime messages in today's world is that we really do not need to worry about the small matters. Nephi warned us against this attitude when he said:<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.</i>. . .<br><br><i>For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish;</i><br><br><i>For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</i>[2 Nephi 28:8–9, 19–20]<br><br>So-called little transgressions are especially serious in our effort to live a life of moral purity. Satan would have us believe that the minor infractions do not need to concern us. Why worry if we do not control our thoughts or if we allow pornographic or immoral entertainment to be part of our lives? Does attending just a few R-rated movies or immoral PG movies really damage us? Are we so unworthy when we watch just two or three questionable programs on the cable television channels? Are the lewd novels of the day really so bad?<br><br>These little rationalizations prompted by Satan will become great detriments to our spiritual growth. Pornography in all its forms--found at the movie theater, on television, and in printed form--constitutes a spiritual poison that is addictive and destructive. Every ounce of pornography and immoral entertainment will cause you to lose a pound of spirituality. And it will only take a few ounces of immorality to cause you to lose all of your spiritual strength, for the Lord's Spirit will not dwell in an unclean temple.<br><br>Our prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, gave us excellent counsel just a month ago. He said:<br><br><i>We counsel you. . . not to pollute your minds with such degrading matter, for the mind through which this filth passes is never the same afterward. Don't see R-rated movies or vulgar videos or participate in any entertainment that is immoral, suggestive, or pornographic. . . .</i><br><br>. . .<i>Watch those shows and entertainment that lift the spirit and promote clean thoughts and actions. Read books and magazines that do the same.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "To the Young Women of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 84]<br><br>Perhaps Satan would tempt us further by suggesting that going a little too far in our physical affection with a boyfriend or girlfriend is not so serious. After all, we are aware of the main commandments and have no intention of violating them. But what we must remember is that our procreative powers are sacred, beautiful gifts from God and are to be used<i>only in marriage.</i>All sexual activity outside of marriage is forbidden. Our physical affection as we date, and even when we are engaged, must be limited to that which is conservative and wholesome--behavior far different than that which is commonly portrayed in the media of our day.<br><br>Lucifer is a master at step-by-step deception. He can make little things seem so harmless when, in reality, they will quickly bind the soul and destroy the spirit. He can make immodest dress and suggestive behavior seem very acceptable. He can cause us to think that a little indiscretion in speech and manner is still quite wholesome. But soon those little steps repeat themselves in an ever-descending pattern until one is at a far-lower level than ever imagined.<br><br>I suggest on the positive side that we watch for all possible little opportunities to overcome evil and increase our spiritual strength. We must let virtue garnish our thoughts unceasingly, that our confidence will wax strong in the presence of God (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>Remember that prayer is really one of the major factors in our lives. President Ezra Taft Benson relates a special experience with prayer:<br><br><i>Rearing 11 vigorous children to honorable manhood and womanhood on a small farm is no easy accomplishment. Yet, as my father and mother devoted themselves to this task, they never seemed to have any fear of the future. The reason was their faith--their confidence that they could always go to the Lord and He would see them through.</i><br><br><i>"Remember that whatever you do or wherever you are, you are never alone," was my father's familiar counsel. "Our Heavenly Father is always near. You can reach out and receive His aid through prayer."</i><br><br><i>All through my life the counsel to depend on prayer has been prized above any other advice I have ever received. It has become an integral part of me, an anchor, a constant source of strength.</i><br><br><i>Prayer came to my aid during a most terrifying experience of my early life. I was a missionary in (Sunderland) England. . . . My companion, William Harris, and I were standing back to back, facing a hostile crowd that was swelled by a rowdy element from the pubs, men who were always eager for excitement and not averse to violence.</i><br><br><i>What had started out to be a customary street meeting soon took on the proportions of an angry, unmanageable mob. Many false malicious rumors had been spread about our church activities.</i><br><br><i>The crowd started swaying. Someone in the rear called out, "What's the excitement?" Several voices shouted, "It's them bloody Mormons!" This touched off a clamorous demonstration: "Let's get 'em under our feet!" "Throw 'em in the river!"</i><br><br><i>The mob surged forward and tried to force us to the ground so they might trample us.</i><br><br><i>In my anxiety, I silently prayed for the Lord's guidance and protection. When it seemed that I could hold out no longer, a husky young stranger pushed through to my side and said in a strong, clear voice: "I believe every word you said tonight. I'm your friend."</i><br><br><i>As he spoke, a little circle cleared around me. This, to me, was a direct answer to my fervent prayer. The next thing I knew, a sturdy English bobby was convoying us safely through the crowd and back to our lodgings.</i>[Frederick W. Babbel,<i>On Wings of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, Inc., 1972), pp. 85–86]<br><br>Using that great principle of prayer taught by his parents saved the life of President Benson and his companion.<br><br>Consider President McKay's comments once again regarding the many little things that build our spirituality:<br><br><i>Every noble impulse, every unselfish expression of love, every brave suffering for the right; every surrender of self to something higher than self; every loyalty to an ideal; every unselfish devotion to principle; every helpfulness to humanity; every act of self control; every fine courage of the soul, undefeated by pretence or policy, but by being, doing, and living of good for the very good's sake--that is spirituality.</i>[David O. McKay, "Something Higher Than Self,"<i>Speeches of the Year,</i>October 12, 1965, pp. 4–5]<br><br>President McKay also taught us that "spirituality is the consciousness of victory over self, and of communion with the Infinite. Spirituality impels one to conquer difficulties and acquire more and more strength. To feel one's faculties unfolding and truth expanding the soul is one of life's sublimest experiences" (David O. McKay,<i>CR,</i>April 1949, p. 17).<br><br>These little things, which, in reality, become such big things, bring perspective to our lives as we learn to conquer them one by one in our effort to gain more and more strength. And this we do in a spirit of humility and gratitude to our Heavenly Father. Alma expressed it best when he said:<br><br><i>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</i>[Alma 7:23]<br><br>Our living prophet today, President Ezra Taft Benson, observes in a positive way that all these things are possible. He said, "Our Father's children are essentially good. I think they have, all of them, a spark of divinity in them . . . and they want to do what is right" (Ezra Taft Benson, Regional Representatives' seminar, 4 October 1973).<br><br>This is our religion. We should try to live every day with absolute faith, for we have learned in life that the Lord keeps his promises and watches over those who trust him in spite of their many faults. He has been so good to all of us that we should have a profound conviction that he must really love us in spite of our faults.<br><br>I testify to you that these so-called little things that I have mentioned tonight really do count in the eternal perspective of what it is all about, and that is to gain eternal life in the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that President Ezra Taft Benson is a true and living prophet, who works under the direction of our Lord and Savior. I pray that we may have the knowledge in our hearts and minds that little things do count as we prepare in this life to meet our Lord and Savior. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Joseph B.

<br>
<h2><b>Finding Our Way Back</b></h2><br>I want to talk with you about going home. This is the time of year when all of us feel a tug at our hearts. Many of you will be thinking about being home for the holidays. But all of us know, perhaps more than at any other time of year, that happiness in some way centers on a family--both in this world and the next.<br><br>Only as I've grown older have I come to understand what my parents did for me. Of all the influences they had on me perhaps the most powerful was the desire to somehow be worthy to be home again with my Heavenly Father, forever. And by their example, and a little preaching, they taught me how I can find my way back to my Heavenly Father. Since I learned this by using scripture to understand experience, I'll share it with you that way. But let me first tell you the lesson so it won't take you so long to recognize it. It's this simple chain:<br><br>1. We will find our way home to our Heavenly Father only if we win the companionship of the Holy Ghost so we can recognize truth.<br><br>2. The companionship of the Holy Ghost requires our being clean.<br><br>3. Being clean requires exercising faith in the Lord Jesus Christ unto repentance.<br><br>That sounds so simple, but it is so hard because there is a Satan, the father of lies, who also knows that simple chain which will give us the companionship of the Spirit of Truth. His determination to keep you from following this chain explains the blunt language Brigham Young used to describe our challenge:<br><br><i>The men and women, who desire to obtain seats in the celestial kingdom, will find that they must battle every day.</i>[<i>DBY,</i>p. 392]<br><br>The nature of that battle, and its difficulty, came clear to me in an airplane not long ago. It was a long flight, so I wrote and read and thought. As I'd rushed out of the door from home, I'd taken one of my son's worn and inexpensive editions of the Book of Mormon. As I read it on the plane, I saw that his seminary teacher had led him through it. I began to move through the book to see what passages were marked and annotated in red ink, wondering what that teacher had taught him was important. I went along and then my eyes fell on these words of the prophet Nephi:<br><br><i>Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.</i>[1 Nephi 10:21]<br><br>Those words made my heart burn, and my eyes too. I thought for a minute of what our Heavenly Father might feel as he had to send children he loved away, forever, because they could not be with him.<br><br>And then a few minutes later, after having lunch and visiting with the person next to me, I picked up a national news magazine from the pocket in the seat in front of me and began to leaf through it. I came to the movie reviews. Only three movies were reviewed. I began to read the first, stopped part way through, went to the second, and then to the third. The three films were reported to portray real people committing acts of immorality, some fortunately beyond my powers of imagination. The reviewers warned me about only one of them, on the grounds that it would be boring, and urged me to see the other two.<br><br>Just minutes later I moved a few chapters through the book of 1 Nephi where these words seemed to appear in bold print:<br><br><i>But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.</i>[1 Nephi 15:34]<br><br>That set me to pondering. I thought of you and of me. We have a problem. We live in a world where there are voices competing for our belief. They claim the authority of truth. Some are clearly lying and some are not. And you and I need to know what is true and what is not, out of far more than curiosity. We need to know. And we need to be sure.<br><br>Some of those voices--some of the loudest--tell you that the questions which matter will yield to reason. And they even warn you that those who purport to answer questions without using their rules of rational analysis are to be distrusted and even despised.<br><br>Your common sense and experience tell you something else. So does mine. Let me illustrate for you what I know about the questions that matter and how they are answered by telling you about the last conversations I had with my father.<br><br>He was suffering through the end of a long struggle with bone cancer. He still weighed enough and was in such pain that it was hard work to move him from a chair to his bed. Others far more heroic than I spent the months and the days caring for him. But I took some turns on the midnight to dawn shift.<br><br>The effects of disease had removed the powers of reason he'd used to make a mark that is still visible in science. He seemed to me almost like a child as we talked through the night. Most of his memories were of riding across the range together with his father in Old Mexico. But sometimes even those happy pictures could not crowd from his mind the terrible pain.<br><br>One night when I was not with him and the pain seemed more than he could bear, he somehow got out of bed and on his knees beside it--I know not how. He pled with God to know why he was suffering so. And the next morning he said, with quiet firmness, "I know why now. God needs brave sons."<br><br>Now, when someone tells you the questions that matter yield only to some rational analysis, remember that the stunning achievements of reason over the past three hundred years have sprung from what is called the "scientific method." I hope you'll also remember, as I always will, the scientist Henry Eyring on his knees, when the questions that really mattered yielded to the method for finding truth he'd learned as a little boy at his mother's knee in Old Mexico. This was long before he took the train to Tucson, and Berkeley, and Madison, and then on to Berlin and Princeton to use the scientific method to create theories that changed the scientific world. What he learned on his knees brought him peace and changed my life.<br><br>It changed my life, but hearing this story today will change yours only if you know that the answer to his prayer was true. And you can only know that the way he did, and the way I do--by the gentle voice of the Holy Ghost speaking to your heart.<br><h2><b>Searching for the Truth</b></h2><br>God has blessed us with sure guides to truth. Some of us have been blessed with parents who knew where to find truth. All of us can listen to the voice of a living prophet to whom God speaks the truth and asks that he tell us. The words of the prophet, and the words of scripture, are the rod which Lehi saw would lead us to the tree of life.<br><br>But many have heard those words, and read them, and still have not known that they are true. The method of knowing truth requires that both he who speaks and he who hears be guided by the Holy Ghost. You and I can only know it is the truth if we can hear the Holy Spirit confirm and expand it in our own hearts. Of all the methods of searching for the truth, that is the one you and I need most.<br><br>The key is in the words of Nephi I was reading on the plane that day. It might surprise you that in a passage on being clean would be the key to gaining the Holy Ghost as your constant companion. It shouldn't surprise you though, because in all but the most casual references to the Holy Spirit in the scriptures, the cry to be clean is close by. The pairing of spiritual cleanliness and the gifts of the Spirit, the power to know and speak truth, becomes plain in the words of Nephi.<br><br>Nephi wanted to know for himself that what his father said he had seen in a vision was true. His father had reported seeing the fearsome landscape we move across in life, either toward eternal life or toward forever being shut out from our Father. Nephi knew he had to know for himself, and so listen to how he pursued the truth:<br><br><i>And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God--and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come--I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men.</i><br><br><i>For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him.</i>[1 Nephi 10:17–18]<br><br>Now you can see why President Benson, a living prophet of God, has repeatedly said, "Read the Book of Mormon." The Book of Mormon is the most powerful written testimony we have that Jesus is the Christ. What did Nephi say was the basis for receiving the Holy Ghost? Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Will reading the Book of Mormon now and then ensure faith in the Lord Jesus Christ? You wouldn't count on it if you read Nephi carefully. He said this "is the gift ... to all those who diligently seek him." Diligently surely means regularly. And it surely means pondering and praying. And the praying will surely include the fervent pleading to know the truth. Anything less would hardly be diligent. And anything less will not be enough for you and for me.<br><br>That diligence will allow faith to grow, and then will come a desire to repent and a confidence that forgiveness is possible. Real repentance requires as diligent a pursuit as real faith. The forgiveness you seek is only possible through the ordinance of baptism, performed by God's authorized servants, and by then keeping the covenants you make with God.<br><br>If you are not yet a member of the Church, you are required to seek baptism by those who hold the priesthood of God. If you have been baptized, it means diligently keeping the covenants.<br><br>Each week you can hear in the sacramental prayer the promise you and I so much need to see fulfilled.<br><br><i>And always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:77]<br><br>That might well raise a question in your mind. You may now be reading the Book of Mormon diligently, daily. You may be praying often and with real intent. That may have led to such faith in Jesus Christ that you remember him with love. And that surely will have both led you to a broken heart and to seeking forgiveness for past sins and a determination to keep every commandment. But you may still say, "With all that, I don't seem to get the promptings of what is true as easily as I think I should if I really have his Spirit, the Holy Ghost, to be with me."<br><br>The great Prophet Joseph Smith once had a test of patience beyond what most of us have endured. He was locked in Liberty Jail and the Saints were suffering. He pled in prayer for action, now. God granted him, in answer to his prayer, something more than he asked. He told him how he would pour out knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Saints. He talked about the priceless knowledge of knowing how to act so that we may be servants of God, worthy of his power. And then he told him, and he told you and me, how it will feel as knowledge of the truth comes. Here it is, at the end of section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br><i>The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46]<br><br>You and I need to be patient, and for a reason. A quick reading of the Book of Mormon, a few prayers, a shallow attempt at repentance, a casual regard for the covenants we've made--of course that is not enough. The scriptures use over and over again the word "steadiness" to describe faithful disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. When faith and repentance and diligent efforts to live the commandments have gone on long enough that virtue garnishes our thoughts unceasingly, then the doctrine of the priesthood, the truthful answers to the questions that really matter, will distill upon us as the dews from heaven.<br><br>That's been my experience with seeking the confirmation of truth by the Spirit of God. I have at times sought it by singular effort, in times of great need, and it has come. Investigators have that experience when they reach the point where they must know if the Book of Mormon is true.<br><br>But far more often for me, I notice its presence in quiet confirmations at times when all I seem to have done is to plod on in diligence, doing the simple things--searching the scriptures with a prayer in my heart and with more concern for others and therefore less time for pursuits that let Satan, the father of lies, entice me. It's in periods of that steadiness that I notice, almost in the way you are surprised at your wet shoes from the dew formed on the grass overnight, and look up and realize the Holy Ghost has been enlightening my mind and enlarging my heart.<br><h2><b>"I Know All Their Works"</b></h2><br>Perhaps the most difficult part of the whole process is not to keep going but to begin. That's true with many projects you face. It may be hard to start writing a paper, or to work a set of math problems. But there is an added difficulty in this most important project. It is that you have a skilled adversary who both lies and urges you to lie.<br><br>Of all his falsehoods, perhaps none is so commonly used and so frequently successful as this: "No one knows, so wait to repent."<br><br>It's not true. First of all,<i>you</i>know. That almost invariably means that the price you must pay to procrastinate repentance is to lie. That lie may be that you take the sacrament when you know you are unworthy. Or it may be to live the lie of accepting the blessings of this university when you know that you have broken the pledge you made to it.<br><br>You may be perfectly content to accept that deception on top of the effects of the sin itself, but you pay a price. Even a man who looked with the eyes of science could see that pain. Lewis Thomas seemed almost surprised when he wrote this about lie detectors and their implications. Here is what he said:<br><br><i>As I understand it, a human being cannot tell a lie, even a small one, without setting off a kind of smoke alarm somewhere deep in a dark lobule of the brain, resulting in the sudden discharge of nerve impulses, or the sudden outpouring of neurohormones of some sort, or both. The outcome, recorded by the lie-detector gadgetry, is a highly reproducible cascade of changes in the electrical conductivity of the skin, the heart rate, and the manner of breathing, similar to the responses to various kinds of stress.</i><br><br><i>Lying, then, is stressful, even when we do it for protection, or relief, or escape, or profit, or just for the pure pleasure of lying and getting away with it. It is a strain, distressing enough to cause the emission of signals to and from the central nervous system warning that something has gone wrong. It is, in a pure physiological sense, an unnatural act.</i>[Lewis Thomas,<i>Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony</i>(New York: Bantam Books, 1984), p. 128]<br><br>It is unnatural in far more than a physiological sense. It is contrary to the nature of our spirits. You are a spirit child of God, a god of truth. Whatever stress your body feels from your choosing to lie, your spirit must be torn far more. The relief of that load by confessing and moving forward to full repentance will more than compensate for whatever unpleasant consequences being honest brings upon you.<br><br>Perhaps even more important than recognizing that you know what you have done is knowing that God knows. You and I can't be fooled into believing anything is hidden. The Savior taught us in 2 Nephi,<br><br><i>And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord! And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us?</i>...<i>Behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works. For shall the work say of him that made it, he made me not? Or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, he had no understanding?</i>[2 Nephi 27:27]<br><br>And not only does our Heavenly Father see all we do, but he sees us with such eyes of love that Enoch, who saw God's reaction to sin in the time of Noah in vision, asked of God in surprise,<br><br><i>How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i>[Moses 7:29]<br><br>And God explained that he saw the terrible, inescapable consequences of unrepented and unforgiven sins. He said this to Enoch:<br><br><i>And the whole heavens shall weep over them, even all the workmanship of mine hands; wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?</i>[Moses 7:37]<br><br>God knows all we have done. And while he cannot look on sin with the least degree of allowance, he looks on us with compassion beyond our capacity to measure. When the scripture speaks of the whole heavens weeping, I think of another picture, given to us by the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is what he said:<br><br><i>The spirits of the just are .</i>. .<i>blessed in their departure to the world of spirits. Enveloped in flaming fire, they are not far from us, and know and understand our thoughts, feelings, and motions, and are often pained therewith.</i>[<i>HC</i>6:52]<br><br>These words pain me when I think of those I have loved and who loved me who are surely now among the spirits of the just. The realization that they feel pain for us and that the God of Heaven weeps because of our unrepented sin is surely enough to soften our hearts and move us to action. And it is surely reason enough to avoid even the approaches, the very thought, of committing serious sin.<br><br>If you could take one picture with you in your mind today, let it be of a son, Nephi. His father told him of his vision about how to get back home again to Heavenly Father and to the Savior. But for Nephi it wasn't enough to hear his father's words. He had to know the truth for himself, to be sure he would know the way.<br><br>You've heard some words today--words about your needing the companionship of the Holy Spirit, of needing to be clean to have it, of needing to have the faith to repent to be clean, and of the deceit which will be used to keep you from repentance and so from the gift.<br><br>You might find a moment sometime before the end of this day to ask God if these words are true. You won't have a record of what I have said, so you might read them in verses 18 through 21 of the tenth chapter of 1 Nephi. You might even have a prayer in your heart now to know for yourself they are true as I read them. Here's what Nephi taught you about the loving God who has provided a way for you to come home:<br><br><i>For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him.</i><br><br><i>For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round.</i><br><br><i>Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be brought into judgment.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.</i><br><br><i>And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these things, and deny them not.</i>[1 Nephi 10:18–21]<br><h2><b>The Companionship of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>Could I now give two bits of practical advice? In my promptings from the Holy Spirit, I have a sense that you really are trying and you really want the gift of the Holy Ghost. I would give you these suggestions.<br><br>First of all, the Holy Ghost is and must be very sensitive. He can be easily offended. I worried as I came here today, hoping I might do nothing that would offend him. Let me give you a little advice the Prophet Joseph Smith gave to the leaders of the Church.<br><br><i>Here is another important item. If you assemble from time to time, and proceed to discuss important questions, and pass decisions upon the same, and fail to note them down, by and by you will be driven to straits from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves, because you may be in a situation not to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired information; or, perhaps, for neglecting to write these things when God had revealed them, not esteeming them of sufficient worth, the Spirit may withdraw, and God may be angry; and there is, or was, a vast knowledge, of infinite importance, which is now lost.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 73]<br><br>And there is or was a vast knowledge of infinite importance that is now lost. I'm not sure that means you should have been taking notes, but it means that in your heart, at least, the attitude of writing down even the simplest things that may come from the Spirit would invite the Spirit back again.<br><br>One other bit of advice. We have been talking together about ourselves, how much we need, how much we must do, how we would be blessed if we had the companionship of the Holy Ghost. My own experience is this: Of all the times I have felt the promptings of the Spirit, they have come most forcefully and most surely when I was asking Heavenly Father, "I love someone, I know they have a need, tell me what you would have me do for them."<br><br>Let me remind you of a great man. His name was Mormon. He wrote this when he was putting together what we now find in the Book of Mormon and he didn't know why he was told to put in certain things and not to put in others.<br><br><i>And I do this</i>[speaking of this arranging of the book]<i>for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.</i>[Words of Mormon 1:7]<br><br>And then, in the very next verse, it's almost as if Mormon is telling us why God is able to take him like a little child and lead him to do things God does not explain the reasons for. Listen to what he writes:<br><br><i>And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people.</i>[Words of Mormon 1:8]<br><br>Years ago a wise father got a letter from a son in the mission field who wrote, "I can't get the feeling for this work. I'm discouraged." The father wrote back what you would think would be too simple a suggestion. He wrote back and said, "Forget yourself and go to work." My prayer is that in the desire to have the companionship of the Holy Spirit we might forget ourselves and go to work and that we might truly seek the good of our Father's children. If with all our hearts we try to take his children home again, we'll be there too.<br><br>I pray that we might live so we might have the companionship of the Holy Spirit, that we might all go home again, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Henry B.
