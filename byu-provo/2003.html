<h1>y and Our Eternal Journey - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Bateman and I are pleased to welcome you to the first devotional of the new year. We are pleased that all of you experienced safe holiday travel but are saddened that three members of our BYU family are not with us today. Two accidents in southern Utah claimed the lives of two students, and a third was seriously injured. With the large number of students traveling during the holidays, the probabilities are high that accidents will occur, but injury and death bring sorrow to their families, dampen our spirits, and remind us of the Apostle James' words: "For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away" (James 4:14).<br><br>James' words remind us that the span between birth and death is short, whether we live to be 20 or 100. On the other hand, in spite of its brevity, life's purposes and consequences are profound in the span of eternity. Today Sister Bateman and I have elected to speak about the mortal journey, its purposes and challenges, and its role in the eternal plan.<br><br>We have just concluded the Christmas season wherein we celebrate the birth of our Savior. Sometimes when I ponder and review my life, I wonder what it would have been like to have lived in the time of the Savior and to have been in His presence. Would I have recognized the special nature of His being (see Matthew 22:42)? Would I have had sufficient faith to be healed by a touch of His garment (see Matthew 14:35–36)? Or if I had been in the synagogue in Capernaum and heard His words, would I like the others have murmured at the strictness of the way "and walked no more with him" (see John 6:51–66)? If the Pharisees and Sadducees had threatened me, would I have denied knowing Him out of fear for my own safety? These questions generally leave me a little unsettled.<br><br>Recently I have been thinking about another question and its answer: a question Pilate asked Jesus and the answer given by the Savior. After the chief priests and leaders of Jerusalem had taken counsel to put Jesus to death, they took Him to Pontius Pilate with the hope that the governor would approve and implement the sentence, since the Jews did not have the authority to execute capital punishment (see John 18:28–31). During the interview, Pilate asked Jesus:<br><br><i>Art thou the King of the Jews? . . .</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: . . .</i><br><br>[Not fully understanding the response, Pilate restated the question:]<i>Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.</i>[John 18:33, 36–37]<br><br>As I have pondered Pilate's question and the Savior's answer, I have come to realize their importance. They are classic. "Who am I? To what end was I born? For what purpose came I into the world?"<br><br>For a few minutes Sister Bateman and I hope to explore these questions with you. Who are we? Why are we here? What are the purposes of this mortal sphere and what are the challenges of the mortal journey? We hope we will add to your knowledge and provide incentive for each to try a little harder and, in President Hinckley's words, "stand a little taller" (Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Stand a Little Taller</i>[Salt Lake City: Eagle Gate, 2001]).<br><br>Excluding the Atonement, our purpose in coming to earth is the same as the Savior's. He was born to be a king. If faithful, we also are promised thrones, kingdoms, and principalities (see D&amp;amp;C 132:19). Jesus' kingdom was not of this world; neither is ours. In the Savior's response to Pilate, He stated that He was born to "bear witness unto the truth." We, too, were born and are reborn through the baptismal covenant to be a witness for the Truth, the Way, and the Life (see Mosiah 18:8–10).<br><br>Sister Bateman will discuss the premortal world, foreordination, and the context it establishes for mortality. I am grateful for the special woman she is. She has helped me understand why I was born and for what cause I came into the world.<br><h2><b>Premortality and Foreordination</b></h2><br><b>Sister Bateman:</b>Brothers and sisters, I am so grateful to stand by my husband and share a few moments with you. We love and honor you. I also testify that through marriage and the family one obtains a clearer understanding of life's purposes.<br><br>Also, a knowledge of the premortal life provides a framework for better understanding mortality. Prior to birth we were spirit children of a Heavenly Father. We had intellect, personality, talents, and agency. As personages of spirit it was possible for us to think and act independently. The scriptures indicate that the faithful spirits, those who accepted and lived the Father's plan, were chosen to be "added upon"; that is, to receive a physical body and to have experiences in a new earthly laboratory. The Lord told Abraham that those "who keep their first estate shall be added upon; . . . and they who keep their second estate [that is, mortality] shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" (Abraham 3:26).<br><br>Not only did we exist as spirits before birth on this earth, but our faith and activities in premortality foreshadowed our opportunities and responsibilities here. As Elder Russell M. Nelson noted in the April 2002 general conference, women were promised special gifts "before the foundation of the world" so they could play a critical role in mortality. Quoting from the Doctrine and Covenants, Elder Nelson said:<br><br><i>Sisters received special gifts</i>[before the foundation of the world].<i>They, according to the Lord, were empowered "to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, . . . for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; . . . herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified"</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:63].<i>Think of it: When a mother bears and cares for a child, she not only helps the earth answer the end of its creation</i>[D&amp;amp;C 49:16–17],<i>but she glorifies God!</i>[Russell M. Nelson, "How Firm Our Foundation,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 75–76]<br><br>May I add that she also glorifies herself.<br><br>The same pattern of foreordination holds true for men. The prophet Alma taught that men who receive the holy priesthood were "called and prepared" in premortality. In Alma's words, righteous men were<br><br><i>called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place</i>[that is, in premortality]<i>being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling.</i>[Alma 13:3]<br><br>I believe that men were not only foreordained to be priesthood holders but also were blessed to be husbands, fathers, and providers for their families.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, you were in those councils and were assigned responsibilities commensurate with your faith. President Hinckley has repeatedly stated that this is "the finest [and strongest] generation of young people ever in the history of this Church" (<i>TGBH,</i>714). You were reserved for the last days when the earth would be in turmoil and confusion. I believe the Lord knew He could count on you to be an example, to live a righteous life, to stand as a witness for Him and His work.<br><br>It is important to understand that the principle of agency is eternal. It operated in premortality, it was preserved in the Fall of Adam, and it will operate after death. Agency is a key to spiritual development. Righteous choices enhance our potential, whereas unwise choices lower the trajectory of our eternal path. The earth was created to be a learning laboratory for the body and the spirit. A veil drawn over our minds helps create this new laboratory (see 1 Corinthians 13:12). The veil separates us from the Lord, blanks our memory of the spirit world, and causes us to depend more on our own strength in making decisions. Spiritual development occurs when prayer draws us close to God and we choose to be obedient. Part of the earthly challenge is to pierce the veil, even in part, so that we may receive the Lord's guidance.<br><h2><b>The Mortal Journey and Its Challenges</b></h2><br>As noted earlier, knowledge of the premortal world provides a context for mortality. This life is the second act of a three-act play. (It is possible to divide the eternal journey into more than three parts; however, for the purposes of this presentation, three have been chosen.) We lived before birth and we continue to live after death. Although mortality is short, it is a very important portal through which we pass. It sets the compass for the path into the eternities.<br><br>There are three major purposes for the earth's creation and the mortal experience. The first is to obtain a physical body (see Abraham 3:26). The second is to grow spiritually by keeping the Lord's commandments (see Abraham 3:25). The third is to initiate an eternal family (see D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4; 132:19). Thus the physical body, spiritual growth, and family are the grand prizes of mortality.<br><h2><b>The Physical Body and Its Challenges</b></h2><br>From birth to adulthood the body grows in strength and capability. For most people physical development peaks between 20 and 30 years of age, and then a long, slow period of deterioration follows. As you know, it matters whether we neglect our physical health or take care of and attend to the needs of the body. Most of you here today are now at the peak of your physical powers. It is difficult to imagine anything other than a strong body. However, at some point, earlier for those who neglect their health and later for those who are attentive, the period of decline will commence. You may not believe it, but wait and see. Within a decade a few gray hairs will appear, there will be a wrinkle or two crease your brow, and extra pounds will begin to change your shape. The quality and length of your life is in your hands. You stand at a critical juncture. With proper care, a 20-year-old can expect to reach 80 years of age or more. (U.S. statistics indicate that a 20-year-old female's life expectancy is 80 years, whereas a male's is 75. Life expectancy for the LDS population exceeds the nation's because of lifestyle. See "United States Life Tables, 1999,"<i>National Vital Statistics Reports</i>50, no. 6 [21 March 2002]: 4; www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr50/nvsr50_06.pdf.)<br><br><b>President Bateman:</b>The body is so important in the Lord's plan that He has given commandments and counsel in three areas. The first commandment describes what is appropriate and what is not with respect to substances taken into the body. In every dispensation, from Adam to the present day, the Lord has revealed a health code. In this dispensation we call it the Word of Wisdom. In addition to outlining proper foods for the body, the Lord commands that we abstain from alcohol, tobacco, and other harmful substances. These forbidden elements harm the body, reduce its capacity to perform, and shorten life. For example, research shows that smoking reduces life expectancy by 13 to 14 years (see National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion report in "Annual Smoking--Attributable Mortality, Years of Potential Life Lost, and Economic Costs--United States, 1995–1999,"<i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>[<i>MMWR</i>] 51, no. 14 (12 April 2002): 300-303; www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5114a2.htm). The pattern of physical health associated with the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and harmful drugs is the path of "neglect."<br><br>Another law pertaining to the physical body is the moral code that prohibits sexual relations with anyone other than one's legally and lawfully married spouse. In our day the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have stated:<br><br><i>Physical intimacy between husband and wife is beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. . . .</i><br><br><i>When you obey God's commandment to be sexually pure, . . . you protect yourself from the emotional damage that always comes from sharing physical intimacies with someone outside of marriage.</i><br><br><i>. . . Satan may tempt you to rationalize that sexual intimacy before marriage is acceptable when two people are in love. That is not true. In God's sight, sexual sins are extremely serious. . . . The prophet Alma taught that sexual sins are more serious than any other sins except murder or denying the Holy Ghost (see Alma 39:5).</i><br><br><i>Before marriage, do not do anything to arouse the powerful emotions that must be expressed only in marriage. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Always treat your date with respect, never as an object to be used for your lustful desires.</i>[<i>For the Strength of Youth</i>(Salt Lake City: Intellectual Reserve, Inc., 2001), 26–27]<br><br>Satan lost the opportunity to have a body. As a consequence, he lost the opportunity to marry and have children. But he has the spirit power to provide opposition and test our choices in this area. Is it any wonder that the physical body and its sacred powers are his prime targets? In his unhappiness, he will do anything to upset the plan of happiness, which includes marriage and family.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the students on this campus are extraordinary in that the vast majority understand and follow the Lord's command to be morally clean. A key visitor to campus during the past semester was stunned when he interviewed a number of students and learned that you do not drink, smoke, use harmful drugs, or engage in sex outside of marriage. He was a police chief on another campus who had come to review our security operations. He could not believe what he saw here. Two major problems he sees on his campus daily are binge drinking and sexual abuse. He left wondering how he could take you with him.<br><br>Another area of counsel in caring for the physical body concerns dress and grooming standards. Again, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have been very explicit in this area. I quote their words:<br><br><i>Your body is God's sacred creation. . . . Through your dress and appearance, you can show the Lord that you know how precious your body is. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The way you dress is a reflection of what you are on the inside. . . .</i><br><br><i>Never lower your dress standards for any occasion. . . .</i><br><br><i>Immodest clothing includes short shorts and skirts, tight clothing, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and other revealing attire. Young women should wear clothing that covers the shoulder and avoid clothing that is low-cut in the front or the back or revealing in any other manner. Young men should also maintain modesty in their appearance. All should avoid extremes in clothing, appearance, and hairstyle.</i>[<i>For the Strength of Youth,</i>14–16]<br><br>There is a connection between how one dresses and one's appreciation of the physical body. I will return to this subject shortly.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Progress and Its Challenges</b></h2><br>Let us next consider the different trajectory that spiritual development may take. Again, the period from birth to adulthood can be a time of rapid growth. This is especially true for children born of goodly parents. Many of you, like Nephi and Enos, were raised in homes where parents set a good example, taught you to pray, and nurtured you in the admonition of the Lord. Some of you, on the other hand, are recent converts. You were contacted by the missionaries or had a friend introduce you to the gospel. Your spiritual understanding and growth may have come a few years later, but still early in life. And then there are many who do not find the gospel until late in life or even in the Millennium.<br><br>Spiritual development differs from the growth pattern for the physical body. It is not as time dependent. As long as one is obedient to eternal principles, the path has an upward slope. The height and steepness of the path are determined by the degree to which one adheres to God's laws.<br><br>There are many paths of spiritual development. It is possible to move from one path to another. Sin causes a shift to a lower trajectory, whereas an increase in faith and participation in covenants and ordinances allows one to move to a higher path.<br><br>All of us desire to be on the road leading to the celestial kingdom and eternal life. All of us experience challenges along the way. I will address three briefly. Meeting these challenges will help us prepare for eternal life.<br><br>The first challenge is to be fully committed. It is so easy to drift through life understanding what is important but only having a loose grasp on the iron rod. This is the "eat, drink, and be merry" syndrome. This is a satanic trap. In contrast, consider the commitment of a young marine in Vietnam in 1969 during the war. Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, then a member of the Twelve, visited Southeast Asia, where he met and interviewed a large number of LDS servicemen. He recalled:<br><br><i>[There I met] a handsome boy, tall, clean-faced, wholesome in his look. I said . . . , "What are you going to do when you go home? Have you ever thought of it?" . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . "Have I ever thought of it? I think of little else, sir. We're moving north again tomorrow, and if I can last another two months I know exactly what I'm going to do when I go home. I'm going to do three things. First, I'm going back to school and finish my education. . . .</i><br><br><i>"I'm also going to work in the Church and try to do some good. I've seen how desperately the world needs what the Church has to offer.</i><br><br><i>"And then I'm going to find me a beautiful girl and marry her forever."</i><br><br>Elder Hinckley countered with a question:<br><br><i>"Are you worthy of that kind of a girl?"</i><br><br><i>"I hope so, sir," he said. "It hasn't been easy to walk through this filth. It's been pretty lonely at times. But you know, I couldn't let my folks down. I know what my mother expects. I know what she's saying in her prayers. She'd rather have me come home dead than unclean." . . .</i><br><br><i>I don't know whether he lived or died. . . . We met and talked with so many and our schedule was so heavy that I do not recall his name or where he was from, but I have not forgotten him.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>710]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the last days are not a time for casual commitments. The Lord needs young people firm in the faith to light the way. There are many in the world who would like what you have if they only knew where to find it. Don't miss the incredible opportunity to grasp the rod tightly and build a firm foundation that will bring happiness now and forever. The most important time in your life is now. Be fully committed.<br><br>The second challenge is to take care of the little things. Before becoming mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani learned that if he paid attention to the little things, the big things often took care of themselves. Early in his administration he determined to eliminate graffiti throughout the city and take care of the squeegee man problem. It was "a way to establish lawful, civil behavior and a feeling of safety" (Rudolph W. Giuliani with Ken Kurson,<i>Leadership</i>[New York: Hyperion, 2002], 42). At the time "there were men who would wander up to a car stopped at a red light or in traffic, spray the windshield, and wipe it down with a dirty rag." They were called squeegee men. If the driver refused to pay them, car doors were kicked in or windows spat upon. Generally they chose to operate near the tunnels. Thus they created the first and last impressions for someone entering or leaving the city. Initially it was thought that there were thousands of these individuals. However, a careful survey revealed only about 180. Steps were taken, and within a few days they were gone (Giuliani,<i>Leadership,</i>41–43; see also 47–48). With the clampdown on these two minor problems, a remarkable thing happened. The number of murders and robberies in the city also fell.<br><br>We have a squeegee-like problem on campus. It concerns dress and grooming. The world's dress fashions for women are becoming tighter and more revealing. Some fashions for men have gone to the other extreme. A few men are beginning to wear longer hair. Again, the "body is God's sacred creation. . . . Through your dress and appearance, you can show the Lord that you know how precious your body is." My plea is for the entire community--faculty, staff, administration, and students--to help with this matter. The problem is small because the numbers are few, but it is important that improvement occur. Often a kind word in private is all that is needed.<br><h2><b>The Family--A Prize Possession</b></h2><br>The third purpose of mortality is to initiate an eternal family. Salvation is a one-by-one process, whereas exaltation is accomplished two-by-two and in family groupings. I am aware that not everyone has the opportunity to marry in this life. Fortunately, adjustments will be made in the Millennium for those who do not have the opportunity here. The most important relationships in mortality--those of the family--are meant for eternity. A key witness of our belief in the eternal family is the construction of temples across the earth. A good part of temple work is associated with the family.<br><br>The creation of an eternal family requires the husband and wife to take the long view. Perfection does not come before the trial of faith. And marriage can be a trial of faith. It is important for a young man and a young woman to understand that love will deepen over time as both live the principles of the gospel. The relationship between a man and a woman is designed to be eternal. Because the man and the woman are incomplete without each other, it is a complementary relationship. This is what Paul meant when he said, "Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:11). The relationship has the potential to refine the spiritual gifts within each person. In taking the long view, family relationships through the power of the Holy Ghost can help family members put off the natural veneer and acquire the divine attributes. They become "submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love" (Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>The world, however, is moving in the opposite direction. There are two tendencies. The first is to delay marriage. The second is to not take marriage seriously. In the first case, more and more young people are waiting until their late twenties. They want to complete their education and have a good job and a home and a car. Unfortunately, they will waste a significant portion of their productive lives.<br><br>The second tendency of not taking marriage seriously is reflected in the latest fad. Have you heard of the "starter marriage"? I guess it is like a starter home. It is a marriage that lasts no more than five years and has no children. It is the antithesis of the marriage called for in the eternal plan. It is a marriage with no faith, no hope, little meekness, and not much love. Can you imagine people finding happiness in such a circumstance? A challenge faced by society today is that people are looking for convenience and are unwilling to sacrifice. People have learned to discard everything from paper plates to spouses.<br><br>In closing, let us return to the three questions with which we began. Who are we? We are the spirit offspring of an Eternal Being who has given us the opportunity to experience mortality--a brief but critical time in an eternal journey. To what end were we born? We were born to become kings and queens with the power of life--with the power to initiate an eternal posterity. For this purpose we became stewards over a physical body and are given mortal challenges that allow us to grow. For what cause did we come? We came to be witnesses of the Truth, to be good stewards, and to serve others and help them find the Way.<br><br>I am grateful that you understand the answers to these questions. Know that you were called and foreordained to lead God's work in these last days. Appreciate the grand prizes of mortality, be fully committed, take care of the little things, and have a view into the eternities. May the Lord bless you to these ends in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>BYU President Merrill J. Bateman and his wife, Marilyn S.

<h1>g Our Prayers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I feel fortunate to be here this morning and grateful to spend a few moments with you. This university is very dear to me. The decisions that have been made over the years regarding this institution have not been made lightly.<br><br>As a church, we have invested sacred resources in this university and especially in the students. What happens here is important to the Brethren, to the Church, and to the Lord.<br><br>We are hopeful that those who walk upon this sacred ground will be an influence for good in their homes, in their communities, and throughout the world.<br><br>There is greatness here. You can feel it.<br><br>Who knows what literature, law, science, invention, insight, research, and art will flow from here? Who knows how the world will be blessed as a result of your efforts and inspiration?<br><br>One of the reasons you will achieve great things is because you will not be alone. The Lord is waiting to open the windows of heaven and magnify your righteous endeavors. He will bless your homes and your relationships. If you will come unto Him and serve Him, He will take the talents and abilities you possess and magnify them in marvelous ways.<br><br>So that we may come unto the Lord, we must communicate with Him through prayer. There may not be a commandment uttered more frequently than that we lift up our hearts and our voices in prayer to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>"Pray always," the Lord has commanded to us in these latter-days, "and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing" (D&amp;amp;C 19:38). The Book of Mormon teaches, "Ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness" (Alma 34:26).<br><br>The Apostle Paul taught that we should "pray without ceasing. [And] in every thing give thanks" (1 Thessalonians 5:17–18).<br><br>Jesus the Christ, our Exemplar, often prayed to the Father. If the Savior of all mankind felt such a need to supplicate the Father, how much more should we lift up our voices in prayer!<br><br>Every person here today lived at one time in heavenly realms. We walked with our Heavenly Father. We knew Him. We heard His voice. We loved Him.<br><br>And although we were eager to enter mortality and continue our progression, we must have regretted the separation that would accompany it. We must have sorrowed that a veil would cover our eyes and the bright memories of our lives would be cloaked in the forgetfulness of mortality. How we must have yearned to stay close to our Father in Heaven. How we must have covenanted to ever reach after Him and commune with Him.<br><br>Undoubtedly our separation from our Heavenly Father was softened when He promised that as we sought after Him in prayer, He would reach toward us.<br><br>Now we are here. Our memories of our premortal life are dim and dark. We have forgotten those things we supposed we could never forget. Unfortunately and tragically we sometimes even forget our Heavenly Father, whom we loved so dearly.<br><br>May I ask you today to consider the effectiveness of your prayers? How close do you feel to your Heavenly Father? Do you feel that your prayers are answered? Do you feel that the time you spend in prayer enriches and uplifts your soul? Is there room for improvement?<br><br>There are many reasons our prayers lack power. Sometimes they become routine. Our prayers become hollow when we say similar words in similar ways over and over so often that the words become more of a recitation than a communication. This is what the Savior described as "vain repetitions" (Matthew 6:7). Such prayers, He said, will not be heard.<br><br>Our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has observed:<br><br><i>The trouble with most of our prayers is that we give them as if we were picking up the telephone and ordering groceries--we place our order and hang up. We need to meditate, contemplate, think of what we are praying about and for and then speak to the Lord as one man speaketh to another.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>469]<br><br>Do your prayers at times sound and feel the same? Have you ever said a prayer mechanically, the words pouring forth as though cut from a machine? Do you sometimes bore yourself as you pray?<br><br>Prayers that do not demand much of your thought will hardly merit much attention from our Heavenly Father. When you find yourself getting into a routine with your prayers, step back and think. Meditate for a while on the things for which you really are grateful. Look for them. They don't have to be grand or glorious. Sometimes we should express our gratitude for the small and simple things like the scent of the rain, the taste of your favorite macaroni and cheese recipe, or the sound of a loved one's voice.<br><br>Thinking of things we are grateful for is a healing balm. It helps us get outside ourselves. It changes our focus from our pains and our trials to the abundance of this beautiful world we live in.<br><br>Think of those things you truly need. Bring your goals and your hopes and your dreams to the Lord and set them before Him. Heavenly Father wants us to approach Him and ask for His divine aid. Explain to Him the trials you are facing. Set before Him your righteous desires.<br><br>Our prayers can and should be focused on the practical, everyday struggles of life.<br><br>If we are commanded to pray over our flocks, then why should we not pray over our finals? If we should pray over our crops, then why not over other important challenges we face?<br><br>Some believe that the more eloquent a prayer, the more effective. Too often these prayers are not so much meant for the ears of the Almighty as they are for the ears of the audience. Do you want to commune with the Infinite? Then approach Him with reverence and humility. Don't worry so much about whether your words are polished or not. Worry instead about speaking from your heart. In faith, set before Him your righteous desires and your petitions, knowing that He will hear you.<br><br>Another reason many prayers have little power is that we lack faith. We approach our Heavenly Father like a child who asks something of his or her parents knowing they will refuse. Without faith, our prayers are merely words. With faith, our prayers connect with the powers of heaven and can bring upon us increased understanding, hope, and power. If by faith the worlds were created, then by faith we can create and receive the righteous desires of our heart.<br><br>What is faith? Faith is absolute confidence in that which is in absolute conformity to the will of heaven. When we combine that confidence with absolute action on our part, we have faith.<br><br>Faith without works is dead. Sometimes we expect Heavenly Father to answer our prayers when all we have done is utter a prayer. The doors of heaven will ever be closed to those who hold out their hands waiting for the blessings of heaven to drop from heaven upon them.<br><br>The legendary football coach Knute Rockne implied the same principle when he said, "I've found that prayers work best when you have big players" (www.creativequotations.com/one/471.htm).<br><br>The powers of faith are activated by action. We must do our part. We must prepare. We must do all that is in our power, and we will be blessed in our efforts.<br><br>Prayer is a private matter between you and Heavenly Father. Both He and you know when you have done what you can. Do not give a thought as to whether or not your best compares with others. In the eyes of Heavenly Father, that doesn't matter.<br><br>When you have absolute confidence in things that are in conformity to the will of God and you act with all your power to achieve them, then will you "ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (Matthew 7:7).<br><br>Perhaps one of the great challenges the Church faces in our day is that of prosperity. President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>The worst fear that I have about this people is that they will get rich</i>[and]<i>forget God. . . . This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty, and all manner of persecution, and be true. But my greater fear for them is that they cannot stand wealth.</i>[<i>Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown</i>(Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1900; New York: AMS Press, 1971), 122–23; also cited by Preston Nibley in<i>Brigham Young: The Man and His Work</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936), 128; see also Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>The Faith of Our Pioneer Fathers</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1956), 13]<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson added:<br><br><i>This particular test seems like no test at all . . . and so could be the most deceiving of all tests.</i><br><br><i>Do you know what peace and prosperity can do to a people--it can put them to sleep. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Lord has on the earth some potential spiritual giants whom He saved for some six thousand years to help bear off the Kingdom triumphantly, and the devil is trying to put them to sleep.</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "Our Obligation and Challenge," regional representatives seminar, Salt Lake City, 30 September 1977, 2–3, unpublished typescript; see also<i>TETB,</i>403]<br><br>Prosperity can deaden us to spiritual things. It can give us the illusion of power. When we are sick, we can go to a doctor and get healed. When we are hungry, we can feed ourselves. When we are cold, we can get warm. In short, most of the problems of life we can solve ourselves--we can answer many of our own prayers.<br><br>Because of the relative ease many have in acquiring their daily bread, they can become deceived into thinking they are saviors unto themselves. In their pride and foolishness they feel they have little need of a Heavenly Father. They think little of the power that created the universe or of Him who gave His life that they might live.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are warned of these modern-day idolaters: "They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 1:16).<br><br>Such men fulfill the prophecy of Paul:<br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i>[2 Timothy 3:2–5]<br><br>Man has ever worshiped the things he loves. That which we love becomes our treasure, and when that treasure is the wealth, pleasures, and praise of the world, is it any wonder that the heavens are closed to the prayers of such? Those who worship the things of this world will one day cry to their riches and plead with them to save them. In that day they will learn the coldness of their god and realize the terrible error of their ways.<br><br>Another reason that our prayers have little power is because we fail to succor those in need around us. The Book of Mormon teaches:<br><br><i>If ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing.</i>[Alma 34:28]<br><br>Our willingness to aid those in distress around us has ever been the benchmark of the disciples of Christ. Indeed, the Savior taught that our very salvation depends upon the level of our compassion for others (see Matthew 25:31–46). We love to talk of the doctrine of grace and of how because of the Atonement of the Savior we can be saved. In spite of our weakness, our sin, and our failures, if our hearts are humble and pure and we repent, "we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23).<br><br>In the end we are all beggars. We cannot merit the blessings of eternity. We can only do the best we can, cleave unto the Spirit, and depend upon the grace of a merciful Heavenly Father for His blessings.<br><br>How like unto this is our response to the poor and the distressed? In like manner they plead with us directly or indirectly for our succor. If we turn our backs upon them, can we, in turn, suppose that our Heavenly Father will be merciful to us?<br><br>As we are to those in need, so our Heavenly Father will be to us in our time of need.<br><br>In the Old Testament we read that David was one who understood adversity and the need to rely upon his Heavenly Father. As a youth he faced and conquered the giant Goliath. Afterward, the jealous King Saul sought to take his life. David fled with a small band and was constantly hunted by the king. During day or night, his life was in jeopardy. Through this experience he understood his dependence upon his Heavenly Father.<br><br>In Psalm 37 David revealed an inspired process for active prayer and faith. It is a step-by-step process that may serve as a pattern for us to follow as we seek to increase our faith and improve the efficacy of our prayers.<br><br>"Fret not" is the first step (verse 1).<i>Fret</i>means to worry or to brood about something. The first thing we must do is stop worrying. When we worry about the future, we create unhappiness in the present.<br><br>Righteous concern may lead us to take appropriate action, but worrying about things we cannot control can paralyze and demoralize us. Instead of worrying, focus on doing all that you can and then leave the worrying to your Heavenly Father. If your heart is right with Him, He will take care of the worry and the fear. We must learn to "fret not."<br><br>The second step is to "trust in the Lord" (verse 3). Why should we trust in Him? Because He is our loving and all-wise Father in Heaven. Because He is the giver of all good gifts. Because He knows us and wants us to be happy, successful, and to return to Him. God is in His heaven. He is perfect. He loves us.<br><br>I remember the many times my dear mother trusted in our Heavenly Father for my safety. I played quarterback at East High School and running back at the university. During all that time I don't think my mother ever stopped praying for my safety. She trusted in our Father in Heaven, depending on Him to protect me from major injury during the games. Although I had my share of bumps and bruises, I never had a major injury.<br><br>I suppose my mother breathed a sigh of relief when I told her that I was going to leave the football field for a season. I met with my beloved bishop, Marion G. Romney, to express a desire to serve a full-time mission. But that short, worry-free season soon ended when I was called to serve in the German/Austria Mission. Three months after I arrived in Salzburg, the name of the mission was changed to the Switzerland/Austria Mission.<br><br>The year was 1937. I arrived in Salzburg, Austria, at the very time Hitler was amassing 300,000 troops on the border for the Anschluss, his invasion of Austria.<br><br>My mother and father gathered the family to kneel in prayer morning and night and pled for my safety. I know that I felt the influence of those prayers. I trusted my Heavenly Father would hear their prayers. I trusted in my prayers that He would preserve my life.<br><br>A month before Hitler invaded Austria, I was transferred to Switzerland. My testimony is that our prayers had been answered.<br><br>"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding," we read in the scriptures. "In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths" (Proverbs 3:5–6).<br><br>The third step is "do good" (Psalm 37:3). We do good because we are followers of Christ. We do good because we are members of His church. We do good because we have made solemn covenants to serve as a light unto the world. Our Heavenly Father expects our actions to serve as a living testimony to our words. As we do good, the Lord can bless our efforts.<br><br>This is not to say that we must never make a mistake, "for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). The Lord requires that we seek Him with a humble heart, that we repent of our sins, and that we continue to do the best we can. As we make mistakes, we should learn from them and strive not to repeat them. As we do so, we become ever more Christlike, ever more as men and women of God.<br><br>As our actions contradict our professions of faith, our prayers become weak. When we do good, the Lord can work through us and magnify our efforts.<br><br>The fourth step is to "delight thyself also in the Lord" (Psalm 37:4). What a wonderful doctrine! Instead of worrying or grumbling that our prayers have gone unanswered, we should delight ourselves in the Lord. Be grateful. Be happy. Know that the Lord, in His time, will bring about all your righteous desires--sometimes in ways we predict, sometimes in ways we could not have possibly foreseen. What a wonderful recipe for happiness and peace.<br><br>Those who delight in the Lord even in times of adversity will carry with them through their trials an inner and abiding peace. The next time you are tempted to grumble, think of this passage and, instead, delight yourself in the Lord. Your step will be a little lighter, your worries a little less oppressive, and people may even want to be around you more.<br><br>The fifth step is to "commit thy way unto the Lord" (verse 5). No matter what your worries are, commit yourself to keeping His commandments. Brethren, honor your priesthood. Sisters, cleave unto the principles of light and truth.<br><br>The sixth step is to "rest in the Lord" (verse 7). Sometimes the hardest thing we can do is wait. The Lord has His own timetable, and, although it may frustrate us, His timing is always perfect. When we rest in the Lord, we allow Him to work His will for us in His own time and in His own way.<br><br>Rich blessings are promised to those who pray in this manner: "So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed" (verse 3). The Lord "shall give thee the desires of thine heart" (verse 4). "He shall bring it to pass" (verse 5). "And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday" (verse 7).<br><br>Prayer is the way we commune with the Infinite. It is a time of gratitude, a time of introspection, a time of emotion: sorrow, joy, enlightenment, and peace.<br><br>The more time we spend in righteous prayer, the more our beings will be filled with light. "And if your eye be single to my glory," the Lord has promised, "your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:67).<br><br>The more our souls are filled with light, the more we become like our Father in Heaven and the more we are capable of feeling the fruits of the Spirit. This light grows within us, often slowly. It banishes the darkness of this mortality. It sets to flight fear and doubt and all desire to do evil. It fills the soul with love, peace, and unspeakable joy.<br><br>The challenge of this mortality is to come out of the darkness into the light. Through prayer, the light of the Spirit can distill upon us line upon line, precept upon precept, until, as Brigham Young taught, the Holy Spirit "opens the vision of the mind, unlocks the treasures of wisdom, and [we] begin to understand the things of God" (<i>JD</i>1:241).<br><br>The things of God can only be understood by the Spirit of God. The Apostle Paul taught, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Corinthians 2:14).<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we learn again and again of people who fell away from the light and embraced darkness. "Because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened" (Mosiah 26:3).<br><br>As we commune with our Father in humble prayer, our hearts receive the gentle outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The Lord tells us, "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24).<br><br>Those who do not have this light ever struggle with disbelief. They cannot understand the things of God because their souls have little light. On the other hand, as our souls become filled with light, we begin to understand clearly things that once were dark.<br><br>Let me recount Joseph Smith's experience with darkness and light:<br><br><i>At the time . . . it was seen that the seemingly good feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pretended than real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensued--priest contending against priest, and convert against convert; so that all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions. . . .</i><br><br><i>During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit. . . . But so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong. . . .</i><br><br><i>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?</i><br><br><i>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads:</i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br><br><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. . . .</i><br><br><i>So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.</i><br><br><i>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction . . . , I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!<br><br><i>. . . I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)--and which I should join.</i><br><br><i>I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong. . . .</i><br><br><i>He again forbade me to join with any of them. . . . When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home.</i>[JS--H 1:6–20]<br><br>Lorenzo Snow wrote of such an experience:<br><br><i>Some two or three weeks after I was baptized . . . I began to reflect upon the fact that I had not obtained a</i>knowledge<i>of the truth of the work . . . , and I began to feel very uneasy. I laid aside my books, left the house, and wandered around through the fields under the oppressive influence of a gloomy, disconsolate spirit, while an indescribable cloud of darkness seemed to envelop me. I had been accustomed, at the close of the day, to retire for secret prayer, to a grove a short distance from my lodgings, but at this time I felt no inclination to do so. The spirit of prayer had departed and the heavens seemed like brass over my head. At length, realizing that the usual time had come for secret prayer, I concluded I would not forego my evening service, and, as a matter of formality, knelt as I was in the habit of doing, and in my accustomed retired place, but not feeling as I was wont to feel.</i><br><br><i>I had no sooner opened my lips in an effort to pray, than I heard a sound, just above my head, like the rustling of silken robes, and immediately the Spirit of God descended upon me, completely enveloping my whole person, filling me, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, and O, the joy and happiness I felt! No language can describe the almost instantaneous transition from a dense cloud of mental and spiritual darkness into a refulgence of light and knowledge, as it was at that time imparted to my understanding. I then received a perfect knowledge that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and of the restoration of the holy Priesthood, and the fulness of the Gospel. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . That night, as I retired to rest, the same wonderful manifestations were repeated, and continued to be for several successive nights. The sweet remembrance of those glorious experiences, from that time to the present, bring them fresh before me, imparting an inspiring influence which pervades my whole being, and I trust will to the close of my earthly existence.</i>[In Eliza R. Snow,<i>Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Company, 1884; reprint, 1975), 7–9; emphasis in original]<br><br>My brothers and sisters, such spiritual experiences are available to all who come before their Eternal Father with a broken heart and contrite spirit. One of the things we must do in this mortality is chase away the darkness. We must fill our souls with the light of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The rich blessings that can come into our lives through prayer are available to all. The poor have as much access as the rich. The movie star has no advantage over the laborer. We are all equal in our ability to approach the throne of our Heavenly King.<br><br>The Lord does not care whether we are smart, rich, talented, famous, or skilled. He loves us because we are His children. The Savior tells us, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 3:20).<br><br>As we approach our Heavenly Father in the name of Christ, we open the windows of heaven. We can receive from Him truth, light, and knowledge.<br><br>Prayer is the doorway through which we commence our discipleship to things heavenly and eternal. We will never be alone so long as we know how to pray.<br><br>I leave you my witness that our Heavenly Father lives and answers prayers. Jesus is the Christ. The Prophet Joseph Smith restored the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. This church today is led by a prophet of God, President Gordon B. Hinckley. I am not alone in proclaiming these truths. Through the power of prayer, millions of people throughout the world add their voice to the growing chorus. God speaks to man today! He directs His church.<br><br>It is my earnest desire that members of the Church will reexamine their own lives through the context of prayer. That we may ever lift up our voices to our Heavenly Father and fill our souls with celestial light is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joseph B.

<br>
I can see in my mind's eye the students, young adults, gathered in the beautiful new institute building in San Salvador in El Salvador, where I was just seven days ago. I see them in Samoa, Madrid, Pusan, Accra in Ghana, Mendoza, Moscow, Seattle, in Anchorage, in Virginia, and dozens of other places.<br><br>To them I say, "Welcome! Bienvenidos! Willkommen! Foon ying! Sdrazvoudje! Yoo koso! And welcome!" I am counting on the dedicated interpreters to give that welcome in the other 25 or so languages. I find that, through them, my Spanish is perfect, my Russian is adequate, and I am a man of many tongues.<br><br>Now, you are young, and I am not. I have been where you are, but you have not been where I am. With the encouragement of my wife, I am going to do something I have never done before. That is to speak very openly and directly and personally to you, speak more about myself than ever I have before a congregation.<br><br>My wife reminded me that you will be leading families and, of almost as much importance, leading the Church in the years ahead.<br><h2><b>A Body Through Which Your Spirit Can Function</b></h2><br>When I was five years old I became very ill. It later turned out that I had polio. That was not diagnosed by the small town doctor. I lay for several weeks on a World War I army cot in our front room beside a coal stove. After those weeks, the doctor said I could get up, having been cured of "pneumonia." I found I could not walk. I remember clearly sliding around on the linoleum floor and pulling myself up on the chairs and learning to walk again.<br><br>As I moved on into elementary school and junior high and then into high school, I found that my muscles were very weak. I was very self-conscious. I could not be an athlete.<br><br>And it did not help a lot when I read about the man who went to a doctor to see if he could get some help with his inferiority complex. The doctor studied him for a while and said, "You don't have a complex. You<i>are</i>inferior!"<br><br>With that encouragement, I set about through life and tried to compensate in other ways.<br><br>Just as we were about to graduate from high school, World War II opened up. As senior boys, we all lamented that the war would be over before we were out of high school in June. Little did we know!<br><br>My older brother was a pilot, and I thought, "Well, I am going to be drafted. I think I will at least try to enlist in the Air Cadet pilot training program." To my surprise, I passed the physical. In looking back on that, I can see two reasons for it: one was that they had learned that you did not have to be a well-muscled athlete to fly a plane. The other reason was perhaps more important: they needed tens of thousands of pilots and bombardiers and navigators.<br><br>And so, I went to basic training, boot camp, and there the physical training was very rigorous.<br><br>I soon found myself in the Air Cadet program where the physical part of it was also very strenuous. So I was back on the army cot, lying at night in agony with aching muscles and swollen limbs and the thought that in the morning we would go right at it again. Actually, that was the best possible therapy.<br><br>In that time, I learned to pray. I learned the difference between saying prayers and praying, earnestly praying for health and strength and wisdom.<br><br>And then something happened that changed my life entirely in a remarkable way. I had my patriarchal blessing. Usually these are very, very private, and we do not talk about them with others and do not read parts of them to others. But I am going to read a paragraph or two to you tonight, you young people who are with us all over the world.<br><br>The patriarch, whom I had never met before, blessed me in this way, in part:<br><br><i>You had the opportunity before coming here to voice your desire to have this privilege of Earth Life in the council of the spirit world. You were valiant in the defense of truth and right. You made a free and willing decision to abide by the laws of Eternal Progress as outlined by our elder brother, the Lord Jesus Christ. You kept faithfully your first estate and have been added upon by being born into this world and given a physical body with which you might experience Earth Life. You have been given a body of such physical proportions and fitness as to enable your spirit to function through it unhampered by physical impediments. You should cherish this as a great heritage. Guard and protect it--take nothing into it that shall harm the organs thereof because it is sacred. It is the instrument of your mind and the foundation of your character</i>. [Patriarchal blessing of Boyd K. Packer, 15 January 1944, 1]<br><br>I, all at once, did not care what kind of a body I had. I had a body of sufficient capacity to let my spirit function through it. I had learned that a body is sacred.<br><br>I found that it did not matter, really, what kind of bodies we have, so long as we understand that our spirit and our body are combined in such a way that our body becomes an instrument of our mind and the foundation of our character.<br><br>From then on, I saw no purpose, nothing to be gained, by talking to other people about my aches and pains. I just moved on through life.<br><br>I will read some<i>very</i>significant paragraphs by Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. . . .</i><br><br><i>All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not. The devil has no power over us only as we permit him. The moment we revolt at anything which comes from God, the devil takes power.</i>[Joseph Smith,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>sel. Joseph Fielding Smith (1976), 181]<br><br>Now, let me restate that: The punishment of the adversary was that he did not receive a body. All beings who have bodies, as the Prophet said it, will have power over those who do not. The devil has no power over us, only as we permit him.<br><br>That was a great moment of enlightenment when I read in my patriarchal blessing. And then, as I began to study and learn, there came the knowledge and understanding of who we are and where we came from.<br><br>I was in the military--had not been on a mission, had not had any college, and often was alone. We often are alone, all of us, in our lives. I became a product of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>I have here a small, serviceman's copy of the Book of Mormon. It is bound in leather, real leather. I picked up an old leather pilot's flight jacket in the wreckage of our headquarters on the little island of Ie Shima in the Ryukyu Islands. It was wet, and the building was torn all to pieces. Everything on the island was destroyed by a hurricane. I rescued the old leather pilot's jacket from the wreckage. The cover of my Book of Mormon was getting very torn, so I gave it a leather cover, genuine leather. I sewed it on myself. The bindings I took from the strings of a parachute that likewise had been ruined.<br><br>I do not know whether it has any meaning, but there was one other thing I picked up in that wreckage of the orderly room: a dictionary. I found out you cannot find anything unless you know how to spell it before you look! That became part of my education.<br><h2><b>Knowledge of Right and Wrong</b></h2><br>From the Book of Mormon I learned something else that is very important. Moroni taught:<br><br><i>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil;</i>[The Spirit of Christ or Light of Christ is given to every man. I will comment on that in a moment.]<i>wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</i>[Moroni 7:16]<br><br>I had already read, when I came to that, the statement of Nephi in 2 Nephi that all "men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil" (2 Nephi 2:5).<br><br>So that is built into us. We know what is right and what is wrong. We all know. That is a very important thing to understand. As we move through life, we begin to understand some other things.<br><br>We live in very troubled times--the beginning of even more troubled times. I want to speak to you very openly. What we faced in World War II, the jeopardy and challenge, was nothing compared to what you young people face now. It is a terrible and challenging time and, at once, perhaps the best time ever in the history of mankind to be alive.<br><br>I want to make this point: In the premortal existence, we were given spirit bodies, and we were given agency. So we are free. Let me read verses from the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.</i><br><br><i>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.</i><br><br><i>All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:27–30]<br><br>So there we are. We have agency. What happens in our lives and in our pattern of eternal progression is just what we decide it will be.<br><br><i>All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.</i><br><br><i>Behold, here is the agency of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:30–31]<br><h2><b>The Great Plan of Redemption and the Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>As we learn about ourselves and learn about the great plan of redemption, we know that in the premortal existence intelligence existed forever. It was not created. It will exist forever. In due course, we were given a spirit body (see Acts 17:29; D&amp;amp;C 93:33–35; Abraham 3:22–23; 5:7). We became then the sons and daughters of God. We had gender then. We were male or female (see Genesis 1:27; Matthew 19:4; Mark 10:6; D&amp;amp;C 20:17–18; 132:63; Moses 2:27; 6:9; Abraham 4:27). While in that existence, we were valiant and chose good, as Alma recorded (see Alma 13:3).<br><br>Alma said that "God gave unto them commandments,<i>after</i>having made known unto them the plan of redemption" (Alma 12:32; emphasis added).<br><br>The great plan is called the great plan of redemption and six or seven other titles (see 2 Nephi 11:5; Alma 12:25; 17:16; 34:9; 41:2; 42:5, 11–13, 15, 31; D&amp;amp;C 101:22; Moses 6:62). Alma called it "the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8).<br><br>Then, in the course of our having chosen good (and that was mentioned in my patriarchal blessing), we had a body prepared by mortal parents, and we were born into mortality. With that came the power to create life, to follow the plan of redemption, the plan of happiness. How we employ that power and understand the supernal value of it is one major factor that will determine where we go in life.<br><br>That paragraph was a revelation to me. The patriarch, who is a prophet, said, "Take nothing into [the body that would] harm the organs thereof."<br><br>As I began to read, I came to section 89 and learned that it was "a Word of Wisdom, . . . given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints" (D&amp;amp;C 89:1, 3). And "the weakest of all saints" included me.<br><br>There was another essential point. The Lord said, "I warn you, and forewarn you."<br><br>"In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation" (D&amp;amp;C 89:4).<br><br>The scriptures say elsewhere that "this is a day of warning, and not a day of many words" (D&amp;amp;C 63:58).<br><br>In one way, I envy you with your youth and looking forward to all the opportunities and challenges. In another way, I'm glad I'm old! It is more comfortable.<br><br>The "Word of Wisdom [was] given for a principle with promise" (D&amp;amp;C 89:1, 3). But what is the promise? The promise, of course, is personal revelation.<br><br>[Those who remember to do these things will]<i>receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; . . .</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i>[And that means we will have some measure of health, which, I have learned, is of secondary importance.]<br><br><i>And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18, 20–21]<br><br>And this: "[You shall receive] great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" (D&amp;amp;C 89:19).<br><br>Now, the Word of Wisdom is, I think, only incidentally to keep us healthy, if we will observe it. But that matter of physical health is a losing battle. You know, no matter what you do to take care of your body, in due course, it begins to weaken! We are not going to live forever in this life. We can live with our infirmities.<br><br>I remember once we were having a sacrament meeting in the temple. Elder Marion D. Hanks was passing the sacrament. I had a catch in my shoulder, and I could not get my hand up to the bread plate. It was very awkward. I was very embarrassed. Finally, we accomplished it, and later I apologized to him and said, "I just couldn't; my shoulder just wouldn't move!"<br><br>And he said, "My shoulder wouldn't move, either! I couldn't get the thing down to you!" So that was some comfort.<br><br>We have accepted as the Word of Wisdom in the Church standards that we will not change. You are not going to go on a mission unless you observe it. You are not going to go to the temple for the more sacred ordinances unless you observe it. That is no tea or coffee or liquor or tobacco or whatever else is covered by it.<br><br>We get strange letters asking if this or that is a part of the Word of Wisdom. Marijuana is not listed in section 89! And neither is strychnine or arsenic listed! But, of course, they are not habit-forming.<br><br>The point is, if you want to move on spiritually and do as you ought to do in this life, the principle outlined in the Word of Wisdom shows you the requirements. You cannot just toy with it.<br><br>Just a week or two ago before a seminary class began, some students were standing at the back of the room. It was a Monday. A new girl in the class overheard them. These very foolish young people were talking about their weekend and what drinks they had. One of them turned to her and said, "What is your favorite drink?"<br><br>She said, "Water, Stupid!"<br><br>And so, like it or not! If you are tampering, if there is any mischief, you have got to quit it! It is not that you are going to be a healthy athlete all of your life, and it is not that you are going to avoid old age. It is that you<i>will</i>have the key to revelation. When your body begins to deteriorate, the patterns of revelation will be augmented and magnified.<br><h2><b>Two Conflicting Influences</b></h2><br>It is another thing to know that the Holy Ghost is conferred upon us at the time of baptism. Remember, "first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Articles of Faith 1:4).<br><br>In the Book of Mormon again:<br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ</i>[as Nephi said].<i>Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i>[2 Nephi 32:3]<br><br>Now, you in your youth are being prompted. If you will keep your body in a worthy, receptive circumstance, you will be prompted, even have angels attend you. Angels will attend you and will "speak [to you] by the power of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>But you also should know, as Moroni said, "[The devil] persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him" (Moroni 7:17).<br><br>So you are the focus of two conflicting patterns trying to influence you in your life, trying to have you go this way or that way (see Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13; James 1:8). You are the one who makes the decision.<br><br>As the old man a generation ago said, "The Lord's votin' for me, and the devil's votin' against me, but it's<i>my</i>vote that counts!" And that is good, solid doctrine.<br><br>You will have just what you want. On one hand, you have inspiration from the Holy Ghost, and, on the other hand, you have what President Ezra Taft Benson called "sinspiration" from the angels of the devil. They are with you all of the time.<br><br>I gave a talk once in which I likened the mind to a stage. There is always something going on in that stage. Whatever you think is going on in the stage, these ideas and promptings and temptations will move in from the side. What do you do about it? You ought to have a delete key.<br><br>I know a little about computers because my grandchildren have taught me. I know that every computer keyboard has a delete key. If there is something there you do not want, something you did that you want to get rid of, you underline it and delete it.<br><br>You can have a delete key in your mind. Your mind is in charge, and your body is the instrument of your mind. Now you will have to figure out a delete key for yourself.<br><br>One man showed me once that he used his wedding ring. He said that whenever there was an unworthy thought that tried to get into his mind--and those influences are everywhere--he just rubbed his thumb against his wedding ring. That was the delete key, "Get out of my mind! I am in charge!"<br><br>You are in command. You cannot say that you do not know any better. You do know better!<br><br>There are other ways. Music is powerful. My older brother taught me that.<br><br>When he was flying in the Eighth Air Force, it was terrible. He was shot down twice. But he said finally he got so he was not afraid. He was not afraid because when fear came, he turned on this little orchestra in his mind. He took his favorite hymn and played it over and over in his mind.<br><br>I learned something, and I have since lived that way. When some ugly thought from the nether kingdom tries to get into my mind, I move it out with good music, hymns (see D&amp;amp;C 25:12).<br><br>That is one of the reasons why you are very, very, very, very, very, very foolish when you like to participate in music that is dark and noisy. Worthy inspiration cannot get through to you where you are. No matter how popular it may be or how much you want to belong, just remember that there are those angels of the devil using you.<br><br>Remember the incident when Christ crossed the water and came to a cave where there were two wild men possessed of the devils. Those spirits said to Him, "What have we to do with [you]?" (Matthew 8:29). They knew what was going to happen.<br><br>They begged, "If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine" (Matthew 8:31). There was a herd of swine feeding there. They would rather go there. They did not have a body, could not get a body, would not ever have a body, and they were temporarily in possession of the bodies of those poor men. Christ did that. Then it records that the swine ran away into the sea and were drowned. (See Matthew 8:28–32.)<br><br>Learn from the scriptures. They are teaching you--teaching about everyday life.<br><h2><b>Marriage and the Sacred Powers of Creation</b></h2><br>The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve issued a proclamation on the family. I can tell you how that came about. They had a world conference on the family sponsored by the United Nations in Beijing, China. We sent representatives. It was not pleasant what they heard. They called another one in Cairo. Some of our people were there. I read the proceedings of that. The word<i>marriage</i>was not mentioned. It was at a conference on the family, but marriage was not even mentioned.<br><br>It was then they announced that they were going to have such a conference here in Salt Lake City. Some of us made the recommendation: "They are coming here. We had better proclaim our position."<br><br>You read the proclamation on the family. Read it carefully. I will read the first paragraph:<br><br><i>We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>Here the physical body comes into play. Within us is the sacred power of creation. The adversary is busy with all his angels focusing right to the bull's-eye of what would destroy us quickest.<br><br>There is the matter of pornography. It has become almost a pornographic world. Now, you leave it alone! If you have any, destroy it! And if you know somebody that has it, help them destroy it! And do not look at it, not ever! It is destructive, and it will take you on a path that is not consistent with who you are and what you can decide. Do not watch it, not ever!<br><br>To talk in something less than casual terms, do not ever let anybody touch your body in order to stimulate in any way those sacred powers of creation. Nobody! Not of your same gender or any gender! That power is to be expressed only and solely with your husband or wife to whom you are legally and lawfully married (see D&amp;amp;C 42:22). Then all of the happiness possible is open to you. You must guard that sacred power with your life.<br><br>If you young women are going with a young man who wants to take you to places where you should not go, however appealing, to those dark and noisy places, and there is some move to try to get you to do something you know you should not do, cut it off. Break it up! Send him a letter. Stamp it "Second-Class Male."<br><br>It is just that serious. No pornography! No mischief! You save those creative powers until they are used for the purpose for which they were intended and that to create a family.<br><br>There are natural instincts, and they are very strong; they have to be. And they are good! There are also cravings and temptations. There can be habitual self-stimulation and a lot of things that are just unworthy of you.<br><br>The young men are not the only ones. We are finding now that the young women, unaccustomed in times past, are becoming aggressive. You young men guard yourselves. You just let it be known that you have ahead of you the fulfillment of the blessings that come with the great plan of happiness. There is not a man that I know that cannot send a woman who has those designs away with just a look or a gesture and just<i>No!</i>And the same with those young women to those young men.<br><br>You may feel alone. A lot of times you are alone. But that is part of what life is.<br><h2><b>Understanding the Plan of Redemption</b></h2><br>People write asking what is the position of the Church on the Word of Wisdom, for instance, on soft drinks or something. And we think, "Why do they have to ask?" It is a principle, and you have the freedom to do as you will. You do not have to be commanded in all things. Without having to have the Church deliver a statement on it, you should know what the Lord's position is on abortion or cloning or same-gender marriage or birth control. All of those things are built in as a part of what we know and what we are.<br><br>We are about the only ones left in the world who hold to these standards. When we look around, we cannot find any organization that is holding to the standards. We do not like to talk about the other churches, but we are going to stand alone. If so, there we will stand.<br><br>There are many things that cannot be understood or taught or explained unless it is in terms of the plan of redemption. Unless you understand the basic plan--the premortal existence, the purpose of life, the Fall, the Atonement, the Resurrection--unless you understand that, the unmarried, the abused, the handicapped, the abandoned, the addicted, the disappointed, those with gender disorientation, or the intellectuals will find no enduring comfort. You will not think life is fair unless you know the plan of redemption.<br><br>Some say they are born with some tendency. Whether you are born with them or you acquired them or you got them through over-medication, addiction, or any other way, what should you do? Resist them! You resist them and push them away. How long? As long as you live. There are some things that are a lifelong battle.<br><h2><b>An Unfinished Composition</b></h2><br>Finally, two things: Ten years ago I was in England on my sixty-eighth birthday. I was having a little difficulty. I could not easily put on a coat. To comb my hair, I kind of had to bend down and did not do it very well at that. I wrote a few lines which I have since entitled "Unfinished Composition." This is not going to impress your English professors.<br><br><b>Unfinished Composition, Part I, 1992--Written in England</b><br><i>I had a thought the other night;</i><br><i>A thought profound and deep.</i><br><i>It came when I was too worn down,</i><br><i>Too tired to go to sleep.</i><br><br><i>I'd had a very busy day</i><br><i>And pondered on my fate.</i><br><i>The thought was this:</i><br><i>When I was young, I wasn't sixty-eight!</i><br><br><i>I could walk without a limp;</i><br><i>I had no shoulder pain.</i><br><i>I could read a line through twice</i><br><i>And quote it back again.</i><br><br><i>I could work for endless hours</i><br><i>And hardly stop to breathe.</i><br><i>And things that now I cannot do</i><br><i>I mastered then with ease.</i><br><br><i>If I could now turn back the years,</i><br><i>If that were mine to choose,</i><br><i>I would not barter age for youth,</i><br><i>I have too much to lose.</i><br><br><i>I am quite content to move ahead;</i><br><i>To yield my youth, however grand.</i><br><i>The thing I'd lose if I went back</i><br><i>Is what I understand.</i><br><br>Now a few months ago, ten years later, I added Part II of this "Unfinished Composition."<br><br><b>Part II, 2002</b><br><i>Ten years have flown to who knows where</i><br><i>And with them much of pain.</i><br><i>A metal hip erased my limp;</i><br><i>I walk quite straight again.</i><br><br><i>Another plate holds neck bones fast--</i><br><i>A wonderful creation!</i><br><i>It backed my polio away;</i><br><i>I've joined the stiff-necked generation.</i><br><br><i>The signs of aging can be seen,</i><br><i>Those things will not get better.</i><br><i>The only thing that grows in strength</i><br><i>With me is my forgetter.</i><br><br><i>You ask, Do I remember you?</i><br><i>Of course, you're much the same.</i><br><i>Now don't go getting all upset--</i><br><i>I don't recall your name.</i><br><br><i>I would agree I've learned some things</i><br><i>I did not want to know,</i><br><i>But age has brought those precious truths</i><br><i>That make the Spirit grow.</i><br><br><i>Of all the blessings that have come,</i><br><i>The best thing in my life</i><br><i>Is the comfort and encouragement</i><br><i>I get from my dear wife.</i><br><br><i>Our children all have married well,</i><br><i>With families of their own.</i><br><i>With children and grandchildren,</i><br><i>How soon they all have grown.</i><br><br><i>I have not changed my mind one bit</i><br><i>About regaining youth.</i><br><i>We're meant to age, for with it</i><br><i>Comes a knowledge of the truth.</i><br><br><i>You ask, What will the future bring?</i><br><i>Just what will be my fate?</i><br><i>We'll go along and not complain.</i><br><i>Ask when I'm eighty-eight!</i><br><br><b>Part III, to be continued</b><br><h2><b>A Broken Bird</b></h2><br>Now, the last thing I want to talk to you about: a broken bird.<br><br>Over the years, as a diversion, I have carved wooden birds. Sometimes it would take a year to complete one. I would get specimens and measure the feathers and study the colors and then carve them. I would carve a setting for them. It was very restful. Sometimes when I would get unsettled, my wife would say, "Why don't you go carve a bird!" It was a very calming thing in my life.<br><br>Elder A. Theodore Tuttle and I were going into town one day. I had one of the carvings. I was taking it in to show someone. We had put it on the backseat. At an intersection, he slammed on the brakes, and the carving tipped upside down on the floor and broke to pieces. He pulled over to the side and looked at it. He was devastated. I was not.<br><br>Without thinking, I said, "Forget it. I made it. I can fix it." And I did. I made it stronger than it was. I improved it a bit.<br><br>Now, who made you? Who is your Creator? There is not anything about your life that gets bent or broken that He cannot fix and will fix. You have to decide. If some of you have made mistakes and you think you are broken and cannot be put together, you do not know the doctrine of the Church. You do not know what the Atonement was about and who the Lord is and what a power He is in your life.<br><br>This is His Church. We are His servants. We who hold the priesthood have His authority and power. We can perform miracles. We do not talk about them. Most of those miracles have to do with healing the body. The greater miracles are the miracles of spiritual growth and healing in the lives of every one of us.<br><br>So if you are on the wrong path, then you must decide. You have the agency. You have the promptings of the Holy Ghost to guide you. There is that great truth that the gospel is a gospel of repentance. Repentance is like a mathematical equation. Repentance leads to forgiveness.<br><h2><b>A Marvelous Time to Be Alive</b></h2><br>You young people, move ahead in your lives. It is a marvelous time to be alive. The world is not going to come to an end. You are going to have time to stand, as I stand now, talking about your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren. You decide!<br><br>You were born as spirit children of God in the premortal existence. You were born to earthly parents in this life. "The spirit and the body [eternally combined, the Lord said,] receive a fulness of joy" (see D&amp;amp;C 138:17; see also D&amp;amp;C 93:33–34). "And the spirit and the body [combined] are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15).<br><br>You are consummately precious to the Lord, to the Church, to your parents, to one another. You now must decide what is right--you know what is right--and then have the courage to do it. You will be blessed and redeemed and exalted.<br><br>As a servant of the Lord, I invoke His blessings upon you, you consummately precious young people, that you will be protected, that you will learn how to hold the powers of the adversary in abeyance simply because you command it (see James 4:7), and that he has no place with you. On the other hand, you learn to invite the Spirit of Revelation that will be constantly with you. The Holy Ghost will be your constant companion and "teach you all things" (John 14:26).<br><br>May you be blessed, and your parents who have sent you here. And may you look forward to a marvelous life in the greatest work that has ever been on the face of this earth.<br><br>I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ. He lives. We know Him. He directs this Church. The gospel is true. The plan is a great plan of happiness. With all that we should<i>want</i>to do, we are, in one way,<i>compelled</i>to do by commandment of the Almighty. I bear that witness and invoke that blessing upon you as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Boyd K. Packer was Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 February 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>of Choice - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great pleasure to be with you today in this devotional. I am prayerful that the time we spend together will motivate each of us to consider our lives and to evaluate where we are as we begin this new year.<br><br>Have you noticed how the seasons of our lives move forward in a never-ending stream? I have been fascinated--sometimes surprised, but almost always invigorated--by the changes I have experienced so far in the seasons of my life. Our personal choices are different as we pass through each new season. Do you remember how many of your choices as a small child focused on play, on discovering the world and people around you, and on simple decisions that made you smile? As you grew to the age of accountability and beyond, choices became more critical. The adversary knew this, of course, and worked harder than ever to influence your choices as you matured. Progressing through the seasons of childhood into the teenage years and young adulthood, did you notice that the Spirit has a tremendous capacity to guide you, to lead you to productive, righteous choices? And as we qualify ourselves to be led by the Spirit in every season of life, the choices we must make become more clear.<br><br>Through the spring, summer, fall, and winter of our life, one thing remains constant: we are free to<i>choose.</i>We fought for this right. It is ours. No matter how sheltered we may have been in our season of childhood, or how much we may have leaned on loved ones and friends to keep us safe, there come countless times in life when we have to choose for ourselves, when we, alone, face the winds of adversity, when we struggle and stand up to temptation, when we must choose which road to travel and then accept the consequences of that choice. Trusted friends cannot always go with us. Parents and teachers will not always be watching. Others are not in a position to make our choices or live our lives. In every season of life we have the opportunity to choose for ourselves.<br><br>In the Pearl of Great Price we are taught that it was God who gave us that power to choose. In Moses 4:2–3 we read:<br><br><i>But, behold, my Beloved Son . . . said unto me--Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down.</i><br><br>Our Heavenly Father was not about to leave His precious sons and daughters on this earth without a means by which they could grow and learn and search and reach to find their way back to Him. The means by which God planned for our return is our free agency--our personal freedom to choose. In explaining these verses in Moses 4, Elder Charles W. Penrose said:<br><br><i>Here we read that that power of choice, the gift, the ability to understand right from wrong, to understand light from darkness, was given to the spirit of man by the Lord. . . . The power of volition is in the spirit man and he brings it with him when he is born into the earthly sphere, and so we can do good or do evil as we elect.</i>[Charles W. Penrose,<i>CR,</i>October 1914, 40]<br><br>The scriptures are replete with further declarations of our power of choice. For example, here are Father Lehi's words:<br><br><i>Men are free . . . to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i><br><br><i>And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit;</i><br><br><i>And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.</i><br><br><i>I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27–30]<br><br>Father Lehi understood the power of choice.<br><br>Years ago, after a visit to the former Soviet Union with the Young Ambassadors, we had the pleasure of welcoming our interpreter from Leningrad, Jessica Petrova, as she came to visit us in Utah. Early in her visit Jessica accompanied my wife, Susan, to the grocery store. As she entered the store she immediately observed what appeared to be thousands of boxes of different kinds of breakfast cereals. She was so disturbed by what she saw that she asked my wife if she might wait for her in the car. As Susan finished shopping and joined Jessica in the car, Jessica said: "It seems wicked that you have so much, so many choices in your country, and I have no choice. I wait in lines for hours at my neighborhood market for whatever food is arriving that day. I have no choice." Of course, this was at a time of difficult transition in that part of the world, but Jessica's comment caused my wife and me to look at our opportunity to choose with greater sensitivity and understanding.<br><br>In today's world we are literally bombarded with choices. In fact, in recent decades the number of choices in our lives have multiplied many times over. Local grocers stock not only hundreds of kinds of cereal but every other imaginable food. With the touch of a remote control we can choose between hundreds of television stations through cable TV or a satellite dish. This is a big change from the three stations that my mom and dad first enjoyed when black-and-white television became available in southern Idaho, where we were living at the time. Today we may choose to shop in hundreds of stores in convenient shopping malls that are filled to overflowing with merchandise from all over the world. With so many choices being required of us every day, we may become weary of choosing. This weariness can place us in a rather dangerous position. If we are weary of the mundane, everyday choices, we may also become weary of making life choices that are far more important than which brand to buy or which television program to watch. With marketing teams working around the clock to capture our attention, we may occasionally allow someone else to make choices for us. Sometimes, however, our inability to make the right choice threatens the very core of our eternal lives. If we allow ourselves to sit back and "go with the flow" of society, we may be surprised to find ourselves somewhere we do not wish to be.<br><br>We frequently encounter heroes in our lives. Their examples of righteousness, faith, service, and love wield a tremendous influence on our choices to become more like them. You know them; they are all around us. I am so grateful for the power of examples in my life. I have been blessed with so many whose faith and works have served to motivate me to make righteous choices. Today I'd like you to become acquainted with six men and women whose lives have influenced their part of the world in an incredible way because they have consistently exercised their power to choose the right.<br><h2><b>Choose to Love</b></h2><br>In Johannesburg, South Africa, the Young Ambassadors were privileged to meet Sister Julia Mavimbela. In 1955, when Julia was expecting her last child, her husband, John, was tragically killed. This period was a time of intense oppression for the blacks in that country. After her husband's death, Julia was left with a young family to raise. From the 1960s through the 1980s, she worked as a schoolteacher in Soweto township. She was always engaged in a worthwhile project, helping others to help themselves. She taught young people to garden. Julia told her students, "Let us dig the soil of bitterness, throw in a seed, show love, and see what fruits will grow. Love will not come without forgiving others. Where there was a bloodstain, a beautiful flower must grow." She got seeds and taught people to plant around their homes. She showed them how to strain dishwater through a gallon bucket filled with sand so they could use it to water their seeds.<br><br>In 1981 two young men in white shirts and dark, conservative ties volunteered to help her with her work. When the missionaries subsequently taught her about the plan of salvation and spoke of life after death, Julia was deeply moved by the message that she could see her husband, John, again. It made sense. She joined the Church, and the gospel became a great strength to her as she faced more tragedy in her family. In the 1990s her grandson happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when gunfire rang through the township, and he was murdered. When Sister Mavimbela's soul cried out for the healing influence of the Spirit, she left behind the rocky paths of grief and bitterness. Julia Mavimbela chose to love.<br><h2><b>Choose to Share</b></h2><br>Raj Kumar studied at the University of Punjab in Chandigarh, India. Attending a performance of the Young Ambassadors at his university in 1982, he saw in the faces of our students something different. As he recognized the light of truth and felt the Spirit, he wasted no time in approaching Tom Nelson, our Young Ambassador lighting technician, after the show, asking to know more about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A letter from Raj to Tom after his baptism illustrates his intense desire to share his newfound knowledge with others.<br><br><i>Dear Brother Tom:</i><br><br><i>It was only because of you that I have found this great happiness and peace. I had been praying continuously for one year before my prayers had an answer through you. You will be glad to know that three young men here in the university are investigating, and one of them, named Pamas Rai, may very soon join the Church. He is very serious, and I have given him sufficient lectures on the basic principles of the gospel. He has left tea, coffee, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco. The Spirit has commanded me to teach and contact two other young men.</i><br><br><i>Dear brother, before I was baptized in this true church of the Savior, I was very reluctant to tell others that I was a Christian. But now, to whosoever comes into contact with me, I openly declare before him that I am a follower of the Living Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and a member of His true church upon this earth. I visit hospitals every Friday and spend about three hours there. I pray for sick people admitted over there and visit from one bed to another, introducing them to the Church and the Lord and distributing tracts. As you know, we do not have tracts and pamphlets in Hindi or Punjabi languages. I've translated the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith into the Punjabi language.</i><br><br><i>I have applied for the mission. I expect to get the call within a couple of months. You will be glad to know that I have started going to Delhi every weekend to take part in church services. Our branch president, John R. Marshall, who is from England, has recommended me for an elder. I hope to be ordained to the high priesthood in a short time. Last week I was given the chance to ordain a young boy to the office of a teacher. This was a wonderful experience for me.</i>[Letter to Tom Nelson from Raj Kumar, 1980]<br><br>Brother Raj Kumar received his call and served a mission in Fresno, California. Since his mission he and his wife, Sarala, have been blessed with a beautiful family. Brother Kumar has served as bishop, on the stake high council, and currently is ward mission leader in Toronto, Canada. When blessed to embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, Raj Kumar chose to share.<br><h2><b>Choose to Follow the Light</b></h2><br>In 1991 Larisa Deeva served as a hostess for two Young Ambassadors on their tour to Riga, Latvia. She recognized the Spirit in the lives of these young men and wanted that spirit to be a part of her life. As she received a copy of the Book of Mormon in Russian from her guests, she proudly displayed it right next to the Bible in her home.<br><br>In a letter to Young Ambassador Richard Higbee, Larisa wrote in halting English:<br><br><i>I don't know how to thank you for all that you have done for me. I am so very glad met you. I am happy found fine friends. It was unforgettably for me! I was visit the paradise with you. I have believed in God! You have agitated my excite! . . . You have given back me sense in life. I wasn't know why and what for I lived. And you present me wings!</i>[Letter to Richard Higbee from Larisa Deeva, 1990]<br><br>Sister Deeva was baptized on August 22, 1992. In a subsequent letter to Richard Higbee, Larisa wrote:<br><br><i>In August of last year I was baptized. I was the first member in the Church here in Riga. Now there are approximately 30 members in this branch. I play the piano in our ward. Now I have God in my life, and He helps me deal with all of my struggles. I know that this church is true and know that our Heavenly Father loves us.</i>[Letter to Richard Higbee from Larisa Deeva, 1993]<br><br>As the Young Ambassadors returned to Latvia to present a fireside for the new Riga Branch on May 30, 1993, we were pleased to learn that Sister Deeva had been sustained as president of the Relief Society. Larisa Deeva found the truth, was nourished by its power, and with great eagerness made the choice to follow the light.<br><h2><b>Choose to Learn from the Word of God</b></h2><br>Nearly every morning at 6:30 you will find me walking the streets of Spanish Fork with another of my heroes: my dad, Wayne Boothe. As we exercise, Dad speaks of his experience studying the scriptures that morning before our walk. For 34 years Dad taught seminary and institute classes for the Church Educational System. Through those years he chose to study the scriptures most mornings at 4:00. Since his retirement in 1990 his enthusiasm for scriptural feasts has not diminished. He sleeps in now until 5:00 a.m. and then gets up and dives into the scriptures every day. As we walk along he talks excitedly of his newest scripture discoveries. He enjoys the topical guide and will often approach his study by topic. He loves to encourage us to visualize the scriptural accounts in our minds or to place ourselves in the time and place of the scriptures to explore what it might have felt like to be there.<br><br>Dad chooses to ponder and pray about those passages he reads. He recently commented, "Son, my scripture study has a fresh new focus. I am reading the scriptures this time through to clearly ascertain whether I am living the gospel as correctly as I should at this stage of my life. I want to be prepared. The scriptures are helping me to prepare." At 4:00 a.m. many of us could think of other ways to spend our time, but through all of the years of raising a family of seven children, 40 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren with my beautiful mother, Dad has chosen to consistently learn from the word of God.<br><h2><b>Choose to Serve</b></h2><br>Choosing to run for mayor of Spanish Fork, Utah, was not a decision that most 76-year-old women would make, but for Marie Huff the choice was simple. She had a great desire to work hard for the betterment of her community. While serving as mayor Marie was president of the Utah County League of Mayors and was recognized in 1995 by Governor Leavitt as the Outstanding Mayor in the State of Utah.<br><br>After eight years in office, Marie finished her service as mayor at age 83. Marie is still a member of the Spanish Fork Arts Council and at 88 years of age has devoted herself to making beautiful bookmarks for school and city libraries in the county. In the past five years she has made 3,000 of them to give to schoolchildren as a means of encouraging them not only to read but to take good care of their library books.<br><br>While serving 14 years as a Relief Society president, Sister Huff learned that folks need to be recognized. In a recent telephone conversation she said, "There are a lot of lonely people in the world. I continue to call young and old alike on the phone to congratulate them, and I try to send notes every day to express appreciation for all the good things they are doing for our growing community of Spanish Fork." Every day Marie Huff chooses to serve.<br><h2><b>Choose to Be Firm in the Faith of Christ</b></h2><br>In the Book of Mormon we read of another hero who "was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding" (Alma 48:11). His name was Moroni. We are told that Moroni "was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ" and that "if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men" (Alma 48:13, 17).<br><br>What if we were to choose to grow up and be like Moroni or choose to love as did Sister Julia Mavimbela? How would the world be different if we chose to share as did Raj Kumar in India or chose to follow the light as did Sister Larisa Deeva? Wouldn't this world be a remarkable, wonderful place to live if all of us here today were to choose to serve others well into our eighties just like Marie Huff, or if we chose to learn from the scriptures as does my dad? Will we, like our heroes, be anxiously engaged in choosing to help accomplish the great mission of bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man? Will we choose to follow the Spirit in our own lives? And then will we choose to extend our love to our families, our associates, and our neighbors, illuminating their paths in our own little corner of the world? What an influence we can collectively have on this world as we choose the right.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, it is the bottom of the ninth inning, the score is tied, there are two outs, the bases are loaded, and<i>you</i>are up to bat. That pretty much sums up the situation we find ourselves in today as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The world is being prepared to receive the Savior, and we are all up to bat. So many of our Father's children are counting on us to bring them into home plate. This is our time to play the game of life. As you step up to the plate in this game of<i>choice,</i>you must choose to serve, to love, to learn, to follow the light, to share. The choice is not complex. We simply choose the Lord or we choose the opposition--and we all know who leads that opposing team. We might well ask ourselves with the poet Hannah Last Cornaby:<br><br><i>Who's on the Lord's side? Who?</i><br><i>Now is the time to show.</i><br><i>We ask it fearlessly:</i><br><i>Who's on the Lord's side? Who?</i><br><br><i>We wage no common war,</i><br><i>Cope with no common foe.</i><br><i>The enemy's awake;</i><br><i>Who's on the Lord's side? Who?</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 260]<br><br>At times in our weariness we may catch ourselves saying, "I just don't care anymore. I don't want to choose. I'll go along with whatever you want to do. I'll embrace whichever marketing approach is more convincing. I am simply too tired to think this through and choose." In that critical moment we need to wake up, arouse our faculties, and join with the prophet Joshua, who declared: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve . . . : but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15). We might have to expand Joshua's invitation to say, "Choose you this minute whom ye will serve. Choose you this day, this week, whom ye will serve."<br><br>Choose hundreds of times every hour to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. We must, of course, enlist the good counsel and influence of the Spirit that we may be directed to those choices that will help us become the woman or man God has planned for us to become.<br><br>It is possible to make every important decision in our lives correctly if we can learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. What we choose today will influence eternity. Every choice brings us either a step closer to or further from our eternal destiny. We are not victims of circumstance. We have total control. We are the ones who decide how we will react to the environment we find ourselves in.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball taught:<br><br><i>Some people feel that decisions are really out of our hands, that we merely respond to circumstances without choice, like a rudderless ship that drifts at the mercy of the wind and waves. And I agree that there can come a time when we no longer have control over our destinies, but I believe that this is only after the cumulation of our own past decisions has left us helpless.</i><br><br><i>In the beginning, each of us is a bundle of potential that can be developed and shaped by what we choose to do. In youth there is still great malleability. We can choose what we will become. As the years go by, we find our past choices have narrowed the alternatives still open to us and we have less and less control over our future.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>165]<br><br>We cannot do everything at once, but every act--every choice--opens the gate and leads us down a specific pathway. With every choice thereafter we progress further down that path. Sometimes we must turn around, take some time out, get back in touch with our eternal map, and hang on as the Savior of mankind draws us back closer to our heavenly home. There are millions who have walked this path before us. When we see a caution sign or a guardrail, we need to recognize that someone wiser and more experienced generously thought to provide some help, some protection, for those who would follow. At those times when we feel very strong and independent, we might close our hearts to those closest to us who could help the most in our journey over life's treacherous paths. Don't close up. Open your heart to the wisdom of life's precious companions.<br><br>Can you imagine how excited we all were in the premortal existence as we anticipated the blessing of exercising our free agency while experiencing life together? How have those heroes in our lives become so valiant in choosing to love, to share, to follow the light, to learn, and to serve? We may feel somewhat overwhelmed with so many good choices. I am convinced that there is really only one choice that we must make, and that choice is Jesus Christ. When we choose Him, everything else will naturally follow.<br><br>The Lord himself outlined His four recommended choices for every season, for every day of our lives:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:1]<br><br>These are four simple, righteous choices to make every day. How about it? Are we ready to choose to commit to the Lord's plan? Are we ready to choose to forsake our sins and come unto Christ? Will we choose to call on His name? Will our choice be to obey His voice? Are we prepared to choose to keep His commandments?<br><br>The great blessings associated with keeping His commandments are explained in this same section of the Doctrine and Covenants. In verse 28 we are promised that "he that keepeth [the Lord's] commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things." We can know all things! That has got to be helpful when we are trying to choose wisely. Every season of life is a season of choice. This is not a time for sitting on the sidelines. We must choose to play ball every day, every hour, every season, relying on the merits of our Savior to assist us in this journey of choice.<br><br>May we choose to be firm and steadfast in our faith in Christ so that when the time for choosing in mortality is past, our knees will have already bowed and our tongues will have already confessed. And, most important, our lives will have been filled with choices that testify of our knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God. May we choose to follow Him in every season is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Randall W.

<h1>on of Eternity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young brothers and sisters, how excited I am to be with you this morning. I bring you greetings from the living prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley. What a remarkable, wonderful man he is. Everyone loves him--members and nonmembers alike. Perhaps it is his unique humor and zest for life that attracts us to him.<br><br>Sometime ago I was entering the Church Administration Building early in the morning when I saw the prophet coming across the parking garage toward me. I waited for a moment, wanting to walk into the building with him. For the first time I noticed that he was carrying a cane.<br><br>"Mel," he said, "how are you?"<br><br>"President, I'm just fine, but how are you? I didn't know that you were using a cane. What's the matter?"<br><br>"Oh," he replied, "I'm having a little vertigo, and the doctors tell me I should use a cane."<br><br>"My goodness," I responded, "let me carry your briefcase for you."<br><br>"Here," he said, with a big smile on his face, "take the cane."<br><br>I think he felt I needed it more than he did.<br><br>Well, we love him, and today I testify that he is God's prophet, seer, and revelator for the entire world--a world that desperately needs a prophet, seer, and revelator.<br><br>Now what I have to say is extremely important. It is intended to help you move through this life, facing all of the challenges of mortality, and then to carry you into eternity.<br><br>On February 16, 1832, a group of men, 12 or more, were gathered together upstairs in the home of John Johnson in Hiram, Ohio. Among them were Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon. As they were working on the translation of the Bible, they came to John 5:29, which refers to the resurrection of the dead. At that time a glorious vision burst into their minds, and they reported:<br><br><i>While we meditated upon these things, the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about.</i><br><br><i>And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness;</i><br><br><i>And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:19–21]<br><br>Of course the vision was one of the most glorious and wonderful ever given to man. Now known as Doctrine and Covenants 76, it refers to the three degrees of glory.<br><br>One of those present was Philo Dibble, a devout convert to the Church, a friend to the Prophet Joseph, and a faithful follower of Jesus Christ. Later in his life as he described the remarkable experience of being in the room when the vision was received, he was asked if he had seen the vision. He replied, "I saw the glory and felt the power, but did not see the vision" ("Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith,"<i>Instructor</i>27, no. 10 [15 May 1892]: 303). Just imagine, there he was in the very room where this grand event occurred, and he did not see it. Oh, he saw something and felt something, but he did not see the miracle of the vision.<br><br>Too many of us are exactly like Philo Dibble: We see the glory associated with the Church and we occasionally feel the power of it, but we never quite see the vision. Many times I have heard the Brethren say, "Do you see? Have you got the vision of what it is that we are trying to get into your hearts?" Today the vision I am trying to get you to see is of your life: beginning with your infant birth, then connecting the dots of mortal experience to the temple, and finally to eternity.<br><br>We tend to be distracted by so many things. We are so caught up in the excitement of the world and worldly things that we do not see the vision. I mention a few of the ugly things that keep us from having our "eyes ... opened and our understandings ... enlightened" (D&amp;amp;C 76:12) to the beauty of eternity.<br><h2><b>The Love of Riches</b></h2><br>So many focus all their efforts on becoming rich. Even students see education as a means of acquiring wealth rather than a means of becoming educated. If our hearts are set too much upon the riches of the world, we become calloused, devious, deceitful, and unkind. I could mention a dozen more negative adjectives, but you get the picture. Usually those who love riches feel that the end justifies the means. And when they obtain wealth, they consider themselves better than their brothers. It was the prophet Jacob who said of those who had become rich: "[They] wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they" (Jacob 2:13).<br><br>We must be so careful. I have learned that possessions have almost nothing to do with happiness. However, the Lord promised the Nephites that riches would be theirs if they sought first the kingdom of God and had a desire "to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted" (Jacob 2:19). I assume that this beautiful formula would work for us as well.<br><h2><b>The Praise of the World</b></h2><br>To gain the praise of the world, we do the most foolish things. We embrace every style of hair: we spike it, color it, frizz it, and even shave it all off--all to get the approval of our peers. We pierce our eyes, ears, noses, and mouths and then hang gaudy jewelry from each as a witness of our desired inclusion into the world. We tattoo our bodies with senseless graffiti to be a part of the "in group," only to discover that the "in group" is really the "out group" in the eternal perspective of things.<br><br>There are some who desire status, position, and honor. There are even a few who covet a position in the Church, thinking that therein can be found praise and honor. I recall Elder Bruce R. McConkie saying, "The only honor found in a Church position is the honor you bring to the position." I know that is true.<br><br>One little boy and his friend were discussing their membership in the Church. One asked, "Wouldn't you like to be a General Authority someday?"<br><br>"I don't know," replied the other. "What do they do?"<br><br>"Oh, they just go to meetings and give talks all day."<br><br>"Not me," said the other little boy. "I can't think of anything worse."<br><h2><b>Destructive Music</b></h2><br>The enemy of man uses music to debase that which is most lovely. Even music can be destructive. It can stimulate the passions and dim any sensitivity to the Spirit. Do not be destroyed by tantalizing rhythms and suggestive lyrics. On the other hand, beautiful music can lift the soul. It can instill in our minds a desire to be gentle, sweet, and filled with love. It can cause men to become more Christlike. Music can soften the hardest heart and bring men to God. Can anything be more inspiring than the hymns we learned in Primary or the thrilling hymns of the Restoration?<br><br>When our children were little, we were often invited to sing as a family at firesides. Sister Hammond would play the piano, and the children and I would sing. Actually I was just a prop on the stage. However, I still remember their little curly heads and beautiful faces turned toward me as they sang "Daddy dear, tell me please, is the world really round? / Tell me where is the bluebird of happiness found?"<br><br>And I would answer, "Little one[s], little one[s], yes, the world's really round / And the bluebird you search for will surely be found" ("Mon Enfant," traditional).<br><br>Those were times never to be forgotten. Now when we are together, one of our favorite things to do is gather around the piano and sing such wonderful words as "I feel my Savior's love / In all the world around me" (<i>Songbook,</i>74–75) and, of course:<br><br><i>I have a fam'ly here on earth. They are so good to me.</i><br><i>I want to share my life with them through all eternity.</i><br><i>Fam'lies can be together forever Through Heav'nly Father's plan.</i><br><i>I always want to be with my own family,</i><br><i>And the Lord has shown me how I can.</i><br><i>The Lord has shown me how I can.</i><br>["Families Can Be Together Forever,"<i>Songbook,</i>188]<br><br>Music has a great capacity to show us the vision.<br><h2><b>Laziness</b></h2><br>Don't be lazy. There are moments when we need to relax, but the Lord's formula is a great one: Rise early and go to bed early, accomplishing as much as possible in between. I hope that during your lifetime you will find happiness in good, hard work. To do well at BYU you must learn to study. Study is work. It requires great self-discipline and some sacrifice, but it is worth it. The work ethic you form here will go with you all of your life. Those who know how to jump into a difficult task and finish it never have to worry about procrastination and the worry and the stress that go with it. I love to work. It invigorates me. Oh, I get tired, but sleep comes more easily when I am weary.<br><br>I was once with Elder LeGrand Richards. He had called me to be a counselor in a stake presidency. I was very young and he was old. I was at his side all day helping him with the details of a reorganization. It was late, and I was afraid that he had overtaxed his physical limitations. I knew that I was spent. I said to him, "Elder Richards, you have worked hard all day. You must be exhausted. How do you do it?"<br><br>A huge smile crept over his face, and he responded, "Work, my boy? This isn't work. This is play, and I am enjoying every minute of it!" I learned a great lesson that day about the difference between work and play, and I think I have finally come to understand what Elder Richards was trying to teach me about seeing the vision.<br><br>Sometimes I think that the world is a madhouse. Even the Savior, as He spoke of the latter days, saw that "the whole earth shall be in commotion" (D&amp;amp;C 45:26). With wars and rumors of wars, plagues, and scourges, it is a time when all of us experience fear. We look for a way to escape from the discouragement, disillusionment, and uneasiness that exists all around us. This is a time for the strong of heart, for those of great faith, and for those who have made a commitment to move forward and not backward.<br><br>If we are to see the vision of our role in eternity, then we must see it through unclouded eyes--which means our lives must be uncluttered by riches, praise, bad music, or laziness. I have such a desire to help you see the vision of eternity a little more clearly. If you will do the following, I think it will help.<br><h2><b>1. Be Determined</b></h2><br>While speaking to his sons, the great Book of Mormon prophet Lehi said, "Arise from the dust, my sons, and be men, and be determined in one mind and in one heart" (2 Nephi 1:21).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith had the ability to thrive on challenges. He faced many of them. Once he said to his cousin, George A. Smith, "Never be discouraged. If I were sunk in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia, with the Rocky Mountains piled on me, I would hang on, exercise faith, and keep up good courage, and I would come out on top" (in John Henry Evans,<i>Joseph Smith, an American Prophet</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1946], 9).<br><br>Whatever the challenge may be--school, marriage, sickness, or death--if you are determined, you will come out on top. If you focus your mind--your intellect--on the most important thing and then move forward with all of your heart, you will win.<br><br>Remember, your focus is on the vision of eternity.<br><h2><b>2. Be True at All Times</b></h2><br>Be true to yourselves. Be true to your parents. Be true to your God. To be true means to be trustworthy, to be constant, to be loyal. When we speak of the 2,000 young warrior sons of Helaman, we think of their courage and their faith. Helaman said of them, "They were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20). I have a strong feeling that those young men never missed their church meetings, never failed to have their prayers, and never had to be corrected because of their filthy language.<br><br>Just a word about your church meetings. Attend all your meetings. Be on time. Sit quietly. Stay to the end. There is far too much wandering around. Remember the admonition of the Lord: "Be still and know that I am God" (D&amp;amp;C 101:16). I believe<i>still</i>means to be quiet and stationary. Then the Spirit can come and testify to your heart and mind.<br><br>I remember my mother saying to me on one occasion, "Mel, I know that I can count on you." I resolved that she would always be able to count on me. I would not let her down. I loved her too much. Her confidence in me meant everything. Today I still feel that way. I feel that way about the Brethren. I don't ever want to let President Hinckley or any of the other leaders of the Church down. But, even more important, I never want to let the Savior down, because I love Him more than anything else. I am sure that all of you feel the same way.<br><br>Are you beginning to see the vision? If so, raise your hand.<br><h2><b>3. Lead in Righteousness--Don't Be Led into Wickedness</b></h2><br>In my high school there were only two boys who were members of the Church: myself and another boy who was inactive. On a whim I decided that on Fridays, for a few weeks, I would wear a white shirt and tie to school. Surprisingly, after the first week, many followed my lead and came dressed in white shirts and ties. One day the principal called me into his office. I had been there before for reasons that I would not care to mention today, but on that occasion he thanked me for setting a standard of dress for the rest of the boys, which he felt improved the spirit of the school. I felt good to know that I had led my friends to do a simple but uplifting thing and that it had been recognized by the school administration.<br><br>Everywhere I go in the Church, nationally and internationally, I find that our young men and young women are the leaders in their schools. They are the student body officers, the outstanding scholars, the finest athletes. They set the standard for morality and dress. Everyone looks up to them for guidance and excellence. Those that I am talking about are you. We are extremely pleased about your leadership. We expect nothing less from you, and neither does your Heavenly Father.<br><br>Are you getting it, the vision?<br><h2><b>4. Find Love and Get Married</b></h2><br>In three short days it will be Valentine's Day. Sister Hammond has reminded me of that. She is the most beautiful valentine in all the world. Although we joke and laugh some about a day when romance and love are on everyone's mind, I would encourage you to enjoy the lightness of the moment but also to consider how profoundly serious and eternally significant is the principle of love. Frankly, love is the key necessary to open the vision, for love leads to marriage and marriage leads to eternal life.<br><br>There is a real concern that you young men returning from your missions do not understand the absolute principle of eternal marriage. Your desire to be rich and well educated takes precedence over your obedience to an eternal law. You hesitate to date because you do not want to complicate your lives. You wait and wait, trifling with the seriousness of love until it becomes almost too late. The years pass by, all too quickly, and you have become older and, honestly, less sure of yourselves. You have become rigidly established in your own ways. Most of the eligible young women are taken, and you are left with little more than your foolish vanity.<br><br>The Savior pulled no punches when He said:<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i><br><br><i>He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4]<br><br>I encourage you to date, find a girl that will assist you in honoring your priesthood covenants, marry her in the temple, have beautiful babies, and begin the lifelong journey of becoming a family together forever. Then, as far as you are concerned, the earth will not "be utterly wasted at his coming" (D&amp;amp;C 2:3).<br><br>You wonderful girls, dress modestly and keep yourselves physically clean. Be cheerful and happy. Be positive about life. Then the Holy Spirit will cause you to be more beautiful and attractive. And when a faithful priesthood bearer comes to carry you away on his white horse--which might be an '84 Ford--to the temple, you will be prepared in every way.<br><br>Is there a glimmer of understanding in your minds? Do you get it?<br><h2><b>5. Fulfill Your Duty</b></h2><br>Young men and women of the Church, you were born into the house of Israel. All of you are descendants of Father Abraham. Because of your heritage you have certain responsibilities. One of those is to keep yourselves unspotted from the sins of the world. This means that you will remain morally clean; that you will not be polluted by the extravagances of the world; that you will continue to keep all the commandments of God; that you men, as priesthood bearers, will spread the gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; that you will maintain the family unity into eternity by going to the temple with your chosen companion. What a remarkable and singular challenge it is to be a member of this Church.<br><br>To maintain the family unity is not only an essential principle. It tends to be the most beautiful doctrine of eternity. This is the essence of the vision that we wish to establish in your minds. You may see the glory of it and feel the power of it, but now we want you to see the vision--to get it in your minds and in your hearts. If you can internalize the story I am about to tell you, it will assist you to see the vision.<br><br>It was rather late at night when Sister Hammond and I entered the tiny apartment of the Florez family. They had just recently been baptized into the Church, and we wanted to visit them. Even though they were not quite sure what a General Authority was, they knew he was somebody quite important. The small apartment fairly gleamed from the mopping and polishing in preparation to receive us. Every member of the family stood to greet us as we entered. They were dressed in their finest clothing, which had been washed and pressed nearly to perfection. Everything had been done to make our visit as comfortable as possible, and each little child waited for us to express our approval for their supreme efforts.<br><br>We began by singing several hymns chosen by the children. Purposefully, we always suggest that we sing "Families Can Be Together Forever." We asked them about the picture of the temple that hung on their wall and about the significance it had for them. They spoke humbly and sincerely about the time that they could go to the house of the Lord and be sealed together as a family forever. We talked about the difference the gospel had made in the family. I asked the children if they could see a difference in their father. They were happy to tell us that he seemed changed; that he treated their mother much better and that he seemed to love them more. The father stood humbly before us, pleased to hear such words from his loved ones. Then he said, "Will you wait for a moment? I have someone special that I would like you to meet."<br><br>We watched him climb the tiny, narrow stairs to the bedroom above. In a moment he came down carrying a sweet little child in his arms. It was a little boy. His tiny body was twisted and disfigured beyond anything we had ever seen in our lives. A crippling virus had destroyed him mentally and physically just days after his birth. Now, seven years later, there had been almost no growth and no progress. He lay very still in the loving arms of his father. Gently the father extended his little frame for us to see. Then he said, "This is our precious son, Maximiliano. I am so grateful for the message that the missionaries brought to us just one month ago, for we now know that someday this little son of ours will be completely healed. He will be whole in body and in mind. And he will be ours--part of our family--forever and ever."<br><br>With that he returned the little boy to his bed in the room above. The tears erupted from our eyes. We had never seen greater faith nor greater love. It was a moment of pure revelation.<br><br>One year later the family was sealed in the Santiago Chile Temple. Maximiliano was there, in his father's arms, to be sealed. In the eternities he will be perfect in mind and in body. They will be an eternal family because the Florez family had seen the vision.<br><br>Do you begin to see the vision? Is what you see the vision of eternity?<br><br>Life, if lived properly, allows the Holy Ghost to bring the vision into our mind. The perfect description was given by a loving Heavenly Father when He said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Furthermore, we will not only see the glory and feel the power, but life--from birth to the temple and into eternity--will be ours, forever and ever.<br><br>Sometimes I have a dream that carries me into eternity. I find myself in a large hall surrounded by thousands of people. All of my family is there. On a lovely stage is a group of men. I gaze at them in awe, for there is the Prophet Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and apparently all of the holy prophets from the beginning of time down to the present day. Everyone seems to be waiting. A hush falls over the vast congregation. A man dressed in white appears. Without hesitation we all fall to our knees, for it is the Savior, Jesus Christ. With His arms extended, He blesses us and expresses His great love for us. The joy I feel is almost more than I can contain--to feel His pure love. I pray that my dream will become a reality for you and for me.<br><br>I know that Jesus Christ lives. As one of those appointed to be His special witnesses, I testify that He wants each one of us to come back into His presence, where with open arms He awaits to receive us all. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>F.

<h1>g Your Full Potential - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good evening, my young brothers and sisters. On behalf of the First Presidency, I welcome you to this fireside.<br><br>I am impressed with the cultural diversity, the spiritual strength, and the future potential of this worldwide audience of young people.<br><br>I pray that the Spirit will touch you and me as we discuss some principles of how you can find greater success and eternal happiness in your individual lives.<br><br>Each of you are very much aware that we are living in challenging times. Since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001, the world has changed, never to be the same again, regardless of where in the world we may live.<br><br>Economic uncertainty is prevalent in most countries of the world. The crusade against terrorism is ever present. Preparation for war continues to escalate.<br><br>Satan's influence continues to abound, not only in the hearts of those who seek to destroy lives and property, but also on the morality and integrity of people everywhere.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley gave us these reassuring but sobering words as he closed the October 2001 general conference: "Our safety lies in the virtue of our lives. Our strength lies in our righteousness. God has made it clear that if we will not forsake Him, He will not forsake us" (<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 112; "Till We Meet Again,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 90).<br><br>Notwithstanding the perilous nature of our time, you young people are a choice generation. You are the future of the Church. Many of you will have opportunities for considerable influence in your communities and countries as you live the commandments and stay true to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>President Hinckley has described "you as the finest generation in the history of the Church" (<i>CR,</i>April 1992, 96; or "A Chosen Generation,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, 69).<br><br>From that commendation I hope you feel the love and confidence that the prophet has for each of you. Your challenge and mine is for each of us to strive to live up to President Hinckley's and the Lord's expectations for us.<br><br>This evening I want to talk about how you might more fully meet those expectations by achieving your full potential.<br><br>This is a time in your life when choices are made and patterns and habits are formed that will have a major impact on who you will become. Your future happiness, personal righteousness, and relationship with the Lord will depend in large part on the habits you embrace and the choices and commitments you make over these next few years.<br><br>The challenge lies in the question "Is the road you are now traveling and the present conduct of your life leading you to achieve your full God-given potential?" If you were to make no changes in the present course of your life, would you be happy with who you are and what you have become five years from now?<br><br>In posing this question, we recognize and commend so many of you who are pursuing your education in preparation for the future. You are striving to live the commandments and be true to gospel principles. Many of you have an idea of what you would like to do with your life as you prepare for marriage and dream dreams of the kind of family you would like to have. Those of you who are married are concentrating on how to make real the dreams and ambitions that you and your spouse have for the future.<br><br>On the other hand, many of you are still working on a vision for your future and the action plans that you need to follow to achieve your full potential. Some of you are challenged with some of the issues that life has handed you and may be struggling with how you can better prepare yourself for the future.<br><br>Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has a favorite two-word statement that he uses frequently to motivate us: "Always improving." The implication is clear--there is room for improvement in each of our lives.<br><br>It has been said that one of the greatest tragedies of our time is that so many people live so far below their potential. President Spencer W. Kimball continually encouraged us to "lengthen our stride" and to "enlarge our vision" ("When the World Will Be Converted,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1974, 5).<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell said it another way: "The Lord loves each of us too much to merely let us go on being what we now are, for he knows what we have the possibility to become!" ("In Him All Things Hold Together,"<i>Brigham Young University 1990–91 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1991], 107).<br><br>Implicit in the statements from each of these distinguished leaders is the message that each of us can and should do more to meet the Lord's expectations of us.<br><br>With these statements in mind, let's now talk about a few ways in which you can take and keep control of your lives. In so doing, you will not only find success in a temporal sense but you will be moving toward achieving a relationship with your Father in Heaven and Savior that prepares you for the prize of membership in the celestial kingdom.<br><h2><b>Develop a Strong Testimony</b></h2><br>First and foremost in your pursuit is the development and nurturing of a strong testimony. I assume that most of you have a basic testimony of the gospel. Yet I would suspect that many of you are being challenged by the "things of the world" with which you deal every day. By things of the world I am referring to the daily bombardment of worldly messages, enticements, and peer pressures that tend to tempt or distract you from keeping your testimony strong.<br><br>Perhaps some of you can relate to a young friend I met while serving as president of a stake that included West Point Academy in the state of New York. He was a bright 4.0 student at the academy. He had been given leave from West Point to serve a mission and was readmitted on completion of his mission--not a common occurrence at West Point. On one of my visits to the West Point Branch he requested some time to talk.<br><br>As we talked he told me of how he had deepened his conversion to the gospel as he served his mission. He remembered the feelings and strength of his testimony as he returned to West Point following his mission.<br><br>Then he said: "In the two years since my mission I have gradually felt the Spirit slipping away from me. Every day I am associating with other cadets with different values. Their whole focus in life is successfully graduating from the academy. Periodically the honor code is compromised. Nearly every weekend is party time--alcohol and young women. I am hazed and ridiculed because I have refused to join with them.<br><br>"President Staheli, I need help. I feel like I am being tossed to and fro on the seas of life and I have lost my mooring. My gospel anchor of the past seems to be giving way to the life of fun and pleasures enjoyed by my colleagues at the academy."<br><br>As we talked it became clear that the magnet of the adversary was gradually but surely drawing him into Satan's grasp. My young friend had lost his mooring--not because Satan's magnet had become stronger but because he had not been nurturing and tending to his testimony. He was in the process of losing what he had previously so deeply cherished.<br><br>Many of you have already or will face similar challenges. It may not be alcohol and immorality--yet, my brothers and sisters, never forget that these are some of Satan's most tempting attractions. They are just two of the adversary's many magnets that look attractive on the surface and may appear harmless only because you feel you can resist.<br><br>It is essential to your testimony that you understand your relationship with your Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ. President Boyd K. Packer talked very clearly in this same broadcast last month about our premortal life, the choice to come here, and the choices we now have that determine what we may become.<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard has said:<br><br><i>Nothing is more remarkable or important in this life than to know that God our Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, have spoken again from the heavens and have called prophets and apostles to teach the fullness of the everlasting gospel once again upon the earth. That is a glorious thing to know. When you know it, that knowledge affects your life. It influences every major decision you make. It changes the course of your life to a safer one because it provides an anchor that helps hold you fast to the teachings of the gospel despite the evil influences all around you that entice you to drift toward sin and transgression.</i>["Anchor to the Soul," in<i>Brigham Young University 1992–93 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1993), 3]<br><br>But knowing is not always enough. You recall my young friend at West Point. He knew. He had developed a testimony, but it had slipped away from him because he failed to nourish it. As he had begun to respond to and engage in the activities of his peers, he gradually lost the promptings of the Spirit.<br><br>Often we are reminded that a testimony is like a muscle. As we nourish and exercise and use it, it develops and becomes stronger. When we fail to do so, it atrophies and becomes weak.<br><br>Our testimonies grow through faith, prayer, scripture study, and obedience to the commandments. The daily exercise and nurturing of these principles is key to a strong and resilient testimony and commitment to gospel principles. Let me comment on each of these principles.<br><h2><b>Faith</b></h2><br>Elder Gordon B. Hinckley, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said the following about faith:<br><br><i>If there is any one thing you and I need in this world it is faith, that dynamic, powerful, marvelous element by which, as Paul declared, the very worlds were framed (Hebrews 11:3). . . . Faith--the kind of faith that moves one to get on his knees and plead with the Lord and then get on his feet and go to work--is an asset beyond compare, even in the acquisition of secular knowledge. I do not minimize the need for study and labor. I would add to these faith and prayer, with the sacred promise that "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost."</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:26] ["God Shall Give unto You Knowledge by His Holy Spirit,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1973</i>(Provo: BYU, 1974), 109]<br><br>I had the privilege of returning with President Hinckley from Nauvoo on his plane following the cornerstone ceremony at the Nauvoo Temple. I was commenting on the unbelievable faith and commitment of those early Saints. I was musing that I was not sure I would have had sufficient faith to keep company with those faithful Saints. In his usual optimistic response, President Hinckley said, "Sure you would, Don." And then he made his real point with me as he reminded me that some of the most faithful Saints faltered, lost faith, and fell by the wayside. His response strongly suggests that our testimonies are vulnerable if we do not stay on course in keeping God's commandments.<br><br>President Hinckley frequently refers to that earlier statement in encouraging us to have "the kind of faith that moves one to get on his knees and plead with the Lord and then get on his feet and go to work." That is sound advice for every one of us. As we follow it, our testimonies and commitments to make right choices will grow.<br><h2><b>Prayer</b></h2><br>Prayer is as essential to a righteous life as food and water are to our daily sustenance. Taking this analogy one step further, if we had to live on the sustenance and the frequency and intensity of some of our prayers, many of us would be much thinner than we are today.<br><br>As I reflect on my youth and the initial development of my testimony, nothing had a greater impact on its development than the faith of my mother and father and their daily application of that faith in their prayers. The Lord responded to their faith and prayers, and as children we witnessed the hand of the Lord in our family. We came to know the meaning of what Moroni meant when he said: "I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>The faith of our family was tried time and again. Periodically special spiritual experiences too tender to tell followed. I bear testimony that the Lord does hear and answer prayers--prayers from the hearts of His faithful children.<br><br>As your lives become crowded with other activities, it is easy to skip a prayer or use an abbreviated version of your prayers. Don't shortchange the Lord on your prayers. Nothing you will do during any day of your life will be more important to your temporal success or your eternal progress than consistent, humble, sincere prayers offered at least morning and night of every day.<br><br>As I visited with my young friend from West Point, it became clear that his faith had wavered and the consistency and sincerity of his prayers had waned. The joshing of his peers and the seeming attractiveness of Satan's alternatives had begun to overshadow his commitment to exercise his faith and prayers.<br><h2><b>Scripture Study</b></h2><br>Equally important in the pursuit of happiness and a secure testimony is the daily habit of reading from and pondering the scriptures. This represents a significant challenge for most of us. The busier life becomes, the more difficult it is to stay connected to this important part of our spiritual growth.<br><br>One of my fellow quorum members confided to me that he had not missed a day in reading or pondering the scriptures since he entered the Missionary Training Center in preparation for his mission. That was approximately 40 years ago. What a commitment! What dedication to the Lord! What a great example for each of us to follow!<br><br>Those who demonstrate the greatest consistency in their scripture study do so because they follow daily a set time to read. They do not speed-read so many pages a day. Rather, they read and then ponder about the application in their lives of what they have read. But they do it daily, and they do it as a serious part of their personal plan for spiritual growth.<br><br>My challenge to you tonight is to reflect carefully on how you evaluate your personal progress in the practice of your faith, prayers, and scripture study daily. Are you providing daily spiritual sustenance to your testimony? Are your actions in these areas providing the willpower against all that the adversary is showing you every day? If not, please think carefully about the changes you will make. As King Benjamin sternly admonished his people, "If you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10).<br><h2><b>Obedience to the Commandments</b></h2><br>Living to be worthy of the Spirit and then responding to its promptings is another important milestone in our temporal and eternal progress. It is an essential ingredient to a strong and vibrant testimony. To be worthy of the Spirit embodies the bottom line of obedient, righteous living. To truly accomplish this is the quest of a lifetime.<br><br>Nephi's early example of obedience has been taught to many of us from our youth. Lehi had not long journeyed in the wilderness before he recognized the differences in his sons. Laman and Lemuel had developed into the "murmurers" of the family. They were already playing the role of "the natural man" that King Benjamin described (Mosiah 3:19). Conversely, Nephi made his commitment to the Lord early on when he said:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1 Nephi 3:7]<br><br>Nephi had made the decision as to how he was going to respond to the Lord's commandments. From that point forward he was steadfast. I suspect Satan worked on him just as he does on each of us today, yet the scriptures indicate that the adversary was totally unsuccessful in affecting Nephi's decision to do the Lord's will.<br><br>The prototype of Lehi's family has played out through the centuries. The world is replete with the Lamans and Lemuels. They are some of Satan's best students. Great blessings come to those who follow Nephi's example.<br><br>Understanding and responding to the principle of obedience has singular importance in preparing us for success and eternal happiness. President Ezra Taft Benson put it most poignantly when he said: "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<br><br>That is such a profound statement that I would like to repeat it--in hopes each of you will write it down so you can ponder its meaning in your life: "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power."<br><br>Do you catch the spirit of what he is telling us? Will you carefully ponder its meaning?<br><br>Of our 13 grandchildren the youngest is now 18 months old. Her name is Zoë, and, according to Sister Staheli, she is one of the most precious, sweet granddaughters in the whole world. There is only one problem. The word Zoë learned first and likes best is<i>no!</i>The challenge to Zoë's mother is the same challenge that your mothers and mine had as they taught us when to say "no" to the wrong things in life but how to say "yes" in response to obedience to the Lord's commandments. Nephi had learned that lesson well. Laman and Lemuel never did.<br><br>So we see that the irritants of obedience are the impediments to God endowing us with power. Tonight before you retire and say your evening prayer, would you carefully ponder and then write down the irritants in your life that keep you from being completely obedient to the Lord's will? As you do so, please be honest with yourself. Remember, you cannot change that which you deny or fail to acknowledge.<br><br>As you are contemplating your possible irritants, remember the counsel from Elder James E. Faust, given when he was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "It will often be necessary for all of us to choose between having a good time and leading a good life" (<i>To Reach Even unto You</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1980], 3).<br><br>Some of you may find that your list relates more to the passive things you don't get done--not because they are irritants but because they are too low on your priority list of important things to do. Or is it because the adversary has rearranged your priorities by sidetracking your thoughts and actions?<br><br>I expect each of us have a few irritants that inhibit our progress. And some may be struggling with a number of serious irritants that have become roadblocks to enjoying the quiet whisperings of the Spirit.<br><br>Although there are several things that might qualify as irritants in your life, some of the most important ones at this stage in your life may relate to the standards of morality.<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard has commented on numerous occasions that Satan has a dominant influence on the media: television, movies, and the Internet. Each becomes seductive in its own way. (See "When Shall These Things Be?"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1996, 57–59.)<br><br>As young adults you may feel you can handle some of the sexually explicit programs on television without affecting your spiritual well-being. A recent<i>New York Times</i>article reported that "83 percent of the shows most watched by teenagers had sexual material; one in five included sexual intercourse." The article stated, "Sex sells, and the fevered competition . . . keeps pushing the limits." The author concluded that "as the boundaries expand, viewers become increasingly inured to material that they not so long ago considered taboo" (Alessandra Stanley, "The TV Watch; It's a Fact of Life: Prime-Time Shows Are Getting Sexier,"<i>New York Times,</i>5 February 2003, E1).<br><br>Even more pernicious are the R-rated movies that are more explicit. It is clear that frequent exposure tends to legitimize that which we see and hear. It dulls our sense of conscience between the acceptable and unacceptable. It is Satan's way of leading you down the slippery slope toward immoral thoughts and actions.<br><br>And those parts of the Internet that move you into pornography serve as the devil's trump card. It only takes a few viewings of pornography and he has you hooked. Then he begins to work his magic, because what you have seen and heard becomes paramount in your thought processes.<br><br>In the case of the single adult, he gradually leads them into the abyss of immorality. In the case of the married, he debases and devalues the spouse and at a minimum destabilizes relationships and spirituality in the home. At worst, it can lead to adulterous relationships and potential divorce and breakup of families.<br><br>My young friends, if you are involved in pornography in any way, stop it before it is too late.<br><br>Be careful that you don't let Satan use his influence to control your thoughts and actions.<br><br>I believe there is a direct correlation between your ability to remove your personal irritants to obedience and the success and happiness that you will enjoy in this life and the eternities to come.<br><br>As you are able to conquer and overcome your personal irritants to obedience, you will feel God endowing you with the power of the Spirit to resist the inappropriate things that the world and Satan would have you enjoy.<br><br>When we are able to declare as the people did to King Benjamin that there has been "a mighty change in . . . our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2), then we will be well on the road to being endowed with the power of the Spirit.<br><br>That companionship of the Spirit and the strength of your testimonies will depend on your daily nurturing of faith, prayer, scripture study, and obedience to the commandments. As you do so, you will be moving toward achieving your full potential for spiritual blessings.<br><br>Now let me visit with you for a few minutes about your secular aspirations. The Lord wants each of you to find joy and happiness and success in your professional and vocational pursuits. But He wants you to do it in a way that your ambitions for success do not supersede your priority for living gospel principles.<br><br>President Thomas S. Monson painted the picture as follows: "We have been provided divine attributes to guide our journey. We enter mortality not to float with the moving currents of life, but with the power to think, to reason, and to achieve" ("Invitation to Exaltation,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1993, 5).<br><br>Let me suggest four simple principles that I hope you will find helpful in your pursuit of temporal and spiritual success.<br><h2><b>1. Take Responsibility for Who You Are and What You Want to Become</b></h2><br>Near the beginning of my remarks this evening I asked, "Is the road you are now traveling going to take you where you want to be five years from now?" I used the five-year time frame because the patterns, habits, and actions you take with your life over the next five years will have tremendous impact on what you will become in the years that follow.<br><br>Some of you have just left parents and family to be on your own for the first time. Many of you have had more years of experience in being independent and accountable for your personal actions. Others have returned from missions to a less structured life following the discipline of a mission. Regardless of your circumstances, these are the years when you must take responsibility for who you now are and what you want to become.<br><br>Many of you are well on your way with your education and the early stages of your careers. We commend you. For those of you who are still pursuing your formal education, complete your degree or vocational training no matter the intellectual or financial struggles you may be encountering along the way.<br><br>For those of you who may not have had the opportunity for advanced education or have dropped out of school for various reasons, think carefully about where you are. Remember, education is the key to the door of opportunity. Is the road you are now traveling going to take you where you want to be? If not, what might you do to change the course you are traveling?<br><br>The Savior's parable of the talents is so applicable to you at this stage in your lives. Jesus knows there are differences between you intellectually, emotionally, and physically. Although each of us has been blessed with various talents, some of us have been challenged with various kinds of handicaps. Therefore the Lord only expects you to magnify and develop whatever talents and abilities you have. But He expects you to be accountable for your actions in so doing.<br><br>At all costs do not allow yourself to "float with the moving currents of life," as President Monson has counseled ("Invitation to Exaltation," 5). Take control of your actions and prepare to succeed at whatever you are capable of doing. As President Hinckley frequently counsels, "Just do the best you can, but be sure it is your very best" ("A Challenging Time--A Wonderful Time," An Evening with President Gordon B. Hinckley, seminary and institute broadcast, 7 February 2003, 5).<br><br>This is also a time in your life when counsel from others can help you decide what you should be doing that will move you toward achieving your full potential.<br><br>As I look back over my life, it is the wise counsel and mentoring of a few special teachers, priesthood leaders, parents, and a loving wife that helped me make some course corrections that put me on the right road in preparation for what has turned out to be a wonderfully challenging and happy pursuit of life.<br><br>If you do not have a clear view of where you are going or what you want to do with your life, ask for help. Seek good counsel. Then follow it. There are numerous Church leaders, institute teachers, and friends who would be pleased to help counsel and mentor you through some of your challenges of life.<br><h2><b>2. Stay Focused and Use Your Time Wisely</b></h2><br>One of the more difficult challenges for young people, and some of us older ones alike, is to stay focused and stay on course--to finish what you have started.<br><br>I am convinced that distractions and discouragement are some of Satan's most effective tools. He finds ways to help us make excuses as to why we can't do this or that. He gets us involved in wasting our time and resources in things that lead us away from improving our lives and developing our talents. He blurs our focus by diverting our attention. And this can happen to the very best of you. Let me share an experience of how it happens.<br><br>A beautiful and vivacious young sister had just returned home from a very successful mission in South America. As her stake president, I had just completed an interview and released her from her mission. I asked her, "What are your plans for the future and how are you going to keep vibrant the beautiful spirit and testimony that you have expressed here this evening?"<br><br>"Oh, that's simple, President Staheli. I have my goals very clearly outlined."<br><br>And then she enthusiastically recited several of her goals. They included daily prayer and scripture study, educational pursuits, and dreams of the kind of man she would marry, along with a few other goals. I commended her, thinking that this young lady really had her life together.<br><br>Several months later this young sister called for another interview--this time for a temple interview to be married and sealed in the temple to the young man of her dreams. As we finished the interview I casually asked, "How are you doing on your goals?"<br><br>"What goals?" she replied.<br><br>As I reminded her of our earlier conversation, I recited back to her a few of the goals she had articulated to me. She teared up and her face flushed with embarrassment as she said, "President Staheli, I can't believe I have forgotten so soon that which was so important to me when I returned home from my mission."<br><br>She still was a worthy young sister, but she had been caught up in the things of the world and had lost focus on some of the things of greatest worth to her.<br><br>To those of you who have returned from missions, we would hope and pray that you have not become too casual about nurturing your testimony and the Spirit you enjoyed while on your mission.<br><br>Staying focused, disciplined, and committed to some meaningful goals, both spiritual and temporal, is an important--in fact, essential--key to your success here in this life and in the eternities to come.<br><h2><b>3. Have the Courage to Be Different from Those in the World Around You</b></h2><br>One of the greatest challenges for all of us is to learn how to live in the world without participating in all that it offers.<br><br>Worldly standards will always be in a state of flux, and the only true and unchanging standards are those set by the Savior and His teachings of the restored gospel.<br><br>World standards are like fashions. They are frequently changing and testing the levels of acceptability for that which provides new excitement, pleasure, and a lure for the daring. The vice president of one of the major media networks explained: "Acceptability is an ever-expanding and retracting elastic band" (Roland McFarland, quoted in Stanley, "The TV Watch," E8).<br><br>That may be true for the world, but it is not for a true Latter-day Saint.<br><br>Unfortunately, frequent exposure to what at first is unacceptable will over time legitimize in our minds that which we have seen and heard. Be careful that you do not become the victim of this seduction.<br><br>As you dare to be different, your exemplary conduct will not go unnoticed. Although you will be tried and tested, your faithful adherence to the Lord's standards will be seen as a beacon in the night to those around you.<br><br>Since graduation from university my wife and I have lived our entire married life in the mission field. We have traveled the world as part of our business career. In the earlier years of our career, to be a nondrinking businessman was an oddity--and not a well-accepted one either. Yet, with a few exceptions, once people understood our principles and standards and our desire to stay true to them, they respected us for them.<br><br>I could recite dozens of examples of my personal experiences on this subject. I hope you will indulge me with just one.<br><br>More than a decade ago I was invited to join a small group of chairmen and presidents of companies from around the world to form a council to advise the mayor of a very large city outside the United States. Our charge was to help him achieve world status for his city as a world-class financial center and at the same time upgrade the life and opportunities for its citizens. I was one of three heads of companies from the United States invited to join this new council. At one point I served for two years as chairman of the council.<br><br>In the meantime the mayor and I had become good friends. According to custom, the chairman of the council would join the mayor at the beginning of a major annual banquet to offer reciprocal toasts. As I stood to do so with a glass of water in hand, to my surprise the mayor explained to this large gathering that my toast would be with water. And then to my amazement he went on to make some very complimentary remarks about my standards and personal ethics.<br><br>Have the courage to be different when it is required of you to be true to the standards of the Church. You will be respected for it. And if occasionally you are not, you need not worry, because that is not the kind of association you will want or need in your future.<br><br>For those of you who are struggling with yourself because you may have crossed a line of the Lord's standards, please know there is a way back. The Lord loves you. His great atoning sacrifice was wrought so that the principle of repentance and forgiveness could be applied in each of our lives.<br><br>Make an appointment this very week to see your bishop or branch president so that he can open the door to helping you be clean and comfortable with yourself and your relationship with your Savior.<br><br>I have not addressed the standards of morality and the Word of Wisdom tonight because of what President Boyd K. Packer taught and counseled you at this same broadcast last month (see "The Instrument of Your Mind and the Foundation of Your Character" [2 February 2003],<i>BYU 2002–2003 Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 2003], 167–75). His talk and very clear counsel was some of the very best that you will ever hear. If you did not hear it or cannot recall it, get a copy of his talk and study carefully how he addressed the issues of morality and the Word of Wisdom.<br><h2><b>4. Lose Yourself in Service to Another</b></h2><br>In closing I want to ask you for a special favor that will bring you joy and happiness as you lose yourself in service to another. Former president of the United States George Bush said, "Any definition of a successful life must include serving others" ("Remarks at a Briefing on the Points of Light Foundation," 13 December 1990, http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/papers/1990/90121301.html; see also Dotson Rader, "I've Had a Wonderful Life,"<i>Parade,</i>1 December 1996, 5).<br><br>King Benjamin taught the standard for service when he said: "Behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>The Savior's life, as the ultimate example of service, made clear His feelings of the importance of our service. He said: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>This evening we have talked extensively about how we prepare ourselves spiritually and temporally for our future success and happiness. We commend the many of you who are also experiencing the blessings and personal satisfaction that come from serving others.<br><br>Now for the favor: Each of you here tonight must know of one or more of your friends or acquaintances who is struggling with some of the principles we have been discussing. Some are discouraged, and some have even lost hope. Others have been disappointed or have faced daunting challenges that they were unable to understand or handle emotionally. The end result, for whatever reason, is the loss of faith in and a testimony of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. They have become less active or inactive. In many cases personal habits or transgressions have overshadowed them with guilt--to the point where it has become difficult for them to come back.<br><br>In Chicago, a large city of the United States, a survey found the names of 3,000 young adults who are members of the Church. Less than 600 of those were active. A "search-and-rescue" program was undertaken. A team effort of active young adults with the full-time missionaries and youth leaders is producing an encouraging response. Many of these inactive youth are responding to the invitation to come back.<br><br>Attendance at sacrament meeting has increased 35 percent during the first three months of this effort. That's more than 200 additional young people attending sacrament meeting. Some are meeting with their bishops and branch presidents and clearing up the issues that have kept them away. Testimonies and commitments are being reawakened. Lives are being changed.<br><br>A new bishop of a young single adult ward in Canada organized his own search-and-rescue program. Eighteen months later the ward had taken on a new feeling of spiritual enthusiasm. Of those who returned, 61 were invited into disciplinary councils. Old issues were discussed and handled, and 58 of the 61 became active. Marriages blossomed in the ward, with 99 percent of them being sealed in the temple.<br><br>What greater service could each of you render than reaching out to someone you know who needs a helping hand to return to full fellowship in the gospel of Jesus Christ?<br><br>Will you accept our challenge tonight to join with your youth leaders, priesthood leaders, and institute teachers and directors to lose your life in the service of helping another young person return to the fold?<br><br>The counsel the Lord gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith in June 1829 is applicable to each of you as you accept this challenge: "And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!" (D&amp;amp;C 18:15).<br><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><br>Now, I conclude as I began. Is the road you are now traveling and the present conduct of your life leading you to achieve your full God-given potential?<br><br>"As the finest generation in the history of the Church," much is expected of you.<br><br>In summary, keep the fire of your testimony burning brightly through faith, prayer, scripture study, and the spiritual blessings that come from obedience to the Lord's commandments.<br><br>• Take responsibility for who you are and what you want to become.<br><br>• Stay focused and use your time wisely.<br><br>• Have the courage to be different from those in the world around you.<br><br>• Lose yourself in service to another.<br><br>As you do these things the Lord will bless you and strengthen you so that you may move forward in magnifying the talents and opportunities He has given you.<br><br>I bear testimony, my brothers and sisters, of the divinity of Heavenly Father's plan for each of you. Jesus is truly our Savior, and He very much loves and cares for each of you. As you keep His commandments and follow the counsel of the prophet and your leaders, He will be there to guide you through the challenges that lie ahead.<br><br>May His choicest blessings be with each of you, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Donald L.

<h1>ghts of Our Hearts or Why Do We Do What We Do? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I need to start with a little confession. My wife, Ann, and I are tyrants. We want our three children to play the piano, and we stop just short of shackling their ankles to the bench to make sure that happens. The other night as we were driving home from an especially dismal piano lesson, I was haranguing my two sons over their sad performance and obvious lack of preparation. As soon as I took a breath, my 11-year-old seized the opportunity to adjust my thinking.<br><br>"Okay, Dad, I had a bad lesson tonight. But, do you know what? I don't care."<br><br>Where had he learned to express himself so clearly? My firstborn apparently possesses not an ounce of desire to excel at the piano, in spite of years of coaxing and persuasion from his parents. Can any of you relate? Does "You will thank me later for making you practice" sound familiar to you? Or "You will be grateful you learned to play the hymns when you hit the mission field." Ever heard that?<br><br>I am counting on Adam's heart softening toward the piano as he matures, because he is actually quite talented. I have the feeling that he will go through the same cycle of change that I did, eventually developing a very personal, internal desire to master the piano for the love of music and what it does for his soul. But, for now, my wife and I accept the fact that he will need steady external motivation if we expect to see any progress. Adam will practice the piano because we force him to.<br><br>I wonder why you do the things you do. Why did you practice the piano? Why did you quit practicing the piano? Why do you wear your hair that way? Why are you in college? Why are you dating that particular girl?<br><br>As a freshman at BYU, I remember going to bed that first Saturday night in my ultracompact Helaman Halls room and realizing that I could decide whether or not to get up for nine o'clock church the next morning. Mom and Dad were in California and would have no idea whether I went or not.<br><br>The decision to get up on Sunday morning was strictly up to me, dictated by the internal desires of my heart. It is really the same with every choice we make. People around us see the choice itself, but only we know why we made that choice. In contrast to our childhood years, when many of our choices were made with little thought or were based on some external motivator--such as our parents or teachers or maybe a best friend--the more mature and independent we become, the more personal responsibility we have for our choices and the more those choices are governed by the motives that lie within our own hearts. Although external forces will always lean on our behavior, they become more and more subservient to the personal, heartfelt desires we carry inside of us.<br><br>President James E. Faust explained:<br><br><i>We must at times search our own souls and discover what we really are. Our real character, much as we would wish, cannot be hidden. It shines from within us transparently. Attempts to deceive others only deceive ourselves.</i>[James E. Faust, "Search Me, O God, and Know My Heart,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 18]<br><br>Years ago I heard Boyd K. Packer invite us to listen to our hearts. That expression turned on a light for me. He didn't speak of feeling the impulses of our hearts but of<i>listening</i>to our hearts--as if this central organ of our body that is somehow able to bridge the temporal and the spiritual about us could actually speak to us.<br><br>When warned by the Lamanites that if they prayed they would suffer death, "Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts" (Mosiah 24:12).<br><br>Even Grandmother Willow understood this important truth when she told Pocahontas to listen to her heart in the Disney movie.<br><br>So what are the thoughts of your heart? What do you hear whispered to your mind each time you make a choice? Why do you do what you do? For the next few minutes, let's each of us peel away our protective shells and take that "fantastic voyage" inside--directly to our hearts--and admit to ourselves what makes us tick.<br><br>If I were to poll you all right now and ask why you went to church last Sunday, and if you answered from quietly inside yourself where no one else could see you or hear you, I suspect we would uncover a colorful array of answers reflecting the true "thoughts and intents" within each of our hearts (Mosiah 5:13). You may say: "Habit." "Spiritual refreshment." "Duty." "Social outlet." "Peer pressure." "Obedience." These honest expressions of the heart are the underlying explanations for our actions. Hearing them clearly helps us understand our choices better. We are probably more comfortable with some of the thoughts of our hearts than we are with others. What's important is to understand them and to know that we can change them if we choose.<br><br>Our family has been slowly working our way together through the Book of Mormon. (We read right after the piano practicing is finished.) Right now we are firmly entrenched in the life-and-death struggles of the battlefield reported in the book of Alma. In the course of narrating one particular battle, the author-prophet took time to describe for us the reasons that each side had gone to war. I can't help but feel that the Lord offers this description so that we can learn something fundamental about ourselves.<br><br>Zerahemnah is captain of the Lamanite army and shrewdly plays upon the desires of the Amalekite subculture--described as being "of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites were" (Alma 43:6). He appointed the Amalekites to be his chief captains so that "he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites" (Alma 43:7). Zerahemnah's driving desire is to enslave the Nephites, and he knows that he must appeal to his people's driving desires to succeed. And why was this army of Lamanites willing to go to battle against the Nephites? The scriptures report it was so they "might usurp great power over them, and also that [they] might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage" (Alma 43:8).<br><br>But the Nephites were going to battle for entirely different reasons. We read:<br><br><i>The Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.</i><br><br><i>And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God.</i>[Alma 43:45–46]<br><br>As the battle progressed, the Nephites found themselves on the brink of defeat. At that point Captain Moroni "sent forth and inspired their hearts," as the scriptures say (Alma 43:48). He renewed their commitment to the reasons that brought them to battle in the first place. And with those thoughts and intents reaffirmed in their hearts, the Nephites "cried with one voice unto the Lord their God" and "began to stand against the Lamanites with power" (Alma 43:49–50). In dramatic fashion the much larger Lamanite army wilted against the Nephites. They began to flee, only to be "encircled about by the Nephites," causing these power-hungry aggressors to be "struck with terror" (Alma 43:53).<br><br>Notice two significant themes from this military exchange. First, our motives for doing things matter. Second, there are better and worse motives to choose from. And the better motives give us access to divine help.<br><br>Both the Lamanites and Nephites were doing the same thing on the surface--they were both at war. But they were doing it for vastly different reasons. "The Nephites were inspired by a better cause" (Alma 43:45)--a cause that they knew was acceptable to God. Their reasons were aligned with God's will and qualified them to rely upon Him for support. The scriptures are careful to report that "in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom," the tide of the battle turned (Alma 43:50). And thus they conquered.<br><br>Neal A. Maxwell brings the significance of our motives into clearer focus:<br><br><i>Actually, everything depends--initially and finally--on our desires. These shape our thought patterns. Our desires thus precede our deeds and lie at the very cores of our souls, tilting us toward or away from God (see D&amp;amp;C 4:3). God can "educate our desires" (see Joseph F. Smith,</i>Gospel Doctrine,<i>5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 297). Others seek to manipulate our desires. But it is we who form the desires, the "thoughts and intents of [our] hearts" (Mosiah 5:13).</i><br><br><i>The end rule is "according to [our] desires . . . shall it be done unto [us]" (D&amp;amp;C 11:17), "for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts" (D&amp;amp;C 137:9; see also Alma 41:5; D&amp;amp;C 6:20, 27). One's individual will thus remains uniquely his. God will not override it nor overwhelm it. Hence we'd better want the consequences of what we want!</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 23]<br><br>So then, why did you go to church on Sunday? Why did you sing the hymns? Why did you partake of the sacrament? Why did you bow your heads in communal prayer? This is a very personal process, this process of inspecting and understanding the thoughts of our hearts. It is difficult to talk about because the subject is so dear and the stakes are so high. Sometimes we are lucky enough to have a family member or a friend or a priesthood leader who helps us unravel the mystery that underlies our choices. But in the end, it is up to each one of us--together with God--to honestly take inventory of the thoughts of our hearts. Remember the Lord's instruction to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery: "There is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart" (D&amp;amp;C 6:16).<br><br>In exploring my own motives, I find they fall across a broad spectrum, bordered on one end by "Love of the World" and on the other end by "Love of God." From that quiet place inside your heart, see if you don't agree. Finding validation and reinforcement from the world immediately around us sometimes seems the most intuitive to us because it is so tangible and so neatly measured by our peers, our coworkers, and our social role models. It is the natural course for the natural man. If being accepted of man is the thought and intent of our heart, we are driven by fashion, winning, our bodies, money, and power. We may well achieve the acceptance we are looking for, but, like the world around us, our satisfaction is built upon sand and soon washes out with the tide. Our bodies get flabby, our possessions decay, someone smarter or younger or more attractive replaces us, and we are left with nothing of lasting value. The Lord cautions us repeatedly about going "on in the persuasions of men" and fearing "man more than God" (D&amp;amp;C 3:6; D&amp;amp;C 3:7).<br><br>William Wordsworth paints the bleak picture of marching to this drum:<br><br><i>The world is too much with us; late and soon,</i><br><i>Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:</i><br><i>Little we see in Nature that is ours;</i><br><i>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</i><br>[William Wordsworth, "The World Is Too Much with Us," 1807, lines 1–4]<br><br>I am able to tell if my motives tend toward this end of the spectrum if I am primarily worried about me--because, ultimately, chasing after worldliness is to follow a path of systematic selfishness. President Spencer W. Kimball warned, "First, we must eliminate the individual tendency to selfishness that snares the soul, shrinks the heart, and darkens the mind" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Becoming the Pure in Heart,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1985, 5). Selfishly pursuing "the honors of men" shrinks our hearts and removes us from God (D&amp;amp;C 121:35).<br><br>Now, just as the natural man within us is magnetized to love-of-the-world–type motivations, our divine nature embraces motives that are compatible with divine attributes. At this end of the spectrum we are driven to act according to God's will and with a desire to serve Him above all others--because we love Him and we love all that He loves. Instead of being influenced by the voices of men, we take "the Holy Spirit for [our] guide," worrying only about listening closely and intently to His direction in spite of the noisy world around us (D&amp;amp;C 45:57). The love of God motivates us to seek riches "for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted" (Jacob 2:19).<br><br>Listen to the words of our living prophet:<br><br><i>There is something of divinity within each of you. You have such tremendous potential with that quality as a part of your inherited nature. Every one of you was endowed by your Father in Heaven with a tremendous capacity to do good in the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Try a little harder to measure up to the divine within each of you. As Alma said, "Awake and arouse your faculties" (Alma 32:27).</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley "The Light Within You,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1995, 99]<br><br>Personal motives at this end of the spectrum are focused on everyone except me. There is no time and honestly no interest in worrying about our own gold medal when it feels so good to help someone else to the platform. We embrace the ideal described by the Lord: "Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 82:19).<br><br>What are your hearts thinking right now? Are the desires of your heart also spread across the horizon? Do they motivate you to choices that bring lasting happiness? Are you satisfied with what makes you tick? I hope that, like me, you would love to change your scattergram of motives for a more clustered group around "Love of God." I am sure you recognize that the peace and joy that accompany the choices arising from these motives are much more appealing than the counterfeit pleasures that come from the others.<br><br>I can't count the times I have put my foot in my mouth with an insensitive comment and afterward asked myself, "Why did I say that?" When I was younger, the honest answer was that I was trying to be funny. I was looking for a laugh. Over time I have mostly gotten past that need to be the favorite entertainer, and now I more often possess better motives. Sometimes I will act on these improved motives and everything will work out great. But other times, even though my motive may be to smooth out a sensitive situation or to make someone else feel comfortable, I will inadvertently say the wrong thing and still offend. However, the feeling about the second foot-in-mouth experience is entirely different from the first. I still regret the offense, but I feel the peace in my heart that tells me loving, godly motives were at work, and, in short order, the unintended offense is miraculously replaced with understanding and love--all because the governing motives were more pure.<br><br>As our lives progress, we become increasingly conflicted as we alternate across the spectrum of motives. For a variety of reasons, with experience we find ourselves drawn more to one end than the other, and when we choose based on the "other" end, we are unhappy or uncomfortable. The Savior's words make perfect sense: "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other" (Matthew 6:24). With the Lord's help we can educate the desires of our hearts--as Elder Maxwell suggested--eventually resolving the dissonance and ensuring progress toward peace and freedom. At times the choice itself may look exactly the same, but our reasons for doing it may be quite different. Just like the Nephites who were forced to defend their liberties, we learn to be motivated by just the same sort of "better cause[s]."<br><br>So, how do we do it? How do we have the thoughts of our hearts more regularly speaking the love of God?<br><br>After years of wandering about, led by love-of-the-world desires and doing all he could to demonstrate his distaste for God, Alma the Younger experienced a remarkable change of heart. As a result of his experience, he told us:<br><br><i>Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</i><br><br><i>And thus they become new creatures.</i>[Mosiah 27:25–26]<br><br>Apparently it is not just the outwardly wicked among us who must undergo this change. It is all of us. Spiritual rebirth is the Lord's way of subduing the natural-man motivations of our hearts and giving life to the divine-nature motivations. In a very real sense spiritual rebirth is the sweetest coming-home experience we can have. It's the process by which we awaken to the meaning of the piano's music--and the process that makes temple marriage an eternal blessing rather than just a cultural norm. It is, I believe, the education of the heart that Elder Maxwell spoke of.<br><br>But we have got to be persistent and patient, remembering how fundamental eternal progress is to gospel living. For most of us, our spiritual rebirth is not the kind of dramatic event it was for Alma. It is probably more of an awakening that occurs over a long period of time and preparation--line upon line, in barely perceptible increments. In practical terms it means living the gospel more perfectly each day. It means doing a lot of things because the people we trust encourage us to. We will use them as the motivators of our choices for a season. I will count on my mother to enforce my piano practicing. And I will pay attention when my wife points out that the joke wasn't funny at all. And I will embrace my dad when he invites me to lean on his testimony until I have discovered one of my own. It also means that sometimes we will do the right thing for the wrong reasons. I'm thinking it is better to be in church to see our friends than not to be in church at all and that praying out of habit at least gets us in the right posture to converse with God. As we practice doing the right things--even if for the wrong reasons or because we are simply responding to the pressure from those we love and trust--rebirth commences and the Lord is able to educate our desires. Before long our personal motives grow up to meet our actions, and we realize how unmotivated we are by desires that were previously so compelling.<br><br>Above all, we need to know the love that God has for us before we can muster the faith to let go of the familiar reinforcement the world offers. In truth, it is His love for us that allows the purifying rebirth to occur. John reminds us that "we love him, because he first loved us," and we recognize that the prime demonstration of His love is the gift of His Son (1 John 4:19; see also John 3:16). In his powerful description of charity, Mormon admonished us to "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love" (Moroni 7:48). Ask for it, he says. Make sure that part of your effort to change is to ask for the love of God. And then, if you do?<br><br><i>Ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.</i>[Moroni 7:48]<br><br>My testimony to you, brothers and sisters, is that as our hearts change and become more pure, attraction to the world fades and we wonder why we ever possessed such hollow desires. We become happier, more giving, more at peace. We have all sighed with relief to see the transformation of old Ebenezer Scrooge. We have felt the burning in our souls as we have read of the conversions of King Lamoni and the Apostle Paul. And we have watched in wonder as family and friends all around us today have undergone the subtle purification of spiritual rebirth. These are people who have honestly faced the thoughts of their hearts and have chosen to change them.<br><br>As we come home to the divine within us, we must do as the children of Israel in the last days: We must exchange stony hearts for soft hearts (see Ezekiel 11:19). We must exchange shrunken hearts for expanding hearts. We must exchange spotted hearts for pure hearts. If we can manage this exchange called rebirth and be attuned to the Holy Spirit, we will clearly hear the thoughts of our hearts urging us to love God, and we will make corresponding choices. Those choices will ultimately lead us to God, who has promised us immortality and eternal life.<br><br>The reasons behind our choices matter. And each of us individually is in charge of determining what those reasons are. May we all have the courage to allow the love of God to govern the thoughts and desires of our hearts and embark upon the path of spiritual rebirth that makes it possible. The rewards are more glorious than we can even comprehend.<br><br>"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).<br><br>I so witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>John C.

<h1> Hate, Words of Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I am happy to be here today, though I feel like the speaker in church who said she felt inadequate standing before the congregation. One sister said to another, "Isn't she humble?" And the other responded, "That's no real accomplishment, she has a lot to be humble about."<br><br>Some of my students are sitting here thinking, "No joke!"<br><br>I do feel overwhelmed at the prospect of attempting to share something new and of value as I stand in the footsteps of the great men and women who have been here before me. I pray I can share some of my life and thoughts in a way that may help some of you have a new and useful perspective about words and their place in a Christ-centered life.<br><br>Words are my tools. As a librarian I collect, catalog, and preserve them. As a lawyer, which is my principal profession, I search them out, savoring the power, sound, feel, and nuance of them. As a mother, words are something I teach, and teach with--a method of motivation, reward, and reprimand. As a person of faith, they are second only to spiritual promptings as a form of guidance, comfort, and inspiration.<br><br>Lately, however, I have observed a distressing escalation of the use of words to hurt, anger, divide, and make war. Perhaps as a law professor I should approve of the trend. It does, after all, make well-paying work for many of our graduates. However, I have viewed myself as a solver of problems and a peacemaker, not as a warrior. I have not found entertainment in<i>L.A. Law</i>or its more recent progeny. Neither am I comfortable with the wars of words that rage around us.<br><br>Today I would like to talk about the power of words. I would like to remind you of some of their magic. There is nothing arcane about words. They are not supernatural. They are like light and gravity--they are central to our existence, and, because they are pervasive, we often fail to see them or recognize their power and worth.<br><br>John sets us on the right path:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i><br><br><i>The same was in the beginning with God.</i><br><br><i>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</i>[John 1:1–3]<br><br>The Savior is the Word. Let us consider whether our words are worthy of Him.<br><br>Words are among the most marvelous gifts we have as human beings. Words are tools used by God to build the necessary framework to lift us from our mortal existence and carry us back to His presence. He uses words for making and keeping binding commitments. The difference between an eternal marriage and a marriage of degrading cohabitation is a few words.<br><br>This is made clear in one of the most loved films of the BYU community, past and present:<br><br><b>Buttercup:</b><i>Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?</i><br><br><b>Westley:</b><i>What hideous sin have you committed lately?</i><br><br><b>Buttercup:</b><i>I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.</i><br><br><b>Westley:</b><i>Never happened.</i><br><br><b>Buttercup:</b><i>What?</i><br><br><b>Westley:</b><i>Never happened.</i><br><br><b>Buttercup:</b><i>But it did. I was there. This old man said "man and wife."</i><br><br><b>Westley:</b><i>Did you say "I do"?</i><br><br><b>Buttercup:</b><i>Uh, no. We sort of skipped that part.</i><br><br><b>Westley:</b><i>Then you're not married. If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.</i><br><br>[From the movie script for<i>The Princess Bride,</i>http://www.krug.org/scripts/princess_bride.html]<br><br>Our words in the marriage vows, and those of the priesthood-holding sealer who binds us together for eternity, are not symbols of the marriage. Words are the mechanism for making the vows and for our Father's accepting our commitment and granting us the opportunity to extend those vows into eternity. The vows are the wedding--the binding.<br><br>As we bind ourselves to our eternal companions through vows, we also bind ourselves to God. We are members of a covenant church. We enter into covenants with our Father in Heaven, as did Abraham, his son, and his grandson. Our Father makes great promises to us through those covenants: eternal life, eternal marriage, blessings poured from the windows of heaven. "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10).<br><br>The individual covenants we make are set out in specific sacred words. The baptism prayer, the sacrament prayer, and portions of the prayer of confirmation use precise words. Why must a baptism or sacrament prayer, a sealing prayer, or any other prayer or blessing in the temple be witnessed and spoken exactly as it is set out in scripture or otherwise revealed? Because the exact pattern of those words is a sacred act--an ordinance--an exercise of the priesthood of God. If you didn't say it, you didn't do it.<br><br>Used in the context of our relationship with God, words are real, and their power is real. Repentance can be real and sincere, but our acceptance of the Atonement is not sufficient if we only have a change of heart. We must also be baptized. The act, and the words of the prayer, are more than symbols. They effect real change. The acceptance and understanding of that change is part of the act of repentance and of our preparation for baptism. Contemplating those vows enables us to test the reality of our commitment to repentance, to a forsaking of past sins and a covenant to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ--more words. More words that are the acts we cherish and revere (see D&amp;amp;C 76:50–54).<br><br>As a lawyer, I understand that. Mutually enforceable promises to act or pay constitute a contract. One relying upon the representations or promises of another can legally bind the promisor. The promisor cannot change his mind or say, "King's X, I didn't really mean it." The time of agreement may alter tax liabilities or the validity of the agreement itself. The parties cannot lawfully misrecord the time or date when it is an element of the agreement. The law views those words as binding, just as our Father does in the spiritual context.<br><br>For this reason I am always shocked when I learn of a law student or lawyer who blithely alters the facts recited in an agreement. He has not made a legally valid change but has committed fraud--deception with intent to achieve a benefit to which the client is not legally entitled. If caught, he will suffer the appropriate penalties--think Enron. If not, he remains at risk of discovery. The false words may fool some people, but they do not make an invalid document valid. If we lie in a document, can we expect the courts to honor the document?<br><br>However, we are mortal and can be deceived. It is possible that the liar can cover up a lie, and it will live so long that it is accepted as truth and the law does not allow the question to be reopened. That does not make it true, but it takes the lie beyond the power of the court to undo its consequences. The term for this is<i>statute of limitations.</i>It means a limitation of action: the services of the courts are no longer available to a petitioner who seeks to overturn a result based on the lie. The law provides for a limitation of actions because otherwise there would be no certainty in our temporal lives. Contracts, deeds, and other transactions would never be final. It would be impossible for us to have certainty in our temporal affairs.<br><br>Temporal affairs are reciprocal of eternal ones. In an eternal world, with an immortal Father and omniscient judge, we cannot lie. We can say we have repented and been baptized, but if we do not in our hearts make the covenants that go with the words, can we expect our Father to honor them? We can fool ourselves, our bishops, our mission presidents, and our spouses, but we cannot lie to our judge, our Father. It is not an accident that Satan is known as the father of lies:<br><br><i>And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</i>[2 Nephi 2:18]<br><br>On the other hand, our Father is the Father of Truth.<br><br>I have a personal vision, not a comfortable one, of the Judgment. I think the book that is the record of each life is the heart and mind of the person. Judgment is ultimately a stripping away of all lies. We are faced with our own selves, the absence of all deceit, excuse, rationalization, or obfuscation. Further, we know that our Father and our Savior have a perfect knowledge of us, as we now have. They love us anyway. However, they also know the exact degree of our sin, our repentance, and our acceptance of the proffered Atonement. Stripped bare of all pretense, we are not so much judged as we come to fully understand the justice, the mercy, and the inevitability of our ultimate fate.<br><br>Until that day we must live with an imperfect knowledge of the truth of words. So I will turn from the perfection of words and understanding to which we come in the next life to the more difficult, even trying confusion we bring to each other as we use and misuse words each day.<br><br>I want to talk about the mundane uses of words for the rest of our time together because their consequences are not mundane. I think these uses are the ones that get us into the most difficulty. In our daily speech we use words casually. We toss them out, sometimes careless of their effect. We drum up a phrase for its immediate impact without thinking of its long-term consequences.<br><br>My father would not tolerate a vulgarity, much less an obscenity or profanity, to be used in the home or by his children. Once, when I was about 11, I used a word often used by my friends and classmates and also used, though not in my father's presence, by my siblings. It was a mild expletive, one that had once had a specific biological connotation, lost through millions of thoughtless repetitions. He asked, in the disappointed tone that always stirred the guilt I was carefully trying to ignore, if I was so bereft of imagination that I couldn't think of a creative way to express myself. He was disappointed if my education from my parents had left me so stunted in vocabulary that I could find nothing to say of greater grace or meaning.<br><br>My parents and their siblings were pioneers. As an adult I had the occasion to read the journals and autobiographies of other late 19th- and early 20th-century settlers as well as historical novels, including my favorite,<i>The Virginian,</i>which tells the story, thinly disguised, of the in-laws and grandparents of some of my dearest friends. Most of these men and women had a few years of education in a local schoolhouse or home. They lacked degrees or academic distinction. However, it was central to their self-definition that they expressed themselves well. Their stories were works of art. Their descriptions were careful and precise. In<i>The Virginian</i>the protagonist brings a train car full of cowboys on the verge of rebellion into happy, though abashed obedience by selling them as truth a tall tale of such magnificence that they bow to his obvious superiority. (See Owen Wister,<i>The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains,</i>http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/wister/ch16.html.)<br><br>My relatives of the same generation viewed speech and especially storytelling as entertainment, art, and a way to build and maintain subtle and nuanced relationships of love and respect within the family and the community. Many of the stories were funny, many tender, but the art of well-chosen language was a hallmark of intelligence and leadership. Or, as Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>A speaker who mouths profanity or vulgarity to punctuate or emphasize speech confesses inadequacy in his or her own language skills. Properly used, modern languages require no such artificial boosters.</i>["Reverent and Clean,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, 51]<br><br>I compare that with the mindless gutter language that washes over us as we watch television, movies, or walk down the street. I loved the movie<i>Apollo 13</i>but was interested, and relieved, when I read an interview of one of the astronauts from that amazing flight. Commenting on the film, he said it was pretty accurate except that no one on the crew swore, there was no antagonism between crew members, and they did not drink alcohol while in training. Apparently the makers of the movie felt the need to use profanity to pump some energy into dialog that lacked, in their minds, vigor or interest--sort of like adding too much salt to watery soup to cover the absence of more nutritious ingredients. Surely this story had enough body that it did not require those extra few handfuls of salt.<br><br>The law has a term,<i>fighting words,</i>for insults so foul that the victim of such insults is entitled to fight back. In the words of one court, "[Fighting words] by their very utterance provoke a swift physical retaliation and incite an immediate breach of the peace" (<i>Skelton v. City of Birmingham,</i>342 So. 2d 933, 936-37 [Ala. Crim. App.], remanded on other grounds, 342 So.2d 937 [Ala. 1976]). The words themselves constitute assaults. If you are interested in what words those might be, listen to some of the more popular rap recordings. I have been dismayed to read in legal literature that some scholars think these words have become so common in general public discourse that, except for one or two racial epithets, there may no longer be words that meet the legal standard of fighting words. I disagree and would like to share two experiences I had this year.<br><br>My son is a basketball player. In the last seven years I have seen perhaps 120 high school or Junior Jazz basketball games. I have also heard perhaps every fighting word in the book on the lips of players, coaches, or referees. It has become an accepted strategy for some players to subject their opponents to a stream of foul language to upset them, put them off their game, or (best of all, it seems) to goad them into fouling. In one game, one of my son's teammates was subjected to a continuing verbal assault from a referee, who told the boy he intended to make him behave so badly that the ref could throw him out of the game.<br><br>An even sadder instance involved a different ballplayer at a different game. A boy about 10 years old was sitting on the floor underneath the home team's basket, yelling every obscenity and profanity the mind could recall at one of our boys who was waiting to rebound. Here was a 16-year-old basketball player trying to stay calm and focused being riveted by a barrage of filth, his teammates yelling his name repeatedly to refocus him on the game. Parents, teachers, principals, coaches, and referees took it for granted. What does it say when we consider foul language to be an acceptable strategy in school sports competitions?<br><br>I love the grace, strength, and skill of basketball. But sitting in the stands I sometimes find my heart racing and my blood pressure shooting up as if I were being mugged when I am surrounded by booing, shouting, disrespect, and harassment of players and referees. If we really love the game, as opposed to a gladiatorial contest, we don't want garbage. In too many sports events, and in television shows like<i>The Weakest Link</i>and<i>American Idol,</i>the real sport is the abuse.<br><br>The referee should have known better. The parents, teachers, and players should have known better. They were not witless or helpless. They made choices about the language they used and tolerated. Those choices tell us much about them--and ourselves when in the same position.<br><br>Elder Charles Didier taught us to remember:<br><br><i>Words are a form of personal expression. They differentiate us as well as fingerprints do. They reflect what kind of person we are, and tell of our background, and depict our way of life. They describe our thinking as well as our inner feelings.</i>["Language: A Divine Way of Communicating,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1979, 25]<br><br>Elder Didier went on to say:<br><br><i>Language is of divine origin. Only man speaks (and women do even better), and he does so because of the purpose for which he was created. Let us listen to Paul when he said: "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal" (1 Cor. 13:1). Anacharsis, when asked what was the best part of man, answered: "The tongue." When asked what was the worst, the answer was the same: "The tongue."</i><br><br><i>"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</i><br><br><i>"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</i><br><br><i>"Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</i><br><br><i>"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh" (James 3:9–12).</i>[Didier, "Language," 25]<br><br>Words can be healing balm or gasoline on a fire in disputes with neighbors, friends, or colleagues. Television and movies create a tolerance for overblown emotion. Where once we sought the subtle or understated, now we often feel the need to heat up our vocabulary. Consider these different ways to make the same point:<br><br>1. "I don't remember things that way" or "You are lying." Or, my personal favorite, "You are a fraudulent malfeasor!"<br><br>2. "Let's think together to try to solve this problem" or "That's dumb. Let me do it. I know the right way."<br><br>3. Or, turning back to my basketball stories, consider the parent of one of my son's teammates, who proposed that our parent rooting core quit yelling negative comments to referees who were doing a poor job but praise them when they did well and encourage our boys on in the face of adversity. It seems to be making an impact in the tenor of games and has even perhaps reduced, though it has not stopped, the foul language.<br><br>When we attack people with whom we disagree, we injure or even end our ability to resolve disputes. Each time we raise the temperature in the discourse it is harder to reconcile differences. We raise a barrier of hate and anger. Elder Richard L. Evans counseled: "We are in a sense as much responsible for what we do to others with our words as we could be with weapons. In a sense, you can hit a man with words--'words as hard as cannon balls' as [Ralph Waldo] Emerson said it [<i>Self-Reliance</i>]" ("The Spoken Word: 'Words as Hard as Cannon Balls,'"<i>New Era,</i>December 1971, 34).<br><br>Words can be powerful in a positive way. Think of Alma's experience with the Zoramites:<br><br><i>And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</i>[Alma 31:5]<br><br>The Apostle Paul admonished us: "But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth" (Colossians 3:8).<br><br>Tenderness and loving speech are more important in families than anywhere else. My mother and I were at a dinner with a large family that was, for the most part, loving. There was one particularly attractive young couple. Their three beautiful children were talented and bright. The parents were successful in the community and apparently had everything. Later we were talking, and Mother grieved over the couple because of the pain in their relationship. I questioned her judgment. They were joking, laughing--the life of the party. She was not fooled by the jokes. Each one had an edge, she said. Every funny comment by one put the other in a bad light. Two years later they were divorced. Mother saw, as I did not, that cutting, hurtful words are not ameliorated by humor--just disguised to the inattentive.<br><br>Loyalty in a family means that we are loving in word. Again, Elder Didier gives great guidance:<br><br><i>Language is divine. Some may know this but do not realize its implications in their daily family life. Love at home starts with a loving language. This need is so important that, without loving words, some become mentally unbalanced, others emotionally disturbed, and some may even die. No society can survive after its family life has deteriorated, and this deterioration has always started with one word.</i>[Didier, "Language," 26]<br><br>And it is always a hurtful word.<br><br>Studies of couples who stay married for 30 or more years show that they are kind to each other. Their criticisms, when they come, are couched as exceptions in a nest of praise and love. I did a Google search on the term<i>lasting marriage.</i>The results? There were over a quarter of a million entries. I did not tally all the suggestions. I did page through the first 50 or so. The overriding theme was to be loving, resolve conflict, and be respectful of each other.<br><br>Elder Lynn G. Robbins wrote of Satan's efforts to destroy families:<br><br><i>He damages and often destroys families within the walls of their own homes. His strategy is to stir up</i>anger<i>between family members. Satan is the "father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with</i>anger,<i>one with another" (3 Ne. 11:29; emphasis added). The verb</i>stir<i>sounds like a recipe for disaster: Put tempers on medium heat, stir in a few choice words, and bring to a boil; continue stirring until thick; cool off; let feelings chill for several days; serve cold; lots of leftovers.</i>["Agency and Anger,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 80; emphasis in original]<br><br>Finally, as a mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and Primary president, I must talk a bit about words that heal children and words that wound them. Children are tender. They want to please. They want to do right. Sometimes they do not know how to do so, but they will strive to do right unless they are beaten down. We have all lost our temper on occasion with a particularly persistent child. But remember the Savior's love for them. His admonition, repeatedly, is that we should seek to be like them.<br><br><i>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</i>[Matthew 18:6]<br><br>A child may, and will, make mistakes. She may do bad things, but she is not bad. Psychological studies suggest that a child's brain is forming and reforming, building connections and synapses. When we discipline or reprimand a child, we are truly building that child. If we teach a child she is bad, we teach her to be bad. If we teach a child she is good, she strives to become good.<br><br>My son Philip persisted in asking me, when he was a child, if he was perfect. I had a rare moment of insight and knew that either a yes or no answer had pitfalls. If he was perfect, there was no room for growth. But he was clearly telling me he wanted and needed approval. I hit upon a compromise: "You are a perfect five-year-old." This was not exactly what he wanted to hear. What was a perfect five-year-old? It gave us a chance to talk about all the things he did well, how he was loved by his heavenly and earthly parents, and how he could grow to be a wonderful adult and return to his heavenly parents--not just a perfect five-year-old but one day perfected. Although he wanted another answer, he found mine acceptable. Through the years he has asked me if he is perfect. At about the age of 12 he came to accept my answer. "You are a perfect 12-year-old." Over time he has developed an understanding of the doctrine of eternal progression. He still desires to be better. He knows he has ample room to grow and improve, though sometimes his lack of perfection frustrates him as it did when he was five. But he accepts the process.<br><br>President David O. McKay counseled:<br><br><i>Three influences in home life awaken reverence in children and contribute to its development in their souls. These are:</i>first,<i>firm but</i>Gentle Guidance; second, Courtesy<i>shown by parents to each other, and to children; and</i>third, Prayer<i>in which children participate.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1956, 6–7; emphasis in original]<br><br>All of these three influences involve words.<br><br>Everything given to us by our Father is given for our eternal salvation. However, any gift can be abused or turned to evil purposes. Words, the power of language, are among the greatest gifts. I pray we can use words for our edification and bless the lives of others, and I do so in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Constance K.

<h1>n the Path of Mortality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Last summer my wife and I had the pleasure of backpacking in the High Uintas with our oldest son, Justin, and three of his friends. We had a wonderful time fishing, camping, and simply observing God's creations. Of course a large portion of the trip involved hiking.<br><br>As many of you know, hikers or backpackers encounter a variety of trail conditions. On any given trek, flat, straight, and easy to locate trail segments can quickly become steep, rocky, and obscure.<br><br>When trails become difficult to find, considerate hikers often place markers on the path to map the way for those who follow. These markers are built by stacking several rocks to form what is called a cairn. Cairns are spaced so that a hiker standing near one can readily see the next. By walking from cairn to cairn, a backpacker can successfully traverse the previously unseen path and reach the goal.<br><br>Significantly, cairns only have meaning for those who recognize them for what they are. For some, cairns are nothing more than a pile of rocks. For others they are helpful markers on a trail. And yet for others, willing to examine in further detail, cairns can provide even more specific directions. For example, a stack of rocks with a small stone to the right of the stack indicates that the trail heads to the right. Similarly, a rock on the ground to the left of the cairn indicates that the trail heads to the left. A basic understanding of these structures makes it possible to obtain the final goal, but by being more informed about the nature of cairns, the journey can be made even smoother.<br><br>During our backpacking trip, each time my wife and I reached a cairn, we stopped to look for the next stack of rocks. When we didn't immediately find it, a sense of being lost was quick to enter our minds, but that feeling instantly vanished when we located the next small, simple landmark.<br><br>This experience using cairns caused me to reflect on the journey through mortality. Things can be going so easily--life is smooth, goals seem obtainable, and the path is clear. When life feels like this, it nearly always changes--new challenges arise, goals dangle out of reach, and the path seems unclear. It is during these moments of confusion that we need to refocus on the single goal of coming unto Christ.<br><br>Heavenly Father has provided a plan for us to accomplish this goal, and Christ has made it possible for each of us to obtain it through His atoning sacrifice and our obedience to His commandments. To clearly mark the difficult path through mortality and help us obtain this goal, Christ has placed markers along the path that leads back to the presence of the Father. The second verse of the hymn "I Believe in Christ" reads:<br><br><i>I believe in Christ, who marked the path,</i><br><i>Who did gain all his Father hath,</i><br><i>Who said to men: "Come, follow me,</i><br><i>That ye my friends, with God may be."</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 134]<br><br>A Church publication describing temples states that "prophets, scriptures, and temples help guide Latter-day Saint youth" ("Beacons of Truth,"<i>Temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1999], 78).<br><br>Prophets, scriptures, and temples are three spiritual cairns that can successfully guide us through life.<br><br>First, let's consider the scriptures. The scriptures act as a cairn by helping us find answers to our questions and by giving us comfort in times of distress. When lost on the trail to Heavenly Father, we can look to the scriptures for voices of warning, for the glorious promise of eternal life, for the example of a perfect life, for answers to our questions, for comfort from our trials, and for the law that we must keep to obtain eternal life. President Howard W. Hunter stated:<br><br><i>Obedience requires that we search the scriptures to know the law. In order to be obedient to the law of the gospel and be obedient to the teachings of Jesus Christ, we must first understand the law and ascertain the will of the Lord. This is accomplished best by searching and studying the scriptures and the words of the prophets.</i>[<i>The Teachings of Howard W. Hunter,</i>ed. Clyde J. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997), 24]<br><br>This mortal life occupies a short period of time in relation to our eternal existence, and it should be emphasized that it is simply one part of our eternal trail. A long trail can be composed of many segments of varying terrain. Two long and easily identified segments can be connected with a short portion that is obscure and difficult to traverse. If we keep to the first long segment, we will eventually reach the short segment that is difficult to follow. If we fail to keep on the short, connecting segment by following the cairns along the way, we will be unable to find the final path that leads to our eventual goal and will be lost forever.<br><br>This, of course, relates to our eternal existence. We have all been successful in following our premortal trail and have reached this earth life, where we will be for a very short but important period of time. During this mortal life we will encounter cairns that, if followed, will lead us back to our heavenly home.<br><br>I remember coming across my first cairn on the path to eternal life when I was a 17-year-old member of another faith. A high school friend I had known for three years came over to my house to obtain help on his trigonometry. While working through his homework, we began talking about typical high school topics including girls, car stereos, jobs, and, eventually, our personal beliefs in the nature of the Godhead. I described to him my beliefs that God the Father and Jesus Christ were separate and distinct beings and that they had bodies much like ours. I explained that these were my own views and not those of the church I occasionally attended.<br><br>My friend, my eternal friend, smiled and reached into his book bag and extracted a small book that he said I should read. He indicated that his church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, believed in the Godhead that I had described. The book he had given me was the Pearl of Great Price. Although this book is not typically used as a missionary tool, in this case it was extremely effective. I read the entire book that very night and followed that cairn, which led to many others. If we follow the cairns while here on earth, we will remain on the path that leads to eternal life.<br><br>In Lehi's vision of the tree of life, a path that represents mortality runs along the bank of a river. Mists of darkness envelop the path and symbolize our individual trials and temptations. An iron rod, which signifies the word of God, runs parallel to the path and through the mists of darkness. Individuals entering this life from their premortal existence find themselves at the beginning of the path that runs the length of the river from where they stand to the tree, or eternal life.<br><br>When Lehi was looking for his family to partake of the tree's fruit, he found that the head of the river and the beginning of the iron rod were not far off. In other words, even though it is of utmost importance to make it from the beginning of this mortal life back to the presence of our Heavenly Father, the journey is not very long. In 1 Nephi 8 we read:<br><br><i>And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof a little way off....</i><br><br><i>And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.</i>[1 Nephi 8:14, 19]<br><br>We later learn that those who held firmly to the iron rod were able to travel from the head of the river through the mists of darkness and arrive safely at the tree.<br><br><i>And they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.</i>[1 Nephi 8:30]<br><br>On the other hand, the numberless concourses of people who did not hold to the iron rod were lost and were unable to stay on the path to eternal life.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost.</i>[1 Nephi 8:22–23]<br><br>Those who successfully made their way to the tree of life did so because of their reliance on the word of God. The counsel Alma gave to his son Helaman in Alma 37 summarizes the necessity of holding fast to the word of God:<br><br><i>For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</i><br><br><i>And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</i>[Alma 37:44–45]<br><br>This mortal life is our path to the tree of life, which is but "a little way off." Although our journey in mortality is short, Lehi helps us understand that mists of darkness can cause us to lose our way and reward if we don't catch hold of the word of God and hold fast to it while pressing forward through mortality.<br><br>Recall that cairns are placed close enough together that an observer standing near one can view the next. Due to a visual impairment I've had since birth, it isn't possible for me to stand next to a cairn and see the next. Fortunately, I hike with my wife, who helps me along the way by giving me audible directions and warnings of potential pitfalls. This assistance is similar to the words of a prophet, which help individuals find and stay on the straight and narrow way. A prophet is the second spiritual cairn I wish to discuss today. President Joseph Fielding Smith identifies these prophets:<br><br><i>All Saints should be prophets. Every man who can say knowingly that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world and the Only Begotten Son of God, is a prophet....</i><br><br><i>A president of a stake has a right to revelation in his stake, and for the guidance of it; a bishop, in his ward; and likewise a missionary in his mission field. Every other member of the Church who is called to an office has the right to the inspiration and the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord in that which is given him to do. If he is so inspired, he is a prophet.</i>[<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954), 1:185–86]<br><br>These prophets are entitled to inspiration and revelation for "that which is given him to do" and not for individuals or groups outside of their stewardship. President Gordon B. Hinckley is "the prophet," the only individual currently entitled to receive revelation for the entire Church. His stewardship includes not only members of Christ's church but every individual on earth.<br><br>Many people hold offices in the Church for short periods of time. Those who lead today will be followers tomorrow, and those who follow today are tomorrow's leaders. The lives of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ clearly teach this principle.<br><br>The Bible teaches that as John the Baptist's mission progressed, he became very popular among the believers. After baptizing the Savior, John's disciples came to him with a concern: "And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him" (John 3:26).<br><br>Now, these disciples were concerned because their master was losing prestige or influence, but John the Baptist understood that his time was coming to an end and the Savior's mission was beginning. He replied: "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30).<br><br>Jesus Christ also recognized that there was a time to teach and a time to learn. At the time of the Passover, Jesus' family traveled to Jerusalem. Upon finishing their business, they returned to Nazareth. After traveling for a day, Joseph and Mary noticed that Jesus was not in their company. After three days they finally found him in the temple teaching and answering questions of those who were astonished at his learning. Jesus returned with his earthly family to Nazareth, and, as stated in Luke 2:52, he "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man." This experience illustrates that Jesus, in addition to being a master teacher, also understood that there were things to learn from his association with parents and family.<br><br>At some points along our mortal path we are followers and at others we are leaders. We lead those within our stewardship and follow those entrusted with our care. When we act in positions of leadership, it is exactly that, leadership--not "dragership" or "pushership" but leadership. We should lead and guide, not drag and push individuals to Christ. Although directed at those holding the priesthood, I am sure section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants applies to all. In verse 41 we read: "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned."<br><br>We find another example of appropriate behavior as a leader in the hymn "I Am a Child of God":<br><br><i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,</i><br><i>Help me find the way.</i><br><i>Teach me all that I must do</i><br><i>To live with him someday.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 301]<br><br>While in positions of leadership, we should be guiding, accompanying, and helping others. We should be teaching them what to do to remain on the path that leads back to their eternal goal. On our hiking trip I was unable to see the cairns that were intended to keep me on the path. Fortunately my wife understands what it means to be a leader; she guided me, walked beside me, and helped me find the way. With her help I was able to traverse the obscure path and reach our destination. By leading others in this fashion we become cairns on the path through mortality.<br><br>When we don't follow the cairns established by a forest service official or by caring hikers, we run the risk of being lost. We must follow the prophets whether through our parents, home teachers, bishops, stake presidents, or general authorities.<br><br>Often small children and inexperienced hikers do not understand the usefulness of cairns and are tempted to knock them down. Without malice--they simply give no thought to why someone might have stacked rocks up--they topple the cairn with a good kick and a thud of satisfaction. How often do we as young and inexperienced members of Christ's church innocently kick down or dismantle the individuals that are serving in offices of responsibility? When we speak evil against the Lord's anointed, we break down the Lord's cairns and potentially obscure the path for those who follow. We must recognize the need and usefulness of prophets and make every attempt to sustain, build up, and support the men and women who serve in the Church to keep us on the path to our heavenly home.<br><br>Finally, we come to the third spiritual cairn--the temple. There is power in the temple that gives each of us direction and dispels the feelings of being lost. Members of the Church and friends of other faiths come by the thousands to participate in temple open houses. Young children look to the temple as a place where they will one day marry for eternity. Worthy youth visit the temple to participate in the sacred ordinances of proxy baptism and confirmation. And worthy adults obtain their own endowments, are sealed, and perform these ordinances for those who are deceased and unable to perform them for themselves. The temple gives us direction by helping us set goals of staying or becoming worthy to enter the temple and perform sacred ordinances for ourselves and others. Brigham Young explained the importance of receiving these sacred ordinances:<br><br><i>Your endowment is, to receive all those ordinances in the House of the Lord, which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels.</i>[<i>JD</i>2:31]<br><br>Although this is of utmost importance, there are additional ways in which the temple helps us remain on the correct path.<br><br>The temple's teachings help each of us better understand our relationship to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and they help us understand our mission here on earth. These truths aid us in finding our way in a confusing world. In<i>Temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>we are told that "in a turbulent world of conflicting values and mixed moral messages, Latter-day Saint youth know that the temple--like a compass--points the way to eternal truth" ("Beacons," 78).<br><br>The truths shared in the temple often include personal teachings and revelations intended to answer personal prayers and provide feelings of peace and comfort. President Howard W. Hunter taught:<br><br><i>Personal blessings come from temple attendance. And we again emphasize the personal blessings of temple worship and the sanctity and safety that are provided within those hallowed walls. It is the house of the Lord, a place of revelation and of peace.</i>[<i>Teachings of Howard W. Hunter,</i>238]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley added:<br><br><i>The temple is also a place of personal inspiration and revelation. Legion are those who in times of stress, when difficult decisions must be made and perplexing problems must be handled, have come to the temple in a spirit of fasting and prayer to seek divine direction. Many have testified that while voices of revelation were not heard, impressions concerning a course to follow were experienced at that time or later which became answers to their prayers.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Salt Lake Temple,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1993, 6]<br><br>The temple stands as a cairn for all members of the Church. Worthy members of the Church should attend the temple in whatever capacity they are entitled. If members are not worthy to attend, they should take whatever measures are necessary to become worthy. As we attend the temple we will be blessed and gain the knowledge and testimony necessary to keep us on the path back to our heavenly home. In addition, we may receive personal revelations and inspirations that will not only help us reach our eternal goal but will make this life more bearable and enjoyable.<br><br>Cairns are placed on trails to guide us across trail segments that are unclear and difficult to find. I have described three spiritual cairns today that can help guide you safely through mortality: scriptures, prophets, and temples.<br><br>Keep in mind that while hiking you must actively seek out the next cairn--you cannot simply hope or wish to be further down the trail. You must walk, step, and strive. I challenge each of us to actively pursue spiritual cairns. Don't simply read your scriptures--hold fast to them, search them, and use them in your life to solve problems and acquire answers. Follow the prophets, seek counsel from your parents, home teachers, bishops, and other local and general authorities. Sustain your leaders and help them perform their work by helping others understand the importance of their callings. Look to the temple, live worthily to enter its walls, attend often to perform sacred ordinances, and gain personal revelation and inspiration to assist you in reaching your mortal and eternal potential.<br><br>Following these cairns will make your life here on earth easier and more fulfilling, and, most important, following them will help you stay on the eternal path that leads to your Father in Heaven.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father lives. He loves us and has provided a plan by which we can return to Him. Jesus Christ lived on this earth, atoned for our sins, and lives today. If we are obedient to the Lord's commandments, we can use Christ's atoning sacrifice and live again in the presence of our loving Heavenly Father. He has provided us help along our mortal journey in the form of the holy scriptures, our beloved prophet Gordon B. Hinckley, and the temples scattered throughout the earth.<br><br>I testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1>ening One Another in the Community of Saints - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to talk with you. I have planned my remarks in the spirit of Nephi of old--to speak with "plainness," that I might be understood (see 2 Nephi 31:2–3).<br><br>I also hope my interpretations of situation and scripture are obvious and straightforward. An incident in my own life may explain what I mean.<br><br>A few years ago I lived in Blacksburg, Virginia, a university town in the Appalachian plateau area. I went to renew my driver's license at the Department of Motor Vehicles. As part of the process the clerk asked me to look into a box on the counter to take an eye test. I looked, and she asked me to read what I saw. There were a number of lines of letters and numbers I could read, so I took a bit of time trying to think of where to start. As I hesitated, I heard a bored voice say, "Out loud, please."<br><br>Well, she thought the task was obvious. I was not quick enough to see it so. I hope today to find the right lines to read with you and to explore a topic that we can all see as important, if not obvious.<br><br>Let me ask you now to look around and take a quick inventory of those assembled here today. Present are your professors, your Relief Society presidents, elders quorum presidents, bishops, and other Church leaders. Take a little more time and you can identify those who plan and maintain the buildings and other facilities at BYU and those who serve in the many supporting roles to your academic programs. Most important, you are here with your peers--other students. You will recognize a growing circle of friends, many of whom will become lifelong associates. And the very discerning will perhaps see a person destined to become their husband or wife.<br><br>As members of this BYU community we do share many things and have opportunities not only to derive benefit from but to contribute to this shared environment. In reality the BYU community may comprise a number of subcommunities. For example, we have the particular academic groups you belong to--the college, department, and even smaller groups. Also, we have our individual ward and stake organizations with special relevance to our lives. There are probably many other subcommunities you might identify from your own experiences.<br><br>Today I want to discuss some of the characteristics of our community as it influences our spiritual growth.<br><br>It is obvious that we are centered around learning and education at BYU. Our very organization speaks to the academic intentions of the university. However, equally significant to us is our emphasis upon developing character and refining and enlarging our spiritual lives.<br><br>Brigham Young University is very direct about its intention to fully integrate academic progress and gospel principles. It has had remarkable success in achieving this goal and stands in contrast to many other universities in both intention and result.<br><br>There is a sense in the world that higher education in general may lead to more reliance upon our own human understanding and less reliance upon the Lord--a sort of equation that says "more education equals less religious activity."<br><br>However, clear evidence exists that this equation does not hold for those who participate in the BYU community. In fact, the equation reads just the opposite for us: that is, "more education equals greater religious activity."<br><br>Graduates of institutions of higher education sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are more involved and dedicated to the gospel in their post-university lives than those from nonreligious schools, and there is a strong correlation between added years of education for Church members and greater adherence to gospel principles and practice. (See Stan L. Albrecht and Tim B. Heaton, "Secularization, Higher Education, and Religiosity,"<i>Review of Religious Research,</i>26, no. 1 (September 1984): 43–58.)<br><br>In a lecture included in a small book entitled<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar,</i>Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke about the mission of BYU and our roles in the community. He noted, "In addition to our concern with<i>learning,</i>Brigham Young University is also concerned with<i>becoming,</i>with the<i>conversion</i>of students and also of teachers." He continued with the reminder that our mission "is not just to enlarge what we<i>know,</i>but to change what we<i>are"</i>(Dallin H. Oaks, "On Learning and Becoming," in Henry B. Eyring, ed.,<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1995], 99, 101; emphasis in original).<br><br>In the same collection of lectures, Elder Neal A. Maxwell likened our situation as disciples and scholars to a form of consecration--where the mind and the spirit become one. He said:<br><br><i>For a disciple of Jesus Christ, academic scholarship is a form of worship. It is actually another dimension of consecration. Hence one who seeks to be a disciple-scholar will take both scholarship and discipleship seriously; and, likewise, gospel covenants. For the disciple-scholar, the first and second great commandments frame and prioritize life. How else could one worship God with all of one's heart, might,</i>mind,<i>and strength? (Luke 10:27.) Adoration of God leads to emulation of Him and Jesus: "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am." (3 Nephi 27:27; see also 2 Peter 3:11.)</i>["The Disciple-Scholar,"<i>On Becoming a Disciple-Scholar,</i>7; emphasis in original]<br><br>Elder Maxwell then talked of our roles in this environment:<br><br><i>The disciple-scholar also understands what kind of community he or she should help to build. Its citizens openly and genuinely desire to be called God's people. They are not secret disciples, but bear one another's burdens, mourn with those that mourn, comfort those in need of comfort, and witness for God at all times, and in all places, and in all things (see Mosiah 18:8–9). Hubris, including intellectual pride, reflects the ways of hell, not of heaven! No wonder a true community of scholars would qualify to be part of a larger community of Saints.</i>["The Disciple-Scholar," 7]<br><br>Elder Maxwell's language references the instructions given by Alma the Elder when he established the Church at the Waters of Mormon. Let me review Alma's words with you, as they are pertinent to our BYU community today:<br><br><i>And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</i>[Mosiah 18:21]<br><br>Alma further instructed his flock to "walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants" (Mosiah 18:29).<br><br>Note that both temporal and spiritual matters were part of the obligations of these early Church members toward one another.<br><br>I am reminded also at this point of the Savior's instructions to His disciples near the end of His earthly ministry:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>When the Savior sat with His apostles at the Last Supper, He spoke frankly to Simon Peter about his responsibilities:<br><br><i>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</i><br><br><i>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</i>[Luke 22:31–32]<br><br>Commandments to love and strengthen one another have been repeated over time in our scriptures and are most clearly a necessary part of the community of faith here at BYU.<br><br>In a talk at the BYU 2001 Annual University Conference, Elder Henry B. Eyring reflected upon our community as a place where we may move toward such consecration and full acceptance of the Atonement. Speaking of evidence that faculty and others help students grow spiritually, he said:<br><br><i>I see it in the eyes of the students. I have seen it especially in the eyes of students who have been trusted with great responsibilities by you. Your remarkable courage to involve students in serious research, in leading service projects, and in caring for the campus has drawn from them sacrifice in time and effort beyond what was true just a few years ago. That is changing them, and it is changing this place.</i><br><br><i>One of the characteristics of a place where the Savior can come is that there will be no class of people that holds itself above another. Think of how foreign that is to the nature of most university life you have seen....</i><br><br><i>... Students come poor in what they know about things you have worked years to understand. Yet you have welcomed undergraduates into your worlds as partners. That will give them powerful advantages when they go on to graduate school and to employment. But in the process of giving equal value to their contributions when they give all they have, you have changed this place. In the great day when the Master comes, the people will have "all things common" (Acts 2:44; 4:32) and there will be "no poor among them" (Moses 7:18). If I had not seen what I have seen here, I would not have thought that possible in universities, where rank and status have always been so carefully guarded.</i>[Henry B. Eyring, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/henry-b-eyring_consecrated-place/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Consecrated Place</a>," BYU Annual University Conference address, 27 August 2001, 2–3; see also adaptation in<i>BYU Magazine,</i>spring 2002, 3–4]<br><br>Elder Eyring's words suggest to me a unique and particular way in which our community functions. It is a way we have of faculty and students interacting, centered upon scholarship, that has great potential for realizing simultaneous goals of academic and spiritual growth during your time here at BYU. We speak of such interactions as mentoring.<br><br>Mentoring of this nature has been happening at BYU for a long time but recently has become a strong focus in many departments and in a variety of situations in the workplaces of BYU. We have attempted to define and support mentoring in such a fashion as to clearly enhance the learning environment on campus. We have developed a number of principles for mentoring that, if followed, will support our efforts. Two of these principles are particularly pertinent to the topic of strengthening one another spiritually.<br><br>The first of these principles states that "students should have access to faculty for sufficient time to allow development of personal and professional relationships."<br><br>A second principle is even more direct. It notes that "students should be provided opportunity and examples for integration of spiritual and secular understanding."<br><br>These principles suggest an important role for mentors. There is an assumption here that our faculty members and others are exemplars and that time spent in their presence has value. In our academic pursuits this assumption is well accepted; in spiritual matters it is equally true, if less obvious.<br><br>A number of situations bring students and faculty together in addition to classroom experiences: field trips, study abroad, research and creative activities, social visits in homes, and experiences in student wards. In all cases the mentor may act to teach, to train, and to demonstrate gospel principles by example.<br><br>The value of personal relationships and gospel living is further supported by BYU alumni's responses to specific questions about their spiritual experience in the BYU community.<br><br>The BYU Alumni Questionnaire of 1998 Graduates (the most recent available survey) asked past students about ways in which their experiences at BYU affected their lives. The alumni consistently reported significant growth in spiritual matters as a result of interaction with faculty, peers, and other members of the campus community.<br><br>One quote from an anonymous respondent seems to sum up these experiences:<br><br><i>The most significant impact BYU had on my life was the presence of good, intelligent people who lived the gospel. When I began studies at BYU I seriously doubted I could live the way I'd been taught all my life. Professors who bore their testimonies, bishops who understood the specific struggles of that age group, roommates who supported me, and eventually a spouse who loved me kept me going on the path my parents had started</i>[me]<i>on. My life at age 26 definitely wouldn't be the same had I not gone to BYU.</i>[BYU Alumni Questionnaire of 1998 Graduates]<br><br>The positive or negative power of such personal examples cannot be overstated as a critical element of spiritual mentoring. In "Jesus, the Perfect Mentor," an article in the February 2001<i>Ensign,</i>Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed:<br><br><i>Each of us, from time to time, is mentored and has chances to mentor. In my experience, truthful and caring one-liners that occur within such nurturing relationships have a long shelf life! You can probably recount three or four examples of how people have said something--probably a sentence or clause--and you remember it still. It moves and touches you still. Such has been the case with me....</i><br><br><i>How wonderful it is (and we have all had these experiences) when we can gather in circles of friendship large or small with shared gospel values. Sharing is like gathering around conversational bonfires that grow warm and bright against the horizon. You will find the memories of these bonfires will achieve a lastingness--not of what you wore or of what the menu was, but rather because of the shared expressions of love and testimony. Especially helpful are the memories of those individuals and friends who are exemplars for you and me by the manner in which they strive so steadily and unapologetically to wear the whole armor of God.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "Jesus, the Perfect Mentor,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 2001, 8, 16]<br><br>I think you can see just how well Elder Maxwell's characterization of mentoring relates to our mentoring principles and our sense of being exemplars and righteous tutors to one another.<br><br>There is also much to be learned from the life of the Savior about being examples.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball spoke of how Jesus served as an example:<br><br><i>Jesus said several times, "Come, follow me." His was a program of "do what I do," rather than "do what I say." His innate brilliance would have permitted him to put on a dazzling display, but that would have left his followers far behind. He walked and worked with those he was to serve. His was not a long-distance leadership. He was not afraid of close friendships; he was not afraid that proximity to him would disappoint his followers. The leaven of true leadership cannot lift others unless we are with and serve those to be led.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "Jesus: The Perfect Leader,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1979, 5]<br><br>The Savior spoke of "doing" and of being "close." Spiritual mentoring is a contact sport and is most effective when we interact openly with one another. Seek out occasions and situations that allow you to get to know your advisors. It is when you know one another well enough to get past the polite, perfunctory, or impersonal conversations that you can begin to feel the spirit of your mentor.<br><br>To illustrate the role of such a faculty mentor, I invite you to listen to this short film segment featuring Professor Laura Bridgewater of our Microbiology and Molecular Biology Department.<br><br>Dr. Bridgewater hosts a mentoring environment with numerous undergraduates and selected graduate students working together.<br><br>Following her remarks is a brief comment from Lara Lee Claus, a student working on a project in English as a second language with Professor Annela Teemant and others.<br><h2><b>Dr. Laura Bridgewater:</b></h2><br><i>It's great to be in a place where religion can be tied into everything. You don't have to keep it separate because it's not separate. Religion fills every part of our lives. It fills every part of the field of science I work in. And it has been very uplifting and very spiritually strengthening to be able to just bask in that and enjoy it and to talk to students about it. Students come in and talk to me all the time about things,</i>[about]<i>questions they have: "How does this part of science fit with our religion?" I just enjoy so much talking to them. Sometimes I have answers and sometimes I don't. Like I said before, we don't know everything yet. And sometimes it's just helping them understand that it is okay not to know, and we just have to be humble and admit that we don't know and keep trying to learn what we can.</i><br><h2><b>Lara Lee Claus:</b></h2><br><i>One of the things that I noticed right away when I started working with Dr. Teemant is that anytime we'd have a group meeting or a team-type meeting, she would start with a word of prayer. Actually, anytime I saw her working she would start the workday with a word of prayer. She recognized that the project she was working with was much more than all of us working together. We were really asking for help we needed to be able to do the best that we could do. We were asking for extra assistance from Heavenly Father. That has helped me as I have done my work, asking for help for any kind of project that we are working on.</i><br><br>Dr. Bridgewater's words reflect the attitude and intent of many faculty and others to be of service--to be a strengthening influence.<br><br>Lara Lee's reaction to her mentor's use of prayer illustrates the power and the potential of such examples to change lives.<br><br>Lest you nod off while I talk about the role of mentors, let me speak directly to you and to your place in the community.<br><br>The capacity of peers to influence one another is a very significant matter here. You will often find yourselves in the mentor role in various situations at BYU. One such example relates to peer encouragement to prospective missionaries.<br><br>Many of us have observed the phenomenon of young men and women in their first years here choosing to go on missions. It is clear that those who have been on missions or have made up their minds to serve have a profound positive influence upon others who are considering missions. Decisions to accept mission calls are discussed and celebrated with friends and roommates. It is significant to our discussion that by the time students graduate from BYU, most males (about 95 percent) have served missions and close to 30 percent of female students are also returned missionaries. Although many have planned their missions long before they attend BYU, a significant number make the final decision to serve while they are here because of the influence of their peers.<br><br>In our research and creative work environments, experienced students tutor novices in matters of academic disciplines. This same sharing and strengthening between peers is common in spiritual matters as well. The potential of peer-to-peer interactions about spiritual matters is great. As lifelong bonds of friendship and marriage occur, the shared love of the gospel illuminates and empowers us to influence others positively.<br><br>I hope we can see from these examples that our immediate thought--that mentor equals professor or other supervisor and mentee equals student--is an oversimplification that does not recognize the fact that we may each be mentor and mentored, depending on the situation. In reality, the relationship between supervisor and student is not a one-way street, particularly in spiritual matters. Both sides must be actively engaged to gain full benefit from the association. It is true that the giver of spiritual insight most often receives back in kind and more abundantly than he or she gave. It seems to me that our mentoring relationship is one of synergy--a situation where the interaction of two forces has a result that is greater than the sum of the individual efforts and contributions. In our situation the added value comes from the direct intervention and contribution of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>A part of this synergy is often the very nature of the shared scholarship. Listen now to two students. First, hear political science major Chris Winters as he talks of his research project that concerned Latter-day Saints in wartime experiences. His mentors were Robert C. Freeman and Dennis A. Wright.<br><br>After his remarks you will hear from Mike Manookin, who was an undergraduate ORCA scholar here and is now working on a graduate degree in linguistics with Professor Deryle Lonsdale.<br><h2><b>Chris Winters:</b></h2><br><i>I think through the research that I've done that I have gained a deeper appreciation for adversity and the roles that we all have to play on this earth. I look at these stories of veterans and I just see the faith that they had in the trials that they went through, and it helps me individually to aspire to that--to aspire to</i>[that faith]<i>no matter what happens. No matter what situation I am put in or come into, I have the choice to react in a positive way and react in a way that is not only going to build my testimony but also build the testimonies of those with whom I am talking.</i><br><h2><b>Mike Manookin:</b></h2><br><i>The more I learn, the more I realize what I don't know and the more I realize why we have to rely on God for understanding--for real understanding and knowledge. But it also gives me an idea of the beauty of nature--the beautiful world and beautiful minds and bodies that God has given us. To try to understand a question as difficult as cognitive modeling, of how the mind is processing language, really makes you think, "Whoa, how could a human being be so complex, so wonderful, and be able to deal with such complex variables with such speed?" To me that is just a wonderful illustration of our brains, the minds that God has made for us.</i><br><br><i>What I have learned is the Christian principle that we need to learn from one another. We all bring something different to the table. We can all learn different things from each other. It just helped me understand more and more the unique and important aspects that each of us has. We are all unique and important children of God, we all have our unique gifts, and we can all learn from one another. And I think that is really what life is about: learning to be the best that we can be and learning to appreciate other people for the gifts that they have.</i><br><br>Both students speak of growth in the gospel as a result of their research projects and the discussions they had with mentors and peers.<br><br>In our mentoring relationships an interesting interplay is also at work between the responsibilities each of us has for working out our own salvation and the roles of others in our spiritual progress.<br><br>Mike Manookin commented about individual, unique gifts and communal learning. His words echo those recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto the church.</i><br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i><br><br><i>To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:10–14; see also 1 Corinthians 12 and Moroni 10]<br><br>The gifts mentioned are collectively given "unto the church" and by extrapolation to the community we are discussing. However, each individual may receive and hold some of the gifts--both for themselves and for others. There is both individual responsibility and group responsibility at work in the community.<br><br>Earlier I talked about Alma establishing the Church at the Waters of Mormon. He was motivated and instructed by a strong testimony of the Savior. How did he get this testimony? Years later his son Alma the Younger answered with these words:<br><br><i>Behold, I can tell you--did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?</i><br><br><i>And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.</i>[Alma 5:11–12]<br><br>This example points out the principles of gaining from the testimony of others as well as exercising our own faith. Both are needed. It is part of the interplay between individual and group responsibility I identified earlier.<br><br>Let me now summarize what we have discussed today. We are an institution that shares a love for the gospel and an active concern for one another. We influence others as examples of gospel living, as mentors and recipients of mentoring. There are those who have found the gospel here and become one with the Church. Decisions have been made about missions, about temple marriage, and about lifelong commitment to righteousness because of the strengthening influence of others.<br><br>Students bring much to the community. Not only do they provide insights into the research and creative work of the faculty, but they serve as examples, as teachers, and as loving fellow citizens to strengthen us all and to aid in the continual testimony growth of those who constitute the ongoing BYU community. In Elder Eyring's words, "You have changed this place."<br><br>My own association with BYU includes student years and these immediate past 11 years of my academic career. I have shared time with you in the classroom and as a bishop. I have attended student presentations and read your proposals for research and creative work. I am enriched in my own testimony from your examples.<br><br>I had the benefit of some mentoring in my formative years--some at BYU and some elsewhere by people of good character and wisdom, such as Professor Katherine Esau, a noted plant scientist. I believe our current mentoring emphasis would have been of even more value to me in my own spiritual growth had it been available then.<br><br>In closing, I return to the Savior as our example. To the people of the new world He gave instructions about strengthening one another. He reminded them to look to Him as a model. He said: "Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up" (3 Nephi 18:24).<br><br>May we enjoy our time together and take full advantage of opportunities to serve and be blessed by others.

<h1>siness in Babylon - H. Dennis Tolley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago I visited an isolated oasis deep in the Gobi Desert in China. Some 80 miles from the nearest town, the oasis was in a small canyon that had been occupied by a handful of Buddhist monks for hundreds of years. In this incredibly isolated spot, the monks could avoid the temptations of the world and focus only on Buddhist teachings. In Latter-day Saint terms, these monks were trying to flee Babylon.<br><br>Most of us have elected not to dwell in total isolation but to live in the civilized world. This decision requires us to interact daily with the world and to face the challenge of doing business in Babylon even as we attempt to follow the Lord's command to "go . . . out . . . from Babylon, from the midst of wickedness" (D&amp;amp;C 133:14).<br><h2><b>Babylon the Great</b></h2><br>In the scriptures the Lord uses the words<i>Babylon</i>and<i>Zion</i>to refer to two archetypes of our temporal existence.<sup>1</sup>Babylon represents the world, and Zion represents the pure in heart. But how did Babylon become the name for the archetypal rival to Zion?<br><br>The city of Babylon predates Abraham. Located in modern-day southern Iraq, it was a thriving commercial center for more than 17 centuries. At its height it was the capital of a vast empire covering much of the Middle East. In about the fourth century B.C., the splendor and wealth of the city began to fade until, in about the second century A.D., Babylon ceased to exist. By ceased to exist, I mean it disappeared. Only piles of rubble and ruin remained. Until the last century, knowledge of the actual city was preserved only in the Bible and in a few references made by ancient historians.<br><br>In its prime, Babylon had two features that were, at different times, counted among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World--the Hanging Gardens and the city's great exterior walls.<sup>2</sup>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were described as a series of arches arranged in a theater-like manner and ascending to the height of a seven-story building. This construction included 16-foot-long stone beams to bear the weight of the different tiers and a hydraulic system to pump water to the top of the structure, from whence it coursed through the gardens. The stone beams and parts of what scholars believe to be the hydraulic pump system were discovered about 100 years ago.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The ancient historian Herodotus noted that the walls of Babylon were 335 feet high and 85 feet wide. The walls surrounded an approximately square city with a circumference of about 56 miles, according to Herodotus.<sup>4</sup>One could fit BYU, Mapleton, Benjamin, Pleasant Grove, Geneva Steel, and everything in between within the walls described by Herodotus. One could drive two full-sized Hummers side-by-side atop the wall.<br><br>Scholars today believe that the Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar was a walled city the size of New York<sup>5</sup>with a population of 250,000 or more.<sup>6</sup>Scaling down Herodotus' dimensions, modern archaeologists say the walls were actually about five stories tall (about 50 feet)<sup>7</sup>and about 90 feet thick at the base,<sup>8</sup>while the inner city covered an area of about 2,100 acres.<sup>9</sup><br><br>Herodotus also described the great temple Etemenanki, translated as "The House of the Foundations of Heaven and Earth," which many feel was the Tower of Babel.<sup>10</sup>"The sanctuary of the deity, on the top floor, had doors inlaid with ivory and beams lined with gold."<sup>11</sup>From the rubble heap representing the probable site of this great tower, the local residents have been removing the best brick for several centuries to build dams and more modern buildings. Even so, the rubble heap currently is a mound of broken brick and debris approximately seven stories high.<sup>12</sup>Evidence suggests that the tower was approximately 30 stories tall and could be seen from 60 miles away.<sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>The Babylonian Legacy</b></h2><br>A list of contributions of Babylonian culture gives us some sense of our legacy from this empire. Tablets indicate an ability for abstract mathematical thought, with calculations involving serial, exponential, and logarithmic relations. Babylon seems to be the only civilization in ancient times that used a positional system, where the value of a number was determined by its position and not its juxtaposition. Even the Roman system is juxtapositional.<sup>14</sup>The Babylonians were deeply interested in astrology, and their detailed recordings and mathematical extrapolations of the heavens formed the foundation of modern astronomy. If we think of the Greeks as philosophers, we must think of the Babylonians as empiricists.<br><br>The Code of Hammurabi, celebrated as one of the first written codes of law, originated sometime in the 18th century B.C. with the great king Hammurabi. The property stake and personal seals, keeping track of who owned what, originated in Babylon.<sup>15</sup>Babylonian business was based on the notion of private property. King Nebuchadnezzar instituted a monetary system based on the silver standard so that all could do business together throughout the empire. We also find in Babylon the notion of interest rates. These rates were simple interest rates for short periods of time and entailed an involved penalty system that amounted to compound interest over longer periods of time. This system is very similar to that used by banks today.<sup>16</sup><br><br>It seems that Babylon was the first empire where anyone could do business and where the business of the king was business itself. It was a place where religious temples and sects were active in commerce to the point that commerce became part of the religion. As in previous empires, there was a marriage of religion and military power to enable a king to rule over many.<sup>17</sup>But a subtle shift took place with Babylon. Power became a commodity that could be obtained through economic success, and laws were built up to protect these successes.<sup>18</sup><br><br>Babylon was an extravagantly beautiful place with numerous gardens and parks. Some people were very rich. Babylon was a commercially successful, seductively exciting place to live and do business.<br><h2><b>Babylon Versus Zion</b></h2><br>The Babylonian empire seems to have initiated many things we now feel are necessary in our everyday business of living. What, then, caused it to reach the stature of an archetypal antithesis of Zion?<br><br>Babylon's status as a foil for Zion seems to be based on more than just wickedness. For out and out wickedness we have other candidates, such as Sodom and Gomorrah. The best assessment of the archetypal Babylon, the one we are admonished to flee, is as described by the Lord in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man</i>walketh in his own way,<i>and after the image of his own god, whose image is</i>in the likeness of the world,<i>and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:16; emphasis added]<br><br>The Babylon I have described seems to have encouraged each individual to walk in his own way, to trust in and be rewarded by the strength of his own arm. It allows one to set up his own image and worship that image through the vitality of his body and the power of his own hand. Indeed, the attainment of power, whether through wealth, priestcraft, or political intrigue, appears to be the mainspring of Babylonian life.<br><br>It is easy for us to identify the debauchery and decadence of Sodom and Gomorrah. Comparing these cities with the teachings of God is like comparing black and white. Babylon, on the other hand, does not offer such a black-and-white comparison. Though we are taught to flee Babylon, the line between Babylon and Zion is much more subtle.<br><br>As we read in Moses 7, the Zion of Enoch had many characteristics in common with Babylon. For example, Zion was a strong military power that "all nations feared greatly" (verse 13). It "did flourish" in the land (verse 17), presumably because of great commercial success. The city of Zion built by Enoch (see verse 19) lasted for 365 years (verse 68).<br><br>However, below the surface, important differences appear. Zion had no poor (see verse 18), while Babylon made individual wealth and power the goal of all. The people of Zion were "of one heart" (verse 18), while Babylon was a collection of individuals, each optimizing his or her own circumstances.<br><br>The key difference between Zion and Babylon is in their foundational premises. By "foundational premises" I mean the very core postulates one uses. The fundamental premise of anyone who "walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god" is power for self. Phrases typifying this premise include<i>mine, it belongs to me, I did it my way,</i>and<i>I deserve it.</i>To operate with this power premise is to operate in Babylon. For some the power sought is simply survival; for others it is wealth; and for others it is to have dominion over people and things.<br><br>At the other end of this scale is the Zion premise of stewardship. It is based on beliefs and convictions that Heavenly Father loves us, that His Son has provided the Atonement, and that all we have is His. Phrases that spring to mind describing the Zion premise are<i>giving, sharing, loving,</i>and<i>purity of heart.</i><br><h2><b>Premises in the University</b></h2><br>How does this apply to a student at BYU? First, what is a university about? Famed economist E. F. Schumacher states that "the key factor of all economic development comes out of the mind of man. . . . In a very real sense, therefore, we can say that education is the most vital of all resources."<sup>19</sup>Education at a university entails learning to engage two types of problems. The first is the convergent problem.<br><br>Convergent problems are ones for which a rational answer can be obtained through logic and scientific research. I teach statistics at BYU, and in my courses the problems have explicit answers. If you work hard enough, you can get them. And you know when you have the right answer (despite what some of my students say). Convergent problems can be solved by the rational use of your five senses. Scientific experiments gather data to address specific hypotheses. These hypotheses represent convergent problems. Sometimes we don't obtain enough data, so we must make a leap to arrive at a conclusion. But, in principle, with enough time and money, we can solve any convergent problem.<br><br>The second type of problem we engage at the university is the divergent problem. Divergent problems entail resolving irreconcilable differences. There is no absolute, correct answer based on logic and formulas alone. By their definition, these are problems for which a rational or logical solution cannot be universally derived; different people will come to different solutions. Current examples are seen in the debates over cloning and stem-cell research.<br><br>Divergent problems cannot be solved simply by the logical application of the data we get from our five senses. There is an additional ingredient needed to resolve the irreconcilable issues. We might call this ingredient assumptions, postulates, or axioms. Whatever we call it, it is a set of fundamental premises or values we hold at the very center of our being. In the end, solutions to the divergent problems rest on our individual premises, our deep-down values. We may present our solutions to divergent problems with a dialectic charm that would warm Aristotle's heart. Our logic may be tight, and our thinking may be impeccable. Nevertheless, fundamentally we must use our basic premises to complete the resolution of any divergent problem.<br><br>Most problems we encounter in life contain both convergent and divergent components. It is our premises at the center of our being that give us the ability to solve the divergent aspects of these problems. If these premises are based on moral beliefs, they are called moral values. People may be without moral values, but they still must have a set of premises that they use to resolve divergent problems.<br><br>Happily, many BYU students have been prepared to form moral premises. This preparation has come from the teaching of parents, Sunday School classes, sacrament meeting talks, seminary courses, scripture reading, and private tutorials received from the Holy Ghost. However, a great number of students do not recognize that they have at the center of their being the ingredients to form these premises. They lack confidence that the truths they learned in Young Men and Young Women classes are in fact worthy of being their premises for solving the problems of life.<br><br>Let's try a few divergent problems. Is claiming personal bankruptcy an acceptable method of attaining financial stability? Most of us have learned of examples on either side. I heard a rumor describing individuals who plan to claim bankruptcy every seven years, and they schedule credit-based purchases accordingly. I have also heard of young couples shackled with huge debts from medical emergencies for which they could not even begin to pay the interest. Most personal bankruptcy cases fall between these extremes. Though the financial planners have data-driven models on the cost of such bankruptcies and on the amount of extra premiums that should be attached to each individual credit purchase, these models do not answer the primary question. No amount of data and sophisticated financial modeling will provide an answer. Additional premises must be used to reach a conclusion.<br><br>Should you date individuals who do not belong to the Church? How close a friendship should you maintain with those who do not live up to your standards? Should you seek a temple marriage? What kind of dress should you wear to the prom or to your wedding reception after the temple ceremony? There are arguments on both sides of these issues. These arguments appear logical because they are. But these problems are divergent, and the different arguments rest fundamentally on different premises. Your solution depends on your premises.<br><br>At BYU the faculty members help students solidify their fundamental premises and assist them in implementing these premises in addressing divergent problems. We do that by first teaching solutions to convergent problems and then linking these problem-solving techniques to a general syllogism that can be applied to the divergent problems of life. We examine case studies of problems that have both convergent and divergent pieces. Students learn how a variety of divergent problems have been solved in the past and where the premises fundamental to their solution enter.<br><br>I remember taking a history class at BYU in which we reviewed some of the many quotes by Christopher Columbus attesting to his belief that he was inspired in his discovery of the New World. My professor was a great scholar on Columbus and reviewed with care and precision what was written and what scholars believed and why. He also referred to the well-known passage in 1 Nephi 13:12, but he read it exactly, imputing no additional meaning. We had the data and the scholarly view. We had the premises by which the scholars had reached their conclusions. With care and tenderness, the professor then showed us how his personal premises allowed him to embrace Columbus' testimonial and to thank Heavenly Father for guiding the explorer. I could see how my premises were at the core of the solution, and I could enjoy the facts and appreciate the scholar's view.<br><br>The principal asset of an economy, a source of educated individuals who can solve problems, has been referred to as human capital. Many believe that such human capital is the basis for growth in technology and economic productivity as well as the basis for solving the ecological and social problems of mankind. To contribute to the human capital of society, students must be capable of solving both convergent and divergent problems. They must have established a set of premises and the ability to use them. If these premises are those of a steward of God, the individuals could be referred to not simply as human capital but as Zion capital.<br><h2><b>Two Kinds of Education</b></h2><br>Thus we have two kinds of university education--Zion's and Babylon's. In both, the syllogisms, formal logic, and mathematical equations for convergent problems are the same. The tools used in putting together rational arguments are the same. In either case, one studies a selection of divergent problems and how they were resolved. But the underlying premises are very different. The Babylonian bachelor's degree holder will base his or her premises on self-interest and trust in the arm of flesh. The Zion bachelor's degree holder will use the principles of stewardship in Zion as premises, and he or she will praise God for the trust of such a stewardship.<br><br>Maintaining your premises in school and in business and not adopting those of a Babylonian business associate requires constant attention. There is a powerful temptation to use the Babylonian premises at certain times and Zion premises at other times, particularly on Sunday. Why? Because the way of Babylon appears successful. There is glitz and excitement. It looks fun. After all, can't we use our wealth to build Zion, regardless of our premises?<br><br>Like entropy, the Babylonian temptation is always pushing us. Starting out with the right set of premises is only the beginning. We must keep track of our fundamental premises, the ones God has helped us form as we have pondered the scriptures, participated in church activity, and prayed for guidance. But this requires constant attention. We can practice here at BYU, where many of the faculty--Latter-day Saints or not--have formed wholesome premises at their very center. I know that there are endowed faculty members who have sought guidance in the development of these premises in the celestial room of the temple. Such faculty would never enter "tutored by God" on their résumé. Such an experience is too dear. But this gift is so wonderful that each faculty member so blessed is anxious to share it with students.<br><br>We may draw a parallel to the Lord's parable of the wheat and the tares discussed in Doctrine and Covenants 86:<br><br><i>The field was the world, and the apostles were the sowers of the seed;</i><br><br><i>And after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign--behold he soweth the tares; wherefore,</i>the tares choke the wheat and drive the church into the wilderness. [D&amp;amp;C 86:2–3; emphasis added]<br><br>Enticing us to adopt the premises of Babylon is a subtle strategy Satan uses to sow tares. Individuals who take the premises of Babylon as their fundamental basis for solving the divergent problems of life, of business, or of everyday activity are tares. Their logic may be consistent, but at the root, the solutions are based on premises that Satan has provided. Though they may resemble wheat in the early years, their genetic code--their core premises for growth--yields a poisonous outcome. The Lord continues in section 86:<br><br><i>Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields;</i><br><br><i>But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender . . . lest you destroy the wheat also.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat . . . the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 86:5–7]<br><br>Before you decide that you are genetically programmed to be a Babylonian scholar or businessman, remember that the good news of the gospel is that your heart--and your premises--can be changed by the Savior. Whereas we may feel programmed to be a tare, we can overcome this.<br><br>May we all form our premises based on God's teachings and have the courage to implement these premises in problem solving. One can't help but speculate what would have happened to Enron, WorldCom, and Andersen Consulting had each of these organizations had more Zion capital around the corporate tables. A steward representing Zion capital would have seen that misrepresenting earnings and losses does not create overall surplus. It only creates the illusion of gain. Creating such an illusion may result in profit-taking opportunities for the Babylonian businessman but does no good for the steward in Zion.<br><br>The environment on this campus is provided for students to master the convergent tools and learn to use this mastery in bringing Zion premises to focus on daily problems at home, at the office, and in the community.<br><br>May we follow the Lord's teachings and take the precious time we have here at this university to develop the tools we need to create Zion capital in us.<br><br><i>H.

<h1>Ever After: Lessons from Joseph Smith, Lehi, and the Recent Accounting Scandals - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The title of my remarks is "Happily Ever After." If you don't remember anything else that I say, please remember the following three points:<br><br>1. "Happily every after" does NOT happen without continuing effort.<br><br>2. We should not get discouraged when our careful plans and solutions don't always lead to calm, clear sailing.<br><br>3. Don't assume that the lives of those around you are cloudless and sunny just because the sun is shining where you are.<br><h2><b>The Causes of and the Responses to the Recent Accounting Scandals</b></h2><br>I teach accounting. I love accounting. The corporate accounting scandals of the past couple of years have generated both good news and bad news for accountants. The bad news is that the entire field of accounting has now been tainted. For example, the name Arthur Andersen, which for 89 years represented professionalism and excellence, is now the punch line of late-night comedians' monologue jokes. And in my own home there has been a subtle but troubling increase in scrutiny from my children when asking me for lunch money or for payment for household jobs. They will still take a check from my wife, but, with my being tainted by this whole accounting thing, my credit rating is down in their eyes, and they prefer to receive payment from me in cash!<br><br>The silver lining for accountants in all of this is that everyone has been reminded how important accounting and accountants are. Without accurate, timely, and unbiased financial reports, our capitalist system just doesn't work very well. For example, without reliable financial reports, bankers are more uncertain about the ability of a company to repay a loan; this increased lender's risk makes it harder for companies, especially small companies, to get loans. In addition, the crisis in investor confidence sparked by the relentless barrage of accounting scandals in 2001 and 2002 helped lower stock values in the United States by over 20 percent, eliminating more than $2 trillion in wealth for U.S. investors. Those of you who have dismissed accountants as "bean counters" must now acknowledge that those are pretty important beans.<br><br>What were the underlying causes of these accounting scandals? Among the many candidates, let me mention two: (1) greed and (2) bad accounting rules.<br><br>Greed has been with us for a long time. In Moses 5 we read that Cain learned from his mentor, Satan, that he might "murder and get gain" (Moses 5:31). After Cain slew his brother Abel, he gloried in what he had accomplished and said: "I am free; surely the flocks of my brother falleth into my hands" (Moses 5:33). With his ill-gotten wealth, Cain saw himself as being financially free from money worries. But this feeling of freedom was almost surely short-lived. Greed is insatiable, and it probably was not long before Cain looked with envy on other flocks and fields. In fact, his greed ensured that he would never be financially free.<br><br>With the accounting scandals we have seen greed in the corporate board room, greed among bankers who have knowingly financed some pretty unsavory plans, and greed among employees who have been more than willing to turn a blind eye to rampant corporate deceit because that deceit was helping to boost the values of the employees' shares in their company 401(k) retirement plans. We have seen greed among the auditors who didn't blow the whistle on financial reporting fraud for fear of losing the business of lucrative clients. We have seen greed from attorneys who chalked up many billable hours advising their corporate clients how to carefully structure their deceptive financial dealings--and who have chalked up even more billable hours helping to clean up the mess that they helped create in the first place.<br><br>For government regulators and a concerned business community eager to "fix" the corporate accounting scandals, greed is not a very promising target. Greed is with us for the long haul and cannot be legislated or regulated out of existence. So if greed can't be eliminated, the next alternative is to improve accounting rules and auditing practices. The most visible result of this effort is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed by Congress in 2002. The provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley include, for example, requirements that all large companies in the United States develop a code of executive ethics and that the head of each company personally vouch for the reliability of the company's financial reports. In addition to Sarbanes-Oxley, the detailed accounting rules governing U.S. companies have been actively reexamined in order to close the loopholes that the accounting scandals revealed.<br><br>The hope in all of this is that the accounting problems will be solved once and for all and that the U.S. business community can live happily ever after. This is wishful thinking. Sarbanes-Oxley and the individual efforts of good business people and accountants around the country have made things better. But let's not kid ourselves; there will be more accounting scandals. The underlying problem of greedy managers still exists, and these managers will find ways to circumvent and exploit any set of accounting rules.<br><br>So, is there no hope? Of course there is hope,<i>if</i>we remember that "happily every after" doesn't happen through a single event, a single Congressional act, or a one-time overhaul of the accounting rules. The economic environment evolves, creative accountants cook up new ways to deceive, and a new generation of investors forgets the expensive lessons of the past. Accordingly, Congress, the regulators, and the accounting profession have to actively seek out and solve new problems as they arise. We make a mistake by getting discouraged when a past answer proves unable to satisfy all future questions. Life is about learning from the past and then relishing the opportunity to generate new answers to new questions as they arise. Ultimately the reliability of our financial reports will be greatly enhanced by our experiences with Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen, and the rest--not so much by the one-time corrections made in direct response to the scandals but more through continuing application of the lessons learned from them.<br><br>We see this important point--that "happily ever after" is a continuing process and not the result of a one-time event--illustrated over and over in the scriptures. Let me give you some of my favorite examples.<br><h2><b>Joseph Smith</b></h2><br>As a 14-year-old boy in 1820, Joseph Smith had what he thought was a fairly straightforward question to ask the Lord. In his history Joseph mentioned three religious denominations that were predominant in the area in which he lived. He wanted to know which of those three he should join. I believe that Joseph wanted to join one of these churches and then to live "happily ever after." Instead, he was told that he "must join none of them" (JS--H 1:19). Not only did Joseph not get a final resolution to the "which church is right" question, but now he had the added challenge of ridicule because he affirmed that he had seen a vision.<br><br>Three years later Joseph again went to the Lord with a straightforward request, as follows:<br><br><i>After I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.</i>[JS--H 1:29]<br><br>Joseph simply wanted to know where he stood with the Lord, and he certainly wasn't expecting a visit from Moroni to tell him of "a book deposited, written upon gold plates" (JS--H 1:34)<br><br>The life of Joseph Smith seems to be a series of these unforeseeable developments, each of which Joseph had to accept on faith without fully understanding where it would lead--from New York to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois to martyrdom. And when Joseph cried out to the Lord to better understand his rocky path, he was told:<br><br><i>Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:7–9]<br><br>What can we learn from Joseph's experiences? Yes, he did live "happily ever after," but he had to wrestle with scoffers and false brethren and wickedness and laziness and disbelief until his death. And I suspect he is facing some of these same challenges in his continuing ministry beyond the grave. How foolish, and tragic, it would have been for Joseph to have given up in discouragement in 1825 because his heavenly manifestations in answer to prayer in 1820 and 1823 had not removed all of his life's challenges.<br><h2><b>Lehi</b></h2><br>Father Lehi lived in a time of great wickedness in the city of Jerusalem. In 2 Chronicles we read the following about the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah:<br><br><i>He</i>[Zedekiah]<i>did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God. . . .</i><br><br><i>Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers. . . .</i><br><br><i>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</i>[2 Chronicles 36:12–16]<br><br>In these frightful circumstances, Lehi prayed unto the Lord for his people--his family, his friends, and all of the people of Jerusalem (see 1 Nephi 1:5) As any of us would, I'm sure Lehi hoped that the Lord would direct him how to "fix" this problem once and for all. As any of us would be, Lehi was willing to do whatever the Lord directed. Well, what the Lord directed did not turn out to be a one-time "fix" but instead resulted in a lifetime of preaching, teaching, and traveling. Years later, in his new home in the promised land, across the sea thousands of miles from Jerusalem, Lehi must have looked back and smiled at the completely unexpected way in which that initial prayer was answered: he was called to preach to a murderously wicked people in Jerusalem; instructed to flee into the wilderness with his family, then to travel across the most barren section of the Saudi Arabian peninsula led by a mysterious compass; and then to trust the fate of his family to an ocean voyage on a boat built by a first-time shipbuilder named Nephi.<br><br>Yes, Lehi did live "happily ever after." However, remember that this was not without relentless effort. Lehi and his party were faced with the lack of food, and this problem wasn't solved once and for all when Nephi made his new bow and arrows. Lehi sorrowed because of the rebelliousness of Laman and Lemuel, and he had to watch them repent and then rebel again and again, but he continued preaching to his wayward sons right to the end.<br><br>Lehi knew that there is no end to the works of the Lord (see Moses 1:38), and so there is no end to the work of His servants. Lehi pressed forward with faith in the answer to the prayer that he offered in 1 Nephi 1:14: "Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! . . . And, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!" Lehi did come unto the Lord, and because he continued to come to the Lord throughout his life, in spite of unforeseen hardship and discouragement he lived "happily ever after."<br><h2><b>The Family of the Prodigal Son</b></h2><br>In Luke we read Christ's beautiful parable of the prodigal son. The parable concludes as follows:<br><br><i>And he</i>[the father]<i>said unto him</i>[the elder brother],<i>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</i><br><br><i>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</i>[Luke 15:31–32]<br><br>Now this is a "happily ever after" conclusion if I have ever heard one--the prodigal is back, the elder brother has been gently shown the error of his ways, and the father has his two sons. But let's continue with the scene. That night, after the fatted-calf leftovers have been put away in the refrigerator, everyone falls into a peaceful sleep. They arise the next morning. Is there anything left to be done? Well, let's consider each of the three main characters. The prodigal himself has made great strides by humbling himself and returning to the house of his father, but a huge amount of follow-through remains to be done. The prodigal has to settle down, show some responsibility, and work long and hard in those fields by the side of his elder brother. The elder brother has been taught an important lesson by his father, but resentment doesn't disappear overnight. Forever after, when there isn't sufficient money to hire enough laborers or to buy new tools, he must stop his mind from thinking back on the family savings bundled up, hauled off, and wasted by his younger brother. As he makes himself serve his younger brother, day by day he will see toleration of his brother grow into appreciation into friendship into love. And what about the father? Maybe he needs to be more aware of showing outward gratitude to his older son, who has worked in the fields faithfully these many years.<br><br>The return of the prodigal son is just the beginning, not the end. There will be bumps in the road as the father and his two sons implement, for the rest of eternity, the lessons they learned on that joyous day when the prodigal returned. And those bumps won't be so troubling if the three of them remember that "happily ever after" means happily dealing with the inevitable bumps that we encounter.<br><br>Now think of some of those "happily ever after" moments in our lives: temple marriage, the arrival of a child, receiving a mission call, or the baptism of a child or a new convert. The joy at these moments is almost overwhelming. But in this joy are the seeds of danger if we have unrealistic expectations about what will come next. Write yourself a note--on your hand, in your day planner, or in your PalmPilot--reminding yourself that the innocent joy we are bathed in during these "happily ever after" moments is supposed to recede, just a little, so that we can roll up our sleeves and get to work. Savor the joy of the moment, but be realistically prepared for the ups and downs that surely lie ahead.<br><br>Let me illustrate what I mean by talking about the joy associated with the arrival of a child. Some of you have experienced the joy of holding a newborn son or daughter in the hospital. The joy is no less when you hold an adopted child for the first time. If your life were a movie, this is a moment when the music would swell, the image would grow soft and slowly fade, and words in a beautiful flowing script would appear on the screen: "And they lived happily ever after."<br><br>Stop the music and let's think about this for a moment. First of all, there is a 50-50 chance that the child in your arms is a little boy. More likely than not, that little boy is going to have an inexplicable fascination with fire and with sharp sticks. He is going to be able to create a blowtorch or a bomb out of common household supplies. I know this from personal experience with my own two sons. And I'm not going to list the common household supplies that can be used for explosive purposes because half the audience, the men, will remember nothing else from my talk except that list. So, back to holding that little boy and the "happily ever after" moment, we realize that it isn't going to be a totally smooth "happily ever after."<br><br>Yes, but what if the child is a little girl? Well, that will bring its own set of challenges--much more complex than the straightforward foolishness perpetrated by little boys. For one thing, that little girl may very well bring home one of those little boys one day, convinced that he should be her eternal companion. And in the meantime she will jam up your home phone lines, no matter how many there are, with conversations that started in school that day, that continue into the night by phone, and that will be resumed in school the next day. These are truly 24-7 conversations.<br><br>Rearing a child--boy or girl--is hard. Serving as a full-time missionary, out on the streets day in and day out, is hard. Being married and learning to set aside your selfishness for the good of the eternal partnership is hard. And we sometimes make these precious activities harder by unreasonably believing that we are failures unless every day of our lives is an error-free, fun-filled extravaganza that is leading on a straight course, without any dips or turbulence, directly to the celestial kingdom. Sometimes there are dips. Sometimes there is a substantial amount of turbulence. Dips and turbulence are normal and are not signs of personal weakness of character.<br><br>As an example of turbulence, allow me to give a brief synopsis of the history of family scripture reading in the Stice home. My wife, Ramona, and I have seven children. We have used a wide variety of approaches to family scripture reading over the years. We have used individualized reading charts (I love charts), colored pictures, and scripture discussion rather than just reading. We have done the traditional one-verse-at-a-time sequential reading circle. We have read sitting up at the breakfast table, and we have read with people sprawled in various postures on the family-room couches and floor. I have heard many verses read by sleepy, muffled voices barely able to escape from under thick blankets on a cold winter morning.<br><br>With all of this experience, one would think that the Stice family has finally got this scripture reading thing down and that we can proceed "happily ever after." Well, two months ago we added two new little girls to our family. It had been 12 years since we had last changed a diaper. Now, with these two babies at once, we feel like we are changing three or four hundred diapers a day. To put it mildly, our family routine has been thrown for a loop. Once again we are regrouping to work out the logistics for family scripture reading. Sure, there is a little frustration because we are back dealing with an issue that I thought we had settled once and for all. I thought that, as far as family scripture reading goes, we were going to live "happily ever after." And we will live "happily ever after" as we cooperate to enlarge our family circle and include two new babies in our scripture reading. (I wonder how these little girls will feel about charts?)<br><br>Our experience with family scripture reading also illustrates that this continuous, patient effort to make sure that we do live "happily ever after" pays off. A couple of years ago my daughter Ryan was invited to a party. From the description of the activities that were planned for this party, it was clear to her that the standards outlined in the<i>For the Strength of Youth</i>pamphlet were not going to be followed. She reports that the first thought that came into her mind was the following: "I can't go to a party like that; my family reads the scriptures in the morning."<br><br>I would like to make one concluding point. Just as it is important for us to remember that "happily ever after" is an ongoing process for us, we should also remember that it is an ongoing process for everyone we meet. This is hard to remember because people don't tend to go out of their way to show us the storms and struggles in their lives. Our optimism and faith about our ability to deal with our own challenges sometimes makes us overly philosophical about the challenges faced by others.<br><br>To illustrate this point, I will tell you a sailing story. My wife's brother Ray had a 20-foot sailboat that he kept on Lake Ontario in upstate New York. He consented to my accompanying him on a cruise from Braddock's Bay, a little west of Rochester, to Sodus Bay, about 30 miles east of Rochester. We set out on a beautiful, sunny summer morning. The winds were coming lightly out of the west, and to my inexperienced eye it looked like a perfect day for sailing. However, because the winds had been steady out of the west for several days, the surface of the lake was undulating in long, lazy swells.<br><br>After a couple of hours of rhythmically going up and down and up and down, I became seasick and was growing increasingly apathetic about this cruise, this boat, and large bodies of water in general. Ray saw the signs of distress and wisely put me to work manning the rudder. I had to be alert because the long swells had a tendency to push the back of the boat (the stern, I guess a real sailor would say) to the right (okay, starboard). This would put us crossways to the swells, slowing our progress and, in my novice opinion, threatening to tip us over.<br><br>I gallantly manned my post at the rudder until, to my mild surprise, the rudder came loose from its attachment points on the stern of the boat. I pulled the wooden rudder up into the boat and intelligently called to Ray: "Is this supposed to come loose like this?" He had been relaxing, sunning himself on the foredeck, but the sight of me holding up the rudder spurred him to frantic action. He scrambled back to me, grabbed the rudder, and leaned out over the stern to try to reattach the thing. His haste stemmed from the fact that we were only about 300 yards from shore, and those gentle, lazy swells were now driving the rudderless sailboat inexorably toward the rocks.<br><br>I remember those anxious moments very well. There wasn't anything that I could do to help, so I had plenty of time to look around and think. Looming large in my thoughts was the fact that I didn't know how to swim. I looked around at the lake and the shore. I was struck by what a beautiful day it was. We were close enough to the shore that I could see people pulled off the road having picnics. I thought that they were probably chewing on a nice chicken drumstick, looking out at us with envy, saying, "Wow, look at those two guys out on that sailboat. What a beautiful day for a sail." Meanwhile, a short distance away, there we were on the boat fighting for our lives.<br><br>Well, we lived. Ray fixed the rudder. We made it to Sodus Bay, where we spent two days living on the boat, riding out a storm, and exploring. But we had been in real danger when that rudder came loose. And the fact that other people were happily picnicking just 300 yards away, admiring our sailboat, didn't lessen our danger at all. So, if your life is currently in the picnic phase and all things are going well, don't assume that all is well in those pretty sailboats that surround you. The sun may be shining, but the people in those boats could still be in extreme danger. And they may not feel comfortable coming out on deck and shouting for help. Sometimes our personal optimism causes us to overlook the real struggles that are going on in the lives of people right next to us.<br><br>To summarize, allow me to review my three main points.<br><br>1. "Happily every after" does<i>not</i>happen without continuing effort. For example, the financial reporting system in the United States has been improved because of the recent accounting scandals, but regulators, accountants, and the investing public must be forever watchful to counteract the development of new techniques for fraud and accounting deception.<br><br>2. We should not get discouraged when our careful plans and solutions don't always lead to calm, clear sailing. Joseph Smith, Lehi, and even the Stice family have learned that "happily ever after" means pressing forward with faith, not discouragement, while experiencing life's unforeseeable twists and turns.<br><br>3. Don't assume that the lives of those around you are cloudless and sunny just because the sun is shining where you are. Look up from your own peaceful picnic and be sensitive to the Spirit to tell you which of those nearby sailboats could really use some help.<br><br>May we all live "happily ever after" is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Earl K. Stice was a BYU professor of accounting when this devotional address was delivered on 27 May 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ness Versus Selfishness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is nice to be here with you again. As I contemplated what I ought to say to you here and now, the thoughts that came into my mind were basically the same thoughts I talked about 22 years ago on October 27, 1981. None of you would have been here to hear that talk, so I feel justified in repeating some of the same material.<br><br>When I was a student here, I used to attend the devotionals and listen to great men and women give powerful messages. I couldn't imagine then how they could possibly do it. I still can't imagine it.<br><br>I received a call to serve as a missionary, and then after my mission I had a military obligation. I married and began to raise a family and never did get back to complete my formal education.<br><br>I believe it is possible for a person to become educated without necessarily being schooled, but I have grieved over the fact that I was not able to get more formal education. I have struggled with a compensatory effort to overcome that problem. I have not always succeeded, and so in many ways I am still unschooled. If it were not for the powers of heaven helping to educate me, it would be most difficult to carry on with my assignments. I recommend education to you with all my heart. I congratulate you for being here.<br><br>Asking your attention and patience, I will attempt to convey some thoughts that have come to me.<br><br>If the veil that covers our remembrance of our premortal past were somehow lifted, we could see ourselves in that glorious assembly where our Eternal Father presented to us the plan for our salvation and exaltation.<br><br>How long it took I do not know--the time does not matter. What matters is that it really happened. It must have been a most interesting time. I suppose there were some anxious moments as one thing built upon another. There must have been intense emotion and anticipation while waiting for the next part to unfold. Think of the pondering and discussion. Father was about His work, teaching us how to exercise our agency by unfolding truth to our understanding.<br><br>As these truths did unfold, there must have been many questions and concerns on our part about the creation of the earth, leaving our Father's presence, our need for physical bodies, the veil, living by faith, symbolic ordinances, death, the Resurrection, and the conditions upon which our return to our Father was based.<br><br>We must have understood some very basic principles then. We must have been able to see that all living things are designed to reproduce after their own kind, that as children of an eternal Father--the seed of a god, if you will--it is our nature to grow and develop into eternal beings with the potential to become like He is. There must have been anxiety on our part when we learned of the need to leave our Father, come to this earth, and have a veil of forgetfulness cover our minds. How would we know what to do or how to do it? And then there would be opposition, choices to make, and the possibility of mistakes and failure.<br><br>It must have been a great comfort as our Heavenly Father made covenants with us to send one of His counselors to be a guide and companion--one of His counselors with delegated power to communicate the truths of the plan to us, that by the power of spiritual communication we could know how to make correct decisions so as to mature after the nature of the species of our Father, who is a god. We know this great counselor as the Holy Ghost.<br><br>As our Father taught us, a pattern began to unfold. It must have become obvious that there would be many things we could not do for ourselves. Someone would have to serve us.<br><br>After its creation, it would not be possible for us to control this world upon which we were to be placed. The earth's delicate environment would have to have a unique relationship to the sun, would need rain and fertile soil to sustain life, would have governing laws of gravity and electricity, and would be subject to the requirements of the elements and their reactions to each other. Someone would have to control these things for us.<br><br>A sense of calmness and peace with the Father's plan must have come to us as He made covenants to give us His other counselor. He would have power to do all these things for us that we could not do for ourselves.<br><br>We would not be able to provide for ourselves the physical bodies we would need to become like Father. Someone would need to serve us by being parents--mothers and fathers.<br><br>We would not have power during our infancy to sustain ourselves. Someone would have to serve us. The basic unit to provide this service, the family, was outlined to our understanding and put into place in our behalf.<br><br>We learned that the physical bodies we would receive would be temporary and would be subject to weakness, disease, and, finally, death. If we were to return to our Heavenly Father with bodies like His--glorified, sanctified, celestialized bodies--someone would have to do something for us, something we could not do for ourselves and something that would reunite our spirit bodies with our physical bodies after the pattern in which God our Father created us.<br><br>There were some other serious needs. It would have been clear to us that because of the influence of opposition, we would make mistakes. Because Father had taught us that these mistakes constituted sin, that sin could not be tolerated by Him, and that no sinful thing could return to His presence, we were then faced with a dilemma. There would have to be a way to overcome these mistakes. Someone would have to intercede for our sins. A need for a redeemer became very clear to us. Who would it be?<br><br>It was then that Satan came before the Father and uttered the most selfish of all statements ever spoken in the heavens: "Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1).<br><br>It was then that the most selfless of all service in the heavens or upon the earth was offered as Christ the "Beloved Son, which was ... Beloved and Chosen from the beginning," came before Father and said, "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2).<br><br>By holy covenant between the Father and His children, Jesus Christ was sent to serve us in all things--to do all things for us that we could not do for ourselves.<br><br>The laws and the covenants were clear to us. They required that we come to this earth to work through the natural process of growth and maturing that will take us back to Father. We must work through this process to become like He is and live the type of life He lives. The work is one of serving and being served. The pattern is clear.<br><br>Happiness in this life can only be obtained by establishing the proper balance between serving and being served. We are social beings. We cannot live in happiness if we attempt to live alone. Self-imposed celibacy and isolationism is an extreme expression of selfishness and an unwillingness to serve or be served. Our eternal destiny is welded to the destiny of our fellows. The very nature of our existence is interdependence on one another.<br><br>A mother serves by giving birth to a child and continues in its service until the child grows to independence. For life to continue, the process must repeat itself. When one is serving, another is being served in turn--and simultaneously. Faith, love of God and fellowman, patriotism, and self-esteem all depend on how we practice serving and being served.<br><br>Perhaps this principle is best understood if referred to as selflessness. Selflessness is the giving of oneself in the serving of others and the giving of oneself in being served by others. Selflessness is a marvelous virtue. It embraces the true spirit of companionship. It is the very essence of friendship. It is the portrayer of true love and oneness in humanity.<br><br>Fundamental to our individuality is agency. The divinely given and heaven-protected gift of agency allows us to determine our own balance of selflessness. How and to what degree we serve others and allow them to serve us is our choice.<br><br>In infancy and childhood we are predominantly served. Our parents provide us with food, clothing, and shelter and nourish our spirits with love and companionship that gives us a sense of belonging and security. We develop kindred ties as we accept from them this service. The very act of our accepting it is, in and of itself, a returning of the gift to the giver. Parents find joy and comfort in participating in the care and training that brings about the maturity and integrity of the adolescent and then the adult. Their joy is consistent with the progress of the child. It falters only when their service is rejected, when disobedience occurs. Nevertheless, the very nature of selflessness keeps parents giving of themselves in spite of the setbacks.<br><br>A time always comes when our level of maturity dictates that we, as individuals, must seek for ourselves expanded experiences and companionships. If the ties we have made as children with our parents have had the proper balance of selflessness, we will have developed a kindred that no physical separation can ever break. There will be an unspoken understanding of oneness. Even with physical separation, each will maintain the joy and spiritual companionship that has been created. This oneness is an eternal happiness. It is the product of selflessness.<br><br>Often as young adults move away from the home environment for employment or to further their education, they suffer a tremendous emotional shock. Suddenly the balance of service and being served is drastically altered. Companionships are new and unproven. A feeling of love and unity has not yet been developed. Old relationships seem distant. We call this period of adjustment and growth homesickness.<br><br>Parent-child relationships turn into teacher-student or boss-employee relationships. Associations change from a kindred to a peer relationship. As this is happening, it is so important to understand the principles of selflessness.<br><br>To understand selflessness we must also understand its opposite: selfishness. Selfishness is closing the door of service to others and disallowing others to serve us in love while at the same time we attempt to serve ourselves or wrongly exact service from people.<br><br>There is no happiness in selfishness. It is a sin. Its product is misery and loneliness. It alienates companions and develops enmity in human relationships.<br><br>Selfishness and greed, put into the heart of Cain by Satan, caused our first parents, Adam and Eve, to mourn before the Lord for him and his brethren.<br><br>It was Cain's selfishness that caused him to bind himself up to Satan and, to get gain, murder his brother Abel. Selfishness inclined the children of Israel toward their indulgences as they drank and played and corrupted themselves around the idol of the golden calf.<br><br>Selfishness is the basic substance--the raw material, if you will--out of which is produced almost all other sins that Satan has introduced upon the earth.<br><br>Under his skillful management this insidious element manifests itself in such a myriad of ways that almost no one escapes its influence.<br><br>In its subtlety it can camouflage itself to the senses of man with such proficiency that he is often oblivious to its presence.<br><br>Its magnetic tentacles stretch out and draw to itself every indulgence that can block man on his quest for exaltation.<br><br>Greed, envy, covetousness, lust, rebellion, thievery, idleness, lying, hypocrisy, falseness, backsliding, immorality, infidelity, pride, arrogance, gluttony, and most other evils are drawn to selfishness as though it were music from the flute of the Pied Piper.<br><br>If we place sin in the sunlight, it will cast the shadow of selfishness. In its simplest form selfishness is the retaining to oneself that which one has the power to give away in benevolence. To some this sounds innocent, almost justifiable, but the truth is that it soon creates people whose "hearts are not satisfied [and] obey not the truth, but have pleasure in unrighteousness." It creates people who "will not give [their] substance to the poor, ... whose spirits are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who will not labor with [their] own hands!" (D&amp;amp;C 56:15–17).<br><br>That which a man serves himself upon the platter of selfishness and greed may appease his mortal appetite, but it will leave him spiritually starved and malnourished.<br><br>As a thought precedes an act, so does selfishness precede sin. Immorality of every kind has its basis in selfishness. Why else would someone commit an immoral act if not to satisfy his or her own pleasure?<br><br>Selfishness embraces corruption as people scheme and bribe and take unfair advantage to satisfy their wants and obsessions.<br><br>It becomes pride as men and women forsake things of eternal value--even marriage, family, and God--for supposed high position and fame.<br><br>Consider how many are infidel to one another and to God as they selfishly squander their lives and means on the evaporative pleasures of what the world portrays as fashionable.<br><br>Satan's subtle use of selfishness causes parents to justify wasting away countless hours before a television set--absorbing violence, sensuality, vulgarity, and the foolishness of the world--while their children, usually allowed to view the same things, are starving for affection and attention. Can such selfishness be condoned, or are parents bringing condemnation upon themselves and sin down upon their heads by not using this time to teach their children? Parents have been instructed to teach their children "the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, [and] to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 68:25, 28).<br><br>Selfishness draws men into a spiritual vacuum, where, absorbed in self-service, they shut out all others.<br><br>Selfish idleness, with its I'll-do-it-later attitude, provides the base of procrastination that keeps righteous work from being done. Satan has decreed he will do all that is possible to stop righteous work upon the earth. What better way than to cause men to procrastinate?<br><br>Within the Church this work stoppage is manifest in a failure to faithfully comply with callings. Home teaching goes unattended. Tithes and offerings go unpaid. Members neglect keeping personal histories and family records and doing temple work. There is an unwillingness to give service in the missionary effort. How it must please Satan to see his success in influencing into nonparticipation those who could be the builders of God's kingdom.<br><br>Of all influences that cause men to choose wrongly, selfishness is undoubtedly the strongest. Where it is, the Spirit is not--talents go unshared, the needs of the poor unrequited, the weak unstrengthened, the ignorant untaught, and the lost unrecovered.<br><br>Selfishness viewed in its true sense is the absence of empathy and compassion, the abandonment of brotherhood, the rejection of God's plan, the isolation of one's soul.<br><br>Just as selflessness can carry us to our exaltation and eternal lives, so can selfishness lead us to our destruction and eternal damnation. Each day we are faced with the challenge: Will our acts be selfless or selfish?<br><br>Life is competitive. There is competition for space. Imaginary lines are drawn that others are not welcome to step over. Mental walls are built, and doors are closed. We dare anyone to intrude.<br><br>There is competition for companionship. We ask, "Who will be my friends?" If they are my friends--my best friends--jealousy, a feeling that they cannot be the friends of others, may arise.<br><br>There is competition for intelligence, talent, conversation, and experiences. As we size one another up and try one another on, we are constantly faced with the challenges of selflessness versus selfishness.<br><br>The only way given in heaven and upon earth whereby a man may be sanctified is in the service of others.<br><br>Every requirement that God's plan for our salvation places upon us is based in the giving of ourselves. Having the spirit of selflessness, men and women share themselves, their talents, and their means in benevolent service to mankind and God. Their reward is the freeing of their soul, the growth of their love, nearness to Divinity, and worthiness for the companionship of the Spirit.<br><br>Are we like the man who came running unto Jesus pleading, "What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?" (Mark 10:17)? After Jesus had explained to him the commandments he must live and the man had assured him that he had done all these things from his youth, Jesus told him he lacked but one thing:<br><br><i>Sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</i><br><br><i>And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</i>[Mark 10:21–22]<br><br>Or are we like the widow who cast her two mites into the treasury? Upon seeing her, Jesus said to His disciples:<br><br><i>This poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</i><br><br><i>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</i>[Mark 12:43–44]<br><br>Each of your circumstances are unique to you alone. Each of you must develop the acts of your own character.<br><br>If you would be truly happy, these acts must be acts of selflessness. Selflessness will turn sadness into a cheerful countenance. Selflessness produces kindness and dispels hypocrisy. Selflessness develops love, confidence, and trust. It is the vehicle of generosity. It is the resource God uses to answer the prayers of His children.<br><br>With selflessness we demonstrate our true relationship and intimacy with the Savior. It is the link that binds together the family of God.<br><br>May you be selfless and exalted, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>William R. Bradford was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at BYU on 3 June 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In 1962 a 17-year-old entered BYU as a freshman. He anticipated majoring in architecture or engineering--something important--but he had almost no idea of what awaited him because no one in his family, or, for the most part, his extended family, had ever attended college. How different the subsequent decades became because of his decision a few months earlier to resign an appointment to the Air Force Academy and attend BYU instead. As is so often the case when students work through the process of selecting a major--or having it select them--his area of study interest shifted. Involvement in the sciences gave way to a passion for something else, and a lifelong love affair with the arts and education was born.<br><br>Today that young man, now replaced with an older version, stands before you, a bit nervous, looking out over your faces and yet inwardly smiling and a bit envious of the potential of what lies ahead for all of you. I encourage you to enjoy every day of your odyssey and never forget to be vocally thankful for the wonderful gift of life and choice and learning that is yours to experience.<br><br>Since that day when I first arrived at BYU, 41 years have passed. In all of those years except one, I have been connected to this campus. What a rare blessing it has been to spend two-thirds of my life associated with this institution. It is an honor to be asked to share a few thoughts with you today. I acknowledge my wife, Janice, a number of our children and other family members, friends, colleagues, and, most of all, you students for whom all of this exists.<br><br>The central mission of this great university has never changed and never will, and each of us is privileged to receive the blessings associated with spending time on this campus and sharing in the wisdom and vision of those who dug the wells from which we now drink.<br><br>I love BYU and all it represents, and I love the gospel of Jesus Christ that brings to this university an additional power to inform and transform and imbue our lives with joy and happiness and understanding and fulfillment. I have been truly blessed to be able to combine who I am with what I do through 40-plus years at BYU.<br><br>I have chosen today to construct my remarks around a few of the experiences that I had as one of six artists invited to work on the murals for the Nauvoo Temple. I will remember and cherish forever the time that I spent working on the murals. It was a unique and beautiful project from inception to conclusion. It was a project that provided many learning moments and tender exchanges. There were also numerous opportunities for interaction with the Brethren, which taught me even more respect for the mantle that they wear and the global implications of the work they direct.<br><br>And yet, as profound as it was, the project is now over. I will admit that it was nice to be thought of, for a while at least, as someone making a special contribution to the temple. But we all know there is danger in being a celebrity for too long, and every day that passes extends the distance from when I<i>was important</i>until now, when I merely remember<i>thinking</i>I was important. So, in trying to focus on what of<i>true importance</i>I could talk about today, I decided to center my thoughts on what I learned from the mural experience that has continued to influence my life for good and helped me see<i>additional things of importance.</i>I pray that my insights will be useful in helping you see yourself more clearly.<br><h2><b>Insight 1</b></h2><br><i>We are all in the daily process of learning and improving--becoming someone with something of value to contribute.</i><br><br>In 1988 I was asked to be part of the making of the temple instructional film that is shown today throughout the world. I remember a late-night discussion with the other artists involved in the project in which we acknowledged that, since the Church no longer had murals painted for the temples, working on the film was as close as we would ever get to doing murals like those done years before. Not one of us had any idea that the future would allow new murals as part of the temple experience. Each of us just continued to paint--refining our talents and abilities in preparation for something that we had told ourselves would never come. And yet it did come. All of you are in that same position today, preparing without knowing, making yourselves capable of giving a full measure when the request comes.<br><br>Opportunities come after appropriate preparation. We are all--as a result of the choices that we are making today and every day--preparing ourselves to provide future service. The extent of that service, and the preparation that it will require, is unknown to us at this time. We have been given many talents, interests, and inclinations. Seeds have already been planted in our garden, but we will only realize their potential as we become active caretakers. We will have a number of different gardens throughout our lives, and all will provide opportunities for learning.<br><br>We are being prepared to perform many great and marvelous things in our families, communities, and church. It is essential that we not get discouraged and that we remain patient in the process, trusting that the Lord knows our heart and our abilities and can increase both to accomplish any righteous task.<br><br>That is, in fact, why we are here. It is a continuation of our divine nature. We have all been given gifts and talents to help us navigate this life and allow us to share what is unique to each of us. Moroni reminds us that we should "deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God" (Moroni 10:8). Through Joseph Smith the Lord admonished us to earnestly seek "the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given" (D&amp;amp;C 46:8). Although talents are not specific gifts of the Spirit, they are nevertheless gifts that bless lives.<br><br>We must spend our lives amplifying our talents and getting good at something rather than waiting for some unique opportunity to present those talents.It is a very lengthy process. I have been painting for more than 40 years. Somewhere in that process I believe I learned how, and yet I have continued to paint. Knowing how is only the beginning. It's amazing how much better we get at something when we keep doing it after we know how.<br><br>In the discipline of visual arts I have observed that students who succeed are those who develop a consuming love for "the doing." For every student who says that they want to be an artist, my advice is always the same: "If you can possibly do something else, do it!" If you can't, if you have to make art, then you have already defined yourself. You are who you are because of the choices you make about how you spend your time and energy and what you do when you have multiple choices.<br><br>That which gives pleasure and challenge and satisfaction always returns value. Our motivation to learn expands because we are nourished by what we are doing. There are also, however, times of despair, frustration, and feelings of inadequacy. Few complete the journey without questioning whether the price is too much to pay. Because of the seemingly overwhelming nature of the journey, it is easy to sometimes succumb to discouragement and forget that a loving Father intends us to find joy in every aspect of our lives. Target goals are important, but we must also enjoy each day of the doing--the acquiring of those goals.<br><br>Bless yourself with quiet, uninterrupted, reflective moments when you can reaffirm how very fortunate you are and how beautiful life is. Many times there is so much pressure in the quest to accomplish that we forget to value the need for meditative moments--and yet they are essential. Protect them.<br><br>A number of years ago I accompanied a group of students to paint and draw in Mexico for a spring term. Although there are many things that I remember about that experience, one activity in particular left its imprint as one of the truly significant memories of that trip. From early morning until evening we responded with pen and brush to the unique character of the quaint, colonial village where we were staying. A lot of art was made. It was hard work. The dinner hour signaled the return to the<i>posada</i>(or inn), followed by a critique of that day's successes and failures. And although it was exciting to see and discuss the work, the highlight of the day was yet to come. Each evening we would adjourn to the rooftop balcony overlooking the sights, sounds, and smells of the city and, in silent, almost monastic reverence, absorb the final moments of the day as the sun performed its spectacular descent.<br><br>How that casual, pleasant release progressed to an evening ritual, I'm not sure--but it did. It became a time when few words were spoken and all of us came to cherish the respite. Personal meditation and contemplation eventually became auditory as reflections that centered on events of the day were ruminated upon and amplified and invariably accelerated into thoughts of a more eternal nature. It became a truly magic time, and many of the discussions that followed and continued through the twilight and into the pensive purple of night had life-changing effects.<br><br>Conversation covered a wide range of topics, but invariably a spirit descended, hearts were softened, and thoughts became centered on issues of an eternal nature. All of us became better people as we allowed things of the Spirit to direct our thoughts and improve our countenances. The witness of the Holy Ghost clarified many things as we sat and listened and connected to others and ourselves. How singularly profound were those moments when the Holy Ghost was comfortable enough with our discussions to be able to contribute. In the book of John we read:<br><br><i>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</i>[John 16:13<br><br>In the course of your education, safeguard times when you can petition the Holy Ghost for both confirmation and comfort. Without His influence, few accomplishments retain significance.<br><br>We are all in the daily process of learning and improving--becoming someone with something of value to contribute.<br><h2><b>Insight 2</b></h2><br><i>Everything we do should be an offering to the Lord. Every effort should be our best effort followed by a prayerful petition for divine acceptance and approval.</i><br><br>Since the completion of the Nauvoo murals, I smile to myself when I realize that what I thought was such a unique experience was, in fact, the way that I should approach everything that I do. It shouldn't require an invitation from the prophet or a "once-in-a-lifetime" commission to change my behavior. My performance should be constant. I should always be prayerful, sensitive, humble, and charitable. I should be Christ-centered in everything I do. Should artwork that I do for the Church receive a better effort than that for another client? Should I be more righteous as a bishop than I am in another calling? Should I be more ethical because I happen to work as an employee of the Church than if I work at the 7-11 in Springville? No.<br><br>Every task should merit my best effort. My character must be consistent and not situational. We are the sum total of all of our daily choices--not only the way we are in uniquely exceptional situations.<br><br>As artists, each of us was honored to be involved with the murals and tried to approach the work with sensitivity to the necessity of matching our efforts with the sacred nature of the edifice. There was a great deal of discussion about the need to be "worthy vessels" and to address the work in a way that would elevate us to an appropriate level before the Lord.<br><br>This is the process of sanctification. By always measuring our choices and efforts against their appropriateness before the Lord, we accept the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ and allow the Holy Ghost to remain as our constant guide. We become like Him because we want our every action to please Him.<br><br>Elder Boyd K. Packer clarified this process when he counseled that we must first sanctify ourselves; second, develop our gifts; and then, third, bless the lives of others (see "The Arts and the Spirit of the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1976, 60–65). I believe he was telling us to be honorable, live the gospel, work very hard at being capable of providing a valuable service, and then to think beyond ourselves.<br><br>Everything we do should be an offering to the Lord. Every effort should be our best effort followed by a prayerful petition for divine acceptance and approval.<br><h2><b>Insight 3</b></h2><br><i>Appreciate the value of every contribution. Some are more visible, but all are essential. If the worth of a soul is great in the sight of the Lord, then each one's contributions are no less important.</i><br><br>During the time before the dedication, when the Nauvoo Temple was open to the public, all of those contributors who were involved in the construction were invited to a special open house. Two days were set apart for contractors, craftsmen, and their families to see the finished building. Hundreds attended. In a manner similar to a regular open house, everyone went through in designated groups. It became known in our group that I was one of the artists involved. Our tour leader asked if I would share some thoughts about the murals. I did, and people were openly complimentary about the work.<br><br>As the conversation continued, a woman introduced herself and quietly took me over to the door of the Creation Room. She reached down, turned the ornate handle, and said, "My husband made all of the doorknobs." They were impressive, but even more impressive was her smile. There was no escaping the pride that she felt for the contribution that her husband had made to the temple. Would each knob be noticed in the same way as the murals? I doubt it. Would her husband receive the same applause for his work? Probably not. Were the handles less important than the murals? No. Every consideration to quality would eventually, collectively, present itself as an offering to the Lord.<br><br>The total attention to detail in the Nauvoo Temple--from the highly visible to the obscure--was inspiring. Every contributor worried whether his or her work would be accepted as an appropriate offering. In a letter from the Twelve Apostles to the Church on January 14, 1845, Brigham Young wrote about a similar effort on the original temple. He said:<br><br><i>Great numbers of carpenters, masons, and other workmen are daily engaged in this arduous undertaking, so that not only is stone being prepared, but the sash, flooring, seats, and other things are progressing rapidly.</i>[<i>HC</i>7:357]<br><br>No task was too small, none was unimportant. Every effort was a significant contribution to the total structure.<br><br>Each of us, in our own way, can make uniquely essential contributions to the lives of all that we meet. Some of us hold titles of importance; some of us serve in anonymity. Some of us receive applause; some of us give in ways that are seldom noticed. And yet all of us have the potential to bless the kingdom with our efforts. It is so important that we believe in the value of who we are and what we can give.<br><br>Many years ago, when our second-to-the-oldest son was about seven or eight, he and I were walking along a dusty gravel lane extending from our home to some open fields behind. I don't even remember where we were going or why. And it doesn't matter any more now than it did then. It was a time when a little boy could be doing something with his dad--only, as usual, the boy was having a much better time than the dad was. I had more important things to do. I thought, "Okay, I'll make time for this little adventure, but not too much time." Dad time is really valuable--so, up the road to look at the horses, and then back to what needed my attention at home.<br><br>And then it happened. He had been picking up stones from the road and throwing them at everything. He stopped, picked up another one, and then ran up to me. He put the pebble to his tongue, licked it, looked at it again, held it up to my eyes, and said, "Isn't it beautiful!" It wasn't a question but rather, for him, an unequivocal reality. It<i>was</i>beautiful--colorfully streaked and striated in taupe and gray with faceted edges and unusually symmetrical sides.<br><br>And yet only seconds before it had been ordinary, no different from the thousands of other rocks strewn all over the lane. What transformed it into an object of beauty was nothing more than a second look--the taking of time to discover and then appreciate its uniqueness. Its hidden properties unveiled themselves. I came to understand what it was beneath what I assumed it was. Seeing beyond its sameness allowed it to reveal mysterious potential. I learned a great lesson that day.<br><br>Appreciate the value of every contribution. Some are more visible, but all are essential. If the worth of a soul is great in the sight of the Lord, then each one's contributions are no less important.<br><h2><b>Insight 4</b></h2><br><i>There is a living prophet directing the affairs of the Church.</i><br><br>I remember when President Hinckley made the announcement that a temple would be rebuilt in Nauvoo. A prophet had spoken, and I knew that what he said was of God. The day before the announcement most of us had not considered the possibility, and then the day after it was as though we had known it all of our lives. It was the way it should be.<br><br>Little has changed since 1845. The mantle of prophet, seer, and revelator reaches both up to the heavens and down to the more temporal. William Weeks, the architect of the original Nauvoo Temple, had a lengthy discussion with the Prophet Joseph Smith about the shape of the windows. Each lobbied their position adamantly. Finally, Joseph said:<br><br><i>"I wish you to carry out</i>my<i>designs. I have seen in vision the splendid appearance of that building illuminated, and will have it built according to the pattern shown me."</i>[<i>HC</i>6:197; emphasis in original]<br><br>I'm sure in Brother Weeks' mind there was no more need for debate.<br><br>No less so than Joseph Smith, President Gordon B. Hinckley wears the current mantle of divine prophetic leadership. After a visit from the First Presidency to our temporary painting studios to review the murals and give final approval before shipping them back to Nauvoo, I was surprised and a bit unsettled to receive a phone call at home the following Monday from the prophet, expressing his concern over a part of the mural image.<br><br>Like Joseph and the original Nauvoo windows, President Hinckley had spiritual confirmation of what was needed. He had been "thinking all weekend" about one aspect of my mural design that kept troubling him. At the time of his visit I had explained the aesthetic motivation for my part of the mural, and he made a couple of suggestions about the overall image. As the visit ended, I felt that all I had done had received approval. But the Spirit had continued to whisper disquieting thoughts into his mind for the next couple of days. His assessment confirmed sensitivity to issues beyond those that had informed my involvement as the painter. He explained his concern and asked if I would mind modifying the painting. As with Brother Weeks, there was no need for more debate. How perceptive President Hinckley had been, and how gentle and respectful was his concern that nothing be introduced into the temple that could become a distraction.<br><br>There is a living prophet directing the affairs of the Church.<br><h2><b>Insight 5</b></h2><br><i>Prayers are answered.</i><br><br>As artists, our original instruction from the First Presidency was, in fact, very simple. We were asked to paint something that would be appropriate for the function of the temple and be consistent with what might have been included in the original building. To do something worthy of that description was not lost on any of the six artists. Each artist was encouraged to let their own peculiar painting process and style find voice in the murals. Complete artistic freedom directed our choices, even though we knew that final approval would come from the Brethren. Our job was to bring all of our experience and abilities to the task and then to allow the Spirit to confirm our decisions.<br><br>I have been asked on various occasions if at any time during the mural painting experience I had a truly spiritual epiphany--some extraordinary help from the other side, some angelically assisted insights. I always disappoint them when my response is no. Solutions came as a result of work, rework, and more work. Validation came in those quiet moments of reflection that I referred to earlier. There was constant prayer for assistance and clarification, but no answers were delivered in extraordinary ways. There was no dramatic divine intervention.<br><br>No matter how passionate the plea, prayer was always answered as a whispered reply from the Holy Ghost--a gentle warmth in the bosom replacing the question or concern with confidence and correctness. Spiritual confirmation came in quiet reflective moments after we had determined a course of action, painted through numerous possibilities, and then requestioned our efforts. Confirmations were received in the assurance that we had accomplished the task and in the feeling that the offering was acceptable. The process was, and is, so simple that it is too often assumed that there must be more to it than that.<br><br>Prayers are answered.<br><h2><b>Insight 6</b></h2><br><i>I am thankful for my life, my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the priesthood that I hold.</i><br><br>To say that I am thankful is so inadequate when measured against the life that I have been allowed to live. I have been blessed with artistic and academic opportunities, as well as associations with choice people who love the Lord and live quality lives. So many people have given clarification to my confusion by their examples of righteous living. The gospel has centered my life and provided numerous course adjustments and corrections. Callings have increased my understanding and taught me to serve prayerfully and humbly. I hope that the Lord is pleased with what has been given back, with what has been done to give service.<br><br>Those who have acquired some degree of prominence and notoriety can relate to the myth of importance that accompanies performance in highly visible arenas assumed to require special talents or gifts. Artists--like athletes, politicians, executives, and, yes, even educators--are continually given deference and applause for their achievements. It is so easy to allow the accolades of others to control the perception of one's own importance. The honors of men are seductive badges that we all like to wear.<br><br>Each of us has the capacity to accomplish much good in this life, but we must always return credit and appreciation to the source of all that is good and truthful. I thank God for His trust, His patience and forgiveness, and the agency and opportunity that defines mortality. I pray to never offend Him or disappoint Him, but I know that I have and that I will.<br><br>I am thankful for my life, my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the priesthood that I hold.<br><br>I was watching a TV program a while back on the transcendental writer Thoreau, who, when dying of tuberculosis, was asked, "Have you made your peace with God?"<br><br>To this he answered, "We never quarreled."<br><br>To be in harmony with God is the most important thing that we do. We are to love Him and keep His commandments.<br><br>May I conclude with a few questions that keep me from quarreling with God? Try to listen with your heart and ask yourself if there is relevance to you.<br><br>• Is the restored gospel of Jesus Christ the center of my life?<br><br>• Do I strive to keep the covenants that I have made and keep my life in harmony with the gospel?<br><br>• Do I have a clear and recent memory of how I felt when I knew that the Spirit was with me?<br><br>• What keeps the Spirit from my life? Can I remove the obstacle?<br><br>• Do I shun everything that detracts from my spiritual development and desensitizes my ability to connect to things of the Spirit?<br><br>• What is the next step in my personal purification process? How do I replace involvement with worldly activities with those of the Spirit?<br><br>• Do I accept responsibility for my own actions? How do I deal with complacency, self-deception, and denial in my behavior?<br><br>• Do I measure my choices against the standards of the world or the kingdom of God?<br><br>• Do I sustain the general and local authorities and support, without reservation, those called as prophets, seers, and revelators? Do I follow their counsel and look to their guidance?<br><br>• Do I understand the benefits of service? Am I truly charitable, caring, and kind with everyone I meet? Do I seek opportunities to give?<br><br>• Do I understand the importance of the temple and seek the blessings of being worthy to enter and return regularly?<br><br>• Do I like the person I am becoming? Am I happy?<br><br>It is my prayer for all of us that we can find joy and fulfillment in all that we do. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert Marshall was a BYU professor of visual arts when this devotional address was given on 10 June 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>s Far as Forever - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I must tell you that the invitation to speak today came as a great surprise to me. As I have pondered what I could say, I have asked myself: "What about my life could be of value to you? How do we all strive together to set and attain meaningful goals? How can we meet the challenges of this life and return to live with our Father in Heaven?" I pray that as we share this time together, you can gain something from the experiences and support that I have personally relied upon in my journey.<br><br>As a child I loved to read and daydream. Sometimes I would daydream about things I read, but often I would just daydream about who I was and who I wanted to be. My favorite place for both of these activities was on the roof of a building that was used as a storage cellar by our family. I would climb up a plum tree next to the cellar with book in hand, then from its branches scramble onto the cellar roof, gingerly work my way over the peak, and settle on the other side under the enveloping leaves of my favorite apple tree. From there I could see forever, and it wasn't hard to imagine that I could be Glinda the Good Witch in the Land of Oz or Nancy Drew spying on some shady characters up to no good. Unseen, I could also watch my father fixing sprinkler pipes or trimming trees and see my mother with her hoe banishing the weeds from the flower beds or hanging fresh wash on the clothesline.<br><br>Even during my early teenage years I would escape to this secret world. However, by then more time was spent thinking about reachable goals and less about fantasies. It was also here that I said many prayers and had intimate conversations with my Father in Heaven. I remember once puzzling out loud to Him: "I try so hard to be good. Why do I seem to get into so much trouble?" What I didn't seem to grasp was that while uttering this prayer I was sitting on the cellar roof that I had been banned from more than once. Even though I tried to be "good," I had trouble sometimes understanding the meaning of the word<i>no.</i>I don't think that's changed.<br><br>Fortunately these early years of my life did much through fantasies, dreams, wishes, plans, and prayers to develop in me an understanding of the importance of goals and the value of a plan to reach those goals. As I have spent time raising children, teaching, coaching, and advising and counseling, I have learned some important lessons that I would like to share with you today.<br><h2><b>Know Who You Are</b></h2><br>The first and most critical step to setting and reaching goals is to know who you are. I have had many affirmations of this important principle.<br><br>After almost 20 years as a stay-at-home mom, I went back to school to earn my teaching certificate. With certificate in hand, I was excited to be offered a job at East High School in Salt Lake City. The only catch was that in addition to teaching English and history, I was assigned to coach swimming. Fortunately for me, I had learned a little from my children, who were competitive swimmers. We also had some great swimmers on the team, and I had excellent assistants. It was not long before we had one of the top teams in the state. In the process I learned a lot about what motivates an athlete to perform well and how to help a swimmer set goals and focus on reaching those goals.<br><br>At the same time that the swim team was having astonishing success, the East High School football team was struggling. At the end of the 1989 season they had the dubious reputation of the longest losing streak west of the Mississippi.<i>USA Today</i>reporters amazingly appeared at these high school games, covering the record-breaking streak. After being defeated the first game of the 1990 season, the team had a 30-game losing streak and had not won a game in four years. The head football coach came to me after this first game--in what I sensed was a state of desperation--and asked if I would accept a position as an assistant varsity football coach for the rest of the season. (I must explain that I did have some experience with football. My father had been a football player and during my years growing up had coached at Provo High School. I had spent time scouting teams with him--watching and loving football. However, never on the cellar roof of my youth had I ever imagined that I would someday be coaching football.)<br><br>My coaching responsibilities were to work with the kickers and the special teams, keep the players motivated and focused during practice, and give the pep talk to the team before the game. I quickly became acquainted with the players on those long, hot August afternoons as we worked hard during the two weeks until our next game. I clocked hang time on punts, held the ball for place kickers, and dodged errant tackles. A smile here, a cheer there, a forceful pat on the shoulder pad, and sometimes a symbolic kick in the pants were common. I also encouraged the players to help each other. Some of the defensive linemen would show up early on Saturday mornings to shag balls as the kickers practiced before the team meeting. Soon these linemen were well aware when the kickers improved their distance and hang time and offered some mocking words of praise. The kickers in turn loudly harassed and applauded tackles and sacks.<br><br>It didn't take me long to discover that these young men were not losers. They had talent, character, and determination. But for four years they had heard the press, fans, and friends talk about how "bad" East High football was, and they had come to believe it.<br><br>When the moment came for me to get the team psyched for the game with West High School (our most serious rival), I didn't rant or stomp and yell to work them up. I simply shared with the players what I had learned about them in those two weeks: They were not losers. They were individual winners and had every right to go out on that field and succeed. Each one of them had a job to do, and they only needed to go out and do their part to the best of their ability in support of the entire team.<br><br>I think the rest of the coaching staff was somewhat disappointed at that point and wondered why they had hired me. They had expected a high-spirited rally to arms. But I wanted to give them something more sustainable than a pep talk. I wanted each one of them to reach inside themselves and excel.<br><br>Those young men went out on the field that day and played like winners. Suddenly they were cheering each other on and smacking helmets and pads with pride. After a grueling game and four overtimes, the score was East High 42, West High 35. The East High football team had learned how to win, and these young men no longer questioned who they were.<br><br>This experience and the rest of the season indelibly impressed on me the importance of knowing who we are and what we are capable of doing. The Savior is our ultimate example. He knew what His mission was when He came to this earth, and He knew the consequences if He should fail. We should feel the same urgency in our own mission on this earth.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith has told us:<br><br><i>If Christ knew</i>[His mission]<i>beforehand, so did we. But in coming here, we forgot all. . . . But by the power of the Spirit, in the redemption of Christ, through obedience, we often catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal soul, which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our former home.</i>[<i>GD,</i>13–14]<br><br>We can sense "the germ of eternal life" within us (<i>GD,</i>14). What confidence we should feel about who we are, what the importance of our mission is, and how much ability to succeed we have as we reach inside ourselves and excel.<br><h2><b>Set the Right Goals</b></h2><br>Once we have a clear picture of who we are and why we are here, the next step in this journey is to accept our mission and set meaningful goals. I would like to share with you an experience I had on a trip to Asia. Each year we try to provide an Asia Business Study Abroad Program for interested Marriott School undergraduate and graduate students. One of the countries we visit is Vietnam. On several occasions we have been able to arrange a chance for the students to visit with families who are part of a microenterprise program in the area of Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>In the microenterprise program, the women in these families are given small loans beginning at less than $50. They use this money to start up a business that they can develop and grow to help support their families. Some women weave mats, some weave hammocks; others raise chickens, ducks, or even small pigs. No matter what business these women were starting, we found they set similar goals for the use of their profits.<br><br>The first goal was always to guarantee the necessities of life such as food and clothing for their beautiful children. The next goal was to replace the troublesome thatched roofs of their homes with metal roofs to keep out the moisture and the bugs that lodged in the thatch. The next goal as their business grew was to cover the dirt floors of their homes with tile. And, finally, when they were really doing well, they would buy a nice bed to replace the customary sleeping mats and add indoor plumbing.<br><br>These goals were very important to them and followed this predictable pattern. Although we are blessed to be able to establish goals at a much different economic level and focus farther into the future, we still sometimes stop short of making our goals part of an all-important eternal plan.<br><br>I am a list maker, and each weekend I create a list of tasks that I want to accomplish during the weekend or the week ahead. This is one of my lists:<br><br>Do the wash<br>Clean out refrigerator<br>Plan Sunday dinner<br>Groceries<br>Work out<br>Get birthday present<br>Work on devotional talk<br>Pay bills<br>Plant flowerpots<br>Clean out the left side of the garage<br>Go to the bank<br>Start Relief Society lesson<br>Get oil changed<br>Clean out dresser drawers<br>Clean off patio<br><br>As I review this list, I see two major problems. The first one is that the list of goals is not realistic. I never get everything done. In fact, "clean out the garage" has been on the list for six months. I always leave it until last and never get to it. It isn't because this is not an important item. In fact, throughout the winter either my husband, Glen, or I (mostly Glen) have had to park our car outside because there is no room to get our two cars in our two-car garage. Obviously I need to develop some strategy other than putting this on my weekly list.<br><br>The second problem with my list is that these are not meaningful goals, and even if I accomplish them I am no further ahead a week from now than I am presently. Where on my list are things I need to do to follow the admonition given by Elder James M. Dunn?<br><br><i>Our earthly sojourn is part of a divine plan of happiness designed by Him</i>[God],<i>which beckons us to live by faith, to gain mortal experiences, and to become qualified through obedience and the power of the Atonement to return to His presence forever.</i>[James M. Dunn, "Words to Live By,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2003, 35]<br><br>Clearly my To-Do list needs to start with some important things like checking in with my sick neighbor, going to a temple session, and getting to my planned study of the scriptures. Then I can add the mundane tasks of my life as Things to Do Next.<br><br>During the spring and summer semester I am teaching a class we call our Management Suite class. That may seem like a strange name for a class, but a definition of<i>suite</i>is "a set of things having a certain dependence upon each other and intended to go or be used together" (<i>Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the English Language, International Edition,</i>vol. 2 [1974], 1254, s.v. "suite"). The suite class is actually a combined curriculum of religion and business--the spiritual and the secular. These subjects are intended to "be used together." To us this is one of the most important classes in our business curriculum. Some of the topics we cover are Pride and the Economic Cycle; Work, Family, and Church; Moral Leadership; Personal Integrity; and Career Planning. Each one of these topics and the many others we cover has application to the goals we set in our spiritual, personal, and professional lives.<br><br>At the beginning of spring classes I asked the students to set a goal to pursue during the spring and summer terms. I would like to share some of these goals with you and let you compare them to my Vietnam goals or to my original To-Do list. Some of the students set very practical goals and some set more eternal goals, but I am very impressed with the direction the students have chosen. Here are some examples:<br><br>"I have planned to spend more time with my wife. . . . I believe that if we dedicate time sharing our testimonies and thoughts about life together on a daily basis, we will grow closer together and implement celestial attributes in our marriage. There is no point in trying to gain mortal accomplishments if I neglect the person most important in my life."<br><br>Another student said, "My number-one focus this semester is to dedicate and set aside time for those I interact with. . . . I want to make sure I can be there for those I care about."<br><br>Another: "My personal goal is to choose each and every day to actively be the person I sincerely want to be. Every day I want to choose to do my best and be the most Christlike person I can be." Included with this goal were daily goals to help him achieve this broader goal.<br><br>Another goal: "Get a job that creates opportunities for others."<br><br>One was: "Work on becoming a more effective leader."<br><br>The last one: "Prepare our home with the Spirit of the Lord for the arrival of our little boy. I want to do this so that he may be raised with all of the blessings of the gospel and understand them."<br><br>Elder Dunn again instructed us when he said:<br><br><i>Life is short. "It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away" (James 4:14). In the precious time that we have in mortality, there are many things to be done. Some of these things are more important than others, and we must make wise decisions. Some things are obviously wrong. Some are good. But some are vital if we are to meet the expectations of our Father.</i>[Dunn, "Words to Live By," 35]<br><br>We worry about choosing between right and wrong, but many of our more difficult decisions involve choosing between right and right. Conscious planning must be directed toward eternal issues. We need to look at our goals and wisely choose how we direct our time and energy.<br><h2><b>Don't Get Sidetracked</b></h2><br>The next problem we run into is that even though we have set good goals and begin to pursue them, we often get sidetracked.<br><br>Teaching and working with business students in the Marriott School has given me some insights as I watch them. Unfortunately I have met with some students who have been sidetracked along the way and end up struggling academically, physically, or emotionally. The original goal for some was to obtain strong business skills that would qualify them for a promising career with a healthy salary to provide for their family. However, the temptation to begin using those skills partway through their schooling results in more and more hours of part-time or full-time work and less and less time to spend on classwork. The additional money from that $10-an-hour job has suddenly stymied their progress toward the long-term career they are seeking. They have lost sight of their original goal.<br><br>Some other students I have worked with have lost the courage and confidence to continue the fight. They came to BYU carefree and with few responsibilities. Now they are married, have a child, have a part-time job, and feel the weight of the world on their shoulders. The goals ahead seem monumental. At times I think we all feel that pressure and want to give up--at least for a while. Often I find for myself that my prayer from the cellar roof has changed to "I faithfully try to do what is right, but why is it such a struggle?" Under these circumstances, I often turn to one of my favorite scriptures: Joshua 1:9, where the Lord speaks to Joshua and says, "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest." If we can just remember these words, the spirit behind them can help us dig a little deeper and look a little harder for solutions to our struggles.<br><br>If we are working to be obedient and are striving toward worthy goals, the Lord will be with us and give us strength. He has promised us in the Doctrine and Covenants, "Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good" (D&amp;amp;C 90:24). When troubles come that make us want to quit, we need the courage to remember that we know who we are and why we are here. We also know that we have prayerfully set goals that are heading us in the right direction. We should not fear, and we must not give up. The character and courage that has brought us this far is still there. There are solutions, and we just need to find them. We may need a tree to climb or a roof to scale to improve our vantage point, but success is possible.<br><h2><b>Make It a Team Sport</b></h2><br>This brings me to my fourth and final point. Struggles become easier if we make life a team sport. I have often wondered what motivated the Savior to come forth in the Council of Heaven and offer Himself as a sacrifice for us. Since it was not for personal glory, it must have been for love--the type of love that we can only begin to imagine as we experience love for spouses, parents, and children. I would like you to remember one of the student goals that I read earlier: "My number-one focus this semester is to dedicate and set aside time for those I interact with. . . . I want to make sure I can be there for those I care about."<br><br>Through my coaching experiences I have learned that athletes perform at a higher level as part of a team than they do when focusing on their individual accomplishments. While coaching swimming I was surprised to find that during the season the best times the swimmers recorded were when they were part of a relay team instead of when they were swimming an individual event. If you want to perform at your best level, become part of a team. That team can be a team of two or a team of more. There are many around you to seek out as teammates.<br><br>One of my favorite authors is the Jewish writer Chaim Potok. In his book<i>The Chosen,</i>the main character, a young man named Reuven, and his father have a discussion. The father says:<br><br><i>"Reuven, listen to me. The Talmud says that a person should do two things for himself. One is to acquire a teacher. Do you remember the other?"</i><br><br><i>"Choose a friend,"</i>[Reuven]<i>said.</i><br><br><i>"Yes. You know what a friend is, Reuven? A Greek philosopher said that two people who are true friends are like two bodies with one soul."</i>[Chaim Potok,<i>The Chosen</i>(New York: Ballantine Books, 1967), 74; book 1, chapter 4]<br><br>When Glen and I were first married and starting our family, I found a very dear friend who was in the same circumstances I was. We would talk on the phone each morning as we did our breakfast dishes. We would talk about the wonderful things in our lives and our daily struggles. We could always help each other when things got tough. Even though I moved away from that neighborhood and our lives became separated, every time we see each other it is like we just talked yesterday, and we can share and support just as before. We are still like "one soul."<br><br>Here on this campus are many opportunities to find a teacher and a friend. I have never been at a university where the faculty is so willing to mentor and counsel students. When I was in the MBA program here at BYU, I relished the opportunity to become good friends with my professors. Fortunately I have had the opportunity to return to the Marriott School as a colleague of these wonderful people. I am thankful that I had the chance to begin these relationships while I was a student. It is easy for me now to tell a business student to take a certain class because I know that faculty member can change a student's life.<br><br>In addition to finding a teacher, take advantage of the chance you have to build lasting friendships. This is such a short period of time, even though it may seem sometimes to go on forever. Part of the value of being at BYU is the wonderful people you associate with. You do not know but what you also might play an important role in each other's lives some time in the future.<br><br>Sometimes when it seems that you are most alone, you discover a wonderful friend who is there to support you. Last year at about this time we lost a son. I was in Beijing, China, at the time I was notified of his death. The following days--filled with shock and disbelief as my daughter Shannon and I struggled to get home--are still very vague to me. We flew into Salt Lake, where we joined the rest of the family, and then flew out the next morning to New York for the funeral service. Separated from friends and other support, our immediate family clung together during those dark days.<br><br>As we returned to Salt Lake and pulled into the driveway of our home, the first thing I saw was that all of my flowerpots had been planted with beautiful blooming flowers and flowering baskets were hanging from our arbor. Our neighbors had gotten together and planted along the entryway to our home. More than the beauty it presented, I felt a deep connection with these wonderful people who had worried and cared about us. This was the way they had expressed their love. Those flowers were beautiful for the entire summer and were a constant reminder that we were not alone.<br><br>As we look to those who love us, remember the most important team member we can have is Christ. He is always there to be a companion and support for us. Christ has promised us that He will be with us: "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63).<br><br>The words and music of the hymn "Be Thou Humble," written by Grietje Terburg Rowley, can be a great consolation as they remind us that we are not alone at any time, no matter how great our struggle.<br><br><i>Be thou humble in thy weakness, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee,</i><br><i>Shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers.</i><br><i>Be thou humble in thy pleading, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee,</i><br><i>Shall bless thee with a sweet and calm assurance that he cares.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 130]<br><br>So let us remember that from the vantage point of a roof and a tall tree, our perspective is to look as far as forever and set goals that will not just help us through the week but will lead us on into eternity. Focus on who you are, because there are no losing streaks that cannot be overcome if there is a glimpse of where you came from and a vast panorama of where you are going. Make sure your To-Do list starts with eternal goals first and leave cleaning the garage to last. Most of all, do not be afraid. Finally, remember you can always find a friend. Always reach out that hand so the Lord can lead you.<br><br>I pray that each of us will be led together to a bright future with a sweet and calm assurance that we all care for each other and seek to understand the daily blessings of the gospel. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Joan W. Young was director of the Marriott School's Undergraduate Management Program at BYU when this devotional address was delivered on 24 June 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Learn; Go Forth to Serve - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that wonderful music. The message of uplifting music is surely one of the reasons for us to attend devotionals each week.<br><br>I'm pleased to be with you students, faculty, staff, and guests. It is an honor to meet with you and have the privilege and opportunity to speak with you. However, it takes family and friends to put things in proper perspective. My grandson Ben said this morning, "Why, you're famous!" and my son Robert said, "If you're dull and boring, I'm going to get under the seat!" Michael Hunter from KBYU said, "Don't worry about it. If you go over, they'll just leave." Within that context, you may feel free to do any of the above.<br><br>I do not know why I was selected to deliver a devotional address, but I do know the message I am supposed to share with you. I have prayed fervently that as I speak with you the Spirit might help us share the feelings and the thoughts I want to express.<br><br>My experiences as a trauma and disaster nurse have been challenging and rewarding. I love the stimulation and excitement of saving a life in the face of overwhelming odds or following a serious accident or illness when a patient is on a ventilator, has many vasoactive IV fluids to maintain blood pressure, and requires numerous interventions to correct or maintain homeostasis. I love the detective work of determining the physiological responses to the terrible stimuli we humans manage to exert on each other and then helping patients recover. I love to bring order out of chaos when there has been a natural or man-made disaster.<br><br>However, as I tell my critical-care students, no patient ever comes back and says, "Thank you for knowing how to read my pulmonary artery catheter values and how to titrate my medications accordingly" or "Thank you for knowing why I am crashing when my lab values are out of whack and knowing which medications will fix the problem."<br><br>What they do say is, "Do you remember that night when I was so scared and you put your arms around me" or "Do you remember how you comforted me as I had that terrible procedure done?" These are the times when I feel the most validation for my interaction with patients. Now as I guide such experiences for my nursing students, I also think that these are some of the reasons Heavenly Father guided me to do what I do and to be where I am.<br><br>Please join me in thinking back to how you felt when you knew you were coming to Brigham Young University--the excitement, the fear and trepidation, and the witness of wonderful things to come, even as you knew you would leave your comfort zone. I remember well my feelings of that day. I was a struggling student at the University of Utah at the time, weighed down by all the life events that are overwhelming some of you: working, studying, trying to be a good parent, and never having enough time, sleep, or money. As I was wont to do, I went to the Salt Lake Temple for solace and guidance. On my way I encountered a neighbor with whom I was teaching Gospel Doctrine in the Colonial Hills Second Ward. In the middle of our conversation, with me grumbling about the heavy load I was carrying and the good brother consoling me, he stopped midsentence and half-jokingly said, "Who knows? Maybe you will teach nursing at BYU."<br><br>There was an immediate, overwhelming confirmation through the Spirit that I would indeed come here.<br><br>Years later as I entered the west entrance of the Brigham Young University campus for the first time as a new faculty member--totally out of my comfort zone--I felt the challenge of the signs there: Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve. Each time I pass through those gates I am reminded of the importance of that injunction, why I chose the profession I did, and why I am at BYU. I hope you periodically take time as well to reevaluate your reasons for being here.<br><br>Many Church leaders and former presidents of Brigham Young University have discussed the reasons for the existence of BYU. In a faculty workshop, former BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson stated:<br><br><i>At BYU we have a twofold responsibility--a grave responsibility which demands a great deal of our faculty and staff:</i><br><br><i>1. Proper academic development--to meet the tests and challenges of the world.</i><br><br><i>2. Proper spiritual development--to meet the basic inner needs of the student, and to help him understand his relationship to his fellow men and to God, the Heavenly Father.</i>["The Calling of BYU," address given at the BYU annual faculty workshop, 18 September 1962, 7; see also John W. Welch and Don E. Norton,<i>Educating Zion</i>(Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), 33]<br><br>In his first devotional as president of Brigham Young University, Elder Merrill J. Bateman recounted an experience in 1975 of looking over those present at a multistake fireside in the Marriott Center. His eyes came to rest on about 2,500 missionaries from the MTC all seated together. He recalled:<br><br><i>I looked at them and realized that within weeks they would be scattered to the four corners of the globe. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then a flash of inspiration opened my mind as to the purpose of Brigham Young University. I realized that</i>[the]<i>students were being prepared to enter the world. . . . The BYU families would be good neighbors; have strong relationships with business associates; and, if well-trained, be leaders in their communities.</i>[Merrill J. Bateman, "A Zion University,"<i>BYU 1995–96 Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1996), 129–30]<br><br>Elder Bateman explained:<br><br><i>As almost everyone here knows, the word</i>Zion<i>in Latter-day Saint literature refers to the "pure in heart" or the "place where the pure in heart dwell." A Zion people are of one heart and one mind--they dwell in righteousness and have no poor among them. . . . In our context, a Zion university is a community of righteous scholars and students searching for truth for the purpose of educating the whole person.</i>["A Zion University," 126]<br><br>Most of you already belong to one of the two greatest forces for good on the face of the earth--the priesthood or the Relief Society. In the Church handbook we read, "The priesthood should be exercised in a spirit of love with a desire to serve and bless others"<i>(Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 2: Priesthood and Auxiliary Leaders</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1998], 161). "The purpose of Relief Society is to assist priesthood leaders in carrying out the mission of the Church by helping sisters and families come unto Christ" (<i>Church Handbook,</i>193). "Taking individual responsibility for spiritual well-being and temporal welfare has always been part of gospel living. One purpose of the Church is to help members fulfill these responsibilities. Priesthood leaders, auxiliary leaders, home teachers, and visiting teachers have important roles in this effort" (<i>Church Handbook,</i>255). While you are at BYU, you have numerous opportunities to participate in these activities, with powerful role models who have years of experience.<br><br>In section 29 of the Doctrine and Covenants, after having discussed spiritual and temporal work, the Lord says, "Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal"--meaning even temporal laws are designed to fulfill spiritual purposes (D&amp;amp;C 29:34).<br><br>The purpose then of Brigham Young University is to be a microcosm of the Church. As we contemplate all these concepts, we can see how a Brigham Young University education prepares us for numerous roles.<br><br>So we "enter to learn" and then "go forth to serve." If indeed we want to become a Zion people, our academic and spiritual efforts at Brigham Young University must be melded into our personal and professional lives. Regardless of our chosen professions, we can provide service. In analyzing and evaluating our interactions with others, we discover the values that really motivate our lives. Such an example and an examination can be a springboard for change and growth.<br><br>I would like to tell you the stories of three groups who really went forth to serve. The first story I want to share occurred in the fall of 2001. On September 11, I, like you, had a full schedule. When the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked, I was on a leave of absence from Brigham Young University for the block, ready to return to Amman, Jordan, as cochair of a Middle Eastern international nursing conference and to complete a research project. Since I obviously could not go to Jordan, and I had no classes to teach, I was able to go to Washington, D.C., as a Red Cross disaster nurse.<br><br>Working there with other relief workers and the community at large was a Zion experience for me. I witnessed the selflessness of many people. Spontaneous acts of kindness abounded all around us. When we went shopping for items for our clients, store owners would not take our money, parking lot attendants refused to let us pay, and people approached us on the street to offer money or blood. Obviously we could take neither, but we gave them the addresses of local Red Cross chapters.<br><br>One of my roles was to work with burn patients and their families at Arlington Hospital, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and at Washington General. As I interviewed patients from the Pentagon and families connected to the events, I heard the heroic stories of dramatic rescues--some of which you saw on television. I watched as a small, dainty woman with two fractured legs was reunited with the young man who caught her when she jumped out of a two-story window. He received the greater of the injuries. I saw an uninjured survivor hug her rescuer, who had burns from the tips of her fingers to the tops of her shoulders. I watched survivors' families support the families of those who had died. All the time I was there I thought of the scripture from Moses 7:18: "And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them." When I looked up that scripture recently, I found a footnote that referred the reader to "unity" in the Topical Guide. Interestingly enough, the name of our operation at the Pentagon was Camp Unity.<br><br>As you know, people all over the United States pulled together during that terrible time. Schoolchildren sent thousands of cards and letters that we delivered to families and survivors. We shared the cards with them, and as tears welled up in their eyes, they remarked, "I can't believe so many people care." A feeling of unity pervaded the atmosphere as everyone worked together, relentlessly. As one seasoned firefighter put it, "We think we're the ones who 'make it all right.' It didn't take us many minutes to realize we couldn't make this one all right."<br><br>We held nightly nondenominational prayer meetings to help us make it better. Local Afghan Muslims organized an interfaith service at the Lincoln Memorial, where beautiful unifying messages were given by Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, and other religious leaders. As the darkness deepened, everyone sang "God Bless America" while group members carried a giant U.S. flag down to the reflecting pool and we held lighted candles aloft. In the shadow of the monument to a remarkable president who wanted to ensure freedom for all, the symbolism of this event did not escape us. No one wanted to leave when the service was over. We walked around chatting with people we had never met, hugging perfect strangers, and sharing our rich ethnic and cultural diversity. It was truly one moment in time when we felt a healing unity. Of such is Zion made.<br><br>The second story is not quite so dramatic, but it is an excellent example of what can happen when people choose to serve each other. In an area largely uninhabited along the banks of Utah's Jordan River, a new community began--first a home here, then a home there. The people who came to this community had a variety of backgrounds. They came from many places and ranged in age from newlyweds to some who were considerably older who had lived in their previous homes for up to 40 years. Stepping out of their comfort zones, they left their former friends and associates behind and formed new relationships. They helped each other build houses; they helped put in sprinkler systems and yards; they worked together to decorate the interiors of their houses. They shared in births, weddings, tragedies, and deaths. Most of them also worshiped together, which helped them unite even more. Through their service to each other they became very close. In fact, one of them called their settlement "The Magic Kingdom," and the name stuck because of the spirit of unity the inhabitants felt.<br><br>As the tide of new homes and new arrivals began to ebb, the people began to turn their attention to outside activities. A wise Relief Society president guided them to extend their service to other people far away. They sent clothing and supplies with a missionary couple from their midst to Primary children in Africa. They provided fruits and vegetables, paper, crayons, and toys for children in a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan. Numerous Eagle Scout projects provided supplies to citizens in far-off lands.<br><br>The entire ward participated in a yearlong humanitarian project. Each month they gathered materials for hygiene kits. The Primary children gathered toothbrushes. The Young Men and Young Women gathered combs. The high priest and elders quorums gathered toothpaste. Each month during Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment evening, the sisters made quilts, hats, mittens, dolls, balls, and tropical bandages. Just before Thanksgiving last year, the Relief Society sisters gathered to assemble the hygiene kits. They discovered they had produced 1,001 hygiene kits, 25 quilts, and untold numbers of dolls, balls, books, and tropical bandages. Their feelings of love and unity in their magic kingdom--i.e., Zion--swelled to a powerful spiritual experience as they rejoiced in their ability to love and serve others. Not only had they begun a Zion society, but they helped others experience it also. Even at this very moment--as we're in this devotional--they are supporting a member of that ward through the loss of a dear one and the funeral.<br><br>The third story I want to share is about Brigham Young University nursing students whom I accompanied for a service/learning semester in Amman, Jordan. I will let the students tell you part of their story through journal entries made as they worked in a government hospital, in the community schools, and in a Palestinian refugee camp.<br><br><i>Faten is a five-month-old infant. When I met Faten she was still struggling. She seemed so distant. Faten was in a corner in a barren room, trapped in an isolette. . . . Because of this she was never held during feeding; she was a poor sucker. She was never held and rarely received physical contact. No wonder her chart said she had brain atrophy. She had no stimulation! I knew I could make a difference. . . . We decided to hold Faten and Ahmed. They needed touch!</i>[Jennifer Cowser]<br><br><i>One of the nurses (our favorite one) came and started to help us when we gave the children their baths. She got us all the supplies and was excited to watch us clean the children. Both Faten and Ahmed needed their heads cleaned. We scrubbed them, and they looked--and I'm sure felt--so much better. A few days later the nurse said Faten was going home because her sucking was much better. I really feel that we helped her. It is very exciting to see progress in the children.</i>[Tiffany Hobbs]<br><br><i>I loved how creative the people in my</i>[community]<i>group were. They put so much work into their health presentations. When they taught the boys about health, they made posters, did role-playing, and involved the boys by asking them questions and having them put things on posters. The boys loved this. They paid attention to the health lessons, and they all wanted to be involved.</i>[Marquelle Wilkinson]<br><br><i>Checking blood sugar among children who had never been tested required creative thinking to do the finger sticks. The BYU students first had to draw their own blood to develop</i>[the children's]<i>trust.</i><br><br><i>The BYU students worked through the Jordan River Foundation to direct at-risk children in learning activities four days a week at Jabal al Nasser, a Palestinian refugee camp.</i><br><br><i>We have taught the kids about wound care, dental care, nutrition, exercise, diabetes, and emotions. I really feel like they have learned what we have been trying to teach.</i>[Laura Murphy]<br><br><i>I have to say this has been one of my most favorite activities we have participated in here in Jordan. I know we are making a difference. These children as so amazing to me. They obviously do not live under the best conditions, but they are happy and so well behaved. . . . What does the future hold for these children? I don't know, but I know that we are able to brighten their lives each time we are with them, and my prayers will be with them always.</i>[Melissa Everton]<br><br><i>All in all, the most important thing I learned from my time at Jabal al Nasser is that love is the universal language. Even if they cannot understand what we are saying, these children know we . . . love them. They feel comfortable with us. . . . We have helped these children find a haven--a place they can come to where they feel adored. We hope they can understand, even in a small way, that they are of infinite worth.</i>[Heidi Thyre]<br><br>This experience has had a lasting influence on these former students. They began a Zion experience--living and working together in Jordan--which continues even now as they share life with each other. Those they served in Jordan were able to feel that spirit of unity as well.<br><br>As we contemplate the connection between these three groups of people and their stories, we find a common theme: that of moving beyond one's comfort zone to help those who are in need. In the First Presidency message in January, President Monson quoted the following story about Christ from Luke:<br><br><i>A certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</i><br><br><i>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</i><br><br><i>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</i>[Luke 10:25–27]<br><br>In this chapter of Luke, Christ then recounted the parable of the good Samaritan and asked the lawyer:<br><br><i>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</i><br><br><i>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</i>[Luke 10:36–37]<br><br>"Times change, the years roll by, circumstances vary--but the Master's counsel to the lawyer applies to you and to me just as surely as though we heard His voice speaking directly to us" (Thomas S. Monson, "The Way of the Master,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 2003, 3).<br><br>Each of the groups we have discussed was trying to follow the Savior's admonition, as President Monson has counseled us.<br><br>Reinforcing this principle in the February 2003<i>Ensign,</i>President Faust said:<br><br><i>Our objective is to have everyone feel the security, love, and warm embrace of the gospel. The divine Redeemer gave us the pattern for achieving this when He commanded: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. . . . Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 22:37, 39). . . .</i><br><br><i>As we plan to reach, involve, and serve the one, the principles to be kept before us on a panoramic screen in heroic size are the two great injunctions of the Savior to all of His children: love and serve God and love and serve our fellowmen.</i>[James E. Faust, "Strengthening the Inner Self,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 2003, 3]<br><br>Remember President Bateman's discussion about the purpose of Brigham Young University: that students are being prepared to enter the world. And remember President Wilkinson's charge to faculty: proper academic development and proper spiritual development for students. Many of us came from families where service to others was a regular part of our lives. BYU can reinforce those lessons already learned. Some of us, however, did not have that luxury. For us, BYU offers the opportunity to learn the lessons now: how to love and serve God and how to love and serve our fellowmen.<br><br>If we are to inherit eternal life, we must become a Zion society--of one heart and one mind. Here at Brigham Young University, as a community of scholars and students, we can practice these principles. Our role as faculty is to prepare you to be powerful, positive, contributing members to your profession--whatever that may be--and to help you experience the joy of living in a Zion society and providing service to others. Our professions will one day cease to exist as we now know them, but love and service will not. As we share in this microcosm of the Church and prepare to travel to the four corners of the earth, let us remember that the Lord said, "All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal" (D&amp;amp;C 29:34).<br><br>I challenge all of us to "enter to learn; go forth to serve." We may not serve in the manner that was exemplified in the three stories I told. Sometimes service is holding a child's hand. Sometimes service is helping a roommate. Sometimes service is bringing chocolate chip cookies to my house, as my good friend Marty did last night. We have great opportunities because of the experiences that we share, and we can bring each other forward as we enter to learn and go forth to serve. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>A.

<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be here with us and that you and I will be edified and instructed from above. I have prayerfully sought the Lord's guidance as I have prepared to speak to you. I am convinced that the unity of the themes that have been addressed to large audiences on this campus in the past 10 days is not a matter of coincidence. As the featured speaker of the Freedom Festival patriotic service, Sheri Dew reminded us that where much is given much is expected. Elaine Bond, last week's devotional speaker, also spoke of our duty and our opportunity to serve our brothers and sisters. I, too, have been guided toward a similar focus.<br><br>Let me begin by taking us back to the last week of the Lord's mortal ministry. The Savior had just delivered a stinging rebuke to hypocritical scribes and Pharisees who, instead of serving God and feeding the flock, had given themselves over to seeking the honors of men. Jesus and His disciples had retired across the Kidron Valley to the Mount of Olives, from where they could look down on the temple and surrounding buildings. From this vantage point--the place from which the Lord would soon ascend into heaven and the place to which He will return as King of Kings and Lord of Lords--the Good Shepherd warned His under-shepherds of trouble ahead and taught them key principles that will help His followers prepare for His much-anticipated return.<br><br>He spoke of tribulation and persecution. He said that there would be "wars, and rumors of wars. . . . For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes. . . . And . . . because iniquity shall abound, the love of men shall wax cold." But "the end . . . , or the destruction of the wicked," will not come until the "Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world" (JS--Matthew 1:28–31). He cautioned us to not despair and charged us to remain vigilant. He then asked, "Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?" (Matthew 24:45). In other words, the faithful and wise servant feeds the sheep. The Lord concluded His counsel with three important parables: the parable of the ten virgins; the parable of the talents; and the parable of the sheep and the goats--this last driving home the importance of serving, of feeding the flock.<br><br><i>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:31–36]<br><br>I am grateful that the Lord has given us such specific guidance to help us find peace in troubled times and to help us know what we need to do--and do we must if we wish to be among those who hear the Lord say: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant . . . : enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:21).<br><br>As we hear of wars and rumors of war, as natural disasters increase, as old and new diseases spread, as iniquity abounds, even Saints are prone to give into the inclinations of the natural man and hunker down and avoid the battle against evil that we came to this earth to fight. As long as one's relatives, friends, and neighbors are safe and sound, it's tempting to write off "the world" and sit back and hope that the Lord comes soon. Brothers and sisters, if our bowels are not filled with charity for the whole world, we have not understood the parable of the good Samaritan. If we shun the fight, our lamps are likely to run out of oil, and before we know it, we may find the door shut before us and hear the Lord say to our request to enter, "I know you not" (Matthew 25:12).<br><br>No one can be faulted for hoping that the coming of the Lord is nigh. What we must guard against is the tendency to assume that it is too late for us to make a difference. We must pray for love to replace fear, for "there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18). As the Prophet Joseph Smith observed, "A man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race" (<i>HC</i>4:227).<br><br>As disciples of Christ we cannot give up. We have been commanded to seek peace. We have been told, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you," and we must follow these teachings if we would be worthy to be called the children of Him who "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matthew 5:44–45). Indeed, "blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" (Matthew 5:9).<br><br>I want to tell you about some peacemakers. It has been my great privilege over the years to associate with hundreds of students committed to working for peace. With surprising regularity students and others knock on my door or call and say, "You may find this strange, but I feel that I am supposed to study Arabic." These people, young and old, all have one thing in common: a strong desire to serve the Lord and work toward a better world. Some are only with us for a semester whereas others spend years and achieve impressive levels of fluency. All are peacemakers, bridge builders. Few things soften a person's heart toward a people like learning their language.<br><br>Let me tell you one student's story. In 1997 Alicia's family moved to Jerusalem as a result of her father's assignment to teach at the BYU Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies. While there she had the opportunity to travel to Jordan and attend church meetings with the members of the Amman Branch. She was frustrated that she could not speak with them and vowed that she would learn Arabic. True to her word, she enrolled in Arabic 101 the first semester of her freshman year here.<br><br>Like many students Alicia found Arabic challenging, but she pushed on, looking forward to returning to Jerusalem in January of 2001 to participate in our winter/spring intensive Arabic program. Less than three months before our scheduled departure, violence broke out in Jerusalem and quickly spun out of control. No students have been sent to Jerusalem since. As a result of remarkable prior events, however, our students ended up spending winter semester in Syria, a land where few Americans go.<br><br>Once in Damascus, the students applied themselves to learning Arabic. With the help of excellent teachers and good friends they gradually acquired facility in the language. Syrians are particularly proud of their language and were deeply impressed to see Americans striving to learn it. Thousands, if not millions, came to know about our students, who were regularly featured on radio and TV and in newspapers. Everywhere the students went, people recognized them.<br><br>All of the students spent time serving in the community. Of one such experience Alicia wrote in her journal:<br><br><i>This morning before classes we did service at the handicapped school again. As we entered the gates, as with all other mornings, about 20 or so little Down syndrome kids raced toward us with huge smiles and outstretched arms. We began the routine of the morning with exercises and the national anthem of Syria and then went off to class. As we filed away to classes I was pulled away by a messenger who had been sent to tell me that the director of the school wanted to see me. I followed her to a room where the director and other administrators were anxiously waiting. . . . The principal informed me that their school was to participate in a Mother's Day program where numerous government officials would be in attendance. He asked if I knew any children's songs about mothers that the children could perform. . . . All that I had to draw from were the Primary songs of the Church that I had learned and sung to my mother as a child.</i><br><br><i>"Yes, I know some Mother's Day songs," I replied.</i><br><br><i>"Good. Will you sing one for us?" he asked.</i><br><br><i>I was startled. They all sat quietly and waited for the impromptu performance. I motioned to my colleague across the hall to come join me. Then she and I stood and sang. With no practice or prior notice we sang our hearts out. And as we did so, I felt certain that our voices were amplified by the power of heaven. We sang with the voices of angels resonating through the stone-arched walkways of this little school. A spirit of peace descended upon all present. At the close of our performance the director complimented us and asked if we would teach our songs to the children to perform on Mother's Day. We accepted and went to work. For months we practiced, and finally the day of performance arrived.</i><br><br><i>As we waited for our turn to perform, we watched the performance of other schools. Instead of the sweet love-filled holiday I had expected, this had played out instead to be a political rally. Mothers and children, infuriated by their separation from one another by the Israeli occupation of the Golan, chanted out calls of war and pledges to reclaim what had been taken from them.</i><br><br><i>The children walked on stage with guns, flags, and signs of protest. The listening crowd cheered. I began to panic, realizing that it was almost our turn to perform. What we had to offer was such a contrast to what had been presented thus far. Yet there was nothing to do but to simply go on and pray that all would go well. . . . We stood on stage and . . . thanked God in heaven for sending us to our dear mothers. We sang of goodness, light, and peace. . . . A silence fell on the crowd, and for a brief moment the anguish and hate were lifted.</i><br><br><i>All in attendance felt of the peace that emanated from our simple Primary songs. Though it was just a Mother's Day program, for me it was a grand experience. During this performance I came to understand a portion of the pain that these Syrians had experienced, and through our songs we offered to them the healing balm of the Spirit and peace. A bridge of understanding had been built between us, and our message to each other was burned into each others' hearts.</i><br><br>In April our group spent a few days visiting Lebanon. We met with the Beirut Branch for church meetings. The room that serves as the chapel was filled to overflowing. The students were thrilled to hear (and understand!) talks given in Arabic and to participate in Sunday School. In a combined priesthood/Relief Society meeting, Nabil Assouad, the branch president, spoke for a few minutes and then turned the time over to the students to share their testimonies. One after another they rose and bore testimony. The Spirit was powerfully present. Alicia spoke of how she had prayed in her first visit to the Amman branch that she would be able to learn Arabic and participate in the meetings. She wept as she thanked God.<br><br>After the meetings and after some delicious food provided by the members, students and members got to know each other better. Both the Lebanese Saints and the students were hungry for each other's company, the Beirut Branch being small and the students having had little or no contact with other members of the Church. The students had also missed having access to a piano, so one student soon began playing hymns and Primary songs. A number of students began to sing along. Other students and local members pulled up chairs to listen. Later that day I wrote in my journal, "I was very touched at the sight. Here we were, in Beirut, symbol [for the West] of all that's gone wrong in the region, but we were united in love and peace, praising God."<br><br>We returned to Damascus to participate in a symposium on Islamic philosophy jointly sponsored by Damascus University and BYU. Syrian professors, students, dignitaries, and media representatives packed the large room and stood in the hall as President Bateman emphasized the common values and the deep faith in God that the Syrian people and the Latter-day Saints share. Dr. Mouaffak Daaboul, academic vice president of the University of Damascus, opened the conference by expressing his admiration for BYU and for the Church and its members, recounting personal details of his visit to Utah to attend the Conference on the Family. He reflected on memories of a family home evening here that, left him deeply touched. He concluded his talk by expressing his love for the BYU students and then reading from letters that they had written in Arabic to the president of Syria about their experiences.<br><br>One student had written, "What surprised me was the friendliness of the Syrians--in my view the Syrians are the gentlest nation I have ever met. Syrians always have the time to sit and talk with us. People are the most important thing in their lives." Dr. Daaboul concluded his remarks by holding the students up as an ideal for all to emulate in order to build bridges of understanding between the peoples of the world.<br><br>A few days later the students bid farewell to Syria, some to return to the U.S. and others to continue on for additional study in Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, and Spain. In each of the three branches of the Church in Jordan the students presented special programs. Returning to Amman meant that Alicia had come full circle and was finally able to communicate with the Saints there. Members and their friends thrilled to mingle with young American members who spoke their language and valued their culture. One of the senior missionaries serving there told me that the students accomplished more in a few days than he would in 18 months. We went on to similar experiences with the Saints in Cairo. Many of the students commented that these opportunities to strengthen Arab members of the Church were the high point of their Study Abroad experience.<br><br>Starting our trip in Istanbul and then covering much of the Mediterranean gave the students a rare feel for Muslim, Jewish, and Christian history and culture. Spain was a particularly fitting conclusion to the trip, it being the site of the culmination of the Umayyad Empire, which was originally based in Damascus. As a result, Spain is home to some of the greatest achievements of Islamic civilization--but more on this in a moment.<br><br>Our students returned home just two months before the tragic events of September 11. I am convinced that they were sent to Damascus and other places by a loving Father in Heaven who knows all things. They softened many hearts, and their hearts were filled with love and understanding. Individuals can make a critical difference in the course of history. I believe that the world is a better place and that it will be a better place because of what these students and others have done, what they are doing, and what they will yet do. Many of them are or will be in positions of responsibility that will allow them to be a force for good, for peace, for understanding. They will likely make an even greater contribution through their children.<br><br>Weeks after her return to the U.S., Alicia left to serve in the Singapore Mission, from which she returned in January. She recently wrote me:<br><br><i>For the first year of my mission I served among the Muslim people in countries ruled by Islamic governments. Although we were not generally permitted to teach Muslims, there were numerous occasions where I had opportunities to build bridges. . . . I attended several Islamic conferences and was able to speak with the conference participants (often in Arabic) and tell them of my experiences in Jerusalem, Syria, and other places. . . . They were interested in our Study Abroad program. They were interested in my love for the Muslim people and expressed a desire for future programs to their countries so that students will likewise come to understand and love them as I do the people of Syria. I was daunted by the fact that I would be the sole representative there. However, I was comforted by remembering that the Lord had prepared me through experiences such as the Islamic Translation Series Conference in Damascus, where I, with the other students, was able to represent our student program and answer questions that I would later be asked again as I stood on my own in Malaysia. I have no doubt that those experiences were in the plan of the Lord and that He prepared me for them.</i><br><br>As I prepared to speak to you, I was struck by the parallels between the sons of Mosiah and students like Alicia. Our world desperately needs more sons and daughters of Mosiah--people who will patiently and lovingly serve in the courts of modern-day Lamoni's. We cannot nor should we all book passage for exotic lands tomorrow, but we can prepare our hearts and prepare our children's hearts. We can pray, we can yearn, we can learn, and we can refuse to give up on any of our Father's children.<br><br>Let us look at another example from the Book of Mormon--that of Mormon himself, soldier and peace seeker. He never gave up--even when it was apparent that he could do no more for those of his generation. Shortly before he was killed by the Lamanites, he addressed their descendants. His last words of loving counsel are written to future generations of Lamanites, and the last words of his son are likewise addressed to the children of those who killed his father. This wonderful final chapter of the Book of Mormon speaks of testimony; of gifts of the Spirit; of faith, hope, and charity; of covenants and sanctification. Moroni opens this final outpouring of love and counsel by saying, "Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the Lamanites" (Moroni 10:1). "My brethren!" We, too, must press on in our discipleship, praying for that gift of charity that will enable us to see every man as a brother and every woman as a sister.<br><br>Let us return to our group's final days in Spain. After months of visiting some of the great monuments of Islamic architecture, the students stood in front of the Madrid Temple. They readily recognized Islamic elements in that beautiful edifice.<br><br>Islamic influence on LDS temple architecture may come as something of a surprise to some of you. Let me explain. For nearly 800 years much of what is now Spain was part of the Islamic world. As a result, the pervasive influence of Arab culture is very much a part of Spain. For example, my tie is a gift that my students bought for me in Toledo. Its distinctive repeating geometric design could have come straight from the walls of a mosque or palace in various parts of the Muslim world.<br><br>Now let's consider influences involved in a beautiful window in the Madrid Temple. The central star configurations reflect the prolific use of star motifs in Islamic art and architecture. Muslims inherited a love of geometric cosmic symbolism from the Byzantine and Greco-Roman world--which can, in turn, be traced back to ancient Egyptian influences. For example, star patterns appear in the marble inlay of important Umayyad monuments such as the Dome of the Rock and especially in the domes of the Great Mosque in Cordoba.<br><br>Also, the nave of the Cappella Palatina, a 12th-century church in Palermo, Italy, copies Fatimid Egyptian style. All of these are exercises in cosmic geometry that pull the human soul back to its origins and God.<sup>1</sup><br><br>One could dismiss such Islamic influences in the design of the Madrid Temple as being merely a case of localization. Temples typically reflect aspects of the region in which they are built. I find the Islamic influence on the architecture of the Madrid Temple deeply symbolic of the role that the prophet Muhammad and Islamic civilization played in laying the groundwork for the Restoration, which is eventually to "gather together . . . all things in Christ" (Ephesians 1:10).<br><br>The Lord works in mysterious ways. Latter-day Saints universally acknowledge the important preparatory role played by the Reformation. If not for the work of reformers like Martin Luther, who paved the way for religious freedom, Joseph Smith would have been burned at the stake long before Peter, James, and John could confer priesthood keys on him.<br><br>The Reformation did not take place in a vacuum. Critical events in history prepared the way. I believe that the advent of Islam is one important factor that contributed considerably to making a better world, including preparing the way for the Reformation and the Restoration. In 1978 the First Presidency acknowledged the important role of the prophet Muhammad and others when they issued this statement:<br><br><i>The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals. . . . We believe that God has given and will give to all peoples sufficient knowledge to help them on their way to eternal salvation.</i>["Statement of the First Presidency Regarding God's Love for All Mankind," 15 February 1978]<br><br>Many Latter-day Saints are of the opinion that little or nothing of note took place between the time of the Apostasy and the Renaissance. They rarely stop to consider the factors that transformed western Europe from a backward collection of quarreling tribes into an economic, scientific, and cultural powerhouse.<br><br>Time permits noting only a few ways in which Islamic civilization has directly and indirectly blessed our lives. Islam provided a much-needed challenge to a Christianity that was becoming more and more corrupt. It played a crucial role in preserving and significantly improving on the achievements of Persian, Indian, Greek, and other civilizations. In the words of my colleague Professor Daniel Peterson:<br><br><i>The civilization that grew out of the Arab conquests and the spread of Islam was, for several centuries, the undisputed leader of the world in virtually every field of intellectual activity. . . . Arabic was the language of science and mathematics, and of philosophy.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars and scientists working together made revolutionary breakthroughs. Muslim centers of learning in Spain and Sicily provided western Europe with easy access to knowledge and methods that helped to fuel the Renaissance. Latin translations of Arabic medical and philosophical textbooks were required reading in European universities. Arab navigational tools and techniques facilitated early European exploration of the globe. Many educated Europeans learned Arabic to gain direct access to the intellectual treasures of Islamic civilization. One of these was Martin Luther, who made a careful study of the Qur'an.<br><br>I am sure that it is no matter of accident nor luck that Luther and his ideas survived to change the world. Charles V, the most powerful European monarch and the newly proclaimed recipient of the title Holy Roman Emperor, condemned Luther as a heretic. A key factor in preventing Charles V from succeeding in executing Luther and squelching the Protestant movement was the fact that Ottoman armies were threatening to overrun Austria. Indeed, "the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people" (Alma 24:27).<br><br>Let me add that Muslims and peoples of many other faiths continue to bless our lives. Our closest allies in the struggle to strengthen the family are our Muslim and Catholic brothers and sisters. My faith and the faith of my wife and children have been greatly strengthened through our association with faithful Muslims and others. I consider my friend and colleague Professor Muhammad Eissa, who will give the benediction, to be something of a modern Colonel Kane. He has come to the rescue and blessed me, the university, and the Church time and time again. Someday, when all things are revealed, I am confident that we will marvel at the debt we owe to peoples all across the earth, peoples we never dreamed of stopping to thank.<br><br>Now back to our little group in Madrid. As we watched the last rays of the sun fade and the temple began to glow brighter and brighter, I observed that the Islamic elements before our eyes seemed a fitting way to honor the culture that passed on light that would culminate in the Restoration. How appropriate it is that the house of the Lord--which exists to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers--brings together contributions from all of Abraham's children.<br><br>Now let us turn to the oldest section of the Doctrine and Covenants: section 2. Of all that Moroni, the peace seeker, said to young Joseph during his visits to the Smith home, only this prophecy was privileged a section of its own:<br><br><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i><br><br><i>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 2:2–3]<br><br>Ten years later the Lord instructed His beleaguered Saints: "Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace, and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers to the children" (D&amp;amp;C 98:16).<br><br>Let us remember that "all are alike unto God" (2 Nephi 26:33) and that the entire world is populated by sons and daughters of God--sons and daughters who chose Him and His plan. Even if we never serve in Lamoni's court, let us do what we can where we are and remember that the fervent prayer of a righteous person "availeth much" (James 5:16). Let us look to Father Abraham and remember the promises made to him and to us. Let us do as he did and become a blessing to all nations that it may be written of us as it was of the sons of Mosiah:<br><br><i>And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</i><br><br><i>And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</i>[Mosiah 27:36–37]<br><br>That we may ever be found publishing peace is my prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>R. Kirk Belnap was a BYU associate professor of Arabic and director of the National Middle East Language Resource Center when this devotional address was delivered on 8 July 2003.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. This devotional address would not have been possible without the contributions of many teachers, colleagues, students, and others over the years. Special thanks, however, are due Professor Cynthia Finlayson for her assistance in helping me to better understand architectural elements of the Madrid Temple and other European edifices.<br><br>2. Daniel Peterson,<i>Abraham Divided: An LDS Perspective on the Middle East,</i>rev. expanded ed. (Salt Lake City: Aspen Books, 1995), 244. This book is an excellent introduction.

<h1> Habits and Dispositions - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Humans are creatures of habit. We all have habits that affect the way we dress and groom ourselves, how and what we eat, how we travel to the university each day, and how we go about our work. In addition we have recreational and entertainment habits, reading and study habits, and even prayer habits. Just as we have habitual ways of behaving, we also have habitual ways of thinking. President Howard W. Hunter acknowledged the existence of thinking habits when he declared, "Outward circumstances do not determine the course of our lives as much as the thoughts that habitually occupy our minds."<sup>1</sup><br><br>In 1910 John Dewey wrote the book<i>How We Think,</i>in which he described some of the ways that thinking habits influence the way people think. In recent years other scholars have elaborated on the idea of thinking habits.<sup>2</sup><br><br>Scholars who have tried to create programs designed to teach people to think better have discovered that many people already possess the skills needed to think effectively. What they lacked was not the necessary abilities but the commitment and the willingness to invest their time and effort in using the thinking skills they had already acquired. This finding led researchers to conclude that people have dispositions that influence the way they think.<sup>3</sup>Consequently, many scholars today believe that effective thinking includes both intellectual skills and positive dispositions regarding the use of such skills. For my purposes today, I shall treat habits of mind and thinking dispositions as being essentially synonymous and interchangeable.<br><br>Shari Tishman and her colleagues at Harvard define thinking dispositions as "abiding tendencies toward distinct patterns of thinking behaviors."<sup>4</sup>Hence a thinking disposition is a consistent tendency or inclination to think in certain ways. Thinking dispositions are somewhat stable and generalizable. To be disposed to think in a certain manner means that an individual has a consistent tendency to employ the same thinking pattern in different situations and on different occasions. For example, some people are disposed to be analytical and skeptical. They typically try to examine the available evidence before deciding whether to accept a proposition. Other people may be prone to rationalize. They make up their mind first and then search for evidence to support their chosen point of view while ignoring any evidence to the contrary.<sup>5</sup><br><br>Let me call your attention to an instance in the New Testament that provides an interesting example of a thinking habit. When Jesus described the Pharisees as being "blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel" (Matthew 23:24), he was doing more than just using figurative language. He was accusing them of having a tendency to make mountains out of molehills when it was to their advantage, and to make molehills out of mountains when that was to their advantage. In other words, He was claiming that they exaggerated trivial matters into unnecessarily complex issues while downplaying weightier questions into trivial and insignificant concerns. This manipulative mindset was a thinking habit on the part of many Pharisees and was one of the problems that aroused Jesus' indignation toward them.<br><br>Now consider the interesting assertion made by Alma the Younger in Alma 12:14:<br><br><i>For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us.</i><br><br>Alma declared that people will be judged by their thoughts as well as by their behavior.<br><br>I believe that Alma's statement in this verse refers more to the thinking habits and dispositions that characterize our minds than to discrete, isolated thoughts.<br><br>One reason the Lord will hold us accountable for our thoughts is because of the relationship between a person's thinking habits and his character. This relationship is taught in Proverbs 23:7. We typically replace the pronoun in this passage and paraphrase the verse to read "As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he." This scripture teaches that we become what we think. In the words of James Allen, "A man is literally<i>what he thinks,</i>his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts."<sup>6</sup><br><br>The verb<i>thinketh</i>in Proverbs 23:7 is expressed in the progressive tense, suggesting that this passage refers more to our ongoing thinking habits than to isolated, individual thoughts that temporarily occupy our minds. It is a person's mental habits and thinking dispositions that will largely determine his or her character rather than random, isolated thoughts.<br><h2><b>Counterproductive Habits of Mind</b></h2><br>Now I would like to get specific and focus on five examples of thinking habits that are counterproductive.<br><h3><strong><i>1. Lustful thinking</i></strong></h3><br>We live in a time when it is difficult to avoid being exposed to risqué images and materials and sexual innuendo, but I encourage you to avoid harboring thoughts about anything that is lewd, coarse, obscene, or vulgar. Unwanted thoughts are like stray cats that trespass across our yards. You may not be successful in keeping them out completely, but a single thought that sneaks into your mind will not do much harm unless you invite it to linger and treat it as a welcome guest rather than as an intruder. Do not feed these strangers. Do not nurture a friendship with them. Do not allow yourself to develop the habit of entertaining them. Treat them as intruders and take affirmative steps to avoid mingling with them.<br><h3><strong><i>2. Coveting</i></strong></h3><br>Coveting is another sin that we commit in our minds. It, too, can become a habit. Coveting is a form of selfish thinking that occurs when a person develops an inordinate desire to obtain the possessions, position, or status attained by someone else. Some of us have a tendency to dismiss coveting as a trivial matter, but it is specifically forbidden by the Lord in the Ten Commandments (see Exodus 20:17). Note that the injunction against covetous thinking is one of the most detailed of the Ten Commandments.<br><h3><strong><i>3. Bearing a Grudge</i></strong></h3><br>The third thinking disposition that I want to describe involves the tendency to remember events that we ought to forget. Some of us have developed the habit of remembering incidents from the past when someone offended us or took advantage of us. Believing that we were wrongfully victimized, we replay the incident over and over again in our minds and often make it worse that it really was. Consequently we come to resent the person who perpetrated the wrong, and we develop a grudge against them. We not only harbor the grudge in our minds, but we nurse it, believing that by doing so we somehow obtain retribution.<br><br>Permitting yourself to be preoccupied with feelings of resentment and revenge will not hurt the other person. Instead, it will likely cause you to become bitter and spiteful. If you allow these thoughts and feelings to continue, they will canker your soul. Remember the words of the Lord in D&amp;amp;C 64:9: "He that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin."<br><h3><strong><i>4. Piling Pity upon Oneself</i></strong></h3><br>The habit of feeling sorry for yourself and engaging in self-pity is another counterproductive habit in which some of us regularly engage. We all experience the ups and downs of life, and we all have a tendency to feel discouraged once in a while. But sometimes we allow this discouragement to feed upon itself. We focus on the negative and talk ourselves into the downward spiral of believing that we are no good and that we can't do anything right. We pile pity upon ourselves and permit our initial discouragement to develop into despondency and despair.<br><br>Take affirmative steps to avoid this downward cycle. Moods like sadness, gloom, anxiety, and anger do not just passively descend upon a person like rain without that person having some control over them. Your thoughts affect your feelings, and "you can change the way you feel by [changing the way] you think."<sup>7</sup>Do not allow yourself to be victimized by your own thinking.<br><h3><strong><i>5. Ignoring the Impact of Your Thinking on the Lives of Others</i></strong></h3><br>Sometimes we allow ourselves to mistakenly believe that what we think and how we think is purely a personal matter that has no effect on others. That idea is not only naïve but false.<br><br>None of us lives in a vacuum completely isolated from other people. Instead we interact with others on an ongoing basis. In this sense life is like a chess game. The thoughts and the moves of each player are influenced by the thoughts and the moves of the other player. Whether you like it or not, how and what you think is influenced by the thinking of others with whom you associate. Conversely, your thoughts and thinking habits will influence their thoughts and actions. This interdependence is emphasized by the following quotation: "Human beings are not only<i>moral agents</i>or subjects of moral action, but also<i>moral patients</i>, or subjects which are acted upon and affected by what they and others do."<sup>8</sup><br><br>Because of our God-given moral agency, we have freedom of choice and the right to make our own decisions. However, in addition, each of us is a<i>moral patient</i>in the sense that we are acted upon and influenced by the ways in which others think and act.<br><br>In recent years I have come to realize that some of my thinking habits have been directly impacted by other influential persons in my life, including my parents, my wife, and some outstanding teachers, colleagues, church leaders, and neighbors. This insight is sobering because it has helped me realize that how and what I think will likely have an impact upon others, even when I don't intend it to do so. May I suggest that the same is true with you. Be careful about how and what you think, because it is likely to have both intended and unintended effects on others. The person who believes that how and what he thinks has no impact on others is not only selfish but irresponsible.<br><br>The five thinking habits that I have discussed so far are not the only ones that are negative and counterproductive. We could discuss many other examples, but we don't have time. If you currently have one or more of these destructive habits, I urge you to change your customary ways of thinking. Repent! We tend to believe that repentance is needed only when we have committed a sinful act, but repentance also applies to how and what we think. In fact, the word<i>repent,</i>as used in the New Testament, comes from a Greek verb that literally means "to change one's mind or purpose."<sup>9</sup>Complete repentance involves more than refraining from discrete acts of sinful behavior that you committed sometime in the past. It involves changing your thinking habits and dispositions as well. Changing your thinking patterns will likely lead to changes in your behavioral patterns.<br><h2><b>Thinking in Which We Ought to Engage</b></h2><br>We have spent enough time focusing on the kinds of thinking you should avoid. Now let's see what the scriptures admonish us to think about. Two scriptures help us describe the types of thinking in which we ought to engage. First, consider the imperative presented in D&amp;amp;C 121:45. The verb<i>let</i>is often interpreted as being synonymous with<i>allow</i>or<i>permit</i>, but the dictionary suggests that<i>let</i>also means "to cause to: make."<sup>10</sup>So the statement "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly" is a command directing members of the Church to take charge of their thoughts and cause them to be more virtuous.<br><br>Second, consider a similar directive given by the Apostle Paul in Philippians 4:8:<br><br><i>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</i><br><br>The structure and meaning of this long verse is not as complex as it first appears. To simplify the structure and reveal the meaning, let's temporarily remove the long series of clauses in the middle of the verse and insert ellipses in their place. Simplified in this manner, the verse reads: "Finally, brethren, . . . think on these things."<br><br>We could simplify the sentence even further by removing all but the subject and the verb. So, in its simplest form this lengthy sentence is an imperative statement encouraging members of the Church to think.<br><br>The eight clauses that we temporarily removed specify the kinds of things Paul admonished the Philippians to think about. They include:<br><br>1. Whatsoever things are true,<br>2. Whatsoever things are honest,<br>3. Whatsoever things are just,<br>4. Whatsoever things are pure,<br>5. Whatsoever things are lovely,<br>6. Whatsoever things are of good report,<br>7. Any virtue,<br>8. [Anything that is] praise [worthy].<br><br>Both the Bible and the Book of Mormon teach the need for every person to be born again. The Book of Mormon describes this spiritual rebirth as a "mighty change" of heart (Mosiah 5:2; Alma 5:14). This process not only includes changes in our innermost feelings and desires, it also presupposes big changes in our thinking habits and dispositions. The Apostle Paul's directive in Romans 12:1–2 emphasizes this need to change the way we habitually think and what we think about. He instructed the Romans, "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind" (verse 2).<br><br>Various scholars and curriculum reformers have recommended lists of productive thinking habits and dispositions that students in universities and public schools should be taught to develop.<sup>11</sup>We don't have time to discuss many of them, but I would like focus on two thinking habits and dispositions that are particularly relevant for students and faculty at a university.<br><h2><b>Two Useful Thinking Habits</b></h2><br><h3><strong><i>Seek Understanding</i></strong></h3><br>John Biggs and several other scholars have distinguished between two different approaches to learning that they call the "surface approach" and the "deep approach." The surface approach occurs when a student tries to complete an assigned learning task with minimum effort while giving the appearance of having properly learned what was expected. Learning to rotely recite the verbatim definition of a concept or principle without any understanding of it is one example of the surface approach. Some forms of factual knowledge need to be memorized, but memorization becomes a surface approach when a student relies on it instead of striving to understand the ideas to be learned.<sup>12</sup><br><br>One of the mistakes students often make is to substitute memorization in place of understanding. I urge you to develop the habit of striving for understanding whenever you study. Seek to understand the basic ideas, procedures, and criteria that you encounter in whatever subject you are studying. In the language of the scriptures, "with all thy getting get understanding" (Proverbs 4:7).<br><br>Understanding cannot be developed without thinking. To understand a new topic you must thoughtfully process the new ideas you encounter and relate them to your prior knowledge. You must integrate isolated bits and pieces of information into some meaningful structure or framework.<br><br>Understanding has three important advantages in comparison to rote knowledge. First, understanding is enabling.<sup>13</sup>The person who possesses understanding is able to use his knowledge flexibly and adaptively. Understanding provides new concepts, principles, procedures, and criteria to<i>think with</i>. By<i>thinking with</i>these new ideas, the person who has developed understanding is able to (1) explain relationships, (2) make predictions, and (3) solve problems that he could not have done without this new conceptual knowledge. To the extent that the person's understanding is inaccurate or incomplete, his thinking will be misleading or limited. Hence, a person's understanding shapes his thinking.<br><br>The second advantage is that understanding is generative. By<i>thinking about</i>the concepts, principles, procedures, and criteria that he has come to understand, the understanding person is better able to recognize relationships, construct meaningful analogies, generate new insights, formulate productive questions, and conduct further inquiry activities. In contrast to the inert nature of factual knowledge, understanding is productive. In other words, understanding provides a basis for acquiring a new and deeper understanding.<br><br>A third advantage of understanding is that it tends to have more staying power. Rote memorization of factual information may get you past a test, but you likely will not retain this information very long afterwards. Understanding is more likely to result in learning that lasts.<sup>14</sup><br><h3><strong><i>Monitor and Manage Your Own Thinking</i></strong></h3><br>Another useful habit to develop is to learn how to more effectively monitor and manage your thinking. Mindful people think about their own thinking. They consciously strive to be aware of the thinking strategies and processes that they use when they try to solve a problem or accomplish a cognitively demanding task. In addition, they evaluate the products of their thinking processes. They question their assumptions, check their inferences, and attempt to validate their interpretations and conclusions. They try to distinguish between paths in their thought processes that seem to be leading them toward a successful solution and any that might seem to be leading them in an unsuccessful direction.<br><br>Psychologists use the noun<i>metacognition</i>to refer to this kind of thinking about one's own thinking.<sup>15</sup>Metacognition is typically conceptualized as including two complementary components. The first is to be aware of your own thinking processes. The second is to monitor, evaluate, and regulate those processes. I encourage you to become proficient in performing both of these aspects of metacognition. You will be a better student and a better lifelong learner if you become proficient at doing both of these.<br><h2><b>"With All Thy Mind"</b></h2><br>I invite you now to compare two interesting passages from the Bible: one from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament. Deuteronomy 6:5 contains a commandment in which the Israelites were directed to "love the Lord . . . with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." According to the record in Mark 12:30, Jesus quoted this passage from Deuteronomy in response to a scribe who tried to trick Him by asking Him which was the first or greatest commandment in the law.<br><br>If you carefully compare the two passages, you will discover that the New Testament account includes the extra phrase "and with all thy mind" that Jesus appears to have inserted. Matthew's account of this incident includes the same insertion (see Matthew 22:35–37). This textual variation should cause us to "marvel" (D&amp;amp;C 76:18) and to wonder "why?" and "so what?"<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants includes a version of this commandment recorded in section 59, verse 5. This version also includes the added idea that we should love the Lord with our minds.<br><br>I do not know why the extra stipulation to love God with all your mind is included in the New Testament and in the Doctrine and Covenants, but I believe it is a noteworthy addition that we ought to ponder. Latter-day Saints should remember that D&amp;amp;C 4:2 contains a directive that is similar to the one we have just examined in Mark. Instead of specifying that we should<i>love</i>the Lord, this parallel verse in D&amp;amp;C 4 directs that we "serve him with all [our] heart, might, mind and strength."<br><br>What does it mean to love and serve the Lord with all one's mind? I don't claim to have any profound answers to this question, but I will share with you three simple ideas that represent my current thinking.<br><br>First, Jesus declared Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). Therefore, to love Him with all your mind is to devote all your intellectual skills and mental capacities to learning and knowing the truth. Second, to love Him with all your mind means to "always remember Him"(D&amp;amp;C 20:77, 79) and to make a habit of thinking about Him and His teachings so that He has an active presence and influence in your mind. Third, to love and serve Him with all your mind is to consciously choose to be His disciple by striving to habitually think the way He would have you think and to do what He would have you do.<br><br>In summary, I suggest that you carefully examine the thinking habits and dispositions that function in your life. Become more aware of them. Monitor and evaluate them in terms of the influence they have upon you. Take steps to manage these habits instead of allowing them to manage you.<br><br>I thank the Lord for blessing us with the ability to think, and I pray that we will all strive to live up to the responsibility that comes with this blessing. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard R Sudweeks was a BYU professor of educational psychology when this devotional address was delivered on 15 July 2003.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.<i>The Teachings of Howard W.

<h1>Cause I Testify - J. Richard Clarke - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your attendance today and for the Spirit you bring and for the faith in my behalf. I need that so very much. Well, you look good to me! Each speaker who addresses the student body must wonder who he's really speaking to. Who of us could predict what you will have become 10 or 20 years from now? Each of you will be famous to somebody. I heard Dr. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School, one of the world's leading business strategists, speak at the BYU forum. He was graduated from this university, and how could he dream then of the prestigious accomplishments that he has since achieved? He is proud of his BYU roots, and so am I.<br><br>The Lord thinks you are great! And because of this, the Lord, your Redeemer, suffered death in the flesh. He voluntarily gave His own life that as many as would believe might become the sons and daughters of God.<br><br>In the world of commerce--of expensive cars and expensive houses--we expect higher prices to assure us of greater value. Who can measure the value of the Savior's sacrifice? When we ponder the horrendous price He paid for our salvation, our sense of personal worth must be enormously enhanced. Shouldn't this be reassurance enough to secure our self-esteem? As children of the royal birthright, you were born to be great.<br><br>When I was a young missionary, I was intrigued with the intellectual giants of the Church who masterfully confounded its critics. I wanted to imitate them. Now, with increased age, I would rather strive for ability to speak simply, with clarity and the Spirit, and not worry about profundity. What about our critics? Well, I'm persuaded they do not need my help to be confounded. They do pretty well on their own.<br><br>In the halls of justice the lives of men and women often hang on the single thread of an eyewitness's testimony--on the accuracy of the testimony and the reliability of the witness.<br><br>It is a pattern followed also in the scriptures: The Lord personally, or through His angels, reveals truths to prophets who bear testimony of Him and declare with power and boldness the true doctrines of salvation. When the prophet's voice is silenced, the people are left to conjecture, debate, and philosophize. The result is spiritual darkness.<br><br>The poet Robert Browning described the silencing of the prophetic voice as he lamented the passing of the last living apostle, John the Beloved, in his poem "A Death in the Desert":<br><br><i>Still, when they scatter, there is left on earth</i><br><i>No one alive who knew (consider this!)</i><br><i>--Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands</i><br><i>That which was from the first, the Word of Life.</i><br><i>How will it be when none more saith "I saw"?</i><br>[1864, lines 129–33; see Hugh Nibley,<i>The World and the Prophets</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1954), 5]<br><br>Prophetic testimony has seldom been popular among the worldly. Pure testimony of revealed truth arouses rejection, scorn, and often wrath from the "natural man."<br><br>The Apostle Paul explained:<br><br><i>We speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth....</i><br><br><i>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2.13,14?lang=eng#12">1 Corinthians 2:13–14</a>]<br><br>Jesus reproved Nicodemus, ruler of the Jews, for his spiritual insensitivity. The Master declared, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/3.11)?lang=eng#p10">John 3:11</a>).<br><br>In the Old Testament the Lord called prophets to testify of Him and to call rebellious Israel to repentance.<br><br>The prophet obeys the Lord and delivers the message. He is not responsible for its acceptance. He is responsible to speak with clarity and spiritual power.<br><br>The world generally does not understand the prophetic commission.<br><br>I was flying to a stake conference years ago and sat by a German engineer. He was in charge of a division of a West German company and was living in Salt Lake City. He was impressed with Utah and its people. When he learned that I was a General Authority of the Church, he inquired, "The one thing I don't understand about you Mormons is: What is this compulsion you seem to have to travel all over the world telling everybody about your religion?" What he didn't say, but I'm sure was on his mind, was "Why don't you stay home and mind your own business?"<br><br>I responded along these lines: "Are you a Christian?"<br><br>He replied, "Yes."<br><br>I asked, "Do you remember the dramatic change that took place in the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus?"<br><br>He said, "Yes."<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"Well, he had this religious experience."<br><br>I said, "He was first obsessed to do everything he could to destroy the church, and then, amazingly, he completely reversed himself and even with greater intensity he became its champion. Quite a turnaround, don't you think?"<br><br>"Yes, it was."<br><br>I said, "Let's turn to Acts 26 and recall that experience."<br><br>We read the account of Paul's defense before King Agrippa, how he, in the middle of the day, had seen a light and heard a voice. The Lord spoke to him, saying:<br><br><i>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</i><br><br><i>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</i><br><br><i>Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles ...,</i><br><br><i>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</i><br><br>[Then Paul said,]<i>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.</i>[Acts 26:15–19]<br><br>I asked my seatmate, "For all practical purposes, did Paul have a viable alternative but to accept the commission he received from the Lord?"<br><br>The man answered, "No."<br><br>I continued: "A similar commission has been given in our day. Let's move the scene ahead some 1,800 years. A young boy is confused by the conflicting claims of the churches of his day. As he pondered his dilemma, he read a simple solution in the epistle of James: 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.' The boy accepted the invitation. He went into the woods on his father's farm and prayed for understanding."<br><br>I read to my friend from the boy's written testimony:<br><br><i>I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me....</i><br><br><i>... Just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, ... which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>... When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.15-17?lang=eng#14">JS--H 1:15–17</a>; emphasis in original]<br><br>I related to the man from West Germany that the boy was told that God's church with a fullness of the truth was not on the earth but that he would be an instrument in its restoration.<br><br>Aside from his family who believed him, the boy found that sharing his experience with the clergy and his neighbors brought ridicule, rejection, and persecution. The Prophet Joseph Smith later stated in response to their behavior:<br><br><i>However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; ... though they should persecute him unto death....</i><br><br><i>So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.24-25?lang=eng#23">JS--H 1:24–25</a>]<br><br>"Now, my friend," I asked the German engineer, "if this young man told the truth, and I am convinced that he did, then did he have any other alternative than to testify, like Paul, of his visitation?"<br><br>The man said, "No, I guess not."<br><br>With deep conviction, I concluded: "That is the reason we are compelled to send our missionaries into the world. We are convinced that through Joseph Smith, the restoration of the kingdom of God has occurred. The heavens have been reopened, divine authority has been bestowed, and the doctrines and ordinances of salvation are again restored."<br><br>The plane landed and we went our separate ways.<br><br>Joseph Smith, the voice of the latter-day kingdom of God, was foreordained to be a new witness for Christ and our Father. Once again a living prophet revealed the power of heaven and confirmed to the world the truth about God and His Son. At that young age he was the world's greatest living authority on Their true nature. He answered the denials of atheism, the doubts of agnosticism, and unraveled the so-called mystery of the Holy Trinity. He saw, and he declared with simple certitude what he saw.<br><br>Believing man has reasoned that the majesty and order of the universe give strong evidence of the reality of God. But that merely demonstrates that an organized intelligence is in control. But who is it?<br><br>In the<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>prepared chiefly by the Prophet, we read that "it was human testimony, and human testimony only, that excited [the] inquiry, in the first instance, ... after the knowledge of God" (<i>Lectures on Faith</i>2:56).<br><br>Compare or contrast the council debates of Nicaea that produced the creedal definition of the Godhead in A.D. 325 with the simple declarations of Joseph the Prophet in 1832:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i><br><br><i>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22-23?lang=eng#p21">D&amp;amp;C 76:22–23</a>]<br><br>And later, in 1843, the Prophet wrote:<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22?lang=eng#p21">D&amp;amp;C 130:22</a>]<br><br>It is our knowledge and testimony of God that draws us heavenward. Pure testimony of Him, born of the Spirit, is the power to change the human heart. Alma demonstrated this when he spearheaded the Nephite reformation.<br><br>Another example comes from the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith. In 1833 the Prophet accompanied Freeman Nickerson to Canada to visit his sons Freeman and Moses. They were received rudely by young Freeman. He said, "Father, ... I had just about as soon you had brought into my home a nest of scorpions and turned them loose upon us. ... I know all about Joe Smith ...; the papers are full of him and his works, and I want none of either. ... But, ... I'll welcome them for your sake."<br><br>Two days passed. Relations became more cordial, but there were no attempts to discuss religion. Freeman had boasted to his wife how he could handle Joe Smith.<br><br>On the evening of the second day, Freeman invited everyone to the living room. "He threw the family Bible on to the table ... with the challenging remark: 'There! Now go to it!'"<br><br>The Prophet did not "go to" the Bible. "Instead, he related his own dramatic experiences, ... told with the utmost simplicity, but with great earnestness."<br><br>Freeman apologized for his rudeness. Before the Prophet left town, 14 people, including the Nickerson brothers, were baptized by the Prophet. (Taken from John Henry Evans,<i>Joseph Smith, an American Prophet</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1936], 86–88.)<br><br>Personal testimony has long been the power of our missionary success.<br><br>Elder Porter shared an article written and passed around by a Protestant minister to help his church members combat the Mormon missionaries. This minister wrote:<br><br><i>Mormons teach that EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN DIRECTLY RECEIVE DIVINE REVELATION, in fact, this is the Mormon method for distinguishing truth from error. Mormon missionaries teach non-Mormons that, in order to know whether or not the Mormon teachings are true, people should PRAY to God to send REVELATION DIRECTLY AND PERSONALLY to them--God will send the Holy Spirit to speak directly to their heart.</i><br><br><i>The importance of this concept cannot be overemphasized because IT IS THE VERY MEANS BY WHICH MORMONS ARE CONVINCED MORMONISM IS TRUE. Though they have heard facts that support the truth of Mormonism and though the doctrines are reasonable, Mormons do not believe primarily for these reasons. Rather, they believe because they are convinced that GOD HIMSELF HAS PERSONALLY TOLD THEM MORMONISM IS TRUE. This is why few Mormons will reject Mormonism simply if they are shown contradictions between the Bible and Mormonism. They conclude the Bible must be in error (it has been changed through the years, etc.), it cannot be Mormonism is wrong, because they know God has told them it is true! This is the TAPROOT OF MORMONISM--the source from which all Mormonism flows. It is the FOUNDATION of the structure of Mormonism. Destroy it and Mormonism fails.</i>[From the files of Elder L. Aldin Porter, the Presidency of the Seventy]<br><br>There are other significant ways in which we bear witness. It is stated that it isn't fair for society to judge the whole Church and the truth of its doctrine by the questionable acts of one member. That's true in a sense, but, taken as a whole, we as a people reflect a composite representation: the fruit of Mormonism. We cannot escape that responsibility. Our actions may be the only chance someone has in forming an opinion about the Church and its people.<br><br>The Lord declared that we should not bear false witness against our neighbors. Are we being true witnesses if our conduct is not congruent with what we profess?<br><br>Before becoming a General Authority, I had a very sobering reminder of this. Our business organization was being honored by our company officers for a successful year. One of the vice presidents, whom I had known well for more than 15 years, called me to the podium during the banquet and announced he had an award for me. He said, "I have been observing you closely under many different circumstances, and I had a personal coat of arms made reflecting what I believe symbolizes the priorities of your life. On the plaque four symbols are represented: Your faith, your family, your profession, and your desire for personal development."<br><br>I was honored and humbled to receive the award but was subdued by the thought that someone had been silently observing and evaluating my conduct against my known beliefs. I tell you this not to impress you with my award but to remind us all that we don't know who is watching and judging us as<br>a witness of what and who we are.<br><br>Our prophet is concerned with spiritual drift in the Church today. In an effort to be tolerant and respectful of the rights and behavior of others, we must guard against being enticed to the incompatible cultures of the world. I fear an eclipse of virtues is occurring for the undiscerning. I remember that my parents taught me as a boy the clear difference between the standards of the world on the one hand and the standards of the Church on the other. Each was different and should be separate. When an eclipse of virtues occurs, the two, like the sun and the moon, overlap each other, neither being clearly distinguishable, the sun losing its brilliance.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell wisely observed, "The moment of gravest danger is when there is so little light that darkness seems normal!" (<i>"Behold, I Say unto You, I Cannot Say the Smallest Part Which I Feel"</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973], 75).<br><br>We must remember that it isn't necessary for Satan to extinguish light if he can simply keep it dim.<br><br>We are called to be witnesses of light. As relating to those not of the faith, the Savior counseled the Nephite church, "Hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye should hold up" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.24?lang=eng#p23">3 Nephi 18:24</a>).<br><br>We covenant each Sunday to do this, don't we? We covenant with Heavenly Father that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of His Son and always remember Him and keep His commandments that He has given us.<br><br>The way we dress, the way we act, and the way we treat our neighbor reflects intentionally or unintentionally how we feel about the Savior. Our behavior attests to what we feel most deeply in our hearts. Every day we see the impact of unintended consequences of our behavior.<br><br>When I was teaching early morning seminary, a lovely, attractive girl complained that the boys were becoming too aggressive and making unwelcome advances. Her dress was too often immodest and accentuated her girlish figure. I suggested that she was undoubtedly sending the boys the wrong signal. Her dress did not reflect her true standards. We must project virtue--if virtuous we are. God expects us to be as we seem.<br><br>Peter admonished us to have our "conduct honest among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak against [us] as evil-doers, they may by [our] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.12?lang=eng#p11">JST, 1 Peter 2:12</a>).<br><br>In these days of exaggerated claims and unfulfilled expectations--where so many fail to deliver as promised--we must be true. Latter-day Saints must combine integrity and competence consistent with gospel principles. What great opportunities lie ahead for those who do!<br><br>When you are graduated from BYU, your employer will expect that your integrity will not be compromised, that you will give your best efforts to excel, that you will be trustworthy and loyal to your employer. There is so much shoddy performance in our society--too few craftsmen, too few professionals, too few problem solvers, too few who realize that their work is their signature, their witness.<br><br>A story is told of an ancient craftsman--a maker of fine doors. He was hired by the king to make two great doors to guard the entrance to the city. After he had hung the doors, there was a celebration in his honor. He did not attend. The citizens didn't understand. This was his moment of glory. They also noticed that his signature did not appear on the doors--most unusual.<br><br>Later, when the king gave him generous payment, he asked the artisan why he had not signed his name on the doors. He replied, "My work is my signature. Moments of glory are just that, only moments. It is one's work that lives on forever, in the lives of others" (from the files of J. Richard Clarke).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the weight of discipleship can be heavy. It has always been so. We are called to be a "Zion people"--peculiar in righteousness--to leave the world, to be separate. Let us not be ashamed of our singularity. Let us celebrate the "dignity of difference" in our standards of behavior.<br><br>We agree with the Protestant minister's assessment: the strength of the Church is the testimony of individual members and its prophets. It is the "taproot of Mormonism."<br><br>May I in meekness and in humility leave my personal testimony--born of prayer, study, and the affirmation of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I know that God our Father lives. I know that His Son Jesus Christ is our Savior, our Lord, and our Redeemer. I know that His Church has been established on the earth with full power and authority to bring salvation to the world through the ordinances of the holy priesthood and the blessings of the gospel through our missionary service and the committed and dedicated lives of our members. The disciples who are true witnesses for Christ will ever stand as a beacon to the world that God has once again spoken to the earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>J.

<h1> Health: God’s Gift and Our Personal Responsibility - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, what an incredible opportunity is mine this morning to share with those I love and respect a message that I believe is timely and important. I am aware that George Burns' secret of a good sermon is to have a good beginning and a good ending and have them as close together as possible. This morning I'm feeling humble, as a child. I hope I can also speak with the simple conviction of a child, like the child I heard about just the other day.<br><br>A little girl was talking to her elementary school teacher about whales. She had just learned about Jonah and the whale in her Sunday School class. The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human because even though it was a very large mammal, its throat was very small. The little girl stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale. Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human; it was physically impossible.<br><br>The little girl said, "When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah."<br><br>The teacher asked, "What if Jonah went to hell?"<br><br>The little girl replied, "Then you ask him."<br><br>Father in Heaven is sending strong spirits like this little girl to earth at this critical time in the history of the world to build His kingdom and prepare for the Second Coming of the Savior. He needs the leaders of this generation to be healthy, energetic, and powerful. Those leaders are you!<br><br>Are you healthy? One of my health science students answered that question with the following quote:<br><br><i>As a university student, this is a time in my life wherein it is common to live a fairly unhealthy lifestyle. At Brigham Young University this is not often in regard to the excessive use of alcohol, illegal drugs, and promiscuous sexual relations but rather lack of sleep, poor nutrition, heavy workloads, and increased stress.</i><br><br>Can you relate to that description?<br><br>What an incredible time to be on the earth, and with great opportunity comes great responsibility. Our Father knows each of us personally and has provided the gifts to allow us to be as healthy as we need to be to accomplish our individual purposes during this earth life.<br><h2><b>Blessings</b></h2><br>The examples of a loving Father blessing His children with gifts of health and healing are many. Here are but three:<br><br>• The tender mercies of the Father who provides healing plants to His children in Alma 46:40.<br><br>• The gift of the stones of light for the Jaredite boats (see Ether 2–3). In her classic book<i>My Grandfather's Blessings,</i>Rachel Naomi Remen said:<br><br><i>This image of a people sailing through heavy seas in search of freedom, steering only by the light that the touch of God kindles in their souls, is a particularly beautiful one for me. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I find that the most moving part of the Mormon exodus story is a single line. Despite the challenges and great difficulties of this sea journey, "the wind always blows in the direction of the promised land." I have seen many people spread their sails and catch this wind.</i><br><br><i>There is a grace in life that can be trusted. In our struggle toward freedom we are neither abandoned nor alone.</i>[Rachel Naomi Remen, "Epilogue," in<i>My Grandfather's Blessings: Stories of Strength, Refuge, and Belonging</i>(New York: Riverhead Books, 2000), 375–76]<br><br>• My personal blessing of health in my patriarchal blessing is as follows:<br><br><i>I bless your body that it will be strong and well, and I promise you that if you will live the law of health the destroying angel will pass you by and not harm you, and when diseases are prevalent upon the land they will have no effect upon you and you will be a living testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Remember this promise, Brother Karren, for it will be fulfilled.</i><br><br>Like any other opportunity, the gifts that produce good health require personal involvement.<br><br>Gifts conjure up thoughts of Christmas. Let's use the power of imagery to put you with your family, gathered about the beautifully decorated tree and the carefully wrapped gifts. Your father planned and chose a special gift for you and knew how important this gift would be to your future. There it was, beautifully covered and waiting for you to open it. But you just didn't get around to opening it--on Christmas Day or the next day or the next. It just stood in the corner gathering dust. How do you think your father would feel? The great potential of the gift could not function on your behalf.<br><br>The gift to be opened is the gift of health. The gift of the gospel lived is the gift of health.<br><h2><b>Health and Wellness</b></h2><br>What is health and wellness? It depends on who you talk to. Mark Twain said, "Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint" (attributed, in<i>The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain,</i>ed. Alex Ayres [New York: Harper and Row, 1987], 97).<br><br><i>Health</i>is a very broad term involved in every dimension of our lives. Dr. Edward Taub says:<br><br><i>Wellness is the dance of life that celebrates infinite and eternal harmony. It is the</i>dynamic activity<i>of caring for your body as the home for your soul; the</i>enriching quality<i>of striving to fulfill your highest potential; and the</i>elevating state<i>of filling your life with love. To achieve wellness is to attain the point of balance where the energies of body, mind, and spirit are so finely attuned to each other that distinctions between them fade away.</i>[<i>Seven Steps to Self-Healing</i>(New York: DK Publishing, 1996), 24; emphasis in original]<br><br>Others define health as an attitude or orientation made up of (1) our basic values and (2) our beliefs about ourselves and the world around us; an inner quality that gives rise to particular health practices but that cannot be reduced to those practices itself.<br><br>Here in America we become quite confused by health issues. For example, only in America do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a 32-oz. diet Coke!<br><br>Factors that affect our health include, among others: genetics, family and socioeconomic background, diet, exercise, social support, risk-taking behaviors, attitude, and spiritual practices.<br><br>New health issues and challenges seem to surface every month. Developing new drugs and procedures is a constant challenge. Yet the real answer is a life centered in the gift of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Does the gift really work? Are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints healthier as a group than most Americans? The answer is a resounding yes!<br><br>Well-designed studies continue to conclude that active LDS men and women experience lower mortality rates from all types of disease.<br><br>Although the studies are numerous, I will quote just a few. Let me summarize what the authors of<i>Handbook of Religion and Health</i>reported, citing from studies by James E. Enstrom and by J. L. Lyon, H. P. Wetzler, and others (Harold G. Koenig, Michael E. McCullough, and David B. Larson,<i>Handbook of Religion and Health</i>[New York: Oxford University Press, 2001]):<br><br>1. "Mormons had 35% lower mortality from" coronary artery disease (p. 243).<br><br>2. "Mormons had fewer cardiovascular diseases and lower mortality rates. . . . Thus, much of the health benefit that Mormons enjoy can be explained by their positive health behaviors and regular religious involvement" (p. 243).<br><br>3. "California Mormons experienced only about one-half to three-quarters the cancer death rates of other Californians. This was especially true for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, and kidney in men and for cancers of the colon, lung, breast, and uterus (cervix and corpus) in women. A number of these cancer sites were unrelated to smoking" (p. 303).<br><br>My own colleague in the Department of Health Science, Dr. Ray Merrill, with Dr. Stirling Hilton of the Department of Statistics, conducted a study on differences in life expectancy between LDS and non-LDS in Utah for the years 1994 to 1998. They found that at every age group LDS men and women live longer and have a higher survival percentage than non-LDS men and women.<br><br>These data are for all Latter-day Saints. If only the active LDS population were studied, the differences would be even more profound.<br><br>How then does religion, and specifically the LDS religion, have such a positive impact on health? Health lies at the heart of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and it is not just physical well-being. Rather, it encompasses the whole person: physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual. Our Savior is the source of all health and the source of an abundant life.<br><br>His gospel-religion (from<i>ligare,</i>a Latin term meaning "binding man to God") protects health through<br><br>• social integration and support<br><br>• more concern for others, less prejudice, and more forgiveness<br><br>• developing a personal relationship with Deity<br><br>• providing a framework of meaning by which to make sense of life<br><br>• enhancing mental health<br><br>• promoting specific patterns of personal lifestyle<br><br>A powerful example of this last point is section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In 1833 the Prophet Joseph, upon initial motivation from Emma, inquired of the Lord concerning health. What he received from the Lord was a revelation on good health. Scientific evidence to support section 89 was well over 100 years away. What a testament the Word of Wisdom is that the Lord loves His children deeply and is personally concerned about their health.<br><br>Science today has developed a theoretical model describing how religion affects physical health. Observe how religion positively affects mental health, social support, and health behaviors to reduce the development of the diseases listed.<br><br>Living the gospel of Jesus Christ, then, can make our lives longer, healthier, and happier.<br><br>In April 1876 President Joseph F. Smith observed that the fruits of the Latter-day Saint religion "are flavored with the sweets of heaven, and they impart health and life to the soul" (<i>GD,</i>92; also<i>JD</i>18:276). Some 80 years later, President Ezra Taft Benson stated that "to be truly fit, truly equal to the demands of life, requires much more than bodily strength. It involves the mind and the training of the mind, the emotions and their use and control. Yes, and it involves the soul and the spiritual growth, too" (<i>TETB,</i>239; also<i>So Shall Ye Reap,</i>comp. Reed A. Benson [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1960], 140).<br><br>These prophets of God understood a great truth of life--that total health is the product of an intricate and intimate connection between mind, body, and spirit. To be truly healthy is to value and nurture each of these important ingredients of the human soul.<br><br>As Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, "Jesus, as the great physician, came to heal the spiritually sick--all of us" (<i>"A More Excellent Way": Essays on Leadership for Latter-day Saints</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1967], 64). That the Savior and the Church can offer spiritual healing has been commonly accepted throughout the ages. What is new about scientific curiosity is the unexpected finding that religion itself heals<i>physically</i>.<br><br>Religion energizes our spirits, and that greatly affects our emotions, a very important part of health. Dr. Candace Pert, an internationally known scientist who, by her discovery of the opiate receptor site in the brain, set medical science in the direction of understanding that it is our emotions and their biological components that establishes the crucial link between mind and body, stated:<br><br><i>For me the key concept is that the emotions exist in the body as informational chemicals, the neuropeptides and receptors, and they also exist in another realm, the one we experience as feeling, inspiration, love--beyond the physical. The emotions move back and forth, flowing freely between both places, and, in that sense, they connect the physical and nonphysical. . . . We know that the way health occurs in the physical body has to do with the flow of the biochemicals of emotion. My work has taught me that there is a physical reality to the emotions.</i>[Candace B. Pert,<i>Molecules of Emotion: Why You Feel the Way You Feel (</i>New York: Scribner, 1997), 307]<br><br>When the servants of God teach us about health and healing, however, the message has a grander scope than just those things physical. Elder Malcolm S. Jeppsen, a practicing physician for more than 40 years and at the time a member of the Seventy, said in general conference in April 1994:<br><br><i>Physicians do not cure patients. This marvelous and complicated machine we call the human body has built into it its own wonderful healing mechanism. All a physician can do is to provide a good healing environment.</i><br><br><i>I soon learned in my medical practice that the ultimate healing process for an injured or sick body was already provided by our Heavenly Father. I also learned that a patient's attitude has much to do with healing. Those who would rely on Heavenly Father and exercise faith in the power of priesthood often enjoyed faster recoveries.</i>["A Divine Prescription for Spiritual Healing,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1994, 17]<br><br>Created after the image of a divine Father, the human body can be conceived of as a self-healer, endowed with an internal supply of chemicals and hormones that maintain and enhance health. Activated by the power of the priesthood, the immune system can heal. The spirit can mobilize the body as it absorbs the lessons of mortality. As Elder Orson F. Whitney told early members of the Church:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God.</i>[Quoted in Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972), 98]<br><br>Western medicine regards disease and death as a dastardly enemy to be fought with all resources possible. Wonderful people do suffer and die. However, Elder Malcolm S. Jeppsen pointed out the importance of recognizing the Lord's will when he said:<br><br><i>The Lord has given a condition for healing blessings: "He that hath faith in me to be healed, and</i>is not appointed unto death,<i>shall be healed" (D&amp;amp;C 42:48; emphasis added). Even when a person relies in faith on the Lord for blessings, if it is his or her appointed time to die, there will not be restoration of health. Indeed, "death [must come] upon all men, to fulfill the merciful plan of the great Creator" (2 Ne. 9:6).</i>["Divine Prescription," 17]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball strengthened this position, adding:<br><br><i>Bones can be straightened, germs can be killed, sutures can close wounds, and skillful fingers can open and close bodies; but no man yet has found a way to actually heal. Man is the offspring of God and has within him the re-creating power that is God-given.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>508]<br><br>We have discussed the impact of religion in general and the gospel of Jesus Christ on health. More specifically, what are these gifts from a loving Father in Heaven that have such a profoundly positive effect on health?<br><h2><strong><i>1. Faith</i></strong></h2><br>Faith is the assurance we have of things not seen. Faith protects health and promotes healing by strengthening the body against the physical changes that can accompany stress. In the same way it can even affect the course of a disease. A review of studies confirms the power of faith over physiological processes (see "More Than Just Placebo: Review Confirms 'Healing' Effects,"<i>New Sense Bulletin</i>16, no. 8 [May 1991]: 1–2). Faith has been shown to influence microbes, plants, animals, and human beings, even from a distance. These studies, combined with personal experiences, have resulted in a growing appreciation of faith among members of the medical community.<br><h2><strong><i>2. Social Support and Relationships</i></strong></h2><br>Researchers who conducted a nine-year study of more than 7,000 California residents were able to identify a single factor that most often led to good health and long life: the amount of social support a person enjoys. They concluded that people with social ties--regardless of their source--lived longer than people who were isolated. And "people who have a close-knit network of intimate personal ties with other people seem to be able to avoid disease, maintain higher levels of health, and in general, to deal more successfully with life's difficulties" (S. Leonard Syme, in Emrika Padus and the editors of<i>Prevention</i>magazine,<i>The Complete Guide to Your Emotions and Your Health: New Dimensions in Mind/Body Healing</i>[Emmaus, Pennsylvania: Rodale Press, 1986], 83–84).<br><h2><strong><i>3. Marriage and Families</i></strong></h2><br>Not only does the family bring spiritual rewards, but it has a strong influence on the health of all members of the family. We know from scientific research that members of weak, stressed families have characteristic health problems; members of strong, healthy families most often enjoy good health; and parents have a tremendous influence on the health and development of children in the family.<br><br>Statistics from a multitude of studies show the same thing: happy marriage dramatically increases life expectancy. In fact, a man who marries can expect to automatically add about nine years and seven months to his life (see Jo Ann Tooley and Lynn Y. Anderson, "Living Is Risky,"<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>104, no. 3 [25 January 1988]: 77). One researcher went so far as to say that "some of the increased death rates in unmarried individuals are astounding, rising as high as<i>ten times</i>the rates for married individuals of comparable ages" (James J. Lynch,<i>The Broken Heart: The Medical Consequences of Loneliness</i>[New York: Basic Books, 1979], 38; emphasis added). The researcher then sums up: "The overall death rate for divorced individuals in the United States is almost double that of married individuals" (p. 40).<br><h2><strong><i>4. Altruism--Serving Others</i></strong></h2><br>A group of studies done on altruism found that people who care for others are physically, emotionally, and mentally healthier than those who concentrate more on their own needs. Many researchers believe that altruism is an inborn characteristic intended to help boost health and longevity. The Paradoxical Commandments by Kent M. Keith were originally published by Harvard Student Agencies in 1968 and were often called "The Ten Commandments of Leadership." Mother Teresa so admired how they summed up the power of altruism that she had a version entitled "Anyway" inscribed on the wall of her children's home in Calcutta. Here is a version called "The Final Analysis":<br><br><i>People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered;</i><br><i>Forgive them anyway.</i><br><br><i>If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;</i><br><i>Be kind anyway.</i><br><br><i>If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;</i><br><i>Succeed anyway.</i><br><br><i>If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;</i><br><i>Be honest and frank anyway.</i><br><br><i>What you spend years building, someone may destroy overnight;</i><br><i>Build anyway.</i><br><br><i>If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;</i><br><i>Be happy anyway.</i><br><br><i>The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;</i><br><i>Do good anyway.</i><br><br><i>Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;</i><br><i>Give the world the best you've got anyway.</i><br><br><i>You see, in the final analysis, it is all between you and God;</i><br><i>It was never between you and them anyway.</i><br>[www.inthefinalanalysis.com]<br><h2><strong><i>5. Healthy Life Perception</i></strong></h2><br>To know who we are and why we are here is essential to good health. Goethe declared: "The greatest evil that can befall man is that he should come to think ill of himself." Marianne Williamson reminds us who we are in a quote from her classic book<i>A Return to Love:</i><br><br><i>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us." We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you</i>not<i>to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</i>[Marianne Williamson,<i>A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of</i>A Course in Miracles (New York: HarperPerennial, 1996), chapter 7, section 3, 190–91]<br><h2><strong><i>6. Humor and Laughter</i></strong></h2><br>Further research on laughter has revealed what may be one of its most important benefits: it apparently enhances the immune system. Laughter appears to boost the production of chemicals that enhance immunity, and it suppresses the hormones that weaken immunity (the stress hormones). Psychologist Robert E. Ornstein and physician David Sobel point out, "When confronted with a threatening situation, animals have essentially two choices: to flee or to fight. Humans have a third alternative: to laugh" (<i>Healthy Pleasures</i>[Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1989], 218).<br><h2><strong><i>7. Hope</i></strong></h2><br>Recently a photo entitled<i>The Hand of Hope</i>was sent to me that typifies hope. The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel Alexander Armas, who had spina bifida, emerges from the mother's uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner, as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life. Little Samuel's mother said they "wept for days" when they saw the picture. She said, "The photo reminds us my pregnancy isn't about disability or an illness, it's about a little person." (Photo taken by Michael Clancy at surgery performed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center on August 19, 1999; see www.michaelclancy.com and "Hand of Hope" at http://urbanlegends.about.com.)<br><br>A report published in<i>Medical World News</i>claimed that "hope can play an important role in vulnerability to disease, the course of illness, and possibly in determining whether a patient lives or dies" ("Studies Show Hope Can Play Role in a Patient's Risk, Illness, Death,"<i>Medical World News</i>25, no. 11 [11 June 1984]: 101). Norman Cousins is perhaps best known for his research into what he called "the biology of hope." He explained that<i>hope</i>is actually tremendous<i>expectation</i>and that it has powerful influence on the human body (see<i>Head First: The Biology of Hope</i>[New York: Dutton, 1989]).<br><br>Of the Lord Jesus Christ, Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote:<br><br><i>In and through and by and because of him we and all men have a hope of peace in this life and eternal glory in the world to come. He is our Hope. Without him we would have no hope of immortality, no hope of eternal life, no hope of the continuation of the family unit, no hope of eternal progress, no hope of exaltation, no hope of any good thing. All the hopes of all the righteous of all the ages center in him.</i>[<i>The Promised Messiah: The First Coming of Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1978), 183–84]<br><h2><strong><i>8. Spirituality</i></strong></h2><br>"Spirituality is . . . the consequence of a succession of right choices" (Dallin H. Oaks,<i>Pure in Heart</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], 123).<br><br>"The spiritual is . . . the deepest sense of belonging and participation. . . . Spirit is an essential need of human nature" (Rachel Naomi Remen, "On Defining Spirit,"<i>Noetic Sciences Review,</i>no. 8 [autumn 1988]: 7). Spirituality buffers stress, making us better able to resist and fight disease. Healing is made possible by the Light of Christ because, as President David O. McKay wrote:<br><br><i>Man is a spiritual being, a soul, and at some period of his life everyone is possessed with an irresistible desire to know his relationship to the Infinite. . . . There is something within him which urges him to rise above himself, to control his environment, to master the body and all things physical and live in a higher and more beautiful world.</i>[<i>True to the Faith,</i>comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), 244]<br><br>One of the reasons spirituality impacts physical health is that people with a deep sense of spirituality stop focusing on themselves and start focusing on others--an attitude that promotes health in general. As the Savior taught, "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39).<br><h2><strong><i>9. Forgiveness</i></strong></h2><br>Forgiveness--and the failure to forgive--affects not only the mind and the spirit but the body. When we don't forgive, the body pumps "high-voltage" chemicals into the bloodstream. They include chemicals like adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisone. As these chemicals build up in the bloodstream, the body literally become a rapidly ticking time bomb. The heart pounds in the chest like a sledgehammer. The muscles of the neck and shoulders gradually tighten. Abdominal pains develop.<br><br>If the situation continues unchecked, the body pays the price. The person who fails to forgive becomes a candidate for gastric ulcers, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and tension/vascular headache.<br><br>Forgiveness reverses the process. Anger and resentment dissolve. The body stops pouring high-voltage chemicals into the bloodstream. The heart rate drops. Muscle tension eases. The healing begins.<br><br>Without forgiveness, we are constrained; when we forgive, we become free. Studies reveal:<br><br><i>• People who are more forgiving report fewer health problems.</i><br><i>• Forgiveness leads to less stress.</i><br><i>• Forgiveness leads to fewer physical symptoms of stress.</i><br><i>• Failure to forgive may be more important than hostility as a risk factor for heart disease.</i><br><i>• People who blame other people for their troubles have higher incidences of illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancers.</i><br><i>• People who imagine not forgiving someone show negative changes in blood pressure, muscle tension, and immune response.</i><br><i>• People who imagine forgiving their offender note immediate improvement in their cardiovascular, muscular, and nervous systems.</i><br><i>• Even people with devastating losses can learn to forgive and feel better psychologically and emotionally.</i><br>[Fred Luskin,<i>Forgive for Good: A Proven Prescription for Health and Happiness</i>(San Francisco: HarperCollins, 2002), xv]<br><h2><strong><i>10. Prayer</i></strong></h2><br>Prayer signals a commitment to a set of moral and ethical values; it is a signpost of spirituality and is at the core of most spiritual experiences. Though mortals have been praying for thousands of years, Elder Neal A. Maxwell points out, "Prayer is not something we can clinically diagnose and dissect, giving ready answers for every question about every dimension of this great process" (<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979], 92). What we<i>can</i>do is examine the effects of prayer.<br><br>Obviously, prayer exerts tremendous spiritual power. We know that prayer can precipitate miracles: the miracle of forgiveness, the miracle of healing, the miracle of a change of heart. In addition to what prayer does for the soul, though, we know that prayer also has powerful physical benefits. When we pray, we are in a state of relaxed alertness, peace, joy, contentment, and emotional release. During prayer we empty the mind, yet we receive direction. Part of the magnetism of prayer comes from our own belief, our own faith: the powerful suggestion that prayer will work, that something will happen.<br><br>Prayer helps us meditate, which also relieves stress.<br><br>[Salt Lake City physician]<i>N. Lee Smith says that when patients pray, "they're focusing on their deepest values and drawing on spiritual power that develops a sense of connectedness and also develops hope. And that has been known to affect medical outcomes. The mind has the ability to heal in ways that are largely unexplainable."</i>[In Keith J. Karren, Brent Q. Hafen, N. Lee Smith, and Kathryn J. Frandsen,<i>Mind/Body Health: The Effects of Attitudes, Emotions, and Relationships,</i>2nd ed. (San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings, 2001), 448–49]<br><br>Dr. Larry Dossey, a leading medical proponent of prayer, says:<br><br><i>You think</i>positively.<i>And positive thoughts aren't confined to your brain. They set in motion a chain of events that has been defined physiologically. We know that expectation and suggestion achieve a lot of fabulous changes in the immune system and probably every other organ in the body.</i><br><br><i>When you get into a meditative, prayer-like, contemplative frame of mind, the metabolism slows down, the immune system is refreshed, blood pressure and heart rates subside, blood lactate level falls, and oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are diminished. A lot of changes happen, the result of which is that the body becomes healthier. . . .</i><br><br><i>But most people probably aren't interested in that level. They want to know, "When I pray, does it</i>work<i>or not?" I think that if you look at the evidence, you can resoundingly say, "Yup! This has a healthful effect and here's the laboratory proof."</i>[Peter Barry Chowka, "Prayer Is Good Medicine: An Interview with Larry Dossey, M.D.,"<i>Yoga Journal,</i>no. 129 (July/August 1996): 63–64; emphasis in original; also "Larry Dossey, MD: The Interview by Peter Barry Chowka," http://members.aol.com/pbchowka/dossey2.html]<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>The key to good health, then, is to immerse ourselves totally in the gospel of Jesus Christ and strike a balance of life's dimensions. We then draw close to the Savior and become more like Him. Helaman 5:12 gives us that direction:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i><br><br>President Howard W. Hunter invited us all "to live with ever more attention to the life and example of the Lord Jesus Christ [and to] treat each other with more kindness, more patience, more courtesy and forgiveness ("Exceeding Great and Precious Promises,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1994, 8).<br><br>In a recent stake conference in Highland, Utah, President Merrill Bateman promised the stake members that they can become more like Christ if they would do the following each day:<br><br>1. Pray to the Father morning and night, then listen and meditate.<br><br>2. Study His scriptures at least 10 minutes per day and learn of Him.<br><br>President Benson added another promise:<br><br><i>There is a power in the book which will begin to flow into your lives the moment you begin a serious study of the book. You will find greater power to resist temptation. You will find the power to avoid deception. You will find the power to stay on the strait and narrow path. The scriptures are called "the words of life" (see D&amp;amp;C 84:85), and nowhere is that more true than it is of the Book of Mormon.</i>When you begin to hunger and thirst after those words, you will find life in greater and greater abundance. ["The Book of Mormon--Keystone of Our Religion,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 1986, 7; emphasis added]<br><br>3. Keep His commandments.<br><br>4. Perform a service to someone daily.<br><br>Spencer W. Kimball taught that "service puts problems in perspective" (<i>TSWK,</i>254).<br><br>Dr. George E. Vaillant, Harvard University's director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, the Study of Healthy Aging, and author of<i>Aging Well</i>, enlarged upon this concept. Quoting from a valedictory address by Timothy Coggeshall at the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, Massachusetts, on June 3, 1987--and giving some credit to E. B. White as well--George Vaillant gives the following:<br><br><i>Besides my sister, my favorite teacher is a two-inch-tall mouse named Stuart Little. Stuart told the children to remember three important rules:</i><br><br><i>"Be a true friend.</i><br><br><i>"Do the right thing.</i><br><br><i>"Enjoy the glory of everything."</i><br><br><i>We can imagine him outside now in the sunshine, paddling past us in his tiny birch bark canoe,</i>Summer Memories,<i>heading north, upstream on his quest, traveling light and . . . reminding us that a person who is looking for something doesn't travel very fast, and waving farewell to his childhood and boyhood, that secure and sun-warmed past that is over and done with and gone for all time.</i><br><br><i>"Yet Stuart knew this:</i><br><br><i>"If a flower blooms once, it goes on blooming somewhere forever.</i><br><br><i>"What is changed is never gone unless we let it go.</i><br><br><i>"You will remember--</i><br><br><i>"And you will be remembered."</i>[In George E. Vaillant,<i>Aging Well: Surprising Guideposts to a Happier Life from the Landmark Harvard Study of Adult Development</i>(Boston: Little, Brown, 2002), 324–25]<br><br>Do I have a testimony--living knowledge of that of which I speak? The answer is a resounding<i>yes!</i><br><br>A number of months ago it was discovered that I had prostate cancer. Before that rude awakening, I had lived a healthy lifestyle and sought to know the Savior. I also knew that the Lord has a definite timetable for each of us. I had great faith that the right thing would occur.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley assures us, "God is weaving his tapestry according to his own grand design. All flesh is in his hands. . . . We have no need to fear. We have no need to worry" (<i>TGBH,</i>288).<br><br>I also have an incredible family and a sweetheart that is so tuned to the Spirit. Therefore, my social connectedness was and is great. Through fasting and prayer and exploring the various treatment options, with an excellent physician I made a decision and felt great peace. My spirit told me all would be well, for I still had much to do. With the help of many, I prepared my mind, body, and spirit and have been greatly blessed with excellent results.<br><br>Last week I visited my parents' grave sites in a little cemetery in Taber, Alberta. As I scanned other headstones, I saw the names of several of my now-deceased high school classmates. I know that living the gospel of Jesus Christ is the gift of health and a quality of life.<br><br>I conclude with a poem by Antonio Machado:<br><br><i>The wind, one brilliant day, called</i><br><i>to my soul with an aroma of jasmine.</i><br><i>"In return for this jasmine odor,</i><br><i>I'd like all the odor of your roses."</i><br><i>"I have no roses; I have no flowers left now</i><br><i>in my garden. . . . All are dead."</i><br><i>"Then I'll take the waters of the fountains,</i><br><i>and the yellow leaves and the dried-up petals."</i><br><i>The wind left. . . . I wept. I said to my soul,</i><br><i>"What have you done with the garden entrusted to you?"</i><br>["Llamó a mi corazón, un claro día," LXVIII,<i>Soledades, Galerías, y Otros Poemas,</i>translated by Robert Bly in<i>Times Alone: Selected Poems of Antonio Machado</i>(Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press, 1983), 57]<br><br>Our Father in Heaven desires us to be joyful and well, to nurture and care for the garden that is entrusted to each of us. He needs a healthy people and has given us the gifts and abilities to be so. It is our responsibility to open those gifts and use them. May we do so, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, the author of all health and healing, amen.<br><br><i>Keith J.

<br>
Elder Scott, President Samuelson, faculty, staff, parents, and graduates, it is a privilege and honor to be with you, as assigned by the First Presidency and the board of trustees. It is a joy to be here today.<br><br>I am grateful for the honorary doctoral degree bestowed upon me. What a wonderful privilege it is to be at a university that recognizes and honors Christian service!<br><br>Today many of you are to be honored for graduating. That is why we have come together: to honor you and this institution. This is a day to rejoice, a day to express gratitude to your parents, family members, teachers, and especially your Father in Heaven. It is a day to acknowledge the divinely inspired purpose of BYU and to thank members of the Church who support and sustain this university by faithful payment of their tithes. Most of all, it is a day to commend you.<br><br>You have kept the commandment to<br><br><i>be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God . . . ;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79]<br><br>Recent events in these countries and kingdoms throughout the world tell us that we are living in the last days. The increasing "perplexities of the nations" recall the words of our Savior, Jesus Christ: "Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars. . . . For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom" (Matthew 24:6–7).<br><br>It is a challenging but exciting time. The gospel is rolling forth as a stone cut out of a mountain without hands. It is filling the earth. And now it is your privilege to help move this great work forward.<br><br>Not very long ago you entered this university to learn. By and large you have been successful in the world of school. But today you walk out the doors of this Marriott Center into another world. The question is: How can you be<i>in</i>the world but not<i>of</i>the world?<br><br>As you go forth to serve, you will find that your greatest success and influence won't come solely from the knowledge you have gained. It will come from what you do with that knowledge--the wise use of agency to make sound decisions.<br><br>In the next 10 years you will make some of the most important decisions of your life. Those decisions will be regarding<br><ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>temple worthiness and covenants;</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>choosing an eternal companion and, for those who have already made that choice, making the companionship work;</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>beginning your family;</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>beginning a life of service and callings in the Church;</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>choosing where you will live;</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>choosing who your employer will be;</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>choosing where you will work; and</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>choosing how you will conduct yourself.</li><br></ul><br></ul><br>Indeed, a decade of decision lies ahead. Of course there are some decisions that must wait until circumstances change and your understanding develops, but many of your most important decisions can and should be made now.<br><br>For example, you can decide the principles or axioms that will influence your decision making in the future. With this in mind, and with your permission, President Samuelson, I'd like to add a new degree to those who are graduating from BYU today: the LLBA or "living life by axioms" degree.<br><br>Here are 10 of these axioms, distilled from my own experience in living the gospel and living life. I hope they will be helpful to you in determining the principles that may guide your life.<br><h2><b>Axiom 1</b></h2><br><i>It is not the obstacle that counts but how you overcome it.</i><br><br>Consider, for a moment, that you are the engineer of a train. As your locomotive races down the tracks, you look out the window. In the distance you see a great pile of debris blocking your way. What do you do?<br><ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>You can radio ahead for help.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>You can stop the train and take care of the problem yourself.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>You can pour coal into the burner and let the engine plow through the trouble.</li><br></ul><br></ul><br>Now it's axiomatic that we will all encounter obstacles in our lives. Temporal obstacles make eternal development possible. So you must decide how to meet those obstacles. Like the engineer, you can call for help. Through prayer, fasting, and diligent study you can obtain the assistance of your Heavenly Father and the Holy Ghost. The Lord will comfort us, strengthen us, and enlighten us by His Holy Spirit. Often He will give us inspired counsel through parents and priesthood leaders.<br><br>Sometimes He will smooth our path by removing the obstacle. Sometimes, like a switchman, He will help us get on a different track. But from time to time the only way to clear debris from the track is to stop the train and take care of the problem. This is always true when the obstacles are of our own making, such as when we violate the Lord's commandments. Repentance is the only way to clear the debris of sin and move forward in our lives. "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43).<br><br>Finally, there are times when Heavenly Father directs us to pour on the spiritual coal. With faith and hope we must plow ahead--or, to use the more scriptural phrase, "press forward":<br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 31:20]<br><h2><b>Axiom 2</b></h2><br><i>Pursue your goals with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. You are doomed to failure if you pursue them in a vacillating manner.</i><br><br>So often we are tentative and don't move forward with conviction. We feel along our way as if we were afraid in the dark. It is so much better to turn on the light of faith and move ahead with energy and commitment. If our course is wrong, we will quickly recognize it and make the necessary adjustments. But if we pursue a course tentatively and indecisively, it is difficult to know whether it is right or wrong in time to correct it and make a difference. The Lord said, "I would thou wert cold or hot" (Revelation 3:15). I hope we choose being active and being hot. We should decide now to make our decisions prayerfully and then move forward with faith, energy, and determination. As one novelist said, "If you're going to have steam in the kettle, you've got to have a fire in the stove" (Louis L'Amour).<br><h2><b>Axiom 3</b></h2><br><i>From a tiny spark can come a great conflagration.</i><br><br>In the course of moving forward, it is normal to generate a few sparks. Misunderstandings, differences of opinion, and diverse personalities and styles can produce friction. Remember, if we are not careful, little things can easily become big things. Decide now to extinguish the sparks of conflict by thinking well of others and being kind to others. As the Lord taught, "Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him" (3 Nephi 12:25).<br><br>Don't criticize. Don't murmur. What you say about others may--and usually does--get back to them. See the good in people and develop that goodness through your own unwavering friendship, acceptance, loyalty, trust, and love.<br><h2><b>Axiom 4</b></h2><br><i>Our greatest strengths can become our greatest weaknesses.</i><br><br>At this university you have prepared well to successfully complete your assignments. You have studied, memorized, and conceptualized to please your professors, pass your exams, and complete your courses. You have become very good at schoolwork. Your ability has been a great strength to you, but if you are not careful it can also become a great weakness. Use the gifts that have been given to you and do not rely solely on the abilities that you have developed at the university. When not properly balanced, the skills you have gained can be very self-serving, and, in the world outside the university, they can become very limiting.<br><br>For instance, you may know how to write a good paper, but if you cannot get along with other people, you may fail. You must now apply the knowledge you have gained to strengthen the Church, your family, your work, the community, and your friendships. Our greatest strengths can become weaknesses to us whenever we forget that our gifts, talents, and intellect are given to us by God and whenever we rely on the natural man and forget that God is the giver of all the gifts of life.<br><br>If we would keep our strengths from turning to weaknesses, we must "confess . . . his hand in all things, and obey . . . his commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21).<br><h2><b>Axiom 5</b></h2><br><i>Failure is one of the greatest teachers we have, if we have the faith to learn from it.</i><br><br>The Savior said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation" (John 16:33). But because He has "overcome the world," we can "be of good cheer"--no failure is permanent (John 16:33). Therefore we should embrace the opportunity to learn from our mistakes, analyze where we could have done better, and make plans to improve. In doing so we will discover that setbacks and disappointments are, as Joseph Smith was told, "but for a small moment" and "shall be for [our] good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:4, 7; see also D&amp;amp;C 121:7).<br><br>With faith we can take seriously the Lord's counsel to "search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for [our] good" (D&amp;amp;C 90:24).<br><h2><b>Axiom 6</b></h2><br><i>It is not how you start the race or where you are during the race--it is how you cross the finish line that is going to matter.</i><br><br>John Stephen Akhwari, a marathon runner from Tanzania, competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics. As he was suffering along the way from fatigue, leg cramps, dehydration, and disorientation, "a voice called from within to go on, and so he went on" (<i>The Last African Runner,</i>Olympiad Series, written, directed, and produced by Bud Greenspan, Cappy Productions, 1976, videocassette). Exhausted and staggering, John Stephen Akhwari was the last man to enter the stadium, more than an hour after the winner of the marathon had completed the race. When asked why he would complete a race he could never win, Akhwari replied, "My country did not send me 5,000 miles to<i>start</i>the race; my country sent me to<i>finish</i>the race."<br><br>We are not brought to earth just to be born into mortality. We came with a mission and a purpose--and that is to endure to the end.<br><br>Remember the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. All of them served the Master, and all received an equal wage. It did not matter that some arrived after others--only that each one finally came and endured.<br><br>Don't let missteps of your youth discourage or overcome you. The Lord's judgments are not spiritual GPAs with past sins and mistakes averaged into a final grade. He has promised that "he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).<br><br>So if you are not where you want to be, decide today to get there. Our lifetime degrees will be graded on how well we live the commandments and how well we have fulfilled our saving ordinances--baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, washings, anointings, endowments, and a sacred sealing in the temple to an eternal companion.<br><br>You can cross the finish line. "Go forward and not backward. Courage, . . . and on, on to the victory!" (D&amp;amp;C 128:22).<br><h2><b>Axiom 7</b></h2><br>Borrowed from Brigham Young:<i>"If you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money; but it takes a wise man to save and dispose of it to his own advantage" (</i>JD<i>11:301).</i><br><br>It is to our advantage to cultivate genuine happiness in our lives. Joseph Smith taught that this "happiness is the object and design of our existence" (<i>HC</i>5:134). Unfortunately we live in an age of greed--one in which many suffer from an insatiable, enslaving appetite for temporal things.<br><br>Remember,<i>temporal</i>means "temporary." And temporary things we cannot bring with us for eternal happiness. So look forward. Take the eternal perspective. Be patient. Pay your tithes and offerings and save your money. Freely give of your offerings. Do not try to have now what it took your parents years of patient saving to acquire. Happy is the individual who can live within his means today and enjoy it.<br><h2><b>Axiom 8</b></h2><br><i>You cannot learn the Lord's will without exercising your agency and becoming accountable for your decisions.</i><br><br>Too often we think that with little or no effort on our part, the Holy Ghost will give us answers to our questions. Like Oliver Cowdery, we take "no thought save it [be] to ask" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). And, regrettably, sometimes we don't even pray. But this is not the way of the Lord. He has commanded us to "study it out in [our] mind[s]; [and]<i>then</i>. . . ask [Him] if it be right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8, emphasis added).<br><br>For example, when choosing an eternal companion, we do not present a list of names to the Lord and ask Him to decide. Instead, we exercise our agency by participating in dating experiences. We get to know another person's inner attitudes and outward behavior. Then we make a decision and take it to the Lord. In this way we become accountable for our decisions and responsible to prayerfully resolve any challenges that may arise.<br><h2><b>Axiom 9</b></h2><br>A new interpretation of the old French proverb:<i>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</i><br><br>In 1975 I stood at this podium and held up my left hand. "We are here," I said, with my left hand representing the Church. I then held up my right hand. "And the world is here and is moving farther and farther away." At that time I imagined the world moving its way outside the building, past Brigham City and Logan and into Idaho. "But," referring to my stationary left hand, "the Church is still here," I said. That was 28 years ago.<br><br>Today the world is a great deal farther away than that. From my perspective, I'd put it in Australia--maybe farther. But my left hand is in the same stationary position. The Church is still here and will remain here.<br><br>As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, you should expect to be different from your peers in the world. You should expect the distance to increase. Many want to have the Church just stay a little behind where the world is and keep moving with it. That is not the way the Lord would have it. As we come to the last days, we need to stand firm and say, "Don't be dismayed."<br><br>Those with eyes to see will recognize you as the light on the hill. They will seek you out because you know where to find the light in the darkness of these latter days--which leads me to the final axiom for today.<br><h2><b>Axiom 10</b></h2><br><i>The temple of God is the greatest university.</i><br><br>The knowledge of the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is the most valuable knowledge you will ever possess, and the endowment is the eternal curriculum. It teaches us where we came from and why we are here on earth. In the Lord's holy house we are given the promise of achieving life eternal in the celestial kingdom if we obey the commandments and covenants. Go to the temple.<br><br>With these 10 axioms in mind, I want to bear a personal testimony to you and give you a promise.<br><br>In striving to be a successful son or daughter of God, you never have to compromise the things of the kingdom. Wherever your divinely appointed mission takes you, wherever your life is concerned, you will never be penalized for living the gospel. However, if for your own temporal gains you compromise God's eternal principles, you will lose the eternal blessings that are rightfully yours.<br><br>As a New York boy, I grew up as one of only two or three members of the Church in a high school of several thousand. At a recent 50-year reunion, my former classmates remembered and expressed appreciation for how I had lived according to the values and beliefs of the Church. I realized then that one infraction of the Word of Wisdom or transgression of moral values would have meant I could never have said, "This is what I believe," and be trusted by my friends.<br><br>We can only share the gospel to the extent we live it.<br><br>During my life at college, in the military as an adjutant and fighter pilot, in graduate school, or in my professional career--in sales and marketing, as president of a division, or as group vice president at the corporate headquarters--I was never required to compromise my values or beliefs.<br><br>Was it easy? I don't know. I wasn't looking for easy.<br><br>Was it hard? I wasn't looking for hard either. That is just the way it was and the way you will find it in your life, too.<br><br>Were there men and women who challenged me about my beliefs at times? Certainly.<br><br>When I held to my beliefs, did they respect and honor the commitment I had made to live the gospel? In every instance.<br><br>If you will remember who you are and act accordingly; if you will give your full effort to every calling, task, and assignment; if you will be true to the Savior's name and worthy of His eternal blessings, being able to have a temple recommend and be worthy to take the sacrament each week--then you will always have the light of the Holy Ghost to be with you, to lead you, to guide you, and to buoy you up. You will never want for what to say or how to act. It will be given to you.<br><br>How you live, what you represent, how you treat your associates, and how you honor and revere your companion and your family will spread the influence of our Savior Jesus Christ to your friends and neighbors, for there is no greater Christian service than to become like Him, heed the counsel of His Spirit, and do His will.<br><br>As the years go by, you will discover many axioms that reflect your own experience of living the gospel. Learn them, live them in your life, and share them.<br><br>I leave with you my testimony of who we are: children of God with divine purpose.<br><br>I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. The restored gospel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has come forth under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith. It has given us the way to eternal happiness and salvation.<br><br>President Hinckley--our prophet, seer, and revelator in these times--leads us and guides us.<br><br>May the Lord bless you and keep you. May you have a good life, may you become what you want to be, and may you fulfill your dreams now and return with honor in the eternities, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert D.

<h1>ce of Your Lifetime - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few short days after graduating, with my wife and a small son by my side, a degree in hand, and a determined resolve, I set out for Dallas, Texas. I was ready and anxious to make my mark upon the world of professional accounting. Behind me was the university--the campus and the environment that had meant so much to me. In front of me was the chance of my lifetime.<br><br>Within days of beginning my first real job, a professional mentor put his arm around me and invited me to become involved with a BYU alumni group. He was an influential executive in the accounting firm for which I worked, and, frankly, I had but little choice to agree.<br><br>Well, that was a lot of years and, as you can see, a lot of hair ago. But how fortunate I was to have someone who was intuitive enough to encourage me along such a meaningful path. Over the years I have made a deliberate decision to be actively involved with the BYU alumni groups. And in the process, some significant things have happened:<br><br>First, I was introduced to an array of activities and opportunities that were beneficial to me from a professional and a social standpoint.<br><br>Second, the individuals with whom I have become involved have been supportive, if not influential, in my own professional development.<br><br>Third, I was introduced to an opportunity to stay connected with the university and to continue to feel that sense of deeper emotion and attachment that comes from just being on this campus.<br><br>Fourth, and perhaps most significant to me at this point, my involvement with BYU alumni groups has given me the chance to try and repay the university--both in volunteer service and in resources. It is just a small portion of everything I received here. And just like you, I think I will always be in arrears on that scorecard, but I will never stop trying to repay that debt.<br><br>And so, this is it! Your tomorrow is here. As you leave the campus and pursue the chance of<i>your</i>lifetime, I am confident that you will reflect often on the educational and spiritual roots provided by your BYU experience.<br><br>Come back to campus often for athletic games, performing arts concerts, Aspen Grove Family Camp, Campus Education Week, Women's Conference, and Homecoming festivities. I think you will find that every visit renews your love for the university and strengthens your resolve to "Go Forth to Serve."<br><br>There are now over 150 alumni chapters throughout the U.S. and abroad and more than 350,000 alumni. Make a difference: contact your local chapter and join with us in the rewarding process of replenishing the wells from which we have all benefited.<br><br>In conclusion, as president of the BYU Alumni Association, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. May you consider the honor, the value, and the responsibility of this title and use it well is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Brent W.

<h1>rning and Ever Improving - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers, sisters, and friends, it is my great privilege on this happy day to add my welcome to all of you and my congratulations to those we honor. We are grateful for the presence of Elder Richard G. Scott of the Quorum of the Twelve and chairman of the executive committee of the board of trustees, Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the Twelve, and other honored and special guests.<br><br>For me, today is a commencement in the usual sense of the word. It is my first graduation exercise as president of this wonderful, special, and unique university. I am learning much that many of you already know from your own BYU experience. There is nothing like it in the world.<br><br>Every day brings surprises--most of them are good, and a few are really exciting and exhilarating. Many are spiritual and even sacred, some are encouraging and lifting, and some are just plain interesting. Let me share just a few of the interesting ones. Although the numbers I report often include the large army of missionaries at the MTC across the street, you might still be impressed. For example, I am told that our annual consumption of ice cream on this campus is about 100,000 gallons! My kind of place! Each year we also consume 350,000 pizzas, 160,000 pounds of French fries, and 2.5 tons of fudge. We are not necessarily as proud of these statistics as we are about some of the others, but I thought you might like to know.<br><br>Our graduates today, generally representative of our entire student body, total 2,758 and come from 49 states, one territory, and 43 other countries. Most graduates are young, with the youngest just having turned 19, and a few are quite mature with the oldest being about the same age that I am. More than half of the graduates are married. All are qualified and presented today with our confidence and endorsement.<br><br>You will see from your program the diversity of disciplines and expertise shared by this distinguished graduating class. We know that you parents and family members, friends, and associates are joined by classmates and other students, faculty, and staff, as well as our administration, in our pride and appreciation for the tremendous accomplishments recognized and celebrated today.<br><br>I am impressed by what I believe our students and graduates have learned while here at BYU. I am even more optimistic about the future. I believe most here adorned in academic regalia have also learned a great deal about learning and are committed to continuing the vital learning process throughout their lives. The ability to continue to learn, to adjust, and to adapt is vital for everyone but is also a doctrinal mandate for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches us that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36) and that<br><br><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Thus we are committed to lifelong learning in both spiritual and secular spheres.<br><br>This compelling urge to learn continually is not only doctrinally sound but absolutely necessary. However well trained and prepared you are for today, the future will be different in ways neither predictable nor anticipated except that it will be different. Some careers will disappear and new ones will continue to emerge. In whatever we are currently planning, new tools and approaches will be necessary even if the nominal job or career description doesn't change. Let me give you an example--and I could choose from many--from my own background in medicine.<br><br>As recently as 60 or 70 years ago, thoracic surgeons (those who operate on the organs in the chest) spent much of their time removing lungs or parts of lungs damaged by tuberculosis. Then, more effective antibiotics for TB were developed and fewer lung operations were required.<br><br>What were these surgeons to do? Some retired, some changed specialties, some left medicine, and some decided that other organs in the chest, mainly the heart, needed attention that they were not then receiving. Many people suffered from rheumatic heart disease with damaged heart valves caused by the streptococcus bacteria. Creative, still-learning physicians devised ways to operate on the heart and fix or replace the damaged heart valves. Many lives were then saved or helped. Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve was involved in this pioneering work.<br><br>Then penicillin and other effective antibiotics became generally available and rheumatic heart disease became much rarer.<br><br>What were these heart surgeons to do? Some retired, some changed specialties, some left medicine, and some decided other problems of the heart not previously addressed needed attention. Coronary artery bypass surgery has now become almost routine. At almost the same time, alternate, less-invasive therapies have become available to prevent or treat heart disease. Incidentally, this includes advice that we exercise more and consume much less ice cream, pizza, and fudge!<br><br>What are these current doctors to do? Like before, they will weigh options and decide, but those who have continued to learn and those who are never satisfied that they know enough will discover or help create the next generation of miracles.<br><br>This lesson certainly applies to those graduates who will be entering medical school. But the lesson also applies to all the rest of us, whatever our careers or life work will be. We need to be ever learning and ever improving.<br><br>As we are reminded in the book of Proverbs, "A wise man [or woman] will hear, and will increase learning" (Proverbs 1:5). Likewise, your BYU education has qualified you for the blessing described in Daniel for those young people who live the Word of Wisdom and keep the Lord's other commandments: "God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom" (Daniel 1:17). You have knowledge and skill and know how to learn so that you may acquire wisdom.<br><br>Again I congratulate you on your accomplishments but even more on your preparation to continue your lifelong learning adventure so that you might fully achieve every additional blessing Heavenly Father has in store for you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this BYU commencement address was given on 14 August 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>o Forth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The message you have just heard from Elder Hales is some of the best counsel you will ever receive for finding success in the important areas of your life. However, in the excitement of commencement and its attendant activities, you may not have captured the deep significance of what he has shared. I strongly recommend that you use a copy of his message as a guide year after year, for life. It will pilot you through uncertainties and opportunities now and in the future to a life of great substance.<br><br>I am deeply grateful for the privilege of celebrating with each one of you graduates on this significant day of your life. The tremendous effort that has brought you this success with its inherent acquisition of professional skills and precious growth experiences will sustain you throughout life. These achievements were obtained through your tireless personal effort on a campus unique in all the world. You have been blessed by an administration, a faculty, and staff who are not only extremely gifted but have been worthy examples of faith, devotion, and leadership. You have found among your fellow students enduring friendships with those of similar noble characteristics. All of this has been done in a spiritual environment centered in principles of eternal truth. You are unique. Therefore, what we expect of you are future accomplishments far beyond those asked of a graduating class elsewhere. We are extremely proud of you. Your presence here indicates that you are each a singular man or woman of great value and potential. Your preparation here has provided an exceptional foundation for you to realize worthwhile ambitions and to accomplish much good.<br><br>It is normal that you feel some anxiety about the uncertainties concerning your future. Each of you faces different opportunities and challenges. If you feel no anxiety now, you will, because you are exceptional young men and women and the Lord will accelerate your growth by giving you experiences that will stretch your current capacity. Trust Him. As you stay close to Him through obedience and faith in His capacity to guide you, in time you will find the solution to every perplexing problem you face. The answers will likely come a portion at a time, but they will come.<br><br>Make raising an eternal family one of the highest priorities of your life. Focus the cream of your effort on that objective. Some of you have begun that sacred work as wife and husband. Others are searching for that eternal companion. Some may have feelings that you will not have that blessing. Do not cheat yourself that way. Decide now that you will live to be led to an eternal companion. Then live to permit the Lord to guide you to that dream on His timetable. I testify that the greatest happiness in this life comes as a wife and husband, mother and father, work together under the guidance of the Lord to create an eternal family.<br><br>Establish a set of guiding principles for your life, and never compromise them. Make no exception to them. Difficulties in life begin when small deviations from true standards are made to justify a quick move to a greater accomplishment. Over time that pattern brings failure. Strength comes from making no exceptions to foundation principles. Without such guidelines, an individual lives from moment to moment, making decisions according to current circumstances. Such a one is doomed to violate eternal truths and lose by rationalization many of the marvelous opportunities of life that bring great achievement and happiness.<br><br>Be honest and loyal. Keep your word and keep your commitments. If your responsibility is to provide an income for a family, acquire work with good leadership in a field that really matters. Give more than is expected. With your background from this university, minimum or average work is plainly not acceptable. Admit mistakes when you make them--for we all do. Admitting your mistakes builds character and also respect. Accept full responsibility for your actions.<br><br>Live so as to be trusted. Trust opens wide the gate to exceptional opportunity and success. Seek to be challenged in what you do. Don't look for a safe haven where you have no risk, for you will not grow or have real satisfaction. Do not compartmentalize your life into segments that apply to profession, Church, and family with different standards used in each segment, as is done in the world. Your life must be a continuum in which uniform high standards of truth, integrity, and hard work will bring success to every aspect of life.<br><br>Smile. Everyone has problems, but nobody wants to know about yours. Smile a lot. It's a beautiful way to let sunshine into your life and to spread it to the joy and benefit of others.<br><br>Don't complain. There will be times when life just isn't fair. Some others may make unfair decisions that affect you professionally or otherwise. Don't waste time complaining. Life is charged with opportunity when you seek the help of the Lord to find it. Look for the gold nuggets of opportunity around you, mine them, and use them.<br><br>Serve others. Immense happiness comes from serving others selflessly. Always have a Church assignment. Always. Don't request specific callings but ask to be used so that you are constantly connected to the reality of eternal truth. That effort will keep your life in balance.<br><br>It is love for each of you that has motivated these comments. Their fulfillment will require you to continue to live a life of obedience to the Lord. With that pattern you will constantly be in a spiritual environment with protection against the contaminating influences of the world. It will require constant prayer and the courage to follow the spiritual promptings that come. It will result in the Lord guiding your footsteps in life to where you never imagined you would be blessed to go.<br><br>We are immensely proud of you, and we pray the Lord will bless you in every aspect of your life. More than that, in the name of Elder Hales and myself, as apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, we invoke a blessing upon each of you--a blessing that, based on your obedience and faith, the Lord will guide you through promptings of the Spirit to make correctly those decisions that will bring happiness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1> Passionate Apathy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At nine o'clock on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, in a plain room on the bottom floor of the Jesse Knight Humanities Building, I attended my first English class at Brigham Young University--a class about writing for the social sciences in which the first 10 minutes of discussion was only rarely related to the syllabus. The professor was passionate and inspiring, and he got a thrill out of bantering with us about art, politics, and the idiosyncrasies of life on campus. He would show us ragged torn-out pages from his favorite art books, inspire us by reading aloud fantastic examples of voice-filled prose, and joke, for example, about how you could practically brush your teeth with the frosting from the BYU Creamery's mint brownies. I always viewed this portion of his class as somewhat of a respite. Not only did I perceive the world of technical writing as inherently stale, I also simply appreciated his honesty and verve.<br><br>It is from this professor, in the opening moments of one day in this class, that I was most forcefully reminded of the responsibility that accompanies knowledge and the effort required to make a college experience worthwhile in the fullest sense. It happened about six weeks into the course. I remember being a southpaw sitting in a desk designed for a right-handed student, rubbing my hands together after walking in from an early autumn chill and wondering what our class would cover in the next hour. Soon the professor, too, walked in, sat down, and slowly started as usual into random but meaningful conversations with his students. I don't remember what the initial topic was, but somehow we got into a discussion about what it takes to turn belief into action, and he made one pithy statement that often occupies my mind. This is what he said: "Apathy is your passion." As you might imagine, it came across as a pointed accusation. My classmates and I were from a variety of majors--some sociology, some international relations, some political science--but, in the professor's mind, we were all apparently passionately apathetic toward the suffering of others and toward social and political problems. Personally, I was at first turned off by the remark, thinking it impossible that students majoring in the social sciences, physics, biology, or even the arts could be entirely apathetic about the well-being of others and the state of the world. "After all," I thought, "aren't pain and dysfunction phenomena that all of our studies at least obliquely address, attempt to better understand, and even reduce?" It seemed counterintuitive that students so consumed in efforts to learn about the world could be indifferent toward what is probably one of its most ubiquitous conditions: human suffering.<br><br>My professor didn't extrapolate, and the class discussion soon shifted to technical writing, but I kept thinking about that one statement--"apathy is your passion." It seemed that he was making an accusation of apathy based on what he had observed of human behavior in general. In retrospect, I don't think he meant to specifically question the character of his students. Knowing myself, however, his comment fell on at least one set of deserving ears. It's probably not too difficult, moreover, to find people--both on campus and off--who would rank highly in terms of intellectual passion for the study of foreign policy, medicine, anthropology, and other topics and at the same time rank poorly in terms of out-of-class efforts to produce change. I'm certain now that this is what my professor meant. He was talking about an apathy that is physical in its demonstration, not intellectual.<br><br>On the occasion I have described, there were probably no more that 15 students present, but I imagine that this professor has made a similar statement to many of his classes since. Indeed, I imagine that he would make a similar statement to most college students if he had the chance. I also imagine that he even accuses himself of passionate apathy at times. This is because although maybe only an enticement for the best of us, the reality is that a habit of inaction can be a passion for everyone--whether we study politics or physics, whether we are students or salaried corporate executives. Inaction carries intense inertia, and it is often difficult to do more than simply study and comment on the problems that surround us.<br><br>I briefly mention this story about my English professor because I think his insight is important for new graduates. We all have a great new opportunity to make use of the knowledge and skills we have acquired, to make sure that apathy is not our passion. I also mention the story because I have admired my professor as a person who effectively combines spirited involvement in the community with study. Others, however, also deserve compliments for their varying efforts to combine intellectual pursuits with real action. Apathy is a difficult passion to discard, but I have been deeply impressed on numerous occasions by the ability of both faculty members and my peers to make precisely this move. A friend of mine, for example, recently set up a nongovernmental organization to facilitate microlending to the suffering citizens of Mozambique. He did this entirely on his own, and only a couple of months after graduating. A friend who graduates today will soon be joining AmeriCorps in an effort to provide support for underprivileged inner-city youth. And several other peers have impressed me simply with their ability to creatively influence public perception regarding issues of social concern.<br><br>I feel lucky to have had the chance to interact with these and many other amazing, unassuming activists during the past four years. Observing their passionate interest--proven through action--in the state of the community, nation, and world has been among the most valuable experiences I have had at BYU. It has motivated me and probably others to overcome the natural human tendency for inaction. It has further validated the important lesson I learned on an early autumn morning from an inspiring English professor. It has reminded me that true passion is a vital component of achievement, success, and greatness. As we reflect today on our undergraduate experience, I hope we can view what's next as a tremendous opportunity to be passionate actors. We have all entered to learn, and we are now on the verge of exit. I hope that as we go forth to serve, we can do so in a way that shuns apathy and exudes intense, passionate energy.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><i>Ryan Matthew Scoville spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 14 August 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ed Responsibilities of Parenthood - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege for Sister Ballard and me to be with you today. I commend you for your desire to further your gospel education by spending a few days here at BYU. This campus has been specifically dedicated to the revealed truth that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36) and "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life . . . will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18). I pray that what I say may help us grow together spiritually as we discuss the sacred responsibilities of parenthood and "Family: 'Central to the Creator's Plan.'"<br><br>I want you to know that I endorse this theme for Education Week. I have profound respect for the family in a global sense and in an intimate, personal sense. As you know, that phrase--"central to the Creator's plan"--comes from the introductory paragraph of "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102). Please allow me to read the entire text of that sentence:<br><br><i>We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i><br><br>As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, I participated in the process of drafting that inspired document. It was a remarkable experience for all of us. As we travel the world, we see things--both within the Church and outside the Church. We were troubled by much of what we were seeing. We could see the people of the world wanting to define the family in ways contrary to God's eternal plan for the happiness of His children. Various world conferences were held dealing either directly or indirectly with the family. Major agenda items were introduced by some delegates that would have greatly weakened the family; yet, through the significant contributions of Church leaders, members, and other like-minded people, the language and thus the effects of those proposals were softened.<br><br>In the midst of all that was stirring on this subject in the world, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles could see the importance of declaring to the world the revealed, true role of the family in the eternal plan of God. We worked together through the divinely inspired council system that operates even at the highest levels of the Church to craft a proclamation that would make the Lord's position on the family so clear that it could not be misunderstood.<br><br>In introducing "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" at the General Relief Society Meeting in September 1995, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>With so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth, with so much of deception concerning standards and values, with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world, we have felt to warn and forewarn. In furtherance of this we of the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles now issue a proclamation to the Church and to the world as a declaration and reaffirmation of standards, doctrines, and practices relative to the family which the prophets, seers, and revelators of this church have repeatedly stated throughout its history.</i>["Stand Strong Against the Wiles of the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 100]<br><br>After reading the proclamation, President Hinckley concluded:<br><br><i>We commend to all a careful, thoughtful, and prayerful reading of this proclamation. The strength of any nation is rooted within the walls of its homes. We urge our people everywhere to strengthen their families in conformity with these time-honored values.</i>["Stand Strong," 101]<br><br>Since the proclamation came out eight years ago, time has overwhelmingly proven its prophetic insight. As a church we are more focused than ever in supporting and strengthening the family. Sadly, the family continues to be assaulted relentlessly throughout the world. You only need to read a newspaper or turn on the television to see how openly and viciously the war against the family is being waged. Gender is being confused, and gender roles are being repudiated. Same-gender marriage is being promoted in direct opposition to one of God's primary purposes for His children to experience mortality.<br><br>The family is not just the basic unit of society; it is the basic unit of eternity. We lived as Heavenly Father's spirit sons and daughters before this mortal existence. In that grand premortal family council, our Heavenly Father's plan for the eternal happiness and peace of His children was presented. We understood that we would come to this earth to live as families, and through the sealing authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood we could live throughout the rest of eternity as families.<br><br>It is alarming to see how intensely and openly the family is under attack in contemporary society. The proclamation is very clear:<br><br><i>We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>["The Family," 102]<br><br>We must stand firm, brothers and sisters, at this time when the adversary is using differing lifestyles in an attempt to replace the marriage of one man to one woman. It would be well for all people of the world to read the full text of the proclamation.<br><br>The attacks on the family also undermine the value of life--particularly the life of the unborn. Life is being trivialized and subjected to the vacillating whims of convenience and political correctness. You will find it troubling as I do that between 1950 and 1997, some 46 industrialized countries and nine developing nations legalized or removed most restrictions on abortion. Each year an estimated 46 million abortions take place worldwide. Indeed, some estimate that induced abortions end one-fourth of all pregnancies.<br><br>Far too many people view marriage as a "couples relationship," designed to fulfill the emotional needs of adults rather than an institution for rearing children. Children are considered a choice rather than a blessing. About 1 million children per year experience parental divorce and its aftermath, and about one-third of all children in America are born out of wedlock. Almost every trend indicates that we are on a slippery slope downward from God's plan for His children. The family, once universally hailed as the cornerstone of society, is losing its essential role.<br><br>When you stop and think about it, from a diabolically tactical point of view, fighting the family makes sense. When Satan wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he doesn't poison the world's peanut butter supply, thus bringing the Church's missionary system to its collective knees. He doesn't send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. He doesn't legislate against green Jell-O or casseroles. When Satan truly wants to disrupt the work of the Lord, he attempts to confuse gender and attacks God's plan for His spirit children. He works to drive a wedge of disharmony between a father and a mother. He entices children to be disobedient to their parents. He makes family home evening and family prayer inconvenient. He suggests family scripture study is impractical and not doable. That's all it takes, because Satan knows that the surest and most effective way to disrupt the Lord's work is to diminish the effectiveness of the family and the sanctity of the home.<br><br>Look at what he accomplishes when he does that. Couples unhappy in their marriages tend<i>not</i>to give appropriate gospel instruction in the home, both through formal family home evening lessons and through exemplary living. They are less likely to be committed to gospel principles in their own lives. Some drift from the Church. Apathy can overcome even the active members, keeping them away from the temple and weakening their capacity to be effective leaders and teachers--thus leaving countless lives untouched and slowing the Lord's work. And the Internet, when<i>not</i>properly used, is a vicious influence in the home. So we know, without question, Lucifer is the enemy of the family!<br><br>Many of you will remember that I have spoken at some length recently about the need to raise up the greatest generation of missionaries in history. Conditions in today's world demand a missionary corps of young men and women filled with faith and deeply anchored testimonies of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ through the Prophet Joseph Smith. They need to be like Helaman and his 2,000 stripling warriors, young men who "were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20).<br><br>Helaman explained the power of these young men:<br><br><i>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their</i>mothers,<i>that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</i><br><br><i>And they rehearsed unto me the words of their</i>mothers,<i>saying: We do not doubt our</i>mothers<i>knew it.</i>[Alma 56:47–48; emphasis added]<br><br>Our youth need steadfast, courageous mothers--and they need fathers like Enos had. As you will recall, Enos was Lehi's grandson, the son of Jacob. Enos recorded that his father was "a just man" who "taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord--and blessed be the name of my God for it" (Enos 1:1).<br><br>The scriptural record seems to suggest that Enos had a spiritual change of heart one day while hunting. He wrote that during this quiet time alone, "the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart" (Enos 1:3).<br><br>Notice that this moment of spiritual enlightenment did not come at the height of a lecture from a concerned father to a troubled son. As important as those occasional lectures are, they rarely result in immediate long-term change. Nor did it come in the midst of one of Jacob's great gospel sermons. It may be that Jacob wasn't even alive to enjoy his son's spiritual rebirth. None of that matters. The important thing is Jacob made sure that he taught his son "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." Enos heard, and eventually he understood. And, as Enos said, "blessed be the name of my God for it."<br><br>Alma was one of the great Book of Mormon prophets. His son, also named Alma, rebelled against everything he was taught. According to the record, Alma the Younger was "a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities" (Mosiah 27:8).<br><br>As a result of the faith and prayers of his righteous father, Alma the Younger had a remarkable experience. It brought him to the knowledge of the truth. He explained:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i>[Alma 36:17–19]<br><br>A father's prayers made a difference in the life of Alma the Younger. A father's teachings eventually had impact upon the life of his wayward son.<br><br>As with these scriptural examples, so with us. What we do and what we teach in our homes and in our families matters. With the proclamation as the primary text, let me share with you five concepts that will help insure happy and secure families.<br><h2><b>1. Full and Equal Partnerships</b></h2><br>Men and women joined together in marriage need to work together as a full partnership. However, a full and equal partnership between men and women does not imply the roles played by the two sexes are the same in God's grand design for His children. As clearly stated in the proclamation on the family, men and women, though spiritually equal, are entrusted with different but equally significant roles. These roles complement each other. Men are given stewardship over the sacred ordinances of the priesthood. To women, God gives stewardship over bestowing and nurturing mortal life, including providing physical bodies for God's spirit children and guiding those children toward a knowledge of gospel truths. These stewardships, equally sacred and important, do not involve any false ideas about domination or subordination. Each stewardship is essential for the spiritual progression of all family members--parents and children alike.<br><br>Family stewardships thus must be understood in terms of obligations and responsibilities--of love, service, and interdependence. Men who attempt to dominate their wives, who seek to exercise unrighteous dominion without regard to spousal counsel and sensitivities, simply don't understand that such actions are contrary to God's will. President Gordon B. Hinckley has made that abundantly clear:<br><br><i>Some men who are evidently unable to gain respect by the goodness of their lives, use as justification for their actions the statement that Eve was told that Adam should rule over her. How much sadness, how much tragedy, how much heartbreak has been caused through centuries of time by weak men who have used that as a scriptural warrant for atrocious behavior! They do not recognize that the same account indicates that Eve was given as a helpmeet to Adam. The facts are that they stood side by side in the garden. They were expelled from the garden together, and they worked together, side by side.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Our Solemn Responsibilities,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, 51]<br><br>It is within the family that divine potential is best realized for both men and women. The blessings and responsibilities of parenthood permit mothers and fathers to act, albeit imperfectly, in a new physical and spiritual relationship that draws them within God's purposes for their lives.<br><h2><b>2. Fathers</b></h2><br>The proclamation states: "Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families" ("The Family," 102). They teach their families the gospel and lead in kindness, following the counsel found in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants (see D&amp;amp;C 121:34–46).<br><br>They perform priesthood ordinances and give priesthood blessings, including father's blessings, to their children. They pray for and with family members, collectively and individually. They set an example of respect and love for their eternal companion and the mother of their children. In all things they follow the example of the Savior and strive to be worthy of His name and His blessing. Fathers should seek constantly for guidance from the Holy Ghost so they will know what to do, what to say, and also know what<i>not</i>to do and what<i>not</i>to say. They serve the family and the Church in the spirit of love and enthusiasm, by example preparing family members to serve--especially preparing sons to serve as worthy missionaries.<br><br>Part of the father's role in presiding in the home involves learning about each individual's needs and aspirations. Brigham Young advised parents to "study their [children's] dispositions and their temperaments, and deal with them accordingly" (<i>JD</i>19:221).<br><br>Fathers are expected by God and His prophets not only to provide for their families but also to protect them. Dangers of all sorts abound in the world in which we live. Physical protection against natural or man-made hazards is important.<br><br>Moral dangers are also all around us, confronting our children from their early years. Fathers play a vital role in protecting children against such snares. It is sad to note that children in single-parent families are more likely to drop out of high school, to get pregnant as teenagers, to abuse drugs, to be physically or sexually abused as children, and to be in trouble with the law than are those from families with both biological parents present.<br><br>We know that a father's role does not end with presiding, providing, and protecting family members. On a day-to-day basis, fathers can and should help with the essential nurturing and bonding associated with feeding, playing, storytelling, loving, and all the rest of the activities that make up family life. And grandfathers continue their shepherding role as long as they live.<br><h2><b>3. Mothers</b></h2><br>The proclamation teaches that "mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children" ("The Family," 102). Nurturing refers to parenting behaviors such as warmth, support, bonding, attachment, recognizing each child's unique needs and abilities, and attending to children's needs. Nurturing in and of itself is more important in the development of a child than is any particular method or technique of child rearing. It hardly needs saying that nurturing is best carried out in a stable, safe family context.<br><br>More than half a century ago, the First Presidency proclaimed, "Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind. It places her who honors its holy calling and service next to the angels" (<i>CR,</i>October 1942, 12–13).<br><br>A mother's nurturing love arouses in children, from their earliest days on earth, an awakening of the memories of love and goodness they experienced in their premortal existence. Because our mothers love us, we learn, or, more accurately, remember, that God also loves us. President Thomas S. Monson said, "One cannot forget mother and remember God. One cannot remember mother and forget God. Why? Because these two sacred persons, God and mother, partners in creation, in love, in sacrifice, in service, are as one" ("Behold Thy Mother,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1998, 6).<br><br>Today there is significant pressure in our materialistic world to have and to spend more money. Unfortunately this draws married mothers to work outside the home to provide a second family income. As husbands, wives, and children recognize the difference between basic necessities and material wants--as manifest in the choice of house, household furnishings, car, entertainment, travel, etc.--they lessen family financial burdens and contribute to helping mothers be at home. Decisions about working outside the home are difficult ones and need to be made prayerfully, keeping ever in mind the counsel of the living prophets on this complex issue. President Gordon B. Hinckley, with his usual sensitive, loving spirit, gave us this wise perspective:<br><br><i>Some years ago President Benson delivered a message to the women of the Church. He encouraged them to leave their employment and give their individual time to their children. I sustain the position which he took.</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, I recognize, as he recognized, that there are some women (it has become very many in fact) who have to work to provide for the</i>needs<i>of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can. I hope that if you are employed full-time you are doing it to ensure that</i>basic needs<i>are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries. The greatest job that any mother will ever do will be in nurturing, teaching, lifting, encouraging, and rearing her children in righteousness and truth. None other can adequately take her place.</i><br><br><i>It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee. I know how some of you struggle with decisions concerning this matter. I repeat, do the very best you can. You know your circumstances, and I know that you are deeply concerned for the welfare of your children.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Women of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, 69; emphasis added]<br><br>President Hinckley's counsel raises significant questions about time pressures on mothers. Taking care of small, dependent, and demanding children is never-ending and often nerve-wracking. Mothers must not fall into the trap of believing that "quality" time can replace "quantity" time. Quality is a direct function of quantity--and mothers, to nurture their children properly, must provide both. To do so requires constant vigilance and a constant juggling of competing demands. It is hard work, no doubt about it.<br><br>Sometimes you sisters may feel like the Brethren do not appreciate you and the important contribution you make to your families and to the work of the Lord. Perhaps if husbands and fathers experienced what someone suggested might be planned for the next<i>Survivor</i>show, it would make a difference:<br><br><i>Six men will be dropped on an island with one van and four children each--for six weeks. Each child plays two sports and either takes music or dance classes. There is no access to fast food.</i><br><br><i>Each man must take care of his four children, keep his assigned house clean, correct all homework, complete science projects, cook, do laundry, etc.</i><br><br><i>The men only have access to television when the children are asleep and all chores are done: There is only one TV, and there is no remote control.</i><br><br><i>The men must put on makeup daily, applying it themselves either while driving or while making four lunches. They must attend weekly PTA meetings; clean up after their sick children at 3:00 a.m.; make an Indian hut model with six toothpicks, a tortilla, and one marker; and get a four-year-old to eat a serving of peas.</i><br><br><i>The children vote them off the island based on performance. The winner is the first one voted off who gets to go back to work.</i>[Various versions available on the World Wide Web]<br><br>Although that may be slightly exaggerated, it does convey a vivid picture of the demands of motherhood. Never doubt, sisters, that you are the heart of the home. Your attitude--whether happy, sad, positive, or negative--will likely be reflected in the feelings of your husband and your children.<br><br>President James E. Faust has given very wise counsel:<br><br><i>Women today are being encouraged by some to have it all--generally, all simultaneously: money, travel, marriage, motherhood, and separate careers in the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>Doing things sequentially--filling roles one at a time at different times--is not always possible, as we know, but it gives a woman the opportunity to do each thing well in its time and to fill a variety of roles in her life. A woman . . . may fit more than one career into the various seasons of life. She need not try to sing all the verses of her song at the same time.</i>["A Message to My Granddaughters: Becoming 'Great Women',"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1986, 18, 19]<br><br>And grandmothers continue their nurturing role as long as they live.<br><h2><b>4. Principles for Marriage and Families</b></h2><br>Let me quote again from the proclamation: "Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities" ("The Family," 102). Parents should work to create loving, eternal connections with their children. Reproof or correction will, to be sure, sometimes be required. But it must be done sensitively, persuasively, with "an increase of love" thereafter, "lest [the child] esteem [the parent] to be his enemy" (D&amp;amp;C 121:43). (See Craig H. Hart, "Three Essential Parenting Principles," in Family Focus,<i>BYU Magazine,</i>spring 2003, 58.)<br><br>It can be equally destructive when parents are too permissive and overindulge their children, allowing them to do as they please. Parents need to set limits in accordance with the importance of the matter involved and the child's disposition and maturity. Don't make mountains out of molehills, and don't produce what to a child seems an interminably long list of rules. Help children understand the reasons for rules, and always follow through with appropriate discipline when rules are broken. It is important as well to praise appropriate behavior. It will challenge all of your creativity and patience to maintain this balance, but the rewards will be great. Children who understand their boundaries through the consistent application of important rules are more likely to do well at school, to be more self-controlled, and to be more willing to abide by the laws of the land (from Hart, "Three Principles," 59).<br><br>Parents need to be consistent and loving, taking into account each child's unique nature and disposition; setting appropriate limits to acceptable behavior, including modest dress, clean language, and dignified appearance; and then allowing each child his or her needed autonomy. Children are better prepared for the inevitable day when they leave home if parents "teach them correct principles and they [learn to] govern themselves" (Joseph Smith, quoted by John Taylor in "The Organization of the Church,"<i>Millennial Star</i>13, no. 22 [15 November 1851]: 339; James R. Clark, comp.,<i>Messages of the First Presidency,</i>6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966–75], 3:54; also see<i>JD</i>10:57–58).<br><br>Helping children learn how to make decisions requires that parents give them a measure of autonomy, dependent on the age and maturity of the child and the situation at hand. Parents need to give children choices and should be prepared to appropriately adjust some rules, thus preparing children for real-world situations (see Hart, "Three Principles," 59). To do this, parents must listen--really listen--to what their children are saying. They must know what is important to each child. I learned this lesson years ago from one of our daughters. She was only four or five at the time. She came into the room all excited. I was reading the newspaper, and she had something very much on her mind that was important to her. I was responding, "Yes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh." All of a sudden the newspaper came crashing down under her two little hands. She grabbed my face between her hands so that she could look me right in the eye. This was a little four- or five-year-old teaching her father a great lesson: "Daddy, you're not listening to me." And she was right.<br><br>Parents, let's listen and know what is important in the lives of our children. If we fail to listen, if we don't try to understand their point of view, how can we expect them to come to us for guidance in making important decisions?<br><h2><b>5. Family Councils</b></h2><br>As you would expect to hear from me, one of the best tools we have at our disposal as parents is the family council. I cannot emphasize enough its importance in helping to understand and address challenges in the family. When members of one family began to feel unusual contention invading their home, they called a family council to discuss the situation. The father and then the mother explained to their children what they had observed and asked how each felt about it. The mother and father learned that since their two oldest children had left home--one to be married and one to go to college--an unfair burden of responsibility had been unwittingly shifted to the two oldest children remaining at home, and they were becoming resentful. By counseling together and listening to what their children were feeling, a more equitable distribution of responsibility was made among the children, resolving much of the frustration and tension in the home (see M. Russell Ballard,<i>Counseling with Our Councils</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1997], 154).<br><br>I recognize that there are as many kinds of family councils as there are different kinds of families. Family councils can consist of one parent and one child, of two parents and several children, of just two parents, or of just siblings, etc. Regardless of the size or makeup of the family council, what really matters are loving motivation, an atmosphere that encourages free and open discussion, and a willingness to listen to the honest input of all council members--as well as to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit (see Ballard,<i>Counseling,</i>157).<br><br>Family councils can be a blessing in the lives of families and individual family members in this life and through the eternities. Through them we can draw closer to our families and closer to God. They provide a unique opportunity for fathers and mothers to extend their loving influence in important ways (see Ballard,<i>Counseling,</i>158).<br><br>As our families counsel together with the understanding that we are the family of God, we come to know that He loves us. We are precious to Him. He cares. He wants to help us. He wants to give us the support and help that we need in times of crisis. Much of that support and strength comes through counseling with one another (see Ballard,<i>Counseling,</i>160).<br><br>We need to remember that our families are imperfect because they are made up of imperfect people. Still, there are things we can do to improve our families and each individual who lives within them as we move forward together toward fulfilling the Creator's eternal plan for us. In all that we do, we must always remember that the voice of the Spirit is an essential component--and it is a still, small voice. God's most significant messages come quietly, softly, sweetly. Barbara and I have raised seven children, and there have been some traumatic, difficult challenges through the years. Through my wife's influence, there has been a spirit of calmness in our family even when times were tough. She has taught me through firsthand, personal experience that you cannot teach nor cradle nor weld together a celestial, eternal family if there is contention in the home.<br><br>If any of you are struggling with contention in your homes, you can change this. Talk to your family. Ask for their help. Tell them you don't want a contentious spirit in the home anymore and discuss what each family member can do to prevent it. More than 20 years ago, President Marion G. Romney taught:<br><br><i>I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart.</i>["The Book of Mormon,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1980, 67]<br><br>Let the spirit in the home reflect the attitude of the still, small voice. It is this spirit that will imbue us with sufficient spiritual strength to feel confident and patient in our family relationships. In that same 1980 conference address, President Romney declared:<br><br><i>If we would avoid adopting the evils of the world, we must pursue a course which will daily feed our minds with and call them back to the things of the Spirit. I know of no better way to do this than by daily reading the Book of Mormon.</i>["The Book of Mormon," 66]<br><br>We have spoken together today about fundamental, guiding principles for our homes and families--about full and equal partnerships, roles of fathers and mothers, principles for marriage and families, and family councils. Remember, also, there is great power in prayer. I strongly encourage personal and family prayer--which are important in building strong families--but I want to emphasize something else as well. I'm wondering if many of you parents--you couples--have lost that essential moment of kneeling together at the end of the day, just the two of you, holding hands and saying your prayers. If that has slipped away from your daily routine, may I suggest you put it back--beginning tonight!<br><br>This is a great time to thank the Lord for your companion and for your children and for one more day together. My wife and I have had that practice for more than 50 years now. When it is her night to pray, she offers a simple, wonderful prayer of gratitude; and when it is mine, I hope it is the same. I want to bear witness to you that it makes a difference. I do not believe Lucifer can penetrate a marriage, or cause discord and misunderstanding within a marriage and the family, when parents take time to pray together. Don't try to work through the daily challenges of life without kneeling together and calling down the blessings of heaven into your marriage and your family, letting Heavenly Father help you get from where you are to where you would like to be.<br><br>My remarks today have been primarily focused on the sacred roles of fathers and mothers. Please do not think I am unmindful or uncaring about the many married persons who have been denied the blessings of parenthood through no fault of their own. I am also well aware of the heart-wrenching sorrow of so many who walk the paths of life alone without a faithful companion at their side. I testify to you, as a servant of God, that no meaningful blessing related to marriage and family will be denied you in the eternities if you will be strong, be loving, and stay faithful. Pray always. He will hear and answer your prayers "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68). And never underestimate the influence for good you can be in the life of a sister, a niece, a brother, or a nephew.<br><br>In conclusion, to parents everywhere, my counsel is simple: Get a copy of "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." Read it and strive to align your marriage and your family to its inspired, revealed direction from the Lord. Then, be the very best and act the very best you can. God will give you strength beyond your own as you strive daily to fulfill the most sacred mortal responsibility He gives to His children. Listen to the voice of the Spirit and the counsel of the living prophets. Be of good cheer. God did not place you on earth to fail, and your efforts as parents will not be counted as failure unless you give up.<br><br>May our Heavenly Father bless each and every one of you. May the peace of the Lord abide in your own hearts and overflow into your homes and families. I leave you my testimony that God lives. We are His children. Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior. They love us and want us to be faithful and happy. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>estions and Answers from a BYU President - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, colleagues, and friends, it is a privilege and honor to gather with you today in this Brigham Young University Annual University Conference. It is a special occasion for me, being my first such conference in my new capacity. I look forward to the discussions, presentations, and recognitions while we are together.<br><br>At the outset, you should know how much I appreciate the contributions made by all those who have gone before us. My gratitude is rapidly expanding as I see how strong the university is and witness the strides that have been made. Of course, my thanks most proximately go to President and Sister Bateman--whose work over the last years is clearly evident to all of us--but I also feel as if I am standing on the shoulders of Presidents Lee, Holland, and Oaks, who have been dear friends and colleagues in other settings. Likewise, I honor also those I have not known personally but who, too, did so much in their time.<br><br>I hope you know that I take this opportunity very seriously. I have thought in some detail about what I might say and have sought the counsel of the President's Council. I am grateful for their input and suggestions--both those that I have included and those not taken. As is usually said at the beginning of Church books by individual authors, all that I say is my own responsibility solely and does not necessarily represent the views or positions of the President's Council, BYU, or our sponsoring organization.<br><br>I have been delighted with my experiences as I have started to meet some of you--perhaps during my visits to each of the colleges, at a devotional or forum, in a lab or classroom. Perhaps it was at a new faculty orientation, at a faculty meeting, at Women's Conference, in the library or Wilkinson Center, or in any one of a myriad other places or settings on campus or in our BYU community.<br><br>Each of you has been cordial and welcoming. Sharon and I express our appreciation for your thoughtfulness, help, and patience as we become comfortable and situated in this great adventure.<br><br>As I meet and visit with different individuals and groups, I notice certain recurring questions, spoken or unspoken. Sometimes they come directly to me and, on occasion, to others thought to know me well. This is natural. I am new, and most of us are not well acquainted. It is understandable that you would like to know something about who I am, my vision for the university, and perhaps my disposition toward or experience regarding the major issues and opportunities we enjoy here at BYU.<br><br>In that spirit, as part of our initial and, in some cases, ongoing dialogue, I thought I might try to identify and address some of those recurrent questions. There are, of course, more questions than I can answer--even if I knew the answers. Some questions are ones I hope we, as a BYU community, will work on together. Others may never have final answers, though we will be blessed in our ongoing efforts to grapple with them individually and as a community. So today will, I hope, be part of our continuing campus conversation in which I so appreciate your welcoming me. Our group is too large to take questions from the floor. We will do that some more when we can be together in smaller groups, but today I'll try to deal with some of the queries that I have already received.<br><h2><b>Making the Change from the U to the Y</b></h2><br>Let's start with an easy question first.<br><br>Question: "Is it true that as a requirement of my appointment here at BYU I was required to retile the bottom of my swimming pool to change the big red U to a big white Y and that Sister Samuelson had to change the Go Utes license plates on her Mercedes?"<br><br>Answer: We have never had a swimming pool. Sharon drives a Ford Taurus with boring, standard-issue license plates. I would, however, call your attention to the fact that I have learned that my initials (COS) may on an upcoming appropriate occasion allow me to ride with a certain familiar mascot in a vehicle called a COS-MOBILE.<br><h2><b>My Own School Days</b></h2><br>Now, some very personal questions that tend to come from the more courageous among us, often meaning the students: "Has school always been easy for you?" "Have you ever been in academic trouble or failed a class or been on probation or expelled?" The short answer to each of these is no, but candor does demand some explanations and perhaps two or three examples. I have never received an F or E. Nor have I been placed on academic probation, but once I was put on probation when I was an 11-year-old in Primary.<br><br>I had the honor of being a safety patrol officer, for which I had a little red flag on a long white pole to assist the other children across the street after Primary. The matter that got me into trouble was that my associate in this assignment and I felt that we needed to delay the children from crossing the street until there was a car coming for us to stop. This was not met with uniform enthusiasm, and probation resulted, following a very direct correction. That ended my law enforcement career, but also my probations. It is not my intent ever to impede your proper progress.<br><br>What I said about failing any classes was technically correct, but on one occasion I came close, at least in my perception at the time. One of the key premedical courses was comparative vertebrate anatomy, and it was well known that an A was absolutely essential to medical school admission. I was a serious student and worked hard but consistently received C's on my tests, and that was my final grade. Incidentally, I was naïve enough not to know that the third of the class that did exceptionally well had old tests from the course and the professor always used the same tests!<br><br>I was crestfallen and felt that my aspirations had been trashed. Happily, a wonderful premed counselor helped me understand that this was not necessarily the end of the world and probably would not be unless this level of achievement became a pattern. Fortunately, it did not.<br><br>About 10 years after this comparative anatomy course trauma, I became the admissions dean of a medical school. I then learned that the common wisdom of my undergraduate years was a myth. In fact, the admissions committee was well aware of the testing practices of this anatomy professor and thus tended to discount the importance of his grades, rather than giving them the prominence that others, including possibly the professor, had attached to them.<br><br>While I am confessing, I should also probably add that I received a C my very last quarter as an undergraduate. (As you see, I'm ancient and went to college before semesters were invented.) I had already acquired more credit hours than needed for graduation (something we do not recommend), had been admitted to medical school, and was beginning to recognize how narrow my college education had been to that point and how grade-driven I had become (a usual necessity for admission to a professional school).<br><br>With my sister Carol--I have two sisters--I enrolled in a personal finance class. Again, I am confessing, not recommending. I decided that I would just listen to lectures, read the parts of the text that truly interested me (I'm afraid the selection was not extensive), and not study or prepare for examinations further. My sister, who got an A, was chagrined and embarrassed, but I remained true to my quest and earned a C.<br><br>I've admitted that school was never really easy, but I can identify a few discrete examples of things that made it more enjoyable. The first occurred early in grade school. I was not an early reader. My mother, who had been a first-grade teacher, encouraged me all that she could, but for some reason I was not interested. A defining moment transpired at the beginning of the third grade. Mrs. Brown, our teacher, evaluated our entering reading competence and determined that I was more suited to take the B, or easier, version of the<i>Weekly Reader.</i>This was based on her evaluation of my poor reading skills.<br><br>I was shocked, my mother was embarrassed, and together we agreed to change things in short order--which we did. My fifth-grade teacher could not understand my mother's elation when it was reported at parent-teacher conference that I had developed the "terrible habit" of always having a book open in my lap even when the class was supposed to be working on something else. I have never gotten over my love of reading or my appreciation for Mrs. Brown.<br><br>The second, and perhaps more important, component in my progressive enjoyment of educational pursuits that I will mention began shortly after my trauma with comparative anatomy. By then, Sharon and I were engaged and had planned our marriage over the Thanksgiving holiday so that we could have a little honeymoon without the necessity of missing school. I was the student; she was teaching school. I had a compelling problem and decision to make, and Sharon supported me fully in my general quest to be a serious student and even in the specifics that I will describe.<br><br>I was enrolled in the embryology course that really was key to medical school admission. The kindly counselor who helped me put comparative anatomy in perspective was also my professor in this class. Therefore I absolutely needed to do well! I've given my defense and now will share the offense for which I have received frequent ribbing for almost 39 years.<br><br>Sharon and I were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple on Wednesday morning. After the temple ceremony, the pictures, and the wedding breakfast, she and my brother drove me to the university campus, where I spent the afternoon in my embryology class and lab. I was on time for the wedding reception that evening!<br><br>A very good friend was the TA for the class, and he told the professor of my circumstances because on the very next Monday a major exam for the class was scheduled. I had been doing well to that point, and the professor was compassionate. He told my friend that we could probably disregard that upcoming test if I did well on all the others. I, of course, knew nothing at that time of this agreement.<br><br>Monday came, we were home from the honeymoon, and I took the test. I didn't fail and, in fact, got 100 percent correct! I had prepared well--but I emphasize only<i>before</i>the wedding--and was finally convinced that advanced, persistent preparation really does pay! Dr. Newby, the professor, called me in and said he was tempted to ask specifics about the honeymoon but wouldn't. He did say that clearly, in my case, marrying the right girl was the most important correct decision I had ever made. I have recalled often the truth of that statement. She did, and does, make me a much better student, even in the face of my obvious limitations.<br><h2><b>Brigham Young University Today</b></h2><br>Let us shift our focus toward BYU and our current circumstances.<br><br>You should know I am becoming acquainted with the Mountain West and other affiliated athletic conferences. We convene in person and telephonically on a regular basis. And I am one--if not the only--General Authority whose stake conference assignments are determined by Cougar game schedules.<br><br>Another common question: President Dallin H. Oaks arrived, and shortly thereafter BYU had a law school. "Will my arrival be followed by the announcement of a BYU medical school?" No. We are grateful for the professional training and impact that our J. Reuben Clark Law School and Marriott School of Management have on campus, in their professional circles, and around the world, but I think it highly unlikely that we will be adding a medical or dental school or other professional schools anytime soon.<br><br>We will strive to continue to improve in all that we currently do. For example, with the tremendous generosity of people like Ira Fulton and his family, for whom the College of Engineering and Technology will soon be named, we will do more at a higher level of achievement than ever before.<br><br>Regarding new disciplines, I would fully expect that when and as appropriate, but not prematurely, we may well add new programs not currently found at BYU. Part of this will be the natural consequence of the emergence of new disciplines as the frontiers of knowledge and the way we organize them continue to expand.<br><h2><b>Selection and Mandate</b></h2><br>Now, some often-asked questions regarding the relationship between Brigham Young University, our board of trustees, and my role as BYU president:<br><br>Question: "How were you selected to be BYU president, and do you come with a special mandate or charge?"<br><br>Answer: I would not normally raise this topic on my own, but since the question has been asked frequently, let me mention some of what President Hinckley has publicly said about such things. One such occasion was a recent commencement at a public institution of higher education in this state. President Hinckley noted that the president of that institution was in transition. President Hinckley quipped that in the Church Educational System we just call someone and sustain them before the people, and the person is ready to function that day--no elaborate search committees, no politicking, no jockeying for position.<br><br>That was certainly true in my case. I received a phone call one day asking if I would meet President Hinckley in his office. After greeting me, President Hinckley basically asked one question: "How would you like a change of scenery?" We members of the Seventy are used to moving to different assignments. I had been at Salt Lake headquarters for a few years. So I thought, "Afghanistan, here I come." What I said was, "President, whatever you would like is what I would like."<br><br>With great kindness but also with considerable brevity, President Hinckley indicated that President Merrill J. Bateman, who had served wonderfully well as BYU's 11th president, was being reassigned to full-time Church service. President Hinckley said he would like me to serve as BYU's 12th president. I was, of course, surprised but pleased. At first Sharon thought I was spoofing her, as I sometimes do. However, she soon realized I was serious. She was as honored and humbled as was I with this unexpected but exhilarating opportunity.<br><br>Was there a charge? "You'll do what is right," President Hinckley said. Subsequent to that time, President Hinckley has called to see how our Provo housing is coming but has not given further new or specific direction. Elder Eyring, as Church commissioner, and the board arranged for us to have a nice university residence here in Provo. Sharon's one request was a double oven. We are now in the process of moving in and are anxious to be here full-time physically, as we are already emotionally.<br><br>Those of you familiar with the governance of BYU will understand that--unlike many other institutions where policies are largely determined by their presidents--BYU is fortunate to have a fully knowledgeable, participatory, and engaged board of trustees, executive committee of the board, and commissioner of education.<br><br>As BYU president I meet monthly with our board of trustees, which, as you know, is chaired by the president of the Church; cochaired by his two counselors; and composed of several members of the Quorum of the Twelve, the senior member of the seven presidents of the Seventy, and the general presidents of the Relief Society and Young Women organizations. I likewise meet monthly with the executive committee of the board. Each month Elder Henry B. Eyring, as Church commissioner of education, meets with me and the BYU President's Council to review and give counsel on university matters.<br><br>So we as a university are board-led, something for which I am very grateful. That is not to say that we are micromanaged, because we are not. The president is given sufficient latitude to get himself into significant trouble on his own!<br><h2><b>Differences of Opinion</b></h2><br>All this leads to another very natural question: "President Samuelson, you're a General Authority of the Church, but you're also the president of BYU. On BYU matters, can we disagree or even argue with you?"<br><br>My response is, "Of course." Open discussions are the lifeblood of universities, including BYU. We face many complex issues, and each of us may have different perspectives that we need to share with one another. What we each do inevitably affects each other. It is natural and expected that we be candid and frank with each other. And I have every expectation that the vigor of our dialogue will be matched by our mutual respect.<br><h2><b>General Authorities</b></h2><br>A related question: "Occasionally we hear that one or more of the General Authorities wants us to do this or not do something else. How do we know how to handle these situations?"<br><br>Answer: It is the policy of the board that General Authority requests to use university resources should come through established channels. This is also true as we make requests of the Brethren. It is reflexive, and wonderful, that we each want to be responsive to opportunities to build the kingdom and help the Church. We want to follow and support the Brethren. In this respect, much wonderful work is accomplished--most of it quietly--by many here at BYU. One advantage of my having worked where I have for the past few years is that I am comfortable checking with the Brethren and others of our leaders and Church associates regarding their priorities and suggestions. This helps clarify if and when direction is in fact coming from appropriate authority in Salt Lake. Also, because we have the established reporting line I mentioned earlier, we can be sure that instruction or direction to us is coming through proper established channels.<br><br>I want to underscore my appreciation for the fact that our established channels of communication with our board of trustees, executive committee, and Church education commissioner are two-way in their consultation and communication. I hope that I can listen to them as carefully as they listen to us.<br><br>Let me share two further observations. It is my understanding of our doctrine that even the process of searching for religious truth often requires us to study things out in our minds--sometimes over extended periods of time. Often we need in the "process of time" (Moses 7:21) to consider multiple and perhaps contending perspectives before arriving at the assurance of a conclusion on which to act. Although we may have the natural tendency to "hasten [the] work in its time" (D&amp;amp;C 88:73), we also must remember the virtue of patience and the promise that "all things must come to pass in their time" (D&amp;amp;C 64:32).<br><br>I also know that an inspired answer given for one situation or at a certain time does not mean that it will always be the answer in other circumstances. We believe, after all, in continuing guidance--all preceded by the spirit and process of open discussion, study, and consideration. After appropriate deliberation, once university decisions are made, I hope we will all wholeheartedly implement and support them. In my thus-far limited BYU experience, I give you all high marks for your cooperation as we meet our opportunities and problems.<br><br>Second, let me also note that, on occasion, I may be asked by our board to take a certain approach or to implement a certain policy. On those occasions I will be as clear as possible as to the source of our directions. I know you will want, as I will, to follow that guidance in letter and spirit regardless of how much or little discussion has preceded it or even if it varies from our personal preferences or perspectives.<br><h2><b>A Case of Nepotism?</b></h2><br>Now a personal, family question: "Is there any conflict of interest or nepotism in having a BYU vice president directly related to the BYU president?"<br><br>The vice president mentioned is, of course, my sister Jan Samuelson Scharman, who is responsible for Student Life. Elder Eyring addressed this question in April with the deans, directors, and department chairs. Let me share what he said then. Elder Eyring indicated that the board of trustees had carefully considered the question of Sister Scharman and me serving at BYU at the same time. (The board's response, I am told, is even recorded in its official minutes.) According to Elder Eyring, the chairman of the board, speaking for the entire board, had declared our simultaneous service "a delightful arrangement." Jan and I are both aware of the burdens and blessings this opportunity presents. Established university policy does allow for siblings to work at this level with express board approval.<br><br>As our policy precludes, I did not hire Sister Scharman. She was here at BYU before I arrived, and, as another member of the First Presidency quipped, may well be here after I have gone. I do not approve Vice President Scharman's salary. That is, as with all President's Council members, a matter for the board of trustees.<br><h2><b>Rank and Status and Teaching</b></h2><br>Our next question is a fundamental one that relates to the mission of Brigham Young University. It is this: "How do we reconcile rank-and-status decisions that some say unduly reward scholarly productivity and outward, professional involvement at the expense of teaching with the repeated injunction that BYU's fundamental mission is to be a great undergraduate teaching institution?"<br><br>I am sure that as I learn more about the details of our rank-and-status policies, more about the full breadth and depth of our scholarly and creative productivity across all our different colleges and disciplines, and more about the remarkable learning and teaching and commitment to students that epitomize Brigham Young University, my insight will continue to increase on these important topics. I must say that I am gratified to learn that many of you share the same perception I have that often our most effective teachers are also our most effective researchers and best community citizens.<br><br>I also mention the comfort it is to reflect with you on these matters from my previous experience as a tenured professor, as a department chair, as a dean, and as a vice president. I think I have been, at least in part, in your shoes.<br><h2><b>Initial Observations</b></h2><br>All that said, some of my initial observations are these. I hope you will recognize their sources and origins.<br><br>We are mandated as a sacred trust by our sponsoring institution to be a great undergraduate teaching university. Our mission is no less than "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a Brigham Young University Education,</i>1).<br><br>That mission includes four educational goals (<i>The Mission,</i>1–2):<br><br>1. "All students at BYU should be taught the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ."<br><br>2. "Students at BYU should receive a broad university education."<br><br>3. "Students should also receive instruction in the special fields of their choice."<br><br>4. "Scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty and students, including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence, are essential and will be encouraged."<br><br>Approved by the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees, this mission is part of the charted course of the Church as it relates to the educational process with which we are involved (see J. Reuben Clark, Jr., "The Charted Course of the Church in Education," 1938).<br><br>Our BYU Aims explain that "a spiritually strengthening education warms and enlightens students by the bright fire of their teachers' faith while enlarging their minds with knowledge. It also makes students responsible for developing their own testimonies by strenuous effort" (<i>The Aims of a BYU Education,</i>4). As "members of the BYU community," we "rigorously study academic subjects in the light of divine truth. An eternal perspective shapes not only<i>how</i>students are taught but<i>what</i>they are taught" (<i>Aims,</i>5). Indeed, we state that "in preparing for the bachelor's degree, students should enlarge their intellects by developing skills, breadth, and depth: (1) skills in the basic tools of learning, (2) an understanding of the broad areas of human knowledge, and (3) real competence in at least one area of concentration" (<i>Aims,</i>5).<br><br>I am grateful that each of us at "Brigham Young University has always cared as much about strong moral character as about great mental capability. Consequently, a BYU education should reinforce such moral virtues as integrity, reverence, modesty, self-control, courage, compassion, and industry" (<i>Aims,</i>10). Indeed, as President Spencer W. Kimball emphasized and as our Aims proclaim, BYU "has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service--men and women who will become stalwarts in the Kingdom and bear witness of the . . . divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ" (<i>Aims,</i>11; quoting Spencer W. Kimball, "On My Honor,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1978</i>[Provo: BYU Press, 1979], 137).<br><br>We who believe in enduring to the end train for lifelong learning and service. "Well-developed faith, intellect, and character prepare students" (<i>Aims,</i>12) to "bring strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind" (<i>The Mission,</i>1). It is not wrong to look for the enduring fruits of our labors in the lives of the children and grandchildren of our graduates.<br><br>Put another way, Brigham Young University's institutional objectives include educating the minds and spirits of students, advancing truth and knowledge, extending the blessings of learning to members of the Church in all parts of the world, and developing friends for the university and the Church (see http://www.byu.edu/president/objectives.html). When carefully considered, we can understand, for example, why our research is done and is so important. It blesses the lives of our students as their understanding of real learning increases, and they are able to link these expanding truths with an enhanced quality of life. Remember, in all that we do, our mission is "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (<i>The Mission,</i>1).<br><br>As you have recognized, I have spent considerable time reiterating the basic documents that detail BYU's charted course, mission, aims, and institutional objectives for a reason. These are the foundational documents that set our course. One of my main responsibilities is to be sure we are rooted in and proceed according to that which is established and secure. This is who we are, why we are, and what we are. Our great responsibility is to select from the myriad opportunities that await us each day so as to contribute to our larger, established identity and purpose.<br><h2><b>Academic Focus</b></h2><br>Let us continue our discussion and questions.<br><br>"Where as BYU president do you see your attention being focused?" I have already learned that many things demand my time and effort, and all are not optional. As I consider where I might best focus my discretional energies here at BYU, I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to what I call our soft, or academic, infrastructure. I want it to be as solid as the wonderful physical, or hard, infrastructure of this beautifully appointed, well-equipped campus.<br><br>I am not saying, of course, that we will not build any new buildings while I am here. We will complete our current building projects, and they will bless us all. Other building projects will develop, which we will undertake with board approval if and when full funds are raised. But the physical infrastructure may be less my initial focus precisely because we are already quite well provisioned for--even in the face of obvious deficiencies in some key areas. I want us to be as good as we say we are and as others think we should be. I am convinced that our human deficiencies are more often our major impediments than are our physical circumstances. Let us together continue to raise the bar in the quality of our learning and teaching, our scholarly and creative works, our outreach and services. Although what I have said applies to our students, it applies equally well and importantly to all of us in the university community--whatever our assignment or role.<br><h2><b>Student Mentoring</b></h2><br>Student mentoring has had much recent discussion and is vital in our faculty-student relationships in every discipline. We all know that for our students to do well in their next steps, they usually need detailed, personal letters of recommendation and other interventions. They may need a phone call from one of us to an associate or friend in a key graduate program, school, or internship. For these efforts to be effective and credible, we need to know our students well. They need us to mentor them.<br><br>But there is something new and increasingly important in our ongoing effort to capture and challenge the full capacities of our many gifted undergraduate students--in ways that advance our common scholarship and development of academic skills as well as our efforts to solve real-world problems. So our focus on student mentoring will continue.<br><br>We still have much common and individual work to do regarding the definitions and application of mentoring to the sciences and humanities, to book and article cultures, to creative and scholarly efforts, to the myriad ways in which BYU is an undergraduate teaching institution, leavened by our ongoing consequential research and creative contributions, important graduate programs, and our considerable service duties.<br><h2><b>Salary and Resources</b></h2><br>Now a practical question: "Do the Brethren realize that for most of the faculty and staff, we are behind most of our national peers in terms of salary and sometimes other resources?"<br><br>The short answer is yes. There will continue, and probably should always be, a dynamic tension between our teaching commitments, our research and creative demands, and the resources to accomplish what we want to do. Likewise, the board is unapologetic in its view that an element of sacrifice continues to have importance as a component of the offering we make in our BYU service. It is vital to note, however, that they will do all in their power to insulate us from the financial threats and crises so common in the first half of our institutional history.<br><br>We will probably never have all the lab or classroom space; all the disposable time or travel money; all the equipment, facilities, or other resources we might desire. We will continually revitalize our efforts by replacing that which is less necessary or timely with that which is more pressing or urgent. But--unlike cousin institutions that frequently find themselves bucking the waves of changing financial tides--due to the generosity of our sponsoring Church and our own careful prioritization and internal reallocations, we will have enough to succeed.<br><h2><b>Extramural Funding</b></h2><br>A related question: "How do we feel about various potential sources of extramural funding? What can we properly do to access these funds more effectively?"<br><br>I see this as one of my roles and responsibilities to help us garner the resources necessary to accomplish our vision and purposes. And I will work hard with each of you in that effort, though, as I have mentioned in some of my college visits, I expect you to be at least as interested in that effort as you expect me to be. We are well situated with our development and LDS Foundation associates to do even more than the impressive work already accomplished, but our success does depend on all of us as we work together carefully under the direction of our deans, chairs, and others in leadership.<br><br>Likewise, we will carefully but actively look to private foundations and even government sources that do not compromise our principles or mission. In all of this we will coordinate closely with the board, as we do with every major initiative.<br><br>As you know, we take all major expenditures at the university to the board, regardless of the source of the funds. This approach has given us tremendous board support because we clearly signal that we understand that all funds at the university are sacred. This approach has also opened the way for us to pursue many new and ongoing funding sources, largely through a cadre of friends of the university who have been exceptionally generous in sharing their time, talents, advice, and means. And we are looking to push the frontiers of these efforts, including in the fall a possible satellite-enabled, worldwide broadcast to BYU alumni.<br><h2><b>Future Changes</b></h2><br>Next question: "Do you plan any significant changes of any sort in the near future?"<br><br>As I said, I am the new kid on the block and very much in a learning mode. I am just participating in my first cycle of resource planning. We are also gearing up for reaffirmation of university accreditation: a process that naturally provides a cross-campus inventory on where we are and where we might want to go--though I am conscious of keeping that effort focused, transparent, and cost effective. So, although we can and should expect ongoing change in an organic and dynamic organization such as BYU, it is fair to say that I currently have no major or immediate changes planned. We have wonderful vice presidents, deans, chairs, and other leaders. Our staff people are generally superb. Their desires and needs, as well as the institution's, will be evaluated regularly.<br><br>Please do not take my honest current opinion as either a statement of perpetual status quo or as a broken promise if and when changes do continue to take place on this never-still campus. In referring to my medical background, President Hinckley said I was not appointed because BYU is sick but rather to keep it healthy. That I am committed to doing, even when it requires changes in our habits, priorities, or style as conditions around us evolve.<br><h2><b>Enrollment, Expectations, Opportunities</b></h2><br>Some have asked another question regarding enrollment limits: "Will they be lifted or liberalized? How can we broaden access to a BYU experience?"<br><br>Now we are moving into the area of questions I mentioned at the beginning--those to which I may not have an immediate answer but that we need to consider and work on together.<br><br>Although I cannot say at this point whether enrollment limits will be liberalized, I don't expect it in a dramatic way in the near term. I can say that we will want to look even more closely at the questions of how we better prepare our students before they come; how we better advise and help them determine (earlier, where appropriate) their majors and courses of study; how to help them make alternative plans when desirable or necessary; how we help them graduate with strong testimonies, schooling, and education; and how we help them find appropriate additional training or employment.<br><br>In this process I hope we can continue to work together to determine how best to help our students in some other dimensions as well. For example, I feel strongly that we have an obligation and opportunity to continue to raise the bar on what we expect of our students. This includes their understanding and personal endorsement of their Honor Code commitments. When so many want to come to BYU, we want to be sure that those who are here recognize and maximize their opportunities. I believe we must ask our students to contribute to all that is BYU and not just take away knowledge and academic credentials. This means exemplary behavior in living as well as in scholarship.<br><br>I see a double-edged opportunity to help our students integrate spiritual and secular information and values for themselves but also to be able to articulate and share their understandings, testimonies, and values with those whose values or cultural backgrounds may be different from their own.<br><h2><b>Pride and Complacency</b></h2><br>And it is always worth asking how we minimize pride and complacency on our campus. We need to be aware of and take comfort in the prophecies made about the future potential and contributions of BYU, including what is now our present. But we must also be knowledgeable and cautious in the light of clear Book of Mormon warnings about the potential risks of affluent, successful societies that seem to me to be related significantly to what we have been blessed as a university to become in recent years. I take particularly seriously the counsel of Nephi in his wonderful discourse on the Atonement:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><br><br><i>But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world. For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god. And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–30]<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I have enjoyed and appreciated this opportunity to gather with you today. I thank you for your support and forbearance.<br><br>I have tried to address some frequently raised questions in the interest of framing and continuing our essential campus communication. I know the best answers are still being worked out and worked through, and I know that many of the most important questions are still to be asked. I look forward to doing both together with you and the campus community.<br><br>Finally, I want you to know that I know that the Lord's hand is on BYU and that the work of BYU is a vital part of the Lord's work. We are thus entitled to seek His blessings and are also entitled to be guided and protected in our quests to the extent that we live our lives in congruence with our charge. God lives, knows us, and loves us. I invoke His blessings on us as we begin this new academic year in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>l Address for Cecil O. Samuelson at Brigham Young University</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Hinckley, officers, other members of the board of trustees, other General Authorities, auxiliary officers, government and education leaders, honored guests, students, staff, faculty, special friends, brothers and sisters, and family: It is an honor and privilege not easily described to stand before you this morning in these special circumstances. I am mindful of the significant sacrifices made by many of you to participate with us. Sharon and I will be ever grateful for your support and thoughtfulness. Likewise, literally hundreds of the university family have worked tirelessly to plan, support, and implement today's events. I thank those who have spoken today in representing this impressive throng.<br><br>So much has been done by so many. I am frankly embarrassed, but I am constantly reminded that today is not about me. It is all about this wonderful place and idea we know as Brigham Young University.<br><br>We have had a remarkable history. We must never forget those whose vision and sacrifices have made our comfortable and positive present possible. We are grateful that Elder and Sister Bateman are with us today. President Bateman built impressively on the firm foundation he found when he arrived and in turn left the university strengthened in important ways. Presidents Lee, Holland, and Oaks have left in their time wonderful, indelible marks that have lifted BYU in its continuing ascendancy. I am grateful that I have personally witnessed their contributions over the years and now benefit from them. My appreciation for President Wilkinson and his six predecessors is more distant but no less profound. All could have done what they did only with the inspired leadership and support of the board of trustees that has been constant throughout our history.<br><br>It is also appropriate that we pause to express gratitude to those of today who contribute so significantly to this large, complicated, and wonderful enterprise we call BYU. This includes, of course, our trustees and other Church leaders, our spectacular students, our able staff and administration, and our devoted faculty. But we must also remember our debt for the substantive and continuing support of those many who assist and enable us through their faithful living of the law of tithing. This includes the poor and meek who may never have the privilege of a direct BYU experience for themselves or for their family members. In addition, we express deep gratitude for that important and impressive group of leaders, friends, and alumni who so generously share the bounty of their blessings with the university. They help fulfill our dreams and those of many generations who love and have loved Brigham Young University.<br><br>President Hinckley, I am grateful for your wise and continuing counsel and will do all within my power to live true to the great confidence you place in me and my associates. Although our opportunities and responsibilities are daunting, I am comforted to know of your encouragement and support, knowing also whose servant you are. I, together with all my colleagues in every capacity at Brigham Young University, sustain you and those who serve with you. We are grateful for the direction and counsel we receive and also appreciate the confidence expressed in us to make appropriate decisions and to move the work of this great university forward.<br><br>Today is not the time for long explications. It is a day to look to our future. I do so with eagerness and a sense of anxious anticipation for what we might and must accomplish in this next season of the illustrious history of Brigham Young University. We see that future more clearly when we understand more fully our past and also the unique foundation of this great miracle of BYU.<br><br>Long before this institution had any physical presence, the need for and potential scope of education in the Church was well understood. Think of early examples from the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79, 118]<br><br>Our mandate, with respect to education, is expansive and encompassing. Brigham Young University is a vital element in our commitment to knowledge and wisdom.<br><br>If we do our part, we have the unspeakable privilege to be part of an enterprise that may cause inspired prophecy to be fulfilled. But, just as in the early days of our institution, this progress and improvement does not just happen. It requires continued blessings from heaven and also our best, consistent, and most effective efforts. It means we must always keep in mind our sacred mission: to seek the best of academic and scholastic achievement within the enfolding environment and sustaining power of abiding faith in our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior, and in the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We cannot neglect or be passive about either our environment of faith or our commitment to academic excellence. In all that we do, we want to bless our students by never allowing the balance between these fundamental basics to become tilted in any direction.<br><br>In fact, all that we do must focus on our students. Our common commitment to and understanding of their growth and spiritual and intellectual development is the reason we exist as a university. There are many wonderful universities, and we applaud enthusiastically the great good they do. We will try with confidence to be as good as the best in certain, carefully selected areas. But we will not be detracted nor detoured from the fundamental "charted course" that makes our mission distinctive.<br><br>We recognize our opportunities and also our potential dangers, which are greater than ever before. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell reminds us, "LDS scholars can and should speak in the tongue of scholarship, but without coming to prefer it and without losing the mother tongue of faith" (<i>Deposition of a Disciple</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1976], 16).<br><br>Speaking from this pulpit several years ago, President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I challenge you never to forget that the schooling of the Spirit is as important, if not more so, than the schooling of the mind. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We live in a world where knowledge is developing at an ever-accelerating rate. Drink deeply from this ever-springing well of wisdom and human experience. . . . Keep everlastingly at it. Read. Read. Read. Read the word of God in sacred books of scripture. Read from the great literature of the ages. Read what is being said in our day and time and what will be said in the future.</i>["A Three-Point Challenge," BYU commencement address, 27 April 1995; excerpt in<i>TGBH,</i>171]<br><br>All kinds of learning are possible without the university. However, the university--and particularly this university--provides a special milieu, environment, and means that maximize not only the accumulation of knowledge but more importantly enhance the capacity of the individual to learn more ably, profoundly, and effectively in the related realms of scholarship, science, and worldly knowledge and in the spheres of faith, spirituality, and Christian service.<br><br>Dr. John A. Fry, president of Franklin and Marshall College, said something in his inaugural address this past April that has resonated with me. With your forbearance, and, I hope, his forgiveness, let me quote him by substituting Brigham Young University for his institution: "With the privilege of a [BYU] education comes the responsibility to act on what was learned" ("The Saga of Franklin and Marshall College," inaugural address, 12 April 2003, 11–12; at http://www.fandm.edu/president/address/inaugural_address.pdf). If that is true at an institution bearing the names of great Americans Benjamin Franklin and Chief Justice John Marshall, then what should be the responsibility of those having the privilege of an education at this university that bears the name of one of the Lord's prophets--Brigham Young? We mention often Brigham Young's instruction to Karl G. Maeser that BYU "ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79). But we also must understand President Young's counsel that we "be a people of profound learning pertaining to the things of the world" (<i>JD</i>8:40).<br><br>Thus we say with appreciation and with confidence that we "enter to learn [and] go forth to serve." While we are here learning, we also gain much by serving. As we go forth to serve, we strive to continue to learn so that our service in every sphere can be more productive, effective, and consistent with those things we hold most dear.<br><br>I express my gratitude to the officers and members of the Church Board of Education for their confidence and this opportunity; to my many new BYU associates that include students, staff, faculty, administrators, and friends of the university; especially to Sharon, my wife, who has ever been by my side, particularly when the going is tough and the stakes are high; to our children, their spouses, and our grandchildren; and to each of you for your thoughtful support and friendship, and particularly for your prayers in our behalf. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was the president of Brigham Young University when this address was delivered at his inauguration on 9 September 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>at the Inauguration of President Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On behalf of all I wish to state our deep appreciation for the service of President Merrill J. Bateman, who presided here from January 1996 until April 2003. His was a wonderful and very progressive administration. We offer him the highest commendation for the tremendous work he accomplished and to his beloved companion, Marilyn, who stood so ably at his side.<br><br>He was honorably released because we felt he had carried long enough the great stress of administering this institution while at the same time serving as a General Authority of the Church.<br><br>He never offered a word of complaint. Under the most difficult of circumstances he met his responsibility in both fields in a most admirable and wonderful way. Thank you, Elder Bateman, for work superbly well done. You and Marilyn may always carry with you the satisfaction that comes of great service gladly and honorably given.<br><br>When there is a change in the monarchy of Great Britain, the people say, "The king is dead. Long live the king."<br><br>When there is a change in the administration of this university, we say, "The president is released with honors. Happiness and great achievement to his successor."<br><br>President Samuelson, we have conferred upon you the authority of your high office. We have heard your inspirational response and sense your commitment to move the university forward on its destined course as one of the great institutions of the nation. Here we are doing what is not done in any other major university of which I am aware. We are demonstrating that faith in the Almighty can accompany and enrich scholarship in the secular. It is more than an experiment. It is an accomplishment.<br><br>We must continue to strengthen our scholarship in every discipline that is followed here. But with that we must never let down on our determination to teach faith in the Living God; to build testimony of His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; to teach the validity of the Holy Bible and of its companion scripture, the Book of Mormon; and to build conviction concerning the restoration of the gospel in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. Here character building becomes an even greater concern than imparting knowledge of secular subjects, although we shall never neglect this knowledge.<br><br>President Samuelson, we have known you for a good while. We have admired your professional skills. We are familiar with the depths of your spirituality. To you we say, go forward in your great role of leadership on this campus. As the president leads, so goes the institution. May those associated with you in the administration march to the same drum in moving toward a greater future than this school has ever known.<br><br>We have here a marvelous physical plant. It has been made possible by the consecrations of our people throughout the world. What a satisfying thing it is to walk about these grounds and never see a beer can or a cigarette butt or anything of the kind.<br><br>To the staff who work with you in creating and maintaining this beautiful environment we extend our congratulations and a charge to keep them beautiful, clean, and conducive to habits of order in the lives of those who use these facilities.<br><br>To the faculty we express gratitude for your dedication in sharing with a large body of anxious and eager students the vast volume of learning that you have accumulated and to which you have added with distinction. There is a spirit of fellowship on this campus between teacher and student that is wonderful and in many respects unique. I am reminded of the occasion recorded in the book of Acts when Peter and John went into the temple at the hour of prayer. A cripple was brought daily to the gate of the temple, where he asked for alms from those going into the temple.<br><br><i>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</i><br><br><i>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</i><br><br><i>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</i><br><br><i>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</i>[Acts 3:4–7]<br><br>Yours is the great opportunity and the very precious responsibility, in effect, of reaching down to lift up those who come to learn and prepare for a productive and meaningful life. Most have been sent here by hopeful parents, who pray night and morning for their success. Great sacrifice has been made to enable them to come. They long for success. And it is your opportunity and your responsibility to see that they do not fail.<br><br>We should not have failures on this campus. We are more than teachers. We are shepherds. And we know that the spirit of shepherding resides in the hearts of those who serve here as members of the great Brigham Young University faculty.<br><br>And now to you students, you for whom this institution was designed: there would be no university without you. You have come here with great hopes and high expectations. I need not remind you that you are a very select group. You have been carefully chosen. We want you to know that all who serve you here desire that you will be successful, that you will have a wonderful experience, that you will be immensely happy and very proud of the institution of which you are a part.<br><br>The motto of this university is "The Glory of God Is Intelligence." You have come to partake of that intelligence, that light and truth which becomes the vast lexicon of your learning. What a precious and magnificent opportunity is afforded you. Robert Browning said that "a man's reach should exceed his grasp" ("Andrea del Sarto" [1855], line 97). Extend your grasp while reaching ever higher to drink from the inexhaustible fountain of learning that is offered you.<br><br>The things you learn on this campus will become a part of your eternal treasure, for the Lord has said, "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18).<br><br>Such teachings as this are the very essence of what you are offered and can gather into your hearts and minds in this unique and wonderful institution.<br><br>We have all smiled a little at the recent report of the<i>Princeton Review.</i>Their rankings come of a survey of 106,000 students representing 351 colleges and universities. The survey indicates that for the fifth year in a row this is the nation's number-one "stone cold sober" university. You are regarded as the most religious student body in America. You are number two in the quality of life found on the campus.<br><br>You are rated "third for the best college library, sandwiched between such notable institutions as Harvard and Dartmouth" ("A Stone Cold Sober Report,"<i>Deseret News,</i>24 August 2003, AA01; see also Tad Walch, "Y. Grins over 'Sober' Label,"<i>Deseret News,</i>19 August 2003, A01).<br><br>I would venture to say, President Samuelson, that there are many university and college presidents in the nation who would be glad to preside over an institution where they did not have to deal with the terrible problems of binge drinking and the train of evils that follow this.<br><br>My dear young friends, how blessed you are to live in this good land. How blessed you are to be on this beautiful campus--how blessed to live in this great age in the history of the earth.<br><br>Everyone here this morning enjoyed good food for breakfast. Everyone slept in a secure place last night. Everyone had good water at the touch of a faucet. Those of us who traveled here did so on good highways in air-conditioned cars.<br><br>What a blessed land. What a blessed season in the history of mankind.<br><br>There is a sign on the gate of this campus that reads: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve."<br><br>I invite you, every one of you, to make that your motto. Mediocrity will never do. You are capable of something better. Give it your very best. You will never again have such an opportunity. Pray about it. Work at it. Make it happen. Drink in the great knowledge here to be obtained from this dedicated faculty. Qualify yourselves for the work of the world that lies ahead. It will largely compensate you in terms of what it thinks you are worth. Walk the high road of charity, respect, and love for others and particularly those who are less fortunate. Be happy. Look for the sunlight in life. Reach for the stars.<br><br>Build friendships. You have the greatest opportunity of your lives to establish wonderful associations with people of your own kind who think as you do. And hopefully for each of you there will come romance, a partner true and beautiful with whom you can share a life that will go on into the eternities.<br><br>Concerning your marriage and your future endeavors, may I repeat with great earnestness and with all of the power of persuasion of which I am capable these words spoken repeatedly by President David O. McKay: "No success in life can compensate for failure in the home" (quoting James Edward McCulloch, ed.,<i>Home: The Savior of Civilization</i>[Washington, D.C.: Southern Co-operative League, 1924], 42).<br><br>Your future family relationships will be the greatest treasure of your life. No salary you will ever earn, no fees you will ever be paid will compensate for failure to live as you ought to live as a family.<br><br>Look to the example of your president. He and his beloved companion, Sharon, have walked side by side with love in their hearts through all the years of their association. Make them your shining example.<br><br>To the many visitors we have here today, I wish to thank you for coming. You do great honor to President Samuelson. You do honor to this institution. And we hope that it has been a good and rewarding experience for each of you.<br><br>God bless you, my beloved friends and associates, every one of you, to whom I feel to reach out in a spirit of true affection, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B. Hinckley was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this address was delivered at the inauguration of BYU president Cecil O.

<h1> All Thy Mind, Love</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson, brothers and sisters: I am humbled to address you. For almost 40 years my wife and I have been blessed by the full life of the mind offered by Brigham Young University--first as students, where we met in the library, and now as we both serve on the faculty. For 23 years I have taught in the law school and worked in various campus assignments. We are grateful to all who have worked to make BYU so intellectually inspiring. I hope my words will in some small way repay the many to whom I am deeply indebted.<br><br>And thanks to each of you for coming and bringing the Holy Ghost with you. Brigham Young's instruction to the BYU faculty was that they "ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 79). I would state a corollary to that: As students, you should not<i>learn</i>even the multiplication tables without the Holy Ghost. It does little good for someone to<i>teach</i>with the Holy Ghost if you aren't ready to<i>receive</i>with the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Today I would ask: What does it mean to you to love God with all your mind? We<i>feel</i>what it means to love Him with our heart, but what does it mean to love Him with our mind? I have asked many people this question. I get many different answers. What would your answer be?<br><br>At the outset, let me turn to a passage in Mark 12, which I find terribly important. A highly educated scribe (their equivalent of a college graduate) who had overhead Jesus reasoning with some Sadducees, asked the Savior, "Which commandment is the first of all?"<br><br>Jesus answered: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength."<br><br>"And," Jesus added, "this is the second: Love thy neighbor as thyself."<br><br>To this the scholar responded, "Teacher, you speak very well and in truth, for to love God with all one's heart and all one's understanding and all one's strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself is more advantageous than all burnt offerings and sacrifice."<br><br>Seeing that this person spoke with keen intelligence, Jesus declared, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." (See Mark 12:28–34; author's translation in part.)<br><br>This brief encounter is deeply interesting to me. Since Jesus was dealing with a craftsman of words, let me mention some notable vocabulary in their conversation. When Jesus stated the prime commandment, He carefully included the mind. The Greek word used for<i>mind</i>is<i>dianoia,</i>meaning with all your "way of thinking" or your "perception of things." In his response the scholarly scribe used an even more dynamic word,<i>synesis,</i>meaning "understanding, getting things all together, comprehensive comprehension, synthesis, and insight." And then, escalating a third step, Jesus told this man that he was not far from the kingdom because he spoke<i>nounechos,</i>literally "having<i>nous,"</i>the highest term in some philosophical pantheons for true, even divine, intelligence. These three words regard the mind highly, the last being especially strong.<br><br>How many lessons can we draw from this inspiring exchange between the Savior and this educated individual? Let us not pass lightly over this stunning scripture; divine declarations often come without much elaboration yet are laden with profound implications. I would speak today of seven dimensions of loving God with our all our mind, drawn from words in this account.<br><h2><b>It Is<i>Possible</i></b></h2><br>First, we learn with assurance that it is<i>possible</i>to get near to the kingdom of God while having intelligence. This smart man was close to the mark, and Jesus congratulated him for it.<br><br>Likewise, we on the faculty congratulate and welcome you. At this university and in this religion, you don't need to check your brains at the door. To be a gospel scholar, you'll need all the brilliance you can muster, for we have the double challenge of knowing not only the ways of the world but also the ways of the Lord--and then, getting the two together. In this sense the world actually has the lighter assignment. Of course, in another sense, our task is the easier. Because of modern scriptures and the temple, we have more pieces in life's puzzle, as well as the picture on the box.<br><br>I hope you are excited and humbled to be at Brigham Young University, where we boldly affirm that "the glory of God is intelligence" and that "to be learned is good," so long as we avoid the vainness, the frailties, and the foolishness of men and also "hearken unto the counsels of God" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36; 2 Nephi 9:29). Ancient and modern prophets offer role models of highly intelligent people who have loved the Lord with their minds. Until only recently, President Hinckley has enjoyed reading the classics in Latin and Greek, which he learned in college. Isaiah was a brilliant writer, and Paul was amazingly articulate. Alma went head-to-head against the stubborn issues of his day. As Limhi promised his people, "If ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him<i>with all diligence of mind</i>. . . , he will . . . deliver you" (Mosiah 7:33; emphasis added). Thus it is indeed possible to get near to the kingdom of God with intelligence.<br><h2><b>It Is<i>Commanded</i></b></h2><br>Second, Jesus makes it clear that we are<i>commanded</i>to love God with our mind. Pondering this, I realized that I should approach this commandment as a responsibility, not just as an opportunity or privilege. I wondered: Do you think of this commandment when you partake of the sacrament or when you answer the recommend question about striving to keep the Lord's commandments?<br><br>Like keeping any commandment, keeping this one will surely take conscious effort. We don't keep the Word of Wisdom by accident. We don't keep the Sabbath day without planning and devotion. So what do you do to keep this commandment deliberately? Do you earnestly strive to love God with all your mind? I doubt that a flimsy "Well, I guess so" is going to be good enough. Speaking to the pure in heart in the city of Nephi, Jacob exhorted them to "look unto God with firmness of mind" (Jacob 3:1). And Alma made it clear that God will give people knowledge of His mysteries only "according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him" (Alma 12:9). There is a direct connection between answers obtained and our effort in keeping this commandment.<br><br>I know that God will help us keep this commandment, for He will give no commandment save He shall prepare a way for us that we can keep it (see 1 Nephi 3:7).<br><h2><b>With<i>All</i>Thy Mind</b></h2><br>Third, the word<i>all</i>is all important here. It appears seven times in this scripture--itself a symbolic number of completion, often associated with sacrifice in Leviticus. Keeping this commandment requires genuine, dedicated completeness. You are commanded to love God with<i>all</i>thy heart,<i>all</i>thy might, and<i>all</i>thy mind. We have a word<i>wholeheartedly.</i>Maybe we should coin a word<i>wholemindedly</i>.<br><br>The gospel is not a cafeteria plan. We can't just pick and choose the parts we like.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell has spoken often about discipleship, submissiveness, and consecration, especially in intellectual settings. He has sensitized us to the dangers of what he calls "holding back," of not loving God with all the mind that we could. He said in a talk at a banquet for the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) on September 27, 1991:<br><br><i>Whatever our particular fields of scholarship, the real test is individual discipleship, not scholarship. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We usually tend to think of consecration in terms of property. . . . But there are so many ways of keeping back part and so many things we can withhold a portion of besides property. All things</i>[including our minds]<i>really ought to be put on the altar.</i>["Discipleship and Scholarship,"<i>BYU Studies</i>32, no. 3 (summer 1992): 7]<br><br>Minds must bend, as well as knees.<br><br>An idea is often the last thing we are willing to let go of. Our pet ideas are often the beginning of our undoing. A wise drama teacher once said, "Forget your best idea." Clinging to it will often block the flow of even greater creativity and more expansive inspiration.<br><br>Fortunately, each of us has been blessed with definite mental talents, with plenty to give forth. And remember, in the world of the New Testament, even one talent of gold or silver was an enormous sum, worth several million dollars in today's markets. It is true that some minds work better in one mode than in another, but that's irrelevant: we can and must love God with our weakest mental abilities, as well as by playing to our strengths. Surely God cares less about what we give Him than if we have brought all of our best, whatever that may be.<br><h2><b>Many Ways to<i>Love</i></b></h2><br>Fourth, this all has to do with<i>love.</i>Sister Welch and I have a pillow on our bed. On it are words of Elizabeth Barrett Browning: "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways." With similar fervor, let us count the ways we love God with our minds and love Him "to the depth and breadth and height / My [mind] can reach, when feeling out of sight / For the ends of Being and [eternal] Grace . . . to the level of everyday's / Most quiet need, . . . freely, . . . purely, . . . with the passion put to use, . . . and, if God choose, [even] better after death" (<i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>[1850], no. 43).<br><br>We love Him with our minds by being observant of the things He has created--by appreciating the amazing things that He has given us in the worlds of chemistry or geology, scriptures or linguistics. If you love a person, you notice and admire the fantastic things he or she has done. President Hunter once said, "He loves God with all his mind who . . . sees God in all things and acknowledges him in all ways" (<i>CR,</i>April 1965, 58; also "'And God Spake All These Words,'"<i>Improvement Era</i>68, no. 6 [June 1965]: 512).<br><br>We love God with our mind by caring about the problems He cares about. We love God with our mind by embracing His work, giving it the best of our planning, research, and problem solving. Figuring out what you can do as a home teacher to motivate someone to repent is truly a challenging intellectual task, and learning the names of everyone in your ward is another way to love God with your mind.<br><br>When we love God, we want to be like Him--and remember, He knows everyone's name. It takes careful thought to internalize all that we can know of Him.<br><br>It takes mental effort to forgive other people as He does, for that begins by thinking nonjudgmental thoughts about them and seeing them as He does.<br><br>Loving God also means loving His words. I love the scriptures, although admittedly some chapters are harder to love than others. We love God with our mind by memorizing scriptures. The conversation between Jesus and the scribe was possible because both of them knew that scripture by heart. We rely too much on our books, notes, and hard drives. Your mind can actually retain far more than you imagine. One of the best things I ever did was to take a challenge from my leader in the MTC to memorize all of the Sermon on the Mount. In an honors Book of Mormon class, I had my students memorize most of King Benjamin's speech. One student recalled: "When we first got the assignment, it was overwhelming; but it was probably the most rewarding assignment I've ever had at BYU."<br><br>We love God with our mind by skillful analysis of problems; it is often said that "God is in the details." But don't forget also to love God with skillful synthesis as well, seeing things as one great whole. When I go to the temple, I give attention to its tiniest details and carefully presented words; at the same time, my mind sees the temple as a huge pattern and cosmic road map that tells me where I am and where I need to go.<br><br>We love God with our mind by asking good and righteous questions. There is nothing wrong with asking. In fact, we are commanded to ask, seek, and knock (see Matthew 7:7). Our scribe in Mark asked Jesus a good question, much better in fact than the unlikely hypothetical one posed by the Sadducees about a supposed seven-time widow who had remarried six of her husband's brothers (see Mark 12:18–27). We need to spend more time discerning between good questions and bad ones. It won't do to be knocking on the wrong door. For examples of good questions, look at the 50 questions Alma asked in Alma 5 (see John W. Welch and J. Gregory Welch,<i>Charting the Book of Mormon: Visual Aids for Personal Study and Teaching</i>[Provo: FARMS, 1999], charts 61–65). Or look at the many questions Jesus asked people in the New Testament gospels, and then go and do likewise (see John W. Welch and John F. Hall,<i>Charting the New Testament</i>[Provo: FARMS, 2002], chart 9-16).<br><br>We love God by listening better to Him and to those who speak for Him. A good measure of people who love each other is how well they listen to each other. Listening is a mental process. It involves attentively processing what we hear. Notice that the scribe repeated back (a good communication strategy) what Jesus said, and thoughtfully commented on its implication.<br><br>How do we love God? Let us count the many ways. It is here at BYU, more than at any other place, that you can specialize in learning how to love God with all your mind and as an integrated soul.<br><br>It is here that we see no irreconcilable conflict between the heart and the mind. The restored gospel of Jesus Christ exquisitely harmonizes the traditional paradoxes of life, embracing both study and faith, reason and revelation, truth and goodness, thought and action, spirit and mind. The one is not without the other in the Lord. The gospel strives, above all, for the fullness of eternal life, not just either half of it. An incomplete view is partial in more ways than one.<br><br>Getting the heart and the mind together is a joyous experience. It is not easy to describe the collaborative workings of the two, but analogies can help. Getting the spirit and intellect together is like seeing with two eyes, allowing depth perception lacking through a single lens. It is like playing a violin that requires two hands, each performing its own function to produce a harmonious melody (see John W. Welch, "The Power of Evidence in the Nurturing of Faith," in<i>Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon,</i>ed. Donald W. Parry, Daniel C. Peterson, and John W. Welch [Provo: FARMS, 2002], 17–53). Or, as a student suggested, it's like chocolate and milk: they taste fine alone, but better together.<br><h2><b>With All Thy<i>Mind</i></b></h2><br>Fifth, I learn from the conversation in Mark that Jesus cares very much about our<i>minds.</i>He carefully noticed that the scribe answered with great intelligence. This means that He notices and cares what we think, write, and teach. I know that God watches over our intellectual endeavors. The surgical testimony of Elder Nelson shows that God will help things happen that far exceed human ability (see Russell M. Nelson, "Sweet Power of Prayer,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2003, 7–9). Have miracles ceased? No. In fact, Mormon says that miracles are ministered "unto them of strong faith<i>and a firm mind</i>in every form of godliness" (Moroni 7:30; emphasis added).<br><br>I have asked for and have received His support in many academic pursuits, often through the unimaginable help of other people. One day, with no appointment, a person walked into my office with the precise skill set I had been praying for, only to tell me she didn't know why she had come but that she had decided not to stay with another job and wondered if I needed any help.<br><br>Last Christmas, facing a crucial year-end deadline after months of work, my staff finally downloaded a huge collection of scanned Church historical documents onto 74 DVD production masters; with those master disks safely in hand, they watched as our linked hard drives crashed irrecoverably only a few hours later.<br><br>I cannot believe that these things were mere coincidences.<br><br>I know that God will support us as we strive to love Him with our minds. My colleagues and I have attended and presented papers at many academic conferences. Not infrequently, results have been transformational in ways that we gladly attribute to the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>I know that God inspires us, but most often only after we have studied things out in our minds (see D&amp;amp;C 9:8) and have paid the price of thorough research directed by the light of faith. Many LDS scholars and regular members as well can tell of sacred experiences they have had in discovering things through study and faith that they never would have found on their own.<br><br>I myself treasure several such discoveries. I remember searching for an answer to a recurring criticism of the Book of Mormon about the resurrected Savior's use of the Sermon on the Mount in 3 Nephi. As I dug into the task, confident that there must be an answer, the apparent problem turned into a strength as the temple and covenant settings of both texts distilled upon me as the dews from heaven (see John W. Welch,<i>Illuminating the Sermon at the Temple and Sermon on the Mount: An Approach to 3 Nephi 11–18 and Matthew 5–7</i>[Provo: FARMS, 1999]).<br><br>I also remember one early missionary morning in Germany when the significant literary feature of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon amazingly unfolded to my view. Outside study and spiritual promptings had set the stage, but a mind firmly and tenaciously pursuing the implications of my testimony of the Book of Mormon caused that discovery actually to happen (see John W. Welch, "Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon,"<i>BYU Studies</i>10, no. 1 [autumn 1969]: 69–84).<br><br>My testimony does not depend on finding such things; rather, my mind looks with confidence for such things precisely because I know the Book of Mormon and the gospel are true. Faith precedes the miracle of insightful understanding. As President Packer has cautioned and encouraged, we should not say, "I know the gospel is true, however . . ." Rather, say, "I know the gospel is true, therefore . . ." And for me, that has made all the difference. (See Boyd K. Packer, "The Mantle Is Far, Far Greater Than the Intellect,"<i>BYU Studies</i>21, no. 3 [summer 1981]: 270; also<i>Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991], 113.)<br><br>I also know that God rewards us after long hours of service. Some of my favorite scriptural insights--making intellectual sense and dissolving spiritual challenges throughout my life--have come at weary hours of the night during my service as a bishop. Ironically, my most productive years as a scholar have been the years when I have been busiest as a bishop.<br><h2><b>It Is the<i>First</i>Commandment</b></h2><br>Sixth, what of the fact that this is part of the<i>first</i>commandment? Loving God is the prime commandment because all else follows from it. Loving God is the wellspring of all righteousness. Loving Him with all our mind is the taproot of true intelligence. Loving Him with all of the integrated faculties of our whole being echoes the integrated harmony of the Godhead and godhood itself.<br><br>John 14:15 can also be translated "If you love me, you<i>will</i>keep my commandments." When you love God with all your mind, you will mind Him and mind all His precepts. And by minding Him always, by obeying Him always, you remember Him always. In Hebrew, the same word,<i>zakhor,</i>means "to remember" as well as "to obey" (see "'O Man, Remember, and Perish Not,'" chapter 35 in John W. Welch, ed.,<i>Reexploring the Book of Mormon: The FARMS Updates</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book; Provo: FARMS, 1992], 127–29).<br><br>If you love God, you will think of Him often. You will want to share with Him your whole day, every day and every night, Fridays as well as Sundays, everything you have thought, said, and done. You miss Him and hope to see Him again.<br><br>You will think kind and loving things about Him. In the face of any type of inconclusive uncertainty, love gives the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>You will also think correct things about Him. Although you cannot talk yourself into loving God or anyone else, it is possible to talk yourself out of love, so give heed to what you think.<br><br>Loving God leads to all else that is of the divine nature.<br><h2><b>It Is Possible to Break This Commandment</b></h2><br>Finally, we must also acknowledge that it is possible to disobey this commandment. How do we break the commandment to love God with all our mind, and, if we have transgressed, what must we do?<br><br>We break this commandment when we think contrary to the degree of knowledge we have received, when we know better.<br><br>We break this commandment when we promote ideas that injure other people, for with knowledge comes power, and with any power comes duty and accountability.<br><br>We break this commandment when we harbor in our mind errors or excuses that deny the existence, love, power, or knowledge of God. As a bishop, I've heard people say: "Everyone is doing it." "I couldn't stop." "It's my life, I can do what I want with it." "Every point of view is equally valid." "I have no friends." "No one will notice." But where do these mental mistakes leave God? Is God doing it? Couldn't God help you stop? Is it really your life? Does God's view count? Isn't He your friend? Doesn't God know and notice everything, including your thoughts?<br><br>We break this commandment whenever we believe Satan, the enemy of all righteousness. Beware: Satan is the father of lies. And he's a good liar. Take the lie of pornography. Satan tells us we will find satisfaction by staring at pornography. This is simply a lie. Can we love God with<i>all</i>our mind if even part of our mind is filled with this pollution? When I came to BYU in the sixties, we were just beginning to worry about environmental pollution. Previous generations had foolishly believed that the oceans could absorb an endless amount of garbage and waste. We learned that pollution doesn't just go away.<br><br>I wonder if people aren't just as naïve today. They foolishly think that the human mind can absorb an endless amount of filth and violence and that somehow we can just push a delete key in our brain and erase all that. You have been blessed with an amazing brain, with incredible retentive powers. Whether or not you can recall that information during a test, it's all still there. Old folks often find that their brains retain things they haven't thought of for decades. Mental pollution sticks; there are no teflon brains. Just as it is true that "whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection" (D&amp;amp;C 130:18), so, too, whatever degree of unrepented smut or cynicism we attain unto, it will rise with us as well.<br><br>Thus, Moroni says, "Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; . . . and love God with all your might, mind and strength" (Moroni 10:32). It says, "Be perfected<i>in him."</i>We cannot perfect our minds without His help. We know the effects of the Fall on our bodies, but our minds are also in a fallen state. Our minds must also be redeemed. This happens by repenting of our bad or erroneous thoughts and submitting to the mind and will of Christ.<br><br>We must repent of our academic pride. Pride is the main occupational hazard for scholars, who too quickly suppose "they know of themselves" (2 Nephi 9:28). Being right is part, but only part, of being righteous.<br><br>We must overcome our rebellious thoughts every bit as much as our disobedient actions. We must pray "and lead us not into<i>intellectual</i>temptation" as much as any other kind of temptation (see Matthew 6:13). Satan knows a lot of truth, but that's not enough, for he still rebels.<br><br>We must feel godly sorrow for our mental sins. Like Zeezrom, we must suffer spiritual migraines over our intellectual mistakes (see Alma 15:3, 5). In many ways, their effects on ourselves and on others are the hardest to undo, but through the Atonement, the human intellect can be transformed into an instrument for loving God.<br><br>So the question becomes: Has your mind been sanctified by the atoning blood of Christ? (see Welch,<i>Echoes and Evidences,</i>44–47). As described in Mosiah 3:19, has your mind "yield[ed] to the enticings of the Holy Spirit"? Or, as stated in Mosiah 5:2, have you "no more disposition" to think evil? Has the finger of the Lord touched our inert cerebral stones and turned them into light-giving gems? To use the words of Paul in Romans 12:2, have you been "transformed by the renewing of your mind [your<i>nous</i>]"?<br><br>If so, the Lord will light up your mind, as He did King Lamoni's (see Alma 19:6). He will cause your mind to expand, as Alma promised (see Alma 32:34). He will write His covenants upon your mind, as Jeremiah guaranteed (quoted in Hebrews 8:10; see Jeremiah 31:33). He will bless your heart and mind with peace that passes all understanding, as Paul assured (see Philippians 4:7–9).<br><br>And in the end, if you love God with all your mind, you will be fit for the<i>kingdom.</i>What a promise! At BYU we are playing for keeps, "for as [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7), and in the day of judgment, our unrepented thoughts will weigh against us (see Alma 12:14). But if you "worship him with all your . . . mind," the scriptures say, "ye shall in nowise be cast out" (2 Nephi 25:29) and "the hope of his glory and of eternal life [shall] rest in your mind forever" (Moroni 9:25).<br><h2><b>A Final Blessing</b></h2><br>In conclusion, as a bishop and teacher, may I offer a prayer in your behalf?<br><br>May you not just pass through BYU, but may the spirit of this university pass through you.<br><br>May you know it is possible to love God with all your mind.<br><br>May you love Him with invigorating questions.<br><br>May you perceptively discern between truth and error.<br><br>May your intellect be keen and sharp but never harm even the least intelligent of the children of God.<br><br>In your academic freedom, may you intellectually "choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men," not "captivity and death" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>May you pray over your books, as you would bless food for thought.<br><br>May you pray as you go to class, and not just as you enter the Testing Center.<br><br>May your love of God give harmony, value, and joy to all that you think and do, that you may become perfected in Christ.<br><br>And in all of this may God find you, too, not far from His kingdom.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>John W.

<h1>s at the Door and knocks, Prayer</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to have been given this opportunity to speak, particularly to this wonderful group of young men and women, the students of BYU. Over the years I have appreciated the many insightful and uplifting speeches given at these devotionals, and I am not sure that I am qualified to be among that group. I do not believe that I have any great, new insights into the gospel; I do not have a new formula or list of things for you to do to improve your lives; nor do I have any particularly profound answers to gospel questions. I always admire those who do.<br><br>A few years ago I ran across an LDS book entitled<i>Answers,</i>referring to answers to difficult gospel questions. I am sure if I were to attempt such a book that it would have to be entitled<i>Questions,</i>for there are still so many that for me are unanswered. For example, how does God keep track of all of the billions of people here on earth when I can barely remember the names of my children? How does He receive and answer prayers from the millions who are praying to Him at any given moment? How does He communicate with us almost instantaneously when for us it would take four years just to send a radio transmission to the nearest star in our galaxy and another four years to receive an answer? How is it possible for us to become like Him when the gulf between us seems so vast? I could go on for hours with questions like these for which I have no answer. The wonderful thing to me is that God has not given us all the answers, but He has given us the opportunity to learn and grow and struggle on our own, with just enough knowledge to return to Him--where we might finally receive the answers to all of these unanswerable questions.<br><br>With that preface, what I would like to share with you today is the only thing of which I am absolutely sure. That is: I know there is a God who knows each of us, who hears our prayers, and who loves us despite our shortcomings and imperfections.<br><br>For those of you who do not know me (which I imagine is most of you), let me start with a bit of my background. I grew up in the town of Pleasant View, Utah, just north of Ogden. During my early youth it was a small town with just one LDS ward. In addition to the church, we had a gas station, a small grocery store, and, when I reached second grade, our own elementary school. Surrounded by a loving family, including grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins living only a few blocks away, it was the perfect place for me to grow up.<br><br>Our town sat at the foot of a mountain called Ben Lomond. In the hills above Pleasant View, and in the narrow canyons cut back into Ben Lomond above these hills, I discovered something magnificent--rocks. I brought them home with me. They were my greatest treasures. My mother and father encouraged my interest in rocks while I was still very young. They let me bring rocks in the house and keep them in my room! They bought me books and kits on mineral and rock identification. They took me to rock shops and to gem and mineral shows. They made stops of geologic interest a regular part of our family vacations.<br><br>At age 14, when I went to receive my patriarchal blessing, the patriarch asked me a number of questions before giving the blessing. The only question I still remember is "What do you want to be when you grow up?" My answer was "I am going to be a geologist." So he put that into my blessing, and here I am today, having taught geology at BYU for 22 years--still teaching, practicing, and believing in the principles I have learned in my study of geology, but also having a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ and a knowledge of its power and truthfulness. Some would ask, "How is this possible? Aren't many of the principles taught in geology contrary to gospel truths? Isn't it true that most scientists are atheists or at least agnostic?" In fact, most scientists believe in God and find no significant contradictions between their belief in God and their belief in science. Brigham Young put it this way:<br><br><i>Our religion will not clash with or contradict the facts of science in any particular. You may take geology, for instance, and it is a true science; not that I would say for a moment that all the conclusions and deductions of its professors are true, but its leading principles are; they are facts--they are eternal.</i>[<i>JD</i>14:116]<br><br>I have also found this to be true in my own personal search for unity between the realms of scientific and religious knowledge. However, it is not because I have discovered the answers to all of the difficult questions. As I stated earlier, I still have many more questions than I do answers. However, I accept both the things I have been taught and learned as a scientist and the things learned from the scriptures and prophets because both of them work. As a scientist I have been trained to look for and accept those theories, ideas, and models that work. I have applied the same test to my religion and have found that the promises made in the scriptures and by the prophets are true because they work! Let me share with you a few examples of what I mean.<br><br>As I mentioned, during my early years we had only one ward in Pleasant View, and all but a couple of families in town were ward members. I really didn't know that any other churches existed, and later in my life it came as a bit of a shock to me to learn that everyone did not belong to the church that I belonged to. I can't say that I had a testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel because I really hadn't thought about it much. My parents were good, kind, and loving parents, and I trusted them and their judgment.<br><br>Then it happened. One day during a deacons quorum meeting our advisor decided that we would have a testimony meeting; it may have been that he had not gotten around to preparing a lesson. It wasn't that I hadn't shared my testimony before; in fact, I was one of those kids who thought that bearing testimony was what one was supposed to do at every testimony meeting. But it wasn't the cool thing to do at age 12.<br><br>I suppose that we had about eight or 10 deacons in our quorum, and slowly (although not slow enough, it seemed to me) one boy after another stood to share his testimony. I was almost panicky because I just didn't know what I would say. I hoped that maybe the time would run out and I wouldn't feel obligated to stand, but it did not; a small group of 10 deacons sharing their testimonies doesn't take more than about 10 minutes, so plenty of time still remained when all of the other boys had finished standing and sharing their testimonies. I stood awkwardly and recited the same basic things most of the others had said: "I love my mom and dad. I know the Church is true. I know Joseph Smith was a prophet. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."<br><br>The thing was done, but for the first time in my life I realized that it was a lie. The only thing I had said that I knew to be true was that I loved my mom and dad. I really did not know if the Church was true or if Joseph Smith was a prophet, but I knew then that I had to find out. I had to know for myself.<br><br>I don't remember exactly when I finally asked--whether it was that day or the next week or the next month--but I do remember that one night, when my two brothers who shared a room with me were sleeping, I knelt by my bed and pleaded with my Father in Heaven to forgive me for my weaknesses and to let me know if this church that I belonged to was truly His church. I had never prayed with such intent before, and I am not sure I have ever prayed with such fervor since. I did not ask for a vision or visitation; I really only wanted to know that someone was there. I was only about 12 or 13 years old, and yet I can still feel to this day the power of the spiritual witness that came to me that night confirming that this was indeed the Church of Jesus Christ and that my Father in Heaven knew me and loved me. The test had worked, just as the scriptures promised.<br><br>But how is it possible for Him to know me? How does He have the time to worry and contemplate someone as insignificant as I? I still ask these questions today and have no answers. When I contemplate God, the universe, eternity, and my place in this marvelous creation, I always struggle to understand. Perhaps you do as well. A few years ago, when I was first called as a counselor in the bishopric in my ward, I was out monitoring the hallway during Sunday School, trying to make sure that all of our young men and women had stayed in class. As I came into the foyer, I saw one of our deacons holding his head as if he didn't feel well. I stopped and asked if he was okay. The young man replied that his head was hurting and felt like it was going to explode. I thought it might be something serious, and so I questioned him further about the problem. He told me that during his class the teacher had been talking about "eternity and everlasting life" and that as he started to think about it his head began to spin and started aching.<br><br>I knew exactly how he was feeling, for I had myself had this same experience on more than one occasion as a young boy. Nonetheless, and notwithstanding my feelings of total insignificance as I have pondered God and eternity, I have a deep assurance that He is there and that in some way unknown to me He knows who I am. He knows who you are and He will respond to your needs.<br><br>In 1977 I graduated from BYU and headed out to Madison, Wisconsin, where I had been accepted into the graduate program in geology. My major professor was a wonderful man by the name of Dr. Campbell Craddock. Cam had the reputation of almost never having seen the summer because he spent summers working in Antarctica, Alaska, or in the islands of the Arctic. Students who followed in his footsteps were sure to be cold and wet during most of their graduate fieldwork. I signed on to work in Svalbard, a group of islands about 500 miles north of Norway. It was a spectacular and wonderful place to work. Four of us from Wisconsin, including Dr. Craddock, were deposited on the shore of an island called Spitsbergen in mid-July of 1978. I was thrilled to be on shore, because for the three days of our voyage on the North Sea in the refitted fishing boat called the<i>Polarstar,</i>I had lain in bed, only rolling over occasionally to vomit into the bag I kept by my bunk. The retching continued even long after there was nothing left in my stomach but a bit of saliva.<br><br>During this time I was almost hoping the ship would sink and my pain would be over. I prayed and asked God for relief. Again my prayer was answered. The test worked, although not in the way I wanted--for into my mind came the following words: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; . . . endure it well [and] all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7 and 122:7). I don't suppose that Joseph Smith was looking for this as the answer to his prayer either. I know that often I tend to push aside or ignore the answers that I don't want, hoping that the Lord will change His mind. But this does not often happen. Nonetheless, I was glad when the small moment of affliction had passed and we were able to step onto the solid earth. I was even able to smile again and realize that the experience was one that had been for my good. It had humbled me, brought me a better understanding of how much I needed my Father in Heaven, and, later in life, helped me to empathize more fully with my wife as she suffered through months of similar conditions during pregnancy.<br><br>During the first month in Svalbard we worked in teams of two as we examined the rocks and collected samples. The Norwegians who had transported us to the island had left us a radio with instructions to contact them each week at a certain time. They warned us to be on the lookout for polar bears (and for seals, the polar bears' main food). They explained that almost every year someone in Spitsbergen was killed and eaten by a bear. The previous year a family of parents, children, and a bachelor uncle had disembarked from a tourist cruise to camp a few nights. The ship was to return for them in a few days. (Tourists were not supposed to be off their ships camping, but some did it anyway.) While the family was camping, the uncle, thinking he recognized the children playing outside his tent door, stuck his head out. But it was not the children. The moment he put his head out, a polar bear ripped it off with one good swat and then dragged him just out of camp and ate him while the rest watched in horror. Fortunately the boat returned before the bear became hungry again.<br><br>As you can imagine, after hearing stories like this one, we were always looking out over the ocean and over the landscape to see if a bear was approaching. We were particularly cautious when seals came into the bay. We carried with us rifles and 45-Magnum revolvers wherever we went. We slept with the guns at our sides. There was no place to run or hide if a bear decided that we would be its next meal.<br><br>About midway through the field season, Dr. Craddock was picked up by helicopter and returned home to Wisconsin. This left three of us--myself, another graduate student named Ernie, and one undergraduate student named Jerry--to work for another month on our own. The problem was that Ernie needed to work in an area that was about 25 kilometers from our base camp. I also had work to do away from base camp, but closer. The decision was made that Ernie and Jerry would pack out together to work for two weeks in the more distant area and leave me by myself.<br><br>I don't know how many of you have ever been truly alone for an extended period of time, but for me it was a new experience. I had, of course, hiked alone before in the mountains of Utah, but I had never camped alone and certainly had never been alone for two weeks. I was doing pretty well and feeling that this "being alone stuff" wasn't all that bad--only talking to myself occasionally--when one evening the fog rolled in off the ocean. Of course, when I say "evening" I mean it would have been evening in Wisconsin or Utah, but in the Arctic, where we were, it was light 24 hours a day. The fog, however, was particularly thick, and I was almost unable to see my hand when held out at arm's length.<br><br>I ate and then retired to my tent, placing my rifle on one side of the bed and the pistol on the other. As I lay in bed, the sounds of the ocean, which were usually so pleasant and comforting, were now muffled by the fog and seemed different. My mind began to interpret them differently. I was sure I heard something moving along the beach and knew it could not be my companions, who were 20 to 30 kilometers away. Fear slowly crept into my heart and soul. It was fear like I had never known before--the kind that makes a person think and behave in irrational ways. I was sure the sounds were the padding of a polar bear coming along the beach and it would not be long until I was discovered. I imagined my companions returning to camp finding a few mangled remains left from the polar bear's meal.<br><br>I sat up with the rifle in one hand and the pistol in the other in a state of panic, waiting for the inevitable to happen. It was then that I remembered I was not alone. I bowed my head and prayed fervently to my Father in Heaven to calm me and protect me. And He did. His Spirit engulfed me, the fear was gone, and I lay down and fell into a peaceful slumber. Once again the test had worked. Once again all I had been required to do was to open the door, and He had entered.<br><br>If these were the only incidents in my life when I had received answers to my prayers, then as a scientist I would probably have to reevaluate the promises and would undoubtedly be skeptical of their validity--passing these few experiences off as mere coincidences. However, such is not the case. I do not believe that I have ever had a sincere and fervent prayer that has not been answered. It is my belief that God wants us to test Him. He wants us to grow in spiritual strength by proving Him. At the close of the Book of Mormon He exhorts us to ask and promises He will reveal the truth unto us (see Moroni 10:4–5). To Oliver Cowdery in the Doctrine and Covenants He gave the challenge to "study it out in your mind; then . . . ask . . . if it be right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). To His disciples He taught, "Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (3 Nephi 27:29; D&amp;amp;C 4:7; 49:26; 66:9; 88:63; see also Matthew 7:7). He is knocking at the door, but it is you and I that must open it if we want Him to enter.<br><br>I believe I can truthfully say that my sincere prayers are always answered. As I mentioned earlier, that does not mean I have always liked the answer. For example, when I was about 17 or 18 years old, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. She was given many blessings, and many prayers were offered. I prayed often that she would be healed. She fought the cancer valiantly and survived for about five years. One day, after I had returned from my mission, I was visiting with her and questioned why God had not answered our prayers--particularly since her patriarchal blessing had promised her a lifetime of good health. She did not hesitate in her response. She told me that God had given her a lifetime of good health. She had rarely been sick until now. She felt that our prayers had been answered, for her life had been extended for several years when she might easily have passed away sooner. This was not the answer I wanted. But as I prayed again and pondered over what she had said, the Spirit confirmed to me that this was true. The problem was that I had not wanted<i>an</i>answer; I had wanted<i>my</i>answer!<br><br>In our communion with God we must ever be careful not just to talk but to listen. We must listen for His Spirit to guide and teach us. As we do, we must be willing always to mold our will to His will, for how can our prayers ever fail if we are willing to put our lives in His hands? I have found that prayer works, that God never fails in His promise to us that He will be there waiting, knocking, hoping that we will open the door. It is a test that each of us can make; it requires no sophisticated equipment, nor any federal grant money. And yet the results can be as incredibly exciting as any research performed with the best, most-expensive equipment. Better yet, the results gained by experimenting on the Lord and upon His word will have consequences that reach far beyond this world into the eternities. I challenge each of you to go to your homes and apartments, to kneel before the Lord and ask, to test and try Him, and to listen for His answer. I bear witness that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true; that prayer is a reliable means of communicating with our Heavenly Father; that even with innumerable questions that are unanswered and perhaps unanswerable in this life, we can know He lives and loves us and knows us. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bart J. Kowallis was a BYU professor of geology when this devotional address was delivered on 14 October 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> and His Kingdom the Center of Your Life, Love</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it is thrilling to be with you today. I bring you greetings from President Hinckley and the First Presidency. Sister McMullin and I marvel over the goodness of your lives and the potential you represent. It is humbling to realize that Heavenly Father has selected you to come forth in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.<br><br>I should like to tell you a story. If you have already heard something similar, no matter--the moral is worth revisiting. As the story goes, the airline company Air France opened an office in Atlanta, Georgia. Some weeks later, the company's chief officer called the Atlanta office. A receptionist answered and, in her charming Southern accent, said, "Air France."<br><br>The proper Frenchman was disturbed. Speaking to the office manager, he said, "We cannot have someone answering the phone 'Air France'; it must be<i>'Air Fränce'!</i>"<br><br>Some weeks later, the company executive called again. The same receptionist answered the phone. She said, "<i>Air Fränce</i>--can I hep ya?"<br><br>The moral is clear. It is much easier to dress up the outside than to change what is within. It is easier to put on an appearance than it is to alter one's nature. Today I hope to be helpful in changing our natures, in lifting us above the things of this world to "a more excellent way" (Ether 12:11).<br><br>You are living in a momentous day in the history of this modern world. Much is expected of you. Your interests and challenges run the gamut from the sciences to the humanities, from the newest discoveries to the most ancient studies. Neither solar systems nor DNA escape your inquisitive probing. Furthermore, that which was arduous for your predecessors you now accomplish in nanoseconds. You are at the forefront of change. Such is the nature of your day and time.<br><br>Unfortunately there is a darker side as well. Exciting and beneficial advances are often eclipsed by things sordid and sensual. Concerning today, the scriptures speak of false Christs and false prophets; nations at war; kingdoms arrayed against each other; famines, plagues, earthquakes, and hailstorms; even cataclysmic events that will shake the very orbs and powers of heaven (see JS--M 1:29–34).<br><br>On a personal level, the Lord speaks of conditions and dangers besetting His covenant people. We read:<br><br><i>For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</i><br><br><i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:15–16]<br><br>This, too, is part of your day and time.<br><br>In today's world much is said about being<i>holistic</i>in one's approach and<i>empowered</i>in one's work. Given what we have just considered, if ever a situation demanded a holistic approach, this is it. If ever a generation needed to be empowered, you do! Unfortunately, the way we typically approach life accomplishes neither of these. Allow me to illustrate.<br><br>We have all been asked the question "What are you going to be when you grow up?" It is a simple question, usually asked in hopes of pointing us in the right direction. In response, our minds typically turn to such things as education, career, marriage and family, wealth and status, lifestyle, church, and the like. In other words, we are inclined to compartmentalize life, to divide it into seemingly neat segments, each of which is expected to contribute to our overall good. In fact, most of a person's time at this great university is spent sharply focused on one or more of these segments.<br><br>But caution is in order. All too often we feel compelled to do everything so we can amount to something. Each segment demands a great deal of personal energy and commitment; each wants to be as important as the other. Soon the battle is with time--time to work it all in--and the day planner or cell phone becomes almost as important as food and air. In the words of Brigham Young, "You are all the time on the wing, and in such a hurry that you do not know what to do first" (<i>JD</i>15:36; see also<i>Deseret News Weekly,</i>5 June 1872, 248). No wonder we feel a little frantic.<br><br>A life divided into compartments risks being overwhelmed by the divisiveness. Priorities can be lost, balance can be surrendered. We can become one of those who "walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god," trusting "in the arm of flesh" to pull him through (D&amp;amp;C 1:16, 19). Our purpose on earth becomes blurred. We no longer have an "eye . . . single to the glory of God" (JST, Matthew 6:22). In the words of the Apostle James, we become as "a double minded man . . . unstable in all his ways" (James 1:8).<br><br>Admittedly, it is improbable that we are going to change the course of warring nations. It is unlikely that a BYU graduate is going to stop the tide of nature's destructive forces. Even an outstanding MBA candidate is not going to alter very much the U.S. balance of payments or the rise and fall of the stock market. But there is something every one of us can do to change our world. We can change ourselves. And as we change ourselves, we alter the way the world affects us. This is done under two simple banners--love and kingdom. Here is how it works.<br><h2><b>Love</b></h2><br>Visualize the first banner--"Love." The Lord was asked, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?" Jesus said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment" (Matthew 22:36–38; see also D&amp;amp;C 59:5). This commandment is at the nexus of all others. Abide by it and every other appetite, passion, or compulsion will yield. As we love God more than anything else, we find that things inimical to His character become unappealing to us. We do not wish to break the commandments; we strive to keep them. We do not lust after what is forbidden; we shun all evil. Even the desire for fashion and fad is replaced with a simple yearning to be neat and comely. That which we love determines that which we become. "No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (Matthew 6:24).<br><br>When I married my dear wife, I knew I would always be number two in her life. This is because she loves God more than she loves me. Over the years my understanding and appreciation for the paramount importance of this "first and great commandment" has deepened. You see, because she loves God more than anything else, she is able to love me more than everything else. How grateful I am that the keeping of this commandment helped her overlook some pretty major deficiencies.<br><br><i>There is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and earth, and all things which are in them;</i><br><br><i>. . . He created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own likeness, created he them;</i><br><br><i>And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him, the only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should worship.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:17–19]<br><br>As we center our love first and foremost in God, the Eternal Father, the capacity emerges within us to love all the works of His hands. For example, no earthly affection or ambition has ever interfered with my wife's devotion to her husband and family. Our marriage is now in its 40th year. Our lives are filled with adoration for one another. Children and grandchildren adorn our home. Temple covenants protect and preserve us. All of this and so very much more because of this "first and great commandment."<br><br><b>Change yourself! Decide today "I am going to love God more than anything else!"</b>Pray for the capacity to do so. Repent of things that stand in the way. Follow the prophet and keep the commandments. Allow your love for God to supersede the styles you wear, the hours you keep, the impressions you give, the grades you receive, the words you speak, even the way you are. As this love grows, changes will emerge. You will become a better neighbor, a more conscientious student, a more honest person, a more devout disciple. Your circle of friends will increase, and your circle of influence will expand. You will also discover that Heavenly Father loves you (see 1 John 4:19). In the words of the Apostle Paul:<br><br><i>I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</i><br><br><i>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i>[Romans 8:38–39]<br><h2><b>Kingdom</b></h2><br>Visualize the second banner--"Kingdom." Brigham Young lifts our sights to this banner with the words "With us, it is the kingdom of God, or nothing" (<i>JD</i>5:342). The Lord taught:<br><br><i>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? . . .</i><br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</i>[JST, Matthew 6:35, 37–38]<br><br>Our beloved prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, has given luster and direction to these teachings for our day:<br><br><i>I wish to remind you</i>[as Latter-day Saints]<i>that we are all in this together. It is not a matter of the General Authorities on one hand and the membership of the Church on the other. We are all working as one in a great cause. We are all members of the Church of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Within your sphere of responsibility you have as serious an obligation as do I within my sphere of responsibility. Each of us should be determined to build the kingdom of God on the earth and to further the work of righteousness.</i>["An Ensign to the Nations, A Light to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2003, 82; see also JST, Matthew 6:38]<br><br><b>The kingdom of God on the earth is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</b>. It has been established to prepare this earth and its people for the Second Coming of our Lord. Did He not pray, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10)? Some 14 months after He established His Church once more upon the earth, the Lord said:<br><br><i>The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that thine enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory, forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 65:2, 6; see also Daniel 2:31–45]<br><br>Again we have the prophetic words of President Hinckley:<br><br><i>I believe and testify that it is the mission of this Church to stand as an ensign to the nations and a light to the world. We have had placed upon us a great, all-encompassing mandate from which we cannot shrink nor turn aside. We accept that mandate and are determined to fulfill it, and with the help of God we shall do it. . . .</i><br><br><i>We must never lose sight of our objective. We must ever keep before us the goal which the Lord has set for us.</i>["Ensign to the Nations," 82–83; see also D&amp;amp;C 105:5–6, 31–32]<br><br><b>The kingdom of God or the Church is made up of two essential parts.</b>One is the family, the basic unit of the Church and kingdom. It is here that the citizens of God's kingdom reside. Unlike many definitions in the world today, such a family consists of a man and a woman joined together in marriage as ordained of God. Established and nurtured in this manner, these families become as eternal as the kingdom itself (see D&amp;amp;C 132:19–20).<br><br>The other essential part is the priesthood. It houses the oracles and organization of the Church. The power and authority of God originate here. It includes apostles and prophets; keys and callings; truth and scriptures; laws and covenants; quorums, wards, stakes, and the like.<br><br>Can you see how these two elements harmonize and complement each other? They are interdependent and interlocking. Can you see how flawed the idea is that one can be without the other? To choose family over priesthood is preposterous, for without priesthood there is no eternal family. To choose priesthood over family is folly, for its powers and purpose are to save those residing in the family circle. Complications that arise are the outgrowth of man, not evidence of an imperfect design. President John Taylor observed:<br><br><i>What is the first thing necessary to the establishment of his kingdom? It is to raise up a Prophet and have him declare the will of God; the next is to have people yield obedience to the word of the Lord through that Prophet. If you cannot have these, you never can establish the kingdom of God upon the earth.</i>[<i>JD</i>6:25; see also John Taylor,<i>The Gospel Kingdom,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1943), 214]<br><br>Harmonizing these elements in the kingdom is neither automatic nor easy. It is, in fact, the essence of our mortal struggle. President Taylor continued:<br><br><i>We have a great mission to perform--we have to try to govern ourselves according to the laws of the kingdom of God, and we find it one of the most difficult tasks we ever undertook, to learn to govern ourselves, our appetites, our dispositions, our habits, our feelings, our lives, our spirits, our judgment, and to bring all our desires into subjection to the law of the kingdom of God and to the Spirit of truth.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:12; see also<i>Gospel Kingdom,</i>214]<br><br>We are a covenant-making and a covenant-keeping people. This is the way to the harmony we seek. It is the way of Heavenly Father and His Holy Son. From baptism to Judgment Day, every one of us is expected to keep his or her covenants--whether in school, in the workplace, at a social, or at church.<br><br>This kingdom is not a Sunday-only experience. It is not limited to callings or meetings. This Church is not like a set of clothes, used to dress up on the Sabbath then laid aside for more casual attire as quickly as possible. The Church or kingdom of God is a way of life--indeed, it is the substance of life. In harmony with our covenants, it should accompany us wherever we go. Live by the couplet<br><br><i>Build the kingdom--twenty-four, seven.</i><br><i>It's the surest way to heaven.</i><br><br><b>Change yourself. Decide today "I am going to make the Church and kingdom of God the center of my life!"</b>Position yourself firmly inside God's kingdom; allow it to encompass you. When you marry, see to it that your family is established as the basic unit in the Church and kingdom. As you meet the demands of life, rather than leaving the Church and stepping into the world, take the kingdom of God with you wherever you go. Allow its purposes and objective to circumscribe all that you do. For example, in pursuit of your studies, have more than a degree or a career in mind. See that mastery of a subject better equips you to serve as a father, a mother, a priesthood or sister leader, an example of goodness and virtue among all with whom you associate. Make this the pattern in all your endeavors, be they social or civic or recreational or whatever. We have, after all, covenanted to do so "at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:8–10; see also D&amp;amp;C 20:37). As we do so, everything else will turn out all right. Said President Hinckley:<br><br><i>If we are to hold up this Church as an ensign to the nations and a light to the world, we must take on more of the luster of the life of Christ individually and in our own personal circumstances. In standing for the right, we must not be fearful of the consequences. . . .</i><br><br><i>This Church, I submit, is far more than a social organization where we gather together to enjoy one another's company. It is more than Sunday School and Relief Society and priesthood meeting. It is more than sacrament meeting, more even than temple service. It is the kingdom of God in the earth. It behooves us to act in a manner befitting membership in that kingdom.</i>["Ensign to the Nations," 84]<br><br>This great winding-up scene is your day and time.<b>Beginning today, make God and His kingdom the center of your life.</b>By doing so, you help cause<br><br>•<i>weak things of the world</i>[to]<i>come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones;</i><br>•<i>every man</i>[to]<i>speak in the name of God the Lord;</i><br>•<i>faith</i>[to]<i>increase in the earth;</i><br>• [the Lord's]<i>everlasting covenant</i>[to]<i>be established;</i>[and]<br>• [the]<i>gospel</i>[to]<i>be proclaimed . . . unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:19–23]<br><br>God is in His heavens. Jesus Christ is His Holy Son, the blessed Redeemer. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is God's kingdom on the earth. Of these truths I bear my witness, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Keith B. McMullin was the second counselor in the Presiding Bishopric of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was delivered on 21 October 2003.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ptures and the Restoration - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I find myself continuing to feel the inspiration of the last general conference. I felt the power of the messages, especially the doctrinal presentations on the restoration of the gospel.<br><br>Fortunately we can continue to study these messages. Sessions are replayed on television and over the Internet, and the printed text is available in the Church magazines in a remarkably short period of time. Just one month after the final session we have the conference edition of the<i>Ensign</i>and the<i>Liahona</i>ready for distribution. That's a marvelous accomplishment. It is now possible to study these messages by topic for use in our personal study and family home evening and as source material for our gospel teaching assignments to emphasize the words of the prophets.<br><br>As I have reviewed the sermons, I have been impressed with the doctrinal foundation taught. How the Lord has blessed us with additional truths reinforced by the holy scriptures in our lives!<br><h2><b>The Scriptures in Previous Dispensations</b></h2><br>From the beginning of time the Lord has instructed His servants to make a record of His dealings with them. For example, in the days of Adam: "A book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, in the language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration" (Moses 6:5).<br><br>Abraham reported that:<br><br><i>The records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right of Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands; therefore a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and of the stars, as they were made known unto the fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write some of these things upon this record, for the benefit of my posterity that shall come after me.</i>[Abraham 1:31]<br><br>And Moses, in his great vision concerning the Lord's work, was commanded: "And now, Moses, my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which thou standest; and thou shalt write the things which I shall speak" (Moses 1:40).<br><br>Throughout almost all periods of time there has been a longing of the people to know the scriptures. In about 458 B.C., after bringing the people of Judah back to the land of Judea from their 75 years of captivity in Babylon, Ezra the scribe gathered the people together so he could read the scriptures to them:<br><br><i>And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.</i><br><br><i>And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</i><br><br><i>And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.</i>[Nehemiah 8:1–3]<br><br>During the time of the New Testament, too, missionaries such as Paul and Silas found people who "received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily" (Acts 17:11).<br><h2><b>The Great Apostasy</b></h2><br>Even so, the Savior's Church had not been organized for very long before apostasy began to enter in among the organized body of the Church. It compelled Paul to write to the early Saints:<br><br><i>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</i><br><br><i>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</i><br><br><i>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</i>[Galatians 1:6–8]<br><br>The early Christians suffered much persecution. By the first quarter of the fourth century, however, there was a great change in the general attitude toward Christianity. It was marked by the conversion of Constantine the Great, under whose patronage the Christian profession grew in favor and, in fact, became a state religion.<br><br>But instead of humbly following the Savior, who established the Church, people began seeking Church offices for the social honor and wealth that accompanied them. Soon pomp and ceremony became a great part of the Church. The ordinance of baptism was perverted. The sacrament was altered. Public worship became an exhibition of art. Men without authority exercised the prerogatives of the Church in leading the people.<br><br>An age of darkness was upon the earth, and for a period the Great Apostasy reigned over men. They were in a condition similar to the Sadducees who sought to entrap the Savior concerning a marriage issue. The Savior told them, "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God" (Matthew 22:29). I guess all of us find ourselves in that position at times when we try to answer the perplexities of life without having a foundation and a knowledge of the truth to lead us in the right direction.<br><h2><b>The Coming Forth of the Bible</b></h2><br>It seems that there was a longing in some of the people to have the words of the Lord to guide them in their lives. As we move through the period commonly called the Dark Ages, we see an awakening of the desire of mankind to have the holy scriptures.<br><br>In A.D. 385 the pope recognized a need for making the scriptures available for the priests to use. He commissioned Jerome to work on a revised version that would be used by Catholic priests. Jerome worked for 23 years to create the Vulgate Latin Translation of the Bible. Almost a thousand years later John Wycliffe translated the Latin Bible into English.<br><br>But very few men had the opportunity to have their own copy of the Bible because it was handwritten only. It took a copyist about 10 months to make a copy. Some people would borrow the scriptures for a day, or even for an hour, because they could not afford to buy them. It was said that a load of hay was the going price to use the Bible for an hour. Because the scriptures were not readily accessible to most people, they were at the mercy of the teachers of religion for knowledge of their contents. Before the restoration of the gospel could occur, the scriptures needed to be made available in a form that could be used by the common man.<br><br>Between 1450 and 1455 Johannes Gutenberg of Germany took an important step in that direction when he published the Latin Vulgate Bible, the first book ever printed in a movable press.<br><br>Early in the 1500s William Tyndale saw the need to make an English translation of the Bible directly from the Hebrew and Greek text rather than from the Latin Vulgate. As a scholar trained in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek, Tyndale was able to identify many errors in the Latin translation and would often turn to the Hebrew and Greek texts in his teaching. But his work of translation was interrupted by church leaders who were opposed to the people having a knowledge of the scriptures. Tyndale was pursued and eventually imprisoned. He suffered mental and physical torment for 18 months, until 6 October 1536, when he was taken from his cell and tied to a stake. There he uttered a loud prayer: "Lord! open the king of England's eyes."<sup>1</sup>Tyndale was strangled and burned at the stake for heresy.<br><br>Since then Tyndale has become known as the father of our present English Bible. About 92 percent of Tyndale's translation survived in the English King James Version. It was prepared by a committee of scholars, printed in 1611, and widely used. The King James Version of the Bible is recognized worldwide for its beauty of expression and general accuracy, given the limitations of the manuscripts from which it was translated.<br><br>Now the scriptures were generally available to men, but there arose a great conflict among religionists about which of the doctrines were to be followed and which were correct. Revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith have made it clear that the King James Version, as great as it was, did not contain all of the ancient manuscripts. Many plain and precious parts had been lost (see 1 Nephi 13:26). There needed to be a clarification of the language of the scriptures--not made by scholars but by a prophet of God.<br><h2><b>The Restoration</b></h2><br>I am intrigued with the Lord's timing to bring forth His gospel again. It shows that He understands His children. The simplicity of life in the early 1800s was a good seedbed for the Restoration. Technology had been asleep for centuries. Communication almost had to be face-to-face. If you wanted to travel, you had to rely on the winds or the strength of men to move vessels over rivers, lakes, or seas, and by land you traveled on beasts of burden or just by plain walking. A half century later may have been too late to find the humble, hardworking, rugged pioneers necessary to establish His Church.<br><br>At the time of the Prophet Joseph Smith's birth, the world's population was about one billion. Since that time we have seen a population explosion. Technology has similarly advanced, with the invention of steam power, electrical power, the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, the internal combustible engine, air flights, television, the computer, and so on as we expand and grow into new technologies. It seems as if the Lord has been opening the minds of men to prepare them for an age when the gospel would be preached in its fulness. This Restoration has come in a time when a large number of God's children can have ready access to His word as revealed through His chosen prophets.<br><br>The Lord needed someone who was teachable to be an instrument through which He would restore the gospel. He needed someone He could mold into a leader. Out of the weak things of the earth the Lord raised up a prophet with power and strength. The one foreordained for this great assignment was the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>Few prophets have come from more humble beginnings than had the Prophet Joseph. He had little opportunity for education. He was not quite 15 years of age when the Lord touched him and brought forth a marvelous vision through which mankind would again know the true nature of God, His relationship to His Son, and Their relationship to the Holy Ghost.<br><br>It is interesting that the Lord chose to reveal Himself to such a young man. I think there were probably two reasons:<br><br>1. Joseph had not been educated in the ways of the world and therefore could more easily be taught the pure doctrine by visitations and establish his understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>2. Joseph would teach what he had learned to others in simplified words that could be understood by all mankind. Through Joseph the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth.<br><br>An essential part of the Restoration was the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon clears up the misconceptions about the gospel as presented in the Bible. It stands as tangible evidence of the reality of the First Vision and of Joseph Smith's divine calling. It teaches about faith in God. It strongly urges obedience to His will and testifies of the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth--that He is the Son of God, the Savior of the world. It declares the truth of the divine origin of the Bible and corroborates its truths. It teaches of purity of thought, word, and deed and sets heaven as the highest goal of life. As in previous dispensations, the doctrinal base provided in the scriptures--in this case the Bible and the Book of Mormon--made possible the establishment of the Savior's Church again on the earth.<br><h2><b>The Story of William Pilkington</b></h2><br>My special interest in the words of the prophets came at a very impressionable age in my life. My father was the bishop of our ward. Each year he would plan a trip that would help impress on our minds the significance of the events that happened near our home in Logan, Utah.<br><br>When I was 12 years of age, he planned a trip to Clarkston, Utah, for the Aaronic Priesthood holders of our ward. Arriving in Clarkston, we were driven to the town cemetery, where we were asked to gather around a tall granite marker. The marker was engraved with the name of Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Not only were we to see Martin Harris's grave, but we would also hear Martin Harris's testimony by one who knew him. I would like you to relive that event with me tonight. I have invited William Pilkington--alias Lael Woodbury--to tell his story. William, please come forth and give that witness.<br><br><i>We had been in our new home a few days. One dark night a knock came on the door. Our family was gathered at home and we were all singing the songs of Zion. We stopped singing and Father opened the door. A strange man walked in. He was given a chair and he sat down.</i><br><br><i>He said, "What is your name, sir?"</i><br><br><i>Father promptly told him our name was Pilkington.</i><br><br><i>He said, "Are you immigrants?"</i><br><br><i>He was told that we had just immigrated from England. He said he wanted to hire a boy to go and live with him for one year.</i><br><br><i>My brother Richard and I were sitting together on the right of the stranger. He looked at us and said, "I think this one will do." That one was Willie--me.</i><br><br><i>He then asked if I would like to go and live with him for a year. He said he had just sold his property in Smithfield and was going to a place across the valley called Clarkston. Father asked him how much I would get if I went for a year. He thought a little while and then said, "I will give Willie a two-year-old heifer and his board and clothes if he will work for me."</i><br><br><i>I asked Father what he thought about the proposition. He said it was all right--I could go and work for him a year, and for me to be a good boy.</i><br><br><i>I put on my coat and hat, kissed Mother, Father, and all the rest of the family, and went with him. It was a very dark night, and the country being strange to me, he took hold of my hand. We walked for about 10 minutes and entered a log house--the first log house I was ever in.</i><br><br><i>The rest of the family had all retired to bed. Or at least I thought so. I thought it very strange the man did not tell me what his name was. He gave me a chair and sat me down close by a little round table. He then asked me if I had had my supper.</i><br><br><i>I said, "Yes," and he said, "Maybe you can eat a little more." So he got a pan of milk, some bread, a bowl and spoon and told me to eat all I wanted. He told me the folks had all gone to bed and said, "Now I will go to bed, but before going I will show you where you will sleep on the floor," and then he went to bed.</i><br><br><i>I was enjoying the bread and milk when my attention was attracted to an object over in the northwest corner of the room. As the oil lamp gives very little light, I was puzzled as to what it could be, so I ate a little faster so I could go to bed.</i><br><br><i>I was obliged to go between the table and this object, and in going round the table I discovered the form of a man. He made a motion with his hand as if he wanted me.</i><br><br><i>Rather timidly I went over to him, and he told me to pull up a chair and sit down close to him. I still felt a rather crawly sensation creeping over me, but I pulled up the chair alongside the chair he was sitting on and sat down.</i><br><br><i>He asked me what my name was, and I promptly told him my name was William Pilkington.</i><br><br><i>He asked me if we were immigrants.</i><br><br><i>I told him our family immigrated from England.</i><br><br><i>He then asked me if I was going to live with them.</i><br><br><i>I told him I thought I would live with them for about a year.</i><br><br><i>Up to this time neither one of them had told me what their name was, and it rather puzzled me. Then he asked me if I was a Mormon.</i><br><br><i>I told him our whole family were Mormons.</i><br><br><i>He told me he was going to call me Willie. I told him that Mother called me Willie too.</i><br><br><i>Then he said, "Willie, tomorrow night after the chores are done and we have had supper and all the folks have gone to bed, I want you to sit down in this chair, close to mine, for I have lots to tell you."</i><br><br><i>I told him I would do that, and then I retired to bed on the floor. Between the floor being hard and what the old man had told me, I did not sleep very much and arose very early the next morning not feeling very much refreshed, as that was the first time I had ever slept on the floor, and that with only one quilt under and one over me.</i><br><br><i>When I arose the next morning, I looked for the man who talked to me last night. I knew that I could recognize him, as in the darkness of the room he resembled a picture I had once seen of Rip Van Winkle. When I found him, however, I found a very old man, and he walked with a cane. He greeted me with "Good morning, Willie" and shook my hand and told me not to forget tonight.</i><br><br><i>I told him I wouldn't forget. I was wondering all day long what that old man wanted me for--an old decrepit man who wanted to talk to a boy he had found out was a Mormon boy.</i><br><br><i>At last night came. Supper was over, and after having family prayer they all retired to bed. The old gentleman then sat down in his armchair, put his elbow on the arm of the chair, and crooked his finger as he did scores of times afterward, and that was a signal for me to bring my chair alongside his.</i><br><br><i>He again asked me what my name was.</i><br><br><i>I told him.</i><br><br><i>"Oh, yes, I am to call you Willie." He then said, "Willie, did you ever go to Sunday School?"</i><br><br><i>I promptly told him, "Yes, sir."</i><br><br><i>"What class were you in?"</i><br><br><i>I promptly told him the Book of Mormon class.</i><br><br><i>His eyes sparkled and his whole body seemed to vibrate. He seemed like a changed being. He was very excited, trembling as I gazed into his eyes.</i><br><br><i>He said, "Did you ever read the Book of Mormon?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes, sir," was the reply.</i><br><br><i>"Well, if you have read the Book of Mormon, what is the first reading that we find in the preface of the book?"</i><br><br><i>After a little thinking, I said, "The first reading in the Book of Mormon is the testimony of the three men testifying to the whole world that they saw an angel come down from heaven, that they saw the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, and the angel told them that the translation was correct, and they bear record that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God and that their names will go forever before the world testifying that the Book of Mormon is true."</i><br><br><i>He then said, "I know now, Willie, that you have read that glorious book. Willie, I am going to ask you one more question. What were those three men's names?"</i><br><br><i>I told him they were Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris.</i><br><br><i>This little old man, then 92 years of age, of whom in my mind I had likened to Rip Van Winkle, whose whole being at this time was wonderful to behold, all lit up with the Spirit of God, whose eyes now were sparkling, whose whole being was transformed, stood up before me on that memorable occasion and, putting his walking cane in his left hand, he straightened up and striking his breast with his right hand exclaimed, "I am Martin Harris, one of the three witnesses to the authenticity of the Book of Mormon--a man who had the privilege of standing before angels, a man whose eyes beheld the golden plates, a man whose ears heard the voice of God declare that the book was translated correctly and then command him to testify to all the world that it was correct."</i><br><br><i>From that time on until his death, he never tired of telling me of the beauties of the gospel, and especially about the early rise of the Church and the tribulations that beset the Prophet Joseph Smith and himself.</i><br><br>Thank you, William Pilkington, for that witness and testimony.<sup>2</sup><br><br>This experience electrified me. I realized that there stood a man who had actually heard the testimony of one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. Now I was having the privilege of hearing his witness on that hillside in Clarkston, Utah.<br><h2><b>The Scriptures Are Fundamental</b></h2><br>There is real power in the scriptures. I am amazed at how much is given to us in them that is sound and beneficial in every age and time. As I study, review, and comprehend the scriptures, I find a fundamental, basic plan that is of value to each generation from the very beginning of time.<br><br>The greatest fear I have in this information age is that we will have so much clutter descending upon us that we will find it difficult to keep our lives in balance. I believe the scriptures provide insight into patterns that will help us prepare for the future.<br><br>President Theodore Roosevelt stated:<br><br><i>Every thinking man, when he thinks, realizes . . . that the teachings of the Bible are so interwoven and entwined with our whole civic and social life that it would be literally . . . impossible for us to figure</i>[for]<i>ourselves what that life would be if these teachings were removed. We would lose almost all the standards by which we now judge both public and private morals; all the standards toward which we . . . strive to raise ourselves.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>Through the scriptures the gospel of Jesus Christ is revealed to us. It is the ultimate good news. There is no news that even approaches the good news of the gospel in beauty, insight, fulness, and depth.<br><br>Our love of the scriptures should be a paramount part of our faith firmly anchored to the gospel of Jesus Christ. We should not look upon reading and studying the scriptures as an inconvenience or something we must endure. In the word of God there is power and nourishment and life. It is interesting to me how many promises the Lord extends to those who read His words. The word can heal the wounded soul (see Jacob 2:8). The words of Christ will tell us all things we should do (see 2 Nephi 32:3). There are other promises for those who turn to the word of God and trust in it fully. Let us examine a few.<br><h2><b>Promises to Those Who Study the Scriptures</b></h2><br>Joshua was told, "Meditate [upon the words of the law] day and night . . . : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success" (Joshua 1:8).<br><br>The Psalmist said: "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path" (Psalm 119:105).<br><br>This is one of the most reassuring promises of the Lord--that in the gospel light we shall be able to find our way in darkness and be able to see the path that we are to follow.<br><br>In the New Testament there is additional insight into the power of the scriptures. In Luke we read about the Savior appearing to two of His disciples following His Resurrection. After He departed from them, they said, "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?" (Luke 24:32). There's a wonderful promise for you. I encourage you to find the real meaning of that promise and have your "heart burn within" you as you study the words of the Lord.<br><br>What will such a study do for us? It will strengthen our testimony of the Savior, for the scriptures testify of Him. Jesus said: "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).<br><br>And Paul made this statement:<br><br><i>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</i><br><br><i>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</i>[2 Timothy 3:16–17]<br><br>Nephi saw that the rod of iron in his father's dream represented the word of God. And then he made this promise about the word of God: "Whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them" (1 Nephi 15:24).<br><br>Can you imagine a more wonderful promise than that? Through our study of the word of God we will find the power to resist temptation.<br><br>Listen to this promise extended to those who diligently study the scriptures and obey the word of God. Perhaps it is the most marvelous of them all. The prophet Mormon wrote:<br><br><i>Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked--</i><br><br><i>And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven.</i>[Helaman 3:29–30]<br><br>In light of these great promises, my encouragement to you this evening is that you do not leave the study of the scriptures to chance. Do not trust in the things of the world that will prevent you from finding the things of eternal value. Turn to the scriptures. In them is the plan of happiness. Through them we can grow in knowledge and understanding of what the Lord has revealed to His prophets through all ages. Do not become so busy that you reduce the power that comes from reading the scriptures because you are overly involved in the things of the world. Have faith and confidence in the Lord's dealings with His children here on earth. Build your faith strong by trusting what the Lord has given to us through His holy scriptures. Surely here is the foundation we need to gain the fundamental witness of the saving grace of our Lord and Savior.<br><br>We also have the opportunity of reviewing the messages of general conference. Please focus on applying the lessons we have been taught so that they will have an effect on our individual lives. The Doctrine and Covenants tells us:<br><br><i>Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i><br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:4–5]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has been so strong in his desire to separate us from worldly involvement, which is penetrating even the sanctity of our own homes. He announced that we are going to raise the standard for full-time missionary service:<br><br><i>The time has come when we must raise the standards of those who are called to serve as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ. . . . I remind you that missionary work is not a rite of passage in the Church. It is a call extended by the President of the Church to those who are worthy and able to accomplish it. . . .</i><br><br><i>I am confident that raising the bar on eligibility will cause our young people, particularly our young men, to practice self-discipline, to live above the low standards of the world, to avoid transgression and take the high road in all their activities.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>That message not only applies to those preparing for missionary service--it has a rippling effect that extends to every member of the Church and to those who must qualify themselves to join the Church. To raise the standards of missionaries requires raising the standard of devotion in our own homes. The Church organizations that support the family--Primary, Aaronic Priesthood quorums, Young Women, Melchizedek Priesthood quorums, Relief Society, Sunday School, and so forth--must also have higher standards of performance.<br><br>The charge has been given to us. Now, to obtain the promised blessings, we must respond by increasing our understanding of the doctrine and religiously applying the doctrine in our lives.<br><br>In closing, I remind you of the promise the Lord gave when He said:<br><br><i>Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i>[2 Nephi 32:3]<br><br>May the Lord bless each of us with the desire to study and know and grow in a knowledge of the scriptures. May you find them to be a guide and a source of power. May they direct you to the eternal good that we are all seeking here in mortality and in the worlds to come.<br><br>I promise you that the scriptures will lead you to life eternal. God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. We have an opportunity of being part of His great kingdom. Let us do it with all of the enthusiasm and with all of the power our souls can muster, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1> Lives, Extraordinary Miracles - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During my career as a professional opera singer, I spent months and sometimes years in preparation for an important concert or stage production. One thing was certain and unavoidable: the time would arrive when I had to stand on the stage in front of thousands of people and sing. This musical accountability was swift and very audible--to my credit or shame. Immediately I could see the quality of my performance reflected in the face of the conductor.<br><br>As we anxiously await and prepare for the hallmark events in our lives, it feels at times as if they will never arrive. We fantasize in anticipation of getting our first driver's license or graduating from high school, attending college, going on a mission, getting married, experiencing the birth of a child, and much more. Just as surely as these highly anticipated events will arrive and pass, so will the time of our mortality come to an end. As Jacob in the Book of Mormon recorded: It will pass "as it were unto us a dream" (Jacob 7:26).<br><br>All of us have dreams, aspirations, and solid goals. As we use our allotted days and years to bring them to fruition, there are six principles I have found that, when practiced, can dramatically affect the outcome of our lives. They can bring us many wonderful blessings and even miracles that can build our faith and shape our lives in ways we never thought possible. Hopefully, when we stand face-to-face with our Savior, our inevitable reunion can be sweet beyond measure as we see the quality of our earthly performance reflected in His smiling face.<br><br>I have been asked to share some of my life's experiences with you. In doing so, I do not wish to glory or boast in my own strength or talent. But, like Ammon, I do glory in my Savior and His goodness (see Alma 26:35–36). It is with deep gratitude and humility that I recount these very personal events. I pray that through my testimony the following principles may assist you in experiencing ways in which the Lord can make a miracle<i>in</i>your life and<i>of</i>your life as you move toward this future reunion.<br><h2><b>Principle One: Make the Lord Your Partner as You Prepare</b></h2><br>As we read the scriptures and observe President Hinckley's examples of "ordinary people who are engaged in an extraordinary undertaking," an unmistakable pattern and path to the extraordinary becomes evident (Gordon B. Hinckley, "The State of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2003, 7). All of the following men drew themselves away--most of them in fasting and mighty prayer--to receive direction and the strength to do what must be done. Moses on Mount Sinai, Nephi, Enos, Joseph Smith, and President Kimball--to name but a few--all formed a solid partnership with their Creator. All were feeling inadequate. All had monumental assignments or decisions to make. Even the most extraordinary being on this earth, Christ Himself, found it necessary to draw Himself away for 40 days before commencing His life's work. At the end of this time a partnership had been forged that would sustain Him through Satan's temptations and, finally, through His unimaginable suffering.<br><br>How much greater is our need? I venture to say that every man and woman sitting behind me on this stand, as well as many of you in this assembly today, have already formed this partnership and through it have experienced extraordinary miracles.<br><br>In my wildest dreams or loftiest aspirations I never envisioned myself as a professional opera singer. Never! My wife and I had been married but a short time when we first moved to Overton, Nevada, directly after graduating from BYU. I was content with my new job as a music teacher and, as far as we were concerned, this was to be our home for the rest of our lives. We bought an old home--and I mean<i>old--</i>and worked to fix it up with air conditioning, a picket fence, and other amenities. During the summer months I continued my education, completing my master's degree at Northern Arizona University in 1977. It was there that the stirrings of a dream began to be felt.<br><br>My voice teacher and mentor, Edgar Stone, encouraged me to seriously think about a career in opera. I struggled with the idea and dismissed it. I couldn't envision how such a career would facilitate the achievement of my primary goal--that of being a good husband and father. How could I possibly balance family responsibilities, a stage life, and Church service? Would I be able to maintain personal integrity in such a highly competitive career? As I prayerfully considered this germinating dream, I began hearing of other members of the Church who had pursued such a course while successfully raising a family, but the most powerful source of encouragement and inspiration was my dear wife, Jeannie.<br><br>One evening after a rehearsal for a high school production, I returned home to find her sitting alone in our den. It was obvious she had been crying. Shocked, I asked her if someone had died. She said no. She had been listening to the recording of my master's recital.<br><br>"Was it that bad?" I asked.<br><br>She smiled and told me, "No. No, it was just fine."<br><br>However, she knew with certainty that the Lord had other plans for us and we would need to leave Overton.<br><br>Such an important and life-altering decision cannot be made alone. By then we had three sons. I knew that uprooting our little family from the security of our nearly completed home and comfortable job would be nothing short of insanity without confirmation from the Lord.<br><br>We fasted and fervently prayed for guidance. One afternoon, just as we were about ready to end our fast, I stopped at the post office to collect the mail. The July 1977 issue of the<i>Ensign</i>had arrived. I opened to the First Presidency message and read President Kimball's life-changing words specifically addressing the arts:<br><br><i>Who of us has not sat spellbound with</i>Aïda, Il Trovatore,<i>or other of the masterpieces of Verdi . . . ? Can there never be another Verdi or his superiors? . . .</i><br><br><i>Is there anyone who has not been stirred by the rich melodic voice of Enrico Caruso . . . , Italian-born operatic tenor? Surely there have been few voices which have inspired so many.</i><br><br>President Kimball continued:<br><br><i>We also remember the celebrated Jenny Lind, the Swedish singer. . . . Do you think there are no more voices like Jenny Lind's? Our day, our time, our people, our generation, should produce such, as we catch the total vision of our potential and dream dreams and see visions of the future.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "The Gospel Vision of the Arts,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1977, 3]<br><br>Can you imagine how we felt as the impact of this message penetrated our souls? It was as if the Lord had literally spoken to us. We had received an extraordinary answer and knew<i>what</i>had to be done. Together, with the Lord as our partner, it became our challenge to figure out<i>how</i>to do it.<br><br>In another series of small, yet irrefutable miracles, we were able to sell our beloved home and were led to the name of John McCollum, a professor at the University of Michigan who agreed to accept me as a private student. On our youngest son Zachary's first birthday we loaded all that we owned into a rental truck and drove the 2,000-plus miles to Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br><br>Three years later, after completing my doctorate, I continued my singing career in New York City with the Goldovsky Opera Company.<br><h2><b>Principle Two: Doubt Not, Fear Not</b></h2><br>It seems that with each great spiritual event, after each divinely confirmed step, an intense buffeting follows. To illustrate, let us consider the experiences of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price and of Christ at the end of His great fast. After experiencing glorious things we cannot possibly comprehend, both were targeted for intense opposition. Using doubt and fear, Satan will also try to dissuade us from our course and persuade us to take the counterfeit.<br><br>The reality of professional singing, which included being absent from my family for up to eight weeks at a time during touring productions, was like a splash of cold water. The old, nagging questions surfaced. What had I done? Had I left my job and dragged my little family far away from the security of a comfortable life for this? Had I really acted upon inspiration or should I let my dreams die and simply bury them? Things were definitely not turning out the way we had envisioned, and for the first time I was really afraid.<br><br>When I took these doubts and fears and laid them at the Lord's feet, the answer to our dilemma came as dramatically and miraculously as our directive to leave Overton. During one of our long-distance telephone conversations I told my wife about several of my colleagues in the touring group that had spent some time in Europe. There it was possible to be a member of an opera company, keep regular hours, have health and retirement benefits, and, best of all, stay in one place. It sounded like a dream come true. We had only one problem: how would we finance an audition tour to Europe?<br><br>Absolutely no one knew of our conversation. A short time after our talk and heartfelt prayer, a dear friend called. To my utter amazement he brought up the subject of a European audition tour and offered to finance the trip. With tears of joy and unbelievable gratitude we thanked our Heavenly Father for such an incredible miracle and the generosity of such a spiritually sensitive friend. I made my reservations shortly thereafter, boarded the plane in New York, and three weeks later miraculously had a job in a beautiful city, the oldest city in Germany: Trier.<br><h2><b>Principle Three: There Is a Way Prepared</b></h2><br>In Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, he wrote:<br><br><i>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</i>[1 Corinthians 2:9]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, after you have invited the Lord to be your partner and dispelled the doubt that can stop your progress, stand aside and allow Him to prepare the way.<br><br>When I returned home from the audition tour we had less than a year to financially prepare for our German adventure. We had moved in with my parents in Denver to save every penny possible. There were five plane tickets to purchase and, after our arrival in Europe, a car to buy and an entire house to furnish. How in the world could we earn that kind of money in such a short period of time?<br><br>Our middle son, Ethan, was in the second grade when he learned of our impending move. He and his older brother, Todd, had seen old paintings of snowy German towns with mosaic cobblestone streets upon which horse-drawn carriages were pulled. One afternoon as they asked a few questions about our upcoming move, it became touchingly apparent to us that they thought we would be moving to a place with no electricity and that our only means of transportation would be horse and carriage. Ethan excitedly came home from school one day. He had mentioned to his teacher that his Dad was an opera singer and that we would soon be moving to Germany. That evening his teacher called and asked me if I would visit his class and introduce the children to opera.<br><br>I thought, "No problem. I'll just sing a couple of arias and answer a few questions."<br><br>Several days later, however, the principal called and asked if I would present the program to the entire student body.<br><br>"Well," I thought, "I guess Jeannie and I will really have to prepare something now." That "something" evolved into an elementary school assembly program that we called "What Is Opera Anyway?" Its popularity increased as it was promoted by newspaper and word of mouth until nearly every school district in the greater Denver area requested our services. We tallied our earnings just before leaving for Europe, and--gratefully, miraculously--we had more than enough to finance our move and necessary purchases.<br><h2><b>Principle Four: Work Hard and Wait upon the Lord</b></h2><br>Are there times when you feel as if you have done everything in your power and the Lord still is not answering your petitions? As the days, months, and even years pass and your life seems to be on hold, let me give you some food for thought. Please turn with me to Malachi 3:10. All of you are familiar with the wonderful promise to those who keep the law of tithing:<br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i><br><br>Now let us focus our attention on the next verse. It holds a glorious promise of protection, of preservation, and of great hope:<br><br><i>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.</i>[Malachi 3:11]<br><br>Keep this verse in mind as I relate the following story.<br><br>Our first home in Europe was located in a beautiful valley nestled among ancient vineyards near Trier. One year there was an exceptionally good crop. The grapes were more plentiful and sweeter than they had been in years. Nearly everyone in the valley was dependent in one way or another on the success of the grape harvest. A few weeks before the laborious work of harvesting the grapes was to begin, a devastating frost hit the entire valley. When we awakened early the next morning, we were surprised to see hundreds of our neighbors already working frantically, trying to save as much of the crop as possible. The tiny stem holding each bundle of grapes had been affected by the frost and was unable to hold its precious fruit any longer. Once the grapes hit the ground and the temperature rose, it was just a matter of hours before the grapes were ruined: The vine had "cast her fruit before the time" (Malachi 3:11; see also 3 Nephi 24:11).<br><br>Our family had made the German adjustment well. In addition to assimilating another language and culture, we had been lovingly accepted into our little branch. However, we knew that our time in Trier would be relatively short.<br><br>Theaters in Germany are classified according to their size, the number of orchestra members, and available finances. Trier is a small "city theatre" and is listed among European theaters as a "D" house. The dream of every opera singer is to be employed as a soloist in an "A" house. "A" houses, or theaters, are comparable to the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York City and La Scala in Milan. They include such opera theaters as Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, and the Vienna State Opera.<br><br>It was also my goal to sing in such theaters. I had worked hard and had done everything in my power to climb the rungs to a "C" house on my way to the larger opera stages. I shudder to think how many auditions I sang and how many times I heard the words "Thank you. You will hear from us if we need you." Many of my colleagues were landing jobs in "C" and "B" houses. With each audition and each rejection, my confidence and hope waned.<br><br>Three years passed. One afternoon I received a call from an agent in Vienna. He had seen me in the tenor role of Cassio in the opera<i>Othello</i>and had recommended me to Eberhardt Waechter. Herr Waechter was looking for a tenor soloist to complete the ensemble for his upcoming position as director of the Vienna Volksoper.<br><br>Before I boarded the train for Frankfurt, where the audition was to be held, Jeannie and I once again prayed for guidance. We had worked and prepared in every way possible and were trying to be patient. We shared our dream yet again with the Lord and put the outcome in His hands. Just a few hours later I called Jeannie with the miraculous news that I had, indeed, signed a contract. It wasn't until later that I learned that the Volksoper was an "A" house.<br><br>With deep reverence and gratitude, my thoughts turned to the words "Neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts" (Malachi 3:11; see also 3 Nephi 24:11).<br><br>Had I been offered a contract after any of the previous auditions, I would have immediately signed away the next several years of my life. I believe success had been withheld until my voice, my acting ability, and my command of the language had ripened. Even after signing, I had two additional years of preparation before the contract went into effect.<br><h2><b>Principle Five: Allow the Lord to Step Between You and the Devourer</b></h2><br>To introduce this principle, I would like to quote the last verse of one of my favorite hymns:<br><br><i>Be still, my soul: The hour is hast'ning on</i><br><i>When we shall be forever with the Lord,</i><br><i>When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,</i><br><i>Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.</i><br><i>Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,</i><br><i>All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.</i><br>["Be Still, My Soul,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 124]<br><br>I wish I could say that my Viennese premiere had been brilliant, that I had stepped onto the stage and evoked bravos and a standing ovation from the audience. But, as it turned out, even with two years of preparation my nerves got the better of me. My first public performance as a member of the Vienna Volksoper ensemble did not go as well as I had hoped. To make matters even worse, I had to read about my inadequacies in several Viennese newspapers the next day. Every day for two years I had worked on that killer aria. What had gone wrong? The performances that followed went very well indeed, but my dream of "making a big splash" in the international opera scene did not happen. We were devastated, and it took some time before the sting of this experience subsided.<br><br>Over the next few years, however, as I watched some of my colleagues experience the instant stardom for which I had hoped, I began to understand. To my sorrow I often saw their marriages dissolve and families suffer in the wake of long absences born of international singing contracts.<br><br>Who knows what would have happened to me, my marriage, my family, and my eternal welfare if things had happened that quickly? Would I have been spiritually mature enough at that time to say "no" to prestige and wealth if it would have compromised my goals as a father? The Lord knows infinitely better than we do what will help and what will harm us. If we allow Him, He will open doors or shut them hard for our spiritual protection and eternal progress.<br><br>Eventually the international contracts and membership in the Vienna State Opera ensemble did materialize. But in addition to these worldly blessings came great spiritual blessings: being present as my sons grew to maturity, serving the Lord in my calling as bishop, and interviewing each of my sons for their foreign missions--from Austria to the United States.<br><br>I look back with incredible gratitude to a loving Father who, for my own welfare, tempered my ambition and allowed me to wait for success.<br><h2><b>Principle Six: Be Willing to Sacrifice All</b></h2><br>The last principle is, perhaps, the most challenging. The Lord will require sacrifice. He will test our integrity and expect us to make difficult choices. He may ask us to "drop, our net" and walk away from certain situations to follow Him. He will ask us to bless others by freely imparting those material, intellectual, or spiritual gifts that may be ours. This is a refining principle. It is that which moves the metamorphic process from ordinary to extraordinary in the direction of our Savior.<br><br>As a performer, the standards I set for myself long before I began my career were often challenged. There were times when I had to openly object to offensive stage movements or costuming. We must be willing to face ridicule or even dismissal, if need be, in meeting such challenges. Some will be black and white in nature. Others will be very private tests of integrity. All will prepare us to stand in the presence of the Lord without fear or shame.<br><br>As you study and dream, make decisions and plans, remember to make the Lord your partner. Do not allow Satan to plant doubts that can foster a change of heart and foil God's divine plan for you. Allow the Lord to prepare the way as you work hard and wait upon His blessings. Know that there will be disappointments but that all will work for your welfare as you learn sacrifice and charity.<br><br>May I take this opportunity to say how grateful I am to be a part of the Brigham Young University community? Nothing that I have ever done professionally has been as satisfying. To be able to share those things that I have learned and help to further President Kimball's vision of the arts as a teacher and mentor is a source of constant joy in my life. I was deeply touched and inspired by the cast and crew of our recent production of the musical drama<i>Abinadi.</i>How wonderful it was to hear from the stage words of a prophet testifying of the divinity of Christ.<br><br>In closing I would like to sing a medley of LDS hymns arranged by my accompanist, Timothy Doot. I met Tim at the University of Michigan as he was completing a degree in piano performance. He later received his master's degree in performance as well as an MBA from the University of Texas. His wife, Cathy, is with him this morning. She was one of the attending nurses for our only daughter, Sarah-Maria. Sarah spent much of her life in the hospital during the 14 months she was with us on earth. We had the honor of sharing the gospel with Cathy and later introducing her to her husband. One evening Tim and I were discussing the privilege we will all have someday of seeing the face of Christ. We decided to select four hymns that frame this sacred theme. Tim then composed the beautiful arrangement that I will sing for you.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, the day will come indeed, as Paul wrote, when<br><br><i>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</i>[2 Corinthians 5:10]<br><br>When the irrevocable passage of time has swallowed the minutes, hours, days, and years we call our earthly experience and we "lay this mortal by" ("O My Father"); when we look into the eyes of our Savior and fall to our knees at His feet, it is my prayer that we may feel His approval and hear His words "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, my child." This is my greatest desire, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lawrence P.

<h1> Beneath Your Wings - Dieter F. Uchtdorf - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, what a delight it is to be with you today. To feel your spirit and the greatness of this school is uplifting and edifying.<br><br>My wife and I connect in a very personal way to this institution of higher education. No, we never studied here, but our daughter received a master's degree here. As a proud parent, I am not only sharing with you that she graduated summa cum laude, but it is much more impressive and joyful for us as parents that she gave birth to our twin grandsons at the Utah Valley Hospital during the same year. Therefore, my wife and I love Provo. We love BYU. We love to be with you today.<br><br>By the way, all of our children and grandchildren live in Europe. They try to follow the long-standing counsel by the First Presidency to remain in their homelands, working to build the Church in their native countries. Great blessings will come personally to them and to the Church collectively as they heed this counsel. I commend the many of you who will strengthen wards and stakes throughout the world as you return to your countries after receiving such an excellent education here at BYU.<br><br>In 2003 a hundred years of powered flight is being celebrated. The Wright brothers invented the airplane in 1903. Having been a pilot since 1959, only 56 years after the Wright brothers, I selected this historic event to make a connection for my talk today.<br><br>An ancient Greek myth tells the story of Daedalus and Icarus, who made wings from feathers and wax. Over the centuries, many, including Leonardo da Vinci, tried to invent flying machines. In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers made a hot-air balloon rise above Paris. At the end of the 19th century, Otto Lilienthal, a German who flew his own gliders, was killed during a test flight in Berlin.<br><br>On December 17, 1903, a dream of mankind was fulfilled as Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first controlled, powered flight. The distance was about 120 feet, or 37 meters--about half the length of a B-747 jumbo jet--and the duration was about 12 seconds. That's shorter than the time it takes me to climb the stairs leading up to the 747 cockpit.<br><br>Few really believed that it would ever be possible for man to fly like a bird. A commissioner of the U.S. Office of Patents is reputed to have said: "Everything that can be invented has been invented."<sup>1</sup><br><br>In Paris on November 5, 1908, Wilbur Wright said to the Aéro-Club de France:<br><br><i>The desire to fly after the fashion of birds is an ideal handed down to us by our ancestors who, in their gruelling travels across trackless lands in prehistoric times, looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space, at full speed, above all obstacles, on the infinite highway of the air. . . . I confess that, in 1901, I said to my brother Orville that men would not fly for fifty years. . . . I have ever since distrusted myself and have refrained from all prediction.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Wilbur and Orville had parents who encouraged education, religion, and family values. Both brothers had their share of serious illnesses. They went through difficult times of trouble, perplexity, and even despair, wondering if they would ever succeed. They tried different vocations as printers, bicycle repairmen, bicycle manufacturers, and, eventually, aircraft inventors. Throughout their lives whenever they picked a project to work on, they were focused and worked as a team.<br><br>Looking at the geography of their activities, a thought came to me--more on the light side. Just to go from their home in Dayton, Ohio, to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers had to first take a train, then a steamship, then another train, and finally one more voyage by boat. The trip of about 700 miles took the Wrights nine days. No wonder they decided to invent the airplane.<br><br>I know they had their share of frustration and discouragement over "too little time," "too much to do," and "too little success," but stumbling blocks became stepping-stones for them.<br><br>As you might have similar feelings at times, let me assure you that you all have reasons to think beyond the horizon of provinciality because you are a royal generation. Even angels are cheering you on; they know of the great divine potential that lies within you.<br><br>Taking a view from a higher perspective, what Orville and Wilbur Wright brought about was actually only a small step for man compared to the leap for humanity and mankind you are able to bring to pass during your lifetime as you "enter to learn" and "go forth to serve."<br><br>In 1918, on the 11th day of the 11th month at the 11th hour--a time at which we stand this very day and hour as well--the world community was hoping that with the end of World War I, the end had come to all wars. Since the infamous attack of 9/11/2001, as we read the newspaper, watch television, or listen to the news, we almost constantly hear of "wars and rumors of wars" and realize that "the whole earth [is] in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them" (D&amp;amp;C 45:26). But let us remember that God declared, "See that ye be not troubled, for all I have told you must come to pass; but the end is not yet. . . . Behold I speak for mine elect's sake" (JS--M 1:23, 29).<br><br>At BYU you have favorable circumstances and inspired leaders who will help you to be honest with others and yourselves and to "be of good cheer" (John 16:33), to have visions, dreams, and always hope--even for your football team, which is presently on a losing streak.<br><br>Sometimes it is difficult to see what good will come out of your efforts and where the road you are on will lead to. You might even feel like Paul on his way to Rome. In the book of Acts we read that Paul was taken as a prisoner to the capital city of the world's number-one military power. It looked bleak for the Apostle Paul. En route to Rome the ship he was on was caught in a<i>perfect storm,</i>one not made in Hollywood but in the Mediterranean Sea. All their lives were endangered. We read, "And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away" (Acts 27:20).<br><br>How did Paul handle this hopeless situation? Amidst all this commotion, he stood up and said, "Be of good cheer: . . . For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, Saying, Fear not" (Acts 27:22–24). Paul then gave concise instructions that appeared at the moment far removed from a logical problem-solving process. Among other things, he told them to lighten the ship, and they did so by throwing things they cherished overboard. Then "they committed themselves unto the sea . . . , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore" (Acts 27:40).<br><br>Fortunately the guards who were prepared to kill Paul believed his words and followed his counsel. The scripture reports, "And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land" (Acts 27:44).<br><br>There will be times in your lives when you will not know the quick answers for your circumstances. Rely then on the word of God. Your Father in Heaven will always teach you to fear not, but to be of good cheer, to lighten your ship of clutter and focus on the spiritual matters, to commit yourselves to the covenants you made, and to put your sail of righteousness into the wind and head courageously toward the land of your eternal future.<br><br>The Wright brothers committed themselves to do what no one else had ever done before--something numerous highly recognized people had declared was impossible. The Wright brothers took time to do their homework. They were humble and smart enough to appreciate and learn about the work of others who went before. And they tackled the problem line upon line, precept upon precept. They realized that there were three main requirements for a practical flying machine:<br><br><b>First,</b>the pilot had to be able to<i>control the aircraft.</i><br><br><b>Second,</b>the wings had to<i>produce lift.</i><br><br><b>Third,</b>it had to be<i>powered by an engine</i>to stay aloft.<sup>3</sup><br><br>They had their goals defined and worked diligently on them one day at a time. Leonardo da Vinci said, "He turns not back who is bound to a star."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Similar principles and requirements apply to your own journey through life and toward the destination of eternal life. Divine principles have to be learned and lived as you prepare to rise up on the wings of eagles.<br><h2><b>First: You Have to Learn to Control Yourself</b></h2><br>It isn't until you come to a spiritual understanding of who you are that you can begin to take control of yourself. As you learn to control yourself, you will get control of your life. If you want to move the world, you first have to move yourself.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball often quoted an unknown author:<br><br><i>The greatest battle of life is fought out within the silent chambers of the soul. A victory on the inside of a man's heart is worth a hundred conquests on the battlefields of life. To be master of yourself is the best guarantee that you will be master of the situation. Know thyself. The crown of character is self-control.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Be responsive to the counsel of the prophets, seers, and revelators who will help you to reach true self-mastery. Be responsive to the promptings of the Spirit. The Spirit will influence your conscience and help you to refine yourself by working on the little tasks of self-control--like controlling your thoughts, words, and actions, which leads to self-control of your whole self, of mind, body, and spirit. Remember,<i>anger</i>is only one letter short of<i>danger.</i><br><br>Your choices are the mirror of your self-control. They will lead you to your eternal destination if they are made with divine direction and control. Stay morally clean. Keep a clean mind and heart. Your thoughts will determine your actions. Control your thoughts. Don't submit yourself to temptation. Aristotle said, "For what it lies in our power to do, it lies in our power not to do."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Control wisely and select carefully what you will invite via a mouse click or remote control into your home, your dormitory, or your office. Select reading material, movies, TV shows, and any other form of entertainment that bring good, uplifting thoughts rather than unwholesome desires.<br><h2><b>Second: Your Attitude Will Determine Your Lift and Altitude</b></h2><br>Dictionaries describe<i>lift</i>something like the following: "to carry or direct from a lower to a higher position; the power or force available for raising to a new level or altitude; a force acting in an upward direction, opposing the pull of gravity."<br><br>The Psalmist sets the goals even higher: "Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul" (Psalm 25:1), and, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help" (Psalm 121:1). He invites you to fly with the eagles, not to scratch with the chickens.<br><br>Lifting your eyes toward the God of heaven is a process cultivating your own very personal spirituality. It is a desire to live in harmony with the Father; the Son, our Savior; and the Holy Ghost. It is also your ability to be truly "submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon [us], even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>With the right attitude--which, incidentally, is also needed to produce sufficient lift for an airplane--you will be able to effectively communicate with your Heavenly Father, and not to just say your prayers. You will be able to say prayers that will go beyond the ceiling of the room--prayers not filled with trite repetitions or spoken without thinking but filled with your deep yearning to be one with your Father in Heaven.<br><br>Prayer, if given in faith, is acceptable to God at all times. If you ever feel you cannot pray, that is the time when you definitely need to pray. Nephi taught in plainness: "For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit [of God] which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit . . . teacheth him that he must not pray" (2 Nephi 32:8).<br><br>President Harold B. Lee taught: "The sincere prayer of the righteous heart opens to any individual the door to divine wisdom and strength in that for which he righteously seeks."<sup>7</sup><br><br>Obedience assures us an answer to our prayers. We read in the New Testament: "And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight" (1 John 3:22).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith learned in a revelation given to him in Kirtland in 1831: "He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh" (D&amp;amp;C 46:30).<br><br>In order to lift, enhance, and cultivate your relationship with God as His spiritual children, you have the unique opportunity to converse with the supreme source of wisdom and compassion in the universe.<br><br>Daily, simple but sincere and mighty prayers will help you to lift your lives onto a higher spiritual altitude. In your prayers you praise God, give thanks to Him, confess weaknesses, petition needs, and express deep devotion to your Heavenly Father. As you do this, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, you perform a spiritual effort that leads to increased inspiration, revelation, and righteousness--not self-righteousness--and brings the brightness of heaven into your lives.<br><br>This brings back memories from my professional life as an airline captain: departing from a dark and rainy airport, climbing through thick and threatening winter clouds, and then, suddenly, breaking through the cloud tops and steeply gaining altitude into the bright sunshine and into the endless blue sky, feeling free, safe, and home at last. But this beautiful feeling reflects only the smallest part of what you can experience through your daily prayers.<br><br>A word of caution: In aerodynamics, gravity and drag work in<i>opposition</i>to lift. This same important principle has been an integral part of the plan of salvation from the beginning. As Lehi explained: "For it must needs be, that there is an<i>opposition</i>in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11; emphasis added). And King Benjamin warned, "For the natural man is an enemy to God . . .<i>unless</i>he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit" (Mosiah 3:19; emphasis added).<br><br>This leads us to God's great gift to His children: agency.<br><br>Lehi taught this most important doctrine to his children. He said:<br><br><i>The Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the . . . power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:16, 27]<br><br>You have agency and you are free to choose. But there is actually no<i>free</i>agency. Agency has its price. You have to pay the consequences of your choices.<br><br>Like gravity or drag in aerodynamics, agency will collect its fee through accountability--just like the foolish man who chose to step out of the window of a high building had to accept the consequences of his choice. He had to learn the hard way that "it ain't the free fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop."<br><br>Agency is a spiritual matter. Without awareness of alternatives, you could not choose. Agency is so important in your lives that you not only<i>can</i>choose obedience or rebellion but you<i>must.</i>During this life you cannot remain on neutral ground--you cannot abstain from either receiving or rejecting the light from God.<br><br>Human agency was purchased with the price of Christ's suffering. The power of Christ's Atonement overcomes the effect of sin on the condition of wholehearted repentance. Through and by the Savior's universal and infinite Atonement, all have been redeemed from the Fall and have become free forever to act for themselves (see 2 Nephi 2:26).<br><br>By learning to use the gift of agency to make right decisions you will increase your spiritual lift and altitude. You will also quickly recognize one other prime source of spiritual truth: the written word of God.<br><br>Lifting your eyes toward heaven requires an attitude directed upward. With this positive attitude toward life comes the desire to<i>feast</i>"upon the word of Christ" (2 Nephi 31:20)--not to just occasionally nibble on the scriptures or the words of the prophets.<br><br>"Feasting" includes searching, pondering, asking, praying, and living the word of God. Read the holy scriptures as if they were written for you--for they are. Nephi said, "For behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3).<br><br>One powerful scripture in the New Testament, James 1:5, initiated a wonderful process that led to the restoration of all things. May I ask you to take time to feast upon the word of God? It is available 24/7 but should not be treated like a fast-food service. Jesus asked listeners to go home and ponder what He had taught them (see 3 Nephi 17:3). This pondering, feasting, and meditating will help you "know to what source [you] may look for a remission of [your] sins" (2 Nephi 25:26).<br><br>Prayers and feasting upon the word of God are two elements of a heavenward attitude that will also enhance your work ethic and your willingness to serve and lift others. It will help you to carry Church responsibilities with the willingness to magnify your callings without trying to magnify yourself. With this divine attitude you will be more concerned about<i>how</i>you serve rather than<i>where</i>you serve. King Benjamin taught, "I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). And we do this by "lift[ing] up the hands which hang down" (Hebrews 12:12).<br><h2><b>Third: You Need to Find and Trust the True Source of Divine Power</b></h2><br>The Wright brothers needed engine power to make the airplane fly. Without true engine power this machine would have remained static. There would have been no lift, no forward motion to enable flight--no airplane.<br><br>You have an all-encompassing true source of power available to help you reach the purpose of your creation. This is the power of God, exercising a subtle and loving influence in the lives of His children, lifting you and keeping you aloft. It is manifested as the Light of Christ, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The Latin source of the word<i>comforter--com fortis--</i>means "together strong." As the Holy Ghost visits your own spirit, you become stronger than you are by yourself. When you receive the Holy Ghost, you receive strength, power, peace, and comfort.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the Gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Parley P. Pratt stated that the Holy Ghost<br><br><i>inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It develops and invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, invigorates and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is . . . marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>President Marion G. Romney gave us encouragement:<br><br><i>You can make every decision in your life correctly if you can learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This you can do if you will discipline yourself to yield your own feelings to the promptings of the Spirit. Study your problems and prayerfully make a decision. Then take that decision and say to him, in a simple, honest supplication, "Father, I want to make the right decision. I want to do the right thing. This is what I think I should do; let me know if it is the right course." Doing this, you can get the burning in your bosom, if your decision is right. . . . When you learn to walk by the Spirit, you never need to make a mistake.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith talked about the promptings of the Spirit as "sudden strokes of ideas."<sup>11</sup><br><br>The Holy Ghost will make you independent. You need to learn many things during your time at BYU, but if you will learn how to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, all other needful things will fall in place. Through your personal righteousness the Spirit of God will guide you to learn to control yourself, to enhance your attitude, to increase your spiritual altitude, and to find and trust the true source of divine power.<br><br>To stay one more time within the metaphor of flying an aircraft, many things are required to make an airplane fly and fly safely, but the most important thing, as I used to call it, is the "wind beneath your wings." Without it, there is no lift, no climb, no flight into the wild blue yonder or to faraway, beautiful destinations.<br><br>The Holy Ghost will be the wind beneath your wings, placing in your hearts the firm conviction of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and His place in the eternal plan of God, your Eternal Father. Through the Holy Ghost you will know<i>your</i>place in this plan and<i>your</i>divine eternal destination. You will be converted to the Lord, His gospel, and His Church, and you will never fall away. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dieter F.

<h1>n’s Kiss: On the Odd Reasons for Brigham Young’s Excellent University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The great Hungarian concert pianist Andor Földes tells the remarkable story of the watershed moment in his rise to world renown. He was 16 years old and already a veteran of years of intense practice and performance. The pianist Emil von Sauer, Franz Liszt's last surviving pupil, came to Budapest and asked young Andor to play for him. Having listened intently to him playing Bach's Toccata in C Major, von Sauer requested another piece. Andor put all his heart and skill into playing Beethoven's "Pathetique" sonata, then continued with Schumann's "Papillons." Finally, after a long pause, von Sauer slowly rose, took the young man's head into his hands, and kissed him on the forehead. "My son," he said tenderly, "when I was your age I became a student of Liszt. He kissed me on the forehead after my first lesson, saying, 'Take good care of this kiss--it comes from Beethoven, who gave it to me after hearing me play.' I have waited for years to pass on this sacred heritage, and now I feel you deserve it." (From Andor Földes, "Beethoven's Kiss,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>November 1986, 145.)<br><br>Andor Földes rose to the expectation. Beethoven's kiss miraculously lifted him from the high level at which he was performing and put him on a level of real greatness. The incomparable greatness and uniqueness of Beethoven survives in many ways, but none more personally or more powerfully than through the mentoring of those touched by this kiss symbolic of his greatness and uniqueness.<br><br>There is another tradition of incomparable greatness and uniqueness that has been passed on through the touch of masters, and not just masters of artistic and intellectual power but masters of the spirit. Let me describe this particular greatness and uniqueness by referring to and commenting on the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees' mission statement for our institution:<br><br><i>The mission of</i>[BYU]<i>is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued. . . .</i><br><br><i>To succeed in this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets and sustained by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God.</i>[<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University,</i>1]<br><br>The mission statement goes on to say that "in that environment these four major educational goals should prevail." Let me paraphrase those four goals.<br><br><b>First,</b>all teaching and all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God, be centered on the absolute and revealed truths of the gospel, and be in conformity with the procedures of the Lord's church. Consider the implications of the fact that the university is an institutional part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and, thus, of the restoration of the gospel.<br><br><b>Second,</b>the intellectual integrity that can only come through a broad and intense general education must be the primary academic mission of the institution. General education excellence at the university is its main goal, the primary concern of its faculty and use of faculty time and resources, and, along with testimony building, the litmus test of our right to be called "the Lord's university." At a university, pursuing a fine major without pursuing an exceptionally fine general education is a fraud and turns out, in the long run, to be pernicious.<br><br><b>Third,</b>in areas where the university judges it can provide<i>real</i>excellence, instruction in special fields or "majors" is given, grooming BYU graduates who are at the top in these fields.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>a few graduate programs of genuine consequence will be encouraged to give special opportunity for scholarly research and creative endeavor to faculty and students.<br><br>In his famous "second-century" address to the faculty and student body, President Kimball gave a detailed explanation of just what our mission of incomparable greatness and uniqueness is all about (see Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>[Provo: BYU, 1976], 244; see also<i>BYU Studies</i>16, no. 4 (summer 1976), 445–57). President Kimball reminded us that the reason for the very existence of this institution is that it become the world's "educational Everest." If this were not a heady enough goal, President Kimball added to it the Lord's expectation that every graduate of this place have a unique spirit and that we all, faculty and students alike, do brilliantly those things that are done at the few other great universities of the world, and do numerous things<i>better</i>than they are done anywhere else. This is, of course, a warning against what we may call the "instead-of syndrome," where we may erroneously think that because we are unique it is acceptable for us to do some things "instead of" rather than "in addition to" what is expected at the few other great universities. This university is not of the world any more than the Church is of the world, President Kimball reminded us, so that we have no choice but to hold the line as regards gospel values and as regards higher expectations for ourselves. Each of us is to become a<i>certain kind of person</i>, then pass on what we have learned and what we have become. And cynical responses to this ideal are not acceptable.<br><br>There is, of course, the kiss of great teaching that has been passed on to us at Brigham Young's excellent university. And there is, for the teacher, the kiss of the superior student's attitude, discipline, and teachableness. The heritage of this university, from Brothers Dusenberry and Maeser to the present, is its great teachers and superior students--not necessarily its<i>famous</i>ones, but its<i>great</i>ones in refined intellect and hidden treasures of the spirit. If we look in detail at this heritage, if we scrutinize that kiss of greatness and uniqueness that has passed Brigham Young's attitude of spiritual and intellectual excellence down to us, what do we find? I propose that we find a certain<i>kind of mind</i>linking great teachers to superior students in an unbroken chain from 1875 to 2003. This, in fact, is the odd reason for the existence of our institution:<i>to create a certain kind of mind that provides a Beethoven's kiss for those to come</i>. We may call this "Brigham Young's Excellent Mind," and I propose the following as this mind's four chief characteristics:<br><h2><b>1. Brigham Young's Excellent Mind Is Self-Reliant</b></h2><br>I am reminded of the poet e. e. cummings' advice to his students:<br><br><i>To be nobody-but-yourself--in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else--means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting.</i>[From the Ottowa Hills<i>Spectator,</i>26 October 1955, in<i>e. e. cummings: A Miscellany Revised</i>(New York: October House, 1965), 335]<br><br>To be self-reliant is to find the best self you have and, at the same time, to be non–self-destructive. Therefore a great mind relies on itself<i>as it is schooled by the Holy Spirit</i>. President Marion G. Romney used to tell a story about the starving seagulls ("Fable of the Gullible Gull,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>October 1950, 32; quoted in Marion G. Romney, "The Celestial Nature of Self-Reliance,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, 91). Great flocks of Florida gulls were once starving amid plenty. Fishing was good, but the gulls did not know how to fish. Generations of gulls depended on the shrimp fleet to toss them scraps from the nets, but then the fleet moved. The big birds, once so free, never bothered to learn how to fish for themselves and they never taught their children how to fish. Instead, they led their little ones to the shrimp nets. People tend to be like these gulls. They see nothing wrong with picking scraps from spiritual, emotional, and intellectual shrimp fleets. The point is that "the practice of coveting and receiving unearned benefits has now become . . . fixed in our society. . . . This practice, if universally accepted and implemented in any society, will make slaves of its citizens" (Romney, "Celestial Nature," 91).<br><br>Parents make "starving gulls" out of their children by permissiveness, by the way they dole out family resources, and by choosing to avoid conflict rather than do hard teaching. Church members become starving gulls by becoming financially or emotionally dependent on leaders, neighbors, or family members. BYU students become starving gulls by taking the easy way out of reading and studying; by avoiding intellectual difficulty, particularly by being concerned about grades instead of about hard intellectual development; or by being concerned with appearances rather than with the achievement of deep spirituality.<br><br>The development of our minds and hearts depends upon self-reliance, because without this freedom we are in no position to even tell when we are enslaved by false doctrine, mere opinion, or tendentious subjectivism. Both intellectual and spiritual excellence are based upon getting to the frontiers of knowledge and to the edge of our weaknesses so as to explore beyond where one has gone before. Since there is nobody out there, one must rely on oneself in making discoveries and judiciously evaluating the terrain. President Hinckley has reminded us:<br><br><i>The learning process is endless. We must read, we must observe, we must assimilate, and we must ponder that to which we expose our minds. . . . There is nothing quite as invigorating as being able to evaluate and then solve a difficult problem, to grapple with something that seems almost unsolvable and then find a resolution.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Standing for Something</i>(New York: Times Books, 2000), 62]<br><br>The Doctrine and Covenants tells us that there is no such thing as a temporal commandment, that all commandments are spiritual (see D&amp;amp;C 29:34–35). This is true of the intellect as well. All true intellection, all trenchant critical thinking, has to do with spirituality. This passage in the Doctrine and Covenants also tells us that we are to be agents unto ourselves: that is, nobody else is to be the agent for the self. One of the things this means is that whenever we get into a situation that threatens our self-reliance, we will find that our intellectual power and our freedom and our very spirituality are threatened as well.<br><h2><b>2. Brigham Young's Excellent Mind Is Service-Oriented</b></h2><br>There is, of course, nothing really to be gained by self-reliance unless we comply with the eternal nature of things. The eternal nature of things demands that we use our developed gifts to bless the lives of others--to heed the divine dictum to those who<i>have</i>to help those who<i>have not</i>. If we were to think of Jacob's advice to the Nephites in university terms, we might see that the kind of service that has kissed generations of Brigham Young's excellent students goes something like this: "Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your<i>learning</i>, that they may be<i>rich in learning</i>like unto you. . . . And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain<i>intellectual riches,</i>if ye seek them, and<i>ye shall seek them with the intent to do good</i>" (see Jacob 2:17–19).<br><br>It might be exaggerated to assert that the<i>only</i>reason for an excellent person to seek learning is to serve others, but certainly we do not seek learning to serve mammon, to gain power and authority rather than to help and nurture, and never merely to get a job. The point is that service is not something we endure on this earth so that we may receive a reward. Service--especially that able to be rendered by the intellectually and spiritually competent--must become the very fiber of our being, that which we naturally provide others by the nature of true learning. The intellectually astute know that there is an interdependence between those who have and those who have not. The process of serving exalts the poor and humbles the rich. In the process both are sanctified. The poor in mind, released from the bondage and limitations of intellectual poverty, are enabled as free people to rise to their full potential so that they can provide the kiss of excellence to others. The rich in mind, by imparting of their gifts and attainments, participate in the eternal principle of giving. Once a person has been made whole, or self-reliant, that person reaches out to serve others and then the cycle of spirituality repeats itself.<br><br>Now there is a tendency toward<i>zeal without service</i>among the worldly and the naïve. You know that zealots are moralists who feel so confident and comfortable in the superiority and self-centeredness of their particular code that they turn their efforts toward improving the moral scene around them. Religious zealots we know about. It is the<i>secular</i>zealots of whom Brigham Young's excellently trained minds need to be most wary. A secular zealot is a person who sees so clearly what is right in terms of the world's assumptions that he or she is driven to convert others, especially the religiously committed, to give the poor benighted masses what they need if the world is to be saved. These are the crusaders par excellence, and, although they can do much good for society, they can easily go to extremes and become obsessed with particular causes for which there is no real transcendent basis. The secular zealot sees public issues as manifestations of the need for reform, based upon both noneternal principles<i>and</i>less-than-<br>complete empirical evidence. Causes espoused vary from one time and place to another, but watch for the clues in political and sectarian discourse: an underlying belief formulated without specific evidence but presented as though it were based upon all the facts; a proliferation of the words<i>should</i>and<i>ought;</i>and an appeal to "secular authority" (as though that weren't a classical contradiction in terms). We know how dangerous a person with a little authority, as they suppose, can be. What is essential in Brigham Young's excellent mind is service undergirded by the transcendent rather than the momentary or the local, by the eternal rather than by media-centered or one-upmanship zealotry.<br><h2><b>3. Brigham Young's Excellent Mind Is Literate</b></h2><br>The essential, indispensable means to education is literacy--not the mere functional literacy of the ability to read and write but the high literacy of precision and range in thinking and expression. Great teachers do not tolerate the least technical flaw in students' expression, and neither do superior students. Here is the reason why. A mutual relationship exists between language and thought. It is a relationship that is often recognized but more often ignored. George Orwell once observed that language "becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, [and] the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts" ("Politics and the English Language,"<i>Horizon</i>13, no. 76 [April 1946]: 253; also in<i>Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays</i>[New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1950], 77). This was written before the dominance of television and film, which has given us more reason to ponder his forebodings. It does not require too much effort to see that we are living in a world in which the image on the screen threatens to displace the written word.<br><br>Now the image is important and rightly powerful, and our emotional and aesthetic lives would be much poorer without it. But there is a differential limitation and strength between the image and written language. What I mean can be understood as we remember that communication functions by arousal, expression, and statement. The visual image, being denotative, is powerful as a means of arousal. Its expressive potential is less reliable. Its capacity for statement, unaided by language or contextual code, is very low, immeasurably lower than words. Arousal and limited expressiveness is common to all functioning animals, but the ability of words to make statements is distinctively human. I might exaggerate if I were to say that if you cannot write it you do not know it, but I am painfully accurate in saying that the weakening of written language through displacement by the image is a fundamental threat to virtually everything that is distinctively human, especially knowledge and intellect. Reliance on the image is a threat to the extension and development of the human capacity for precision of thought and for the ability to creatively manipulate connotative structures. Sophistication in languages is the fundamental trait of the true intellectual. The mind of Brigham Young's excellent university will be characterized by<i>genuine literacy, by precision and range in language and thought</i>. This bears sibling relationship to what Brigham Young meant by "learn everything that the children of men know, and be prepared for the most refined society upon the face of the earth" (<i>JD</i>16:77).<br><h2><b>4. Brigham Young's Excellent Mind Is Realistic</b></h2><br>By "realistic" I mean that an excellent mind takes things for what they are by nature, without confusing the world's ideas, standards, and definitions of things with eternal verities. Think of this story told by the great Native American actor Iron Eyes Cody.<br><br><i>Many years ago, Indian braves would go away in solitude to prepare for manhood. One hiked into a beautiful valley, green with trees, bright with flowers. There, as he looked up at the surrounding mountains, he noticed one rugged peak, capped with dazzling snow.</i><br><br>I will test myself against that mountain,<i>he thought. He put on his buffalo-hide shirt, threw his blanket over his shoulders, and set off to climb the pinnacle.</i><br><br><i>When he reached the top, he stood on the rim of the world. He could see forever, and his heart swelled with pride. Then he heard a rustle at his feet. Looking down, he saw a snake. Before he could move, the snake spoke.</i><br><br><i>"I am about to die," said the snake. "It is too cold for me up here, and there is no food. Put me under your shirt and take me down to the valley."</i><br><br><i>"No," said the youth. "I know your kind. You are a rattlesnake. If I pick you up you will bite and your bite will kill me."</i><br><br><i>"Not so," said the snake. "I will treat you differently. If you do this for me, I will not harm you."</i><br><br><i>The youth resisted awhile, but this was a very persuasive snake. At last the youth tucked it under his shirt and carried it down to the valley. There he laid it down gently. Suddenly the snake coiled, rattled and leaped, biting him on the leg.</i><br><br><i>"But you promised--" cried the youth.</i><br><br><i>"You knew what I was when you picked me up," said the snake as it slithered away.</i>[In Iron Eyes Cody, "But You Promised,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>June 1989, 131]<br><br>There are many contemporary snakes that would trick us into thinking they have a different nature than they really do. Perhaps the snakiest things in the grass of our times are transitory ideas that are taken to be<i>permanently real</i>, especially materialist and subjectivist ideas breathlessly propounded in the world today. It is because of this worldly trickery, among other reasons, that, as President Hinckley says, "we cannot afford to stop learning and growing and progressing. We must not rest in our personal development--development that is emotional and spiritual as well as mental. There is so much to learn and so little time in which to learn it" (<i>Standing for Something,</i>62).<br><br>One of the matters most clearly revealed through the restoration of the gospel is that this mountain of knowledge of truth, beauty, and goodness partakes of the<i>real</i>rather than the<i>transitory</i>. A knowledgeable person knows the difference between what is true and what is only transitory opinion. A true intellectual has the knowledge of transcendental facts requisite to distinguish the true nature of ideas, whether they are real or merely opinion. Those who buy into the<i>momentary</i>without knowledge of the<i>permanent</i>are the true anti-intellectuals of our day, or of any other, and are given to being persuaded by the snakes of our society. As President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>People entangled in sin</i>[or wrong ideas]<i>are not free. In this university . . . there will be real individual freedom. Freedom from worldly ideologies and concepts unshackles man far more than he knows. It is the truth that sets men free.</i>[<i>The Second Century</i>, 246]<br><br>I am reminded of something Harold Macmillan--British prime minister from 1957 to 1963 and chancellor of Oxford University from 1960 to 1986--is supposed to have said. Recalling a professor's advice, his words were: "Nothing you learn here at Oxford will be of the slightest possible use to you later, save only this: that if you work hard and intelligently, you should be able to detect when a man is talking rot. And that is the main, if not the sole, purpose of education."<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>As a way of bringing together these thoughts on the fourfold characteristic makeup of the mind we are supposed to be creating at Brigham Young University, I refer to Doctrine and Covenants 88:33. In this passage Heavenly Father makes it clear that it is our responsibility to develop and use our talents. We must do this so that others can see our good works and so that we glorify God (see Matthew 5:16). That is the reason for our Brigham Young University education and, ultimately, the<i>only</i>reason for it. It is wise for us to consider that developing talents, intellectual prowess, and spiritual power is antimaterialist and takes backbreaking hard work. Often that hard work involves overcoming our weaknesses so that we can develop strengths (see Ether 12:27).<br><br>President Heber J. Grant's personal motto might serve each of us as well as it did him. Attributed to Emerson, President Grant often used this quote: "That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing is changed, but that our power to do is increased" (<i>GS,</i>355). My own sense of this university and our place in it drives me to conclude that it might be right for us all to work harder at the permanent value of celestial education, especially at the testimony-building and general education efforts of the Lord's university. I quote President Kimball in this regard:<br><br><i>As the pursuit of excellence continues on this campus . . . we must remember the great lesson taught to Oliver Cowdery, who desired a special outcome--just as we desire a remarkable blessing and outcome for BYU. . . . Oliver Cowdery wished to be able to translate with ease and without real effort. He was reminded that he erred, in that he "took no thought save it was to ask" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). We must do more than ask the Lord for excellence. Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence. We must do more than pray for these outcomes . . . , though we must surely pray. We must take thought. We must make effort. We must be patient. We must be professional. We must be spiritual.</i>[<i>The Second Century,</i>253]<br><br>The high and holy mind I have described today understands, just as Brigham Young's excellent minds always have, exactly what the long-standing motto of this university means. It says, "Enter to learn; go forth to<i>serve."</i>It does not say, "Enter to learn; go forth to<i>earn."</i>Our motives must be purer than they sometimes are. We must be able to provide Brigham Young's kiss of excellence because we are<i>expected</i>to pass it on, and also because it just happens to be the right thing to do. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Larry H.

<h1> Born to Lead, You Were Born for Glory - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I pray that the Spirit will speak to each of you who is ready to hear what the Lord wishes you to hear. For I am not the teacher--He is.<br><br>Two Christmases ago I went out to my car one evening to find the passenger window smashed and my briefcase stolen with everything in it--money, credit cards, all of my ID (including the passport that had taken me to 50 countries), and irreplaceable documents. I was beside myself. Hoping the thieves had stolen the money and discarded everything else, a friend and I spent all night prowling through area dumpsters, hoping to find something. But we found nothing.<br><br>The next day I began the tedious process of replacing the contents. Suffice it to say, the whole process was a pain. Then, unexpectedly, two mornings later, my phone rang at 3:00 a.m. It was a Church operator.<br><br>"Sister Dew, did you lose a briefcase?"<br><br>"Yes," I answered.<br><br>"I have a man on the line who says he found it in a dumpster behind a bar. Been to any bars lately, Sister Dew?" Laughing at her own joke, she connected me with this man whose pickup, as it turned out, had been robbed that night and who had been going through dumpsters. In one he had found a briefcase.<i>My briefcase.</i>When I asked how he had tracked me down, he replied, "When I looked inside the briefcase and saw that Mormon recommendation, I knew this must be important."<br><br>He was referring, of course, to my temple recommend. He had then called the Church number, where the operator on duty knew how to reach me.<br><br>The phrase<i>Mormon recommendation</i>instantly reminded me of Mormon's tender words to his son Moroni: "I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved" (Moroni 9:22). I have often pondered what it would mean to be recommended to God.<br><br>In essence, every time we qualify for a temple recommend, our priesthood leaders are doing just that. But on this subject of recommendation there is another dimension to consider. For God our Father and His Son Jesus Christ, with Their perfect foreknowledge, already recommended every one of you to fill your mortal probation during the most decisive period in the history of the world. You are here now because you were elected to be here now (see 1 Peter 1:2).<br><br>This is not new news. You have been told countless times that you are a chosen generation reserved for the latter part of the latter days. Just two months ago, in general conference, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2003/11/an-ensign-to-the-nations-a-light-to-the-world?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">President Gordon B. Hinckley said once again</a></span>: "You are the best generation we have ever had" ("An Ensign to the Nations, a Light to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2003, 84). It's akin to being chosen to run the last leg of a relay, where the coach always positions his strongest runner.<br><br>You were recommended to help run the last leg of the relay that began with Adam and Eve because your premortal spiritual valor indicated you would have the courage and the determination to face the world at its worst, to do combat with the evil one during his heyday, and, in spite of it all, to be fearless in building the kingdom of God.<br><br>You simply<i>must</i>understand this, because you were born to lead by virtue of who you are, the covenants you have made, and the fact that you are here now in the 11th hour.<br><br>You were born to lead as mothers and fathers, because nowhere is righteous leadership more crucial than in the family. You were born to lead as priesthood and auxiliary leaders; as heads of communities, companies, and even nations. You were born to lead as men and women willing "to stand as witnesses of God at<i>all times</i>and in<i>all things,</i>and in<i>all places,"</i>because that's what a true leader does (Mosiah 18:9; emphasis added).<br><br><i>You were born to lead,</i>and, in the words of Isaiah,<i>you were born for glory</i>(see Isaiah 62:2–3).<br><br>Now the glorious but sobering truth is that, in spite of your aeons of premortal preparation, the days ahead will at times "wrench your very heart strings," as the Prophet Joseph told the Twelve (in John Taylor,<i>JD</i>24:197). If you've hoped to passively, comfortably live out your lives, let me burst that little bubble once and for all. Now, please, do not misunderstand me: This is a magnificent time to live! It is a time, <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/11/privileges-and-responsibilities-of-sisters?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">said President Spencer W. Kimball</span></a>, when our influence "can be tenfold what it might be in more tranquil times" ("Privileges and Responsibilities of Sisters,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1978, 103). The strongest runner<i>wants</i>to run the last leg of the relay.<br><br>But the last days are not for the faint of heart or the spiritually out of shape. There will be days when you feel defeated, exhausted, and plain old beat-up by life's whiplash. People you love will disappoint you--and you will disappoint them. You'll probably struggle with some kind of mortal appetite. Some days it will feel as though the veil between heaven and earth is made of reinforced concrete. And you may even face a crisis of faith. In fact, you can count on trials that test your testimony and your faith.<br><br>Aren't you glad I came bearing such optimistic news? Actually, I am nothing if not optimistic about you, for everything about your lives is an indicator of our Father's remarkable respect for you. He recommended you for now, when the stakes are so high. Now is the day when His kingdom is being established once and for all, never again to be taken from the earth. This is the last leg of the relay. This is when He needs His strongest runners.<br><br>The simple fact is that our Father did not recommend Eve or Moses or Nephi or countless other magnificent exemplars for this dispensation--He recommended you and me. Do you think God would have left the last days to chance by sending men and women He couldn't count on? A common theme of patriarchal blessings given to men and women your age is that you were sent now because our Father's most trustworthy children would be needed in the final, decisive battle for righteousness. That is who you are, and it is who you have always been.<br><br>So how will you live up to our Father's recommendation? Happily, though we must each walk through life on our own, we don't have to do it alone. Four principles explain why:<br><br><b>First,</b>God wants a powerful people.<br><br><b>Second,</b>He gives His power to those who are faithful.<br><br><b>Third,</b>we have a sacred obligation to seek after the power of God and then to use that power as He directs.<br><br><b>Fourth,</b>when we have the power of God with us, nothing is impossible.<br><br>I repeat, God wants a powerful people. Ammon taught that "a man may have great<i>power</i>given him from God" (Mosiah 8:16; emphasis added), and Nephi prophesied that we of the latter days would be "armed with ... the<i>power</i>of God in great glory" (1 Nephi 14:14; emphasis added).<br><br>There are many evidences that God wants a powerful people. This is one reason that at baptism we become eligible to receive "the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost" (1 Nephi 13:37) and the privilege of constant access to the third member of the Godhead.<br><br>This is one reason that 12-year-old boys may be ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood, which holds "the key of the ministering of angels" (D&amp;amp;C 84:26).<br><br>This is one reason<i>every</i>worthy adult may go to the temple, from which he or she emerges surrounded and protected by God's power (see D&amp;amp;C 109:22).<br><br>God wants a powerful people. No one better understands that Satan is real and that he has power. No one better understands that none of us is smart enough or resilient enough to spar with Satan and survive spiritually. He is a snake, in every sense of that word.<br><br>I hate snakes. I'm terrified of snakes. In fact, I'll go to almost any lengths to avoid even seeing a snake. A few years ago, while visiting the Philippines with its lush, green countryside, I asked a Filipino mission president if there were many snakes in his country. His answer was classic: "Where der is grass, der is snake"--meaning, they were everywhere.<br><br>By the same token, Satan is everywhere today. Where there is any kind of dishonesty, immorality, contention, or addiction, there is Satan. He is in blatant sin, he is in subtle deception. Stay away from him. He is "a roaring lion, [who] walketh about, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8). And he will devour you--unless you "put on the whole armour [or power] of God" (Ephesians 6:11), for the power of God is stronger than the power of Satan.<br><br>Indeed, the power of God and the power of Satan are as different as night and day. Satan's power is temporary and will end--in fact, he's almost out of time. God's power is absolute and endless. Satan uses his power to destroy and damn; God uses His power to bless, sanctify, and exalt. Satan's arrogance blinds him; God is all seeing and all knowing. Satan abandons those he spiritually maims, whereas God has promised to make all of His faithful children "joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17).<br><br>There is only one thing the power of God and the power of Satan have in common: Neither can influence us unless we allow them to. The devil can't make us do anything. Said the Prophet Joseph: "Satan cannot seduce us by his enticements unless we in our hearts consent and yield" (<i>The Words of Joseph Smith,</i>ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook [Orem, Utah: Grandin Book Company, 1991], 65). On the other hand, although God<i>could</i>manipulate us, He never has and never will. We "are free to choose ... eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the ... power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:27). In short, the kind of power operating in our lives is entirely up to us.<br><br>If God wants a powerful people who can withstand the wiles of the devil--and He does--and if we were born to lead in these latter days--and we were--then we need to understand how God makes His power available to us and how we gain access to that power.<br><br>Let's review five ways God makes His power available.<br><h2><strong>Number 1: There Is Power in the Word of God</strong></h2><br>Alma and the sons of Mosiah learned that the preaching of the word--meaning the gospel of Jesus Christ--has a "more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than ... anything else" (Alma 31:5). There is power in the word to heal our wounded souls (see Jacob 2:8), to help us overcome temptation (see 1 Nephi 11:25), to prompt us to repent (see Jarom 1:12), to humble us (see Alma 32:14), to help us overcome the natural man (see Mosiah 3:19), to bring about a mighty change in our hearts (see Alma 5:13), and to lead us to Christ.<br><br><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/11/little-children?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #33cccc;">President Boyd K. Packer taught</span></a>:<br><br><i>True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior.</i><br><br><i>The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior.</i>["Little Children,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, 17]<br><br>In other words, the word of God can transform us.<br><br>I have a lifelong friend whose teenage tampering with pornography evolved into a deadly addiction, and for years it has ruled him and ravaged his marriage. Frankly, I had lost hope that he would ever really change.<br><br>And then, a year ago, a remarkable sequence of events began to unfold. He began to study the scriptures for the first time since his mission. The word of God pierced his heart, and he knew he had to repent--which involved heart-wrenching confessions and subsequent excommunication. Now he is working his way back by immersing himself in the gospel as never before.<br><br>He wrote me this recently:<br><br><i>It was when I began to study the gospel that I realized I had been under Satan's power for years. When I finally got on my knees, pleaded for help to change, and surrendered my sins to the Lord, my world turned upside down. This past year has been a crash course in the ways of God and His Son. It has been the most difficult but wonderful year of my life. I wish I could tell everyone who is in a situation like I was to not be afraid to surrender to the Lord. They will find joy like never before in His Atonement. They will feel the Father wrap His arms around them. They will discover there is power in the gospel to really change.</i><br><br>Some may be skeptical about this man's transformation, believing that "once addicted, always addicted." But that is not true. The gospel has the power to cleanse and make new, because the word "is quick and powerful," it "divide[s] asunder all the cunning ... of the devil," and it "lead[s] the man of Christ" home (Helaman 3:29). The Atonement is real. My friend is evidence of that. His great change is the change that comes with conversion.<br><br>Do you know what we believe? Do you know there is power in the doctrine of Christ to change and overcome weakness? Do you realize that the scriptures contain the answer to every life dilemma? A casual understanding of the gospel will not sustain you through the days ahead, which is why it is imperative that you immerse yourself in the word of God.<br><br>This spring I spent two weeks at the United Nations as a White House delegate to an international commission. As I listened to women from around the world debate complex social problems, I didn't hear them raise one issue that couldn't be solved by living the gospel. Not one.<br><br>There is power in the word.<br><h2><b>Number 2: There Is Power in the Gift of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>The gift of the Holy Ghost is a gift of power. The Holy Ghost inspires and heals, guides and warns, enhances our natural capacities, inspires charity and humility, makes us smarter than we are, strengthens us during trials, testifies of the Father and the Son, and shows us "all things" that we should do (2 Nephi 32:5). No wonder President Hinckley has said: "There is no greater blessing that can come into our lives than ... the companionship of the Holy Spirit" (Boston Massachusetts Regional Conference, priesthood leadership session, 22 April 1995; quoted in<i>TGBH,</i>259).<br><br>Because the Holy Ghost will show us everything we should do, it only makes sense to learn how He communicates--or to learn the language of revelation. Our challenge is not getting the Lord to speak to us; our challenge is understanding what He has to say (see D&amp;amp;C 6:14).<br><br>I remember a time when I was desperate for guidance on a crucial decision. I had fasted and prayed and been to the temple, but the answer wasn't clear. In frustration I told a friend that I just couldn't get an answer. He responded, simply: "Have you asked the Lord to teach you how He communicates with you?" I hadn't, so I began to pray daily that He would.<br><br>Not long thereafter, while reading about Nephi building the ship, I couldn't help but notice how clearly he understood the Lord's instructions. With that, I began to hunt for scriptural evidences of direct communication between God and man. At each one I made a little red<i>x</i>in the margin of my scriptures. Now, many years later, my scriptures are littered with little red<i>x</i>'s, each an indication that the Lord does communicate with His people--and often. The scriptures are the handbook for the language of revelation. They are our personal Liahona. If you will regularly immerse yourself in the scriptures, you'll get clearer, more frequent answers to your prayers.<br><br>Learning this language takes time. As a young captain charged with leading the Nephite armies, Moroni sent messengers to the prophet Alma, asking him to inquire of the Lord where the armies should go. But in time Moroni received inspiration for his stewardship himself, for he became "a man of a perfect understanding" (Alma 48:11)--suggesting that he learned to speak the language of revelation, perhaps even perfectly.<br><br>What a gift to have access to a pure source of information, a source devoid of flattery or spin-doctoring, "for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not" (Jacob 4:13). The Lord will teach us directly as much truth as we are worthy and willing to learn. As Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught, "There is<i>no limit</i>to the revelations [we] may receive" (<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985], 490; emphasis added).<br><br>Having the Holy Ghost as our constant guide and protector is essential to latter-day leadership, for the gift of the Holy Ghost is a gift of power.<br><h2><b>Number 3: There Is Power in the Priesthood</b></h2><br>By definition, priesthood power is the power and authority of God delegated to men on earth. Those who hold the priesthood have the right to say what the Lord would say if He were here. Whatever they bind on earth is bound in heaven.<br><br>Because the priesthood was restored, we have access to ordinances: baptism and confirmation, sealings and healings and blessings, miracles, and the ministering of angels. Indeed, "the keys of<i>all</i>the spiritual blessings of the church" (D&amp;amp;C 107:18; emphasis added) are available through the power and authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.<br><br>There is<i>power</i>in ordinances. All who are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost are eligible to speak the words of Christ and qualify for eternal life. Those who are endowed with power in the house of the Lord need never face the adversary alone. Couples worthy to be sealed at an altar in that holy house are gifted with power. The power of the priesthood heals, protects, and inoculates every righteous man and woman against the powers of darkness.<br><br>I will never forget an experience in Cali, Colombia. After a long evening of meetings, the presiding officer asked the congregation to remain seated while we departed. But upon the final "amen," several dozen priesthood leaders jumped to their feet and formed two lines, creating a pathway from the chapel to a waiting van outside. As we walked through this sheltered passageway, where priesthood leaders symbolized priesthood power, I was deeply moved by the metaphor. It is the power of the priesthood that marks, clears, and protects the path leading to eternal life. Priesthood power safeguards us from the world, binds heaven and earth, subdues the adversary, blesses and heals, and enables us to triumph over mortality. Every ordinance of the Melchizedek Priesthood helps prepare us to live in the presence of God.<br><br>I am deeply grateful for the power of the priesthood and the gift of having full access to this power, which when used righteously is the only true power on earth.<br><h2><b>Number 4: There Is Power in the House of the Lord</b></h2><br>It is precisely because of priesthood power--the fulness of which is available only in the temple--that we may be endowed with power in the house of the Lord. The Prophet Joseph Smith made this clear at the Kirtland Temple dedication, when he prayed "that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power" (D&amp;amp;C 109:22).<br><br>For years now I have attended the temple frequently. It is a place of refuge and revelation. I could never have handled the pressures of recent years without regular time there. This past year, however, a head-banging, hand-wringing challenge has driven me to attend even more. There have been weeks when the only peace I felt was in the temple. Even still, about six months ago, nine words from 1 Nephi leapt off the page: "And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft" (1 Nephi 18:3). Instantly I knew I needed to spend even more time in the temple. So I have.<br><br>The results have not been what I expected. Although I have received help with the challenge in question, it seems that the Lord simply needed me to be in the temple more where it is easier to learn certain things. That was apparently Nephi's experience as well, for as he went "into the mount oft," the Lord "showed unto [him] great things"--undoubtedly great things of the Spirit.<br><br>In the temple we learn how to deal with Satan, how to live in the world without letting it stain us, how to fulfill our foreordained missions, and how to come into the presence of God. The best place to learn about the temple is in the temple. Our kept covenants will eventually save us. And that is power!<br><h2><b>Number 5: There Is Power in the Atonement of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>Until I was in my thirties, I thought the Atonement was basically for sinners--meaning that it allowed us to repent. But then I suffered a heartbreaking personal loss and began to learn that there was so much more to this sublime doctrine.<br><br>My solution initially to my heartbreak was to exercise so much faith that the Lord would have to give me what I wanted--which was a husband. Believe me, if fasting and prayer and temple attendance automatically resulted in a husband, I'd have one.<br><br>Well, the Lord hasn't even yet given me a husband; but He did heal my heart. And in doing so, He taught me that He not only paid the price for sin but compensated for all of the pain we experience in life. He taught me that because of His Atonement, we have access to His grace, or enabling power--power that frees us from sin; power to be healed emotionally, physically, and spiritually; power to "loose the bands of death" (Alma 7:12); power to turn weakness into strength (see Ether 12:27); and power to receive salvation through faith on His name (see Mosiah 3:19). It is because of the Atonement that, if we build our foundation on Christ, the devil can have no power over us (see Helaman 5:12).<br><br>There is power in God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ--power that we may access through the word, the Holy Ghost, the priesthood, and the ordinances of the holy temple.<br><br>What then must we do to access this power? May I suggest three things?<br><br><i>First of all, have faith.</i>Faith is the first principle of the gospel because faith is a principle of power that influences, to at least some degree, the Lord's intervention in our lives.<br><br>By faith Noah built an ark and saved his posterity, Sara gave birth "when she was past age" (Hebrews 11:11), Moses parted the Red Sea, Alma and Amulek were delivered from captivity, and the sons of Helaman were miraculously preserved.<br><br>"So great was the faith of [the previously insecure] Enoch that ... he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled" (Moses 7:13). So great was the faith of the 14-year-old Joseph that when he went into a grove of trees and asked "in faith, nothing wavering" (James 1:6), the Father and the Son appeared, ushering in the Restoration.<br><br>Faith is a principle of power, which explains why <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_god-shall-give-unto-knowledge-holy-spirit/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">President Hinckley has repeatedly declared</span></a>: "If there is any one thing you and I need in this world it is faith" ("God Shall Give unto You Knowledge by His Holy Spirit,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1973</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1974], 109). Our prophet knows whereof he speaks.<br><br>Soon after President Hinckley was called to serve as a counselor to President Spencer W. Kimball, the health of the prophet and his two other counselors failed, leaving President Hinckley to shoulder the burdens of the presidency alone. At one point he recorded:<br><br><i>"The responsibility I carry frightens me. ... Sometimes I could weep with concern. But there comes the assurance that the Lord put me here for His purpose, and if I will be humble and seek the direction of the Holy Spirit, He will use me ... to accomplish His purposes."</i>[In Sheri Dew,<i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996), 393]<br><br>Throughout his life, President Hinckley's practice has been to simply go forward with faith.<br><br>Prophets ancient and modern stand as witnesses that the Lord will indeed use His matchless power to help us. Surely the brother of Jared's transcendent privilege of seeing the Lord was linked to his expression of faith:<br><br><i>I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones....</i><br><br><i>... O Lord, thou canst do this.</i>[Ether 3:4–5]<br><br>In this instance, as in many others, faith allowed the Lord to do not just what was asked of Him, but much more.<br><br>Challenges that tax our faith are usually opportunities to stretch and strengthen our faith by finding out if we really believe the Lord will help us.<br><br>If your faith is wobbly, if you're not sure the Lord will come to your aid, experiment, put Him to the test: "Even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you" (Alma 32:27). A great place to start is in the scriptures. As Jacob wrote: "We search the prophets, and we have many revelations ... ; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken" (Jacob 4:6).<br><br>Unshaken faith activates the power of God in our lives, "for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men" (Moroni 10:7).<br><br><i>Second, we can increase our access to godly power through repentance and obedience.</i><br><br>Faith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent--or turn away from sins that hold us spiritually captive--and to obey with exactness. Great power follows those who repent and obey.<br><br>Lamoni's father pledged to "give away"<i>all</i>his sins to know God (Alma 22:18). Today I invite you to do the same. What favorite sins, large or small, are you willing to give away--right now, today--to increase your access to the power of God?<br><br>Repentance is, frankly, just plain smart, because sin makes you stupid: Stupid because you are deaf, dumb, and blind to the ways of the Lord. Stupid because habitual sin drives the Spirit away, leaving you outside the protective influence of the Holy Ghost. Stupid because it makes you incapable of drawing upon the powers of heaven. Being stupid costs a lot.<br><br>Sin costs a lot, too. It can cost time, money, peace of mind, progress, self-respect, your integrity and virtue, your family, the trust of those you love, and even your Church membership.<br><br>Sin is just plain stupid. And the cost is off the charts. So repent now. Repent daily. If you want to be sanctified, repentance is not optional.<br><br>Obedience, on the other hand, is brilliant, and its fruits are endless--one of which is happiness. The only way that I know to be happy is to live the gospel.<br><br>It is not possible to sin enough to be happy. It is not possible to buy enough to be happy or to entertain or indulge yourself enough to be happy. Happiness and joy come only when you are living up to who you are. King Benjamin clearly understood this when he admonished us:<br><br><i>Consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For ... they are blessed in all things ... ; and if they hold out faithful to the end ... they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.</i>[Mosiah 2:41]<br><br>Satan no doubt bristles at this principle, for happiness is something the ultimate narcissist will never experience. I have yet to meet the man or woman who is happier because he or she was dishonest or because they were addicted to something or because they were immoral. The Lord blessed us with covenants that keep us on the straight and narrow path because this road less traveled is actually the easier road. It is so much easier to be righteous than to sin.<br><br>This summer I was invited to speak on the subject of the family to a gathering of United Nations diplomats. I agonized over what to say to such a diverse group. In the end I simply shared my personal experience. I explained that my parents had taught me as a child that personal virtue was essential for a happy marriage and family and that in my youth I had made promises to God that I would live a chaste life.<br><br>I then acknowledged that I was about to turn 50 and that, though I had not yet married, I had kept my promise. "It hasn't always been easy to stay morally clean," I admitted, "but it has been far easier than the alternative. I have never spent one second worrying about an unwanted pregnancy or disease. I have never had a moment's anguish because a man used and then discarded me. And when I do marry, I will do so without regret. So you see," I concluded, "I believe a moral life is actually an easier and a happier life."<br><br>I worried about how this sophisticated audience would respond to a message about virtue and abstinence, but much to my surprise they leapt to their feet in applause--not because of me but because the Spirit had borne witness of the truth of that message.<br><br>The happiest people I know are those who repent regularly and obey. They have increased their access to the power of God.<br><br><i>Third, to increase the power of God in our lives we must diligently seek.</i>There is perhaps no more frequent invitation or reassuring promise in all of scripture than this one: "Seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 88:63).<br><br>Notice that God never said, "Seek me a zillion times. Beg again and again and, maybe, just maybe, if you're lucky, I'll help you a little." To the contrary, the two greatest of all beings are ever ready to help us--no call waiting, no voice mail.<br><br>Most of the revelations received by the Prophet Joseph Smith came after diligent seeking, including this magnificent promise:<br><br><i>I, the Lord, ... delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness....</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i><br><br><i>And to them will I reveal all mysteries....</i><br><br><i>And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven....</i><br><br><i>For ... by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:5–10]<br><br>Clearly there is no limit to what the Lord is willing to teach and give us.<br><br>The question, then, for you and me is, How much power do we want to have, and what are we willing to do to obtain it? Heber C. Kimball said:<br><br><i>The greatest torment</i>[the Prophet Joseph]<i>had ... was because this people would not live up to their</i>[spiritual]<i>privileges. ... He said ... he felt ... as though he were pent up in an acorn shell, and all because the people ... would not prepare themselves to receive the rich treasures of wisdom and knowledge that he had to impart. He could have revealed a great many things to us if we had been ready.</i>[<i>JD</i>10:167]<br><br>Spiritual privileges that call forth the powers of heaven are available to all who diligently seek them. God wants a powerful people; but, again, how much power we learn to access is up to each of us.<br><br>The question, then, is: Will you diligently seek? Listen to this classic passage from Alma: "Whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come" (Alma 42:27). Notice that this passage doesn't say that just the popular ones or the smart ones on full scholarship or the ones who got married at 21 may come. It says "whosoever will"--meaning it is our choice.<br><br>Those of you who served missions didn't ask investigators, "Would you like to come to Church? Would you like to be baptized?" Instead you asked, "Will you come? Will you be baptized?"<br><br>So today I ask, "Will you increase your faith? Will you repent and obey? Will you diligently seek? Will you learn to access the power of God so that you can live up to the heavenly recommendation that placed you here now? Will you do what you were born to do?"<br><br>In his last major address as prime minister, and while World War II still raged in the Pacific, Winston Churchill said this to his countrymen:<br><br><i>I told you hard things at the beginning of</i>[this war];<i>you did not shrink, and I should be unworthy of your confidence ... if I did not still cry: Forward, unflinching, unswerving, indomitable, till the whole task is done and the whole world is safe and clean.</i>["Forward, Till the Whole Task Is Done," London BBC radio broadcast, 13 May 1945, in<i>Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat: The Speeches of Winston Churchill,</i>ed. David Cannadine (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1989), 266]<br><br>I told you hard things at the beginning of this message. But I've also brought reassurance that if you will learn to draw upon the power of God, you will not shrink. You will go forward--"unflinching, unswerving, indomitable"--making the world safer and cleaner until you've done everything you were born to do. For you were born to lead. You were born to build Zion. You were born for glory. Everything you do in life should be measured against this grand standard.<br><br><a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_stand-truth/"><span style="color: #33cccc;">President Gordon B. Hinckley said it this way</span></a> at a BYU devotional in September 1996:<br><br><i>Stand strong. ... You can be a leader. You must be a leader, as a member of this Church, in those causes for which this Church stands. ... The adversary of all truth would put into your heart a reluctance to make an effort. Cast that fear aside and be valiant in the cause of truth and righteousness and faith.</i>["Stand Up for Truth,"<i>BYU 1996–97 Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1997), 25–26]<br><br>My dear young friends, I repeat that these are the days in which a true leader wants to live. These are days when opportunities to change lives and even destinies are nearly endless. You are running the anchor leg of the relay because you were born to lead. You were born for glory.<br><br>In conclusion, in the words of Moroni, "I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written" (Ether 12:41) so that you experience for yourself the power in Jesus Christ to strengthen you, to sanctify you, and to help you run this leg of the relay. Don't ever underestimate the power of Jesus Christ to help you. Isaiah said it this way:<br><br><i>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?...</i><br><br><i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength....</i><br><br><i>... They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i>[Isaiah 40:28–31]<br><br>I have learned for myself that this is true--that because of our Father and His Son, we don't have to run this last strenuous leg of the relay alone. We have access to the greatest and grandest of all power. And when we have the power of God with us, we truly can do all things--including everything we were born to do. And we were born to lead. We were born for glory.<br><br>In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sheri L.
