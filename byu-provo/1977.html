<h1>Thee Every Hour” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I received a call from the BYU Music Department just a few days before Christmas requesting the subject of my talk this evening. They wanted to coordinate the music with the topic I had selected. Then in a very nice way, they explained that this was the holiday season and it would be necessary to prepare the music early. If it would be convenient, they wondered if I could fit their theme rather than allow me that privilege. This I agreed to do, and you will notice the music they render at the closing of this service will be, "I Need Thee Every Hour." This is our theme this evening.<br><br>I want to express my appreciation to them for choosing such an appropriate theme to begin a new year. It is a good time to direct our thought to our dependence on our Lord and Savior. Tonight our objective will be to start your new year with thoughts in that direction.<br><br>How great is that need! How total is our dependence on him! To recognize that need every hour is to realize in every aspect the manifold nature of man; we need to be sensitive to the direction of our Lord and Savior.<br><br>Let me begin with a scripture story which, I believe, tells us of our need to have balance in our lives. There is a story in Acts which has always intrigued me. The scripture starts out:<br><br><i>And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest.</i><br><br><i>And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</i>[Acts 9:1–2]<br><br>Now, a most remarkable event occurred to Saul as he was making this journey to find Christians in Damascus. As he was proceeding on his journey,<br><br><i>there shined round about him a light from heaven:</i><br><br><i>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</i><br><br><i>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</i>[You see, not knowing the ways of the Lord, he had to inquire as to what the Lord would have him do.]<i>And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</i><br><br><i>And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</i><br><br><i>And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</i><br><br><i>And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</i>[Notice, he did not say, "What will you have me do?" but, "Here am I, ready to serve."]<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</i><br><br><i>And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</i>[Acts 9:3–12]<br><br>Ananias was shocked at this. He knew Saul. He knew how much evil he had been doing. He knew that he was there with authority to bind and take back to Jerusalem those who professed Christianity. But the Lord just said to him:<br><br><i>Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</i><br><br><i>For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.</i><br><br><i>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</i>[Acts 9:15–17]<br><br>And immediately, just as if scales had fallen from the eyes of Saul, he received his sight and arose and forthwith was baptized.<br><br>Then he asked to receive meat, and he was strengthened. He spent some days with the disciples that were at Damascus. After being trained by them, he went straightway and "Preached [of the Savior] in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God." And "all that heard him were amazed" and wanted to know if this was not the same man who came from Jerusalem with the intent of binding those who would call upon the name of the Savior. "But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the very Christ" (Acts 9:20–22).<br><br>Saul went through a special process of preparing himself for the work that the Lord had called him to do. He had to be prepared<i>physically</i>to receive his sight and strength. He found a need to be<i>emotionally</i>prepared to associate with the disciples. He found a need to be<i>mentally</i>prepared to be taught by Ananias and the other disciples in the way of the Lord. Saul also found a need to be<i>spiritually</i>prepared by having hands laid on his head so he might receive the Holy Ghost. It was when Saul found the need for all aspects of his life to be brought into focus and to be a builder rather than a destroyer that he found purpose to life.<br><br>It is not difficult for me to give my witness concerning the need for all parts of our life to be in harmony and dependent on the Lord. However, in case there should be any who would not trust my witness tonight, I have brought with me three special witnesses. I know the scripture, "But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established" (Matthew 18:16). I have brought with me my special panel of experts tonight to help give witness and testimony to these various aspects of life, and to teach us of our need for our Lord and Savior in all that we do.<br><br>First, our physical needs. The Lord has given us special insight into our physical needs; we have been directed to keep our physical bodies properly functioning to make it possible for the full expression of our spirit. One cannot function properly without the other. We are instructed:<br><br><i>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</i><br><br><i>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</i>[1 Corinthians 6:19–20]<br><br>Let me call my first witness to give you testimony of physical needs. She has distinguished herself in the medical profession as a nurse. She has BYU ties as a former student and as a member of the faculty. My first witness tonight is Barbara Perry.<br><h2><b>Barbara Perry</b></h2><br>There are three areas I would like to address myself to regarding the direction the Lord has given us for our physical well-being. First, we have been instructed in the Doctrine and Covenants concerning the partaking of the proper foods to give our bodies nourishment. "All wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the . . . use of man--every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving" (D&amp;amp;C 89:10–11). Also he designated that the "flesh . . . of beasts and of the fowls of the air" are for the use of man, but "to be used sparingly" (D&amp;amp;C 89:12). All grain is good for the food of man, particularly wheat (see D&amp;amp;C 89:14, 16–17). Nutritionists concur with the recommendations given by the Lord: in fact, the basic four food plan includes: first, cereals and breads; second, fruits and vegetables; third, meat, fish, and poultry; and fourth, milk and dairy products. How many of you follow this food plan and include food from these groups in prescribed amounts in your daily diet? Or does your diet consist of high-caloric, empty foods, such as soft drinks, French fries, and pastries, which contribute more to your waistline than to your health?<br><br>It is particularly important for you girls, as prospective mothers, to eat properly. Being a nurse and involved in the maternity area, I have a special concern here. And nutritionists agree that even more important than adequate nutrients during pregnancy is good nutrition during the mother's own period of growth and development. Such will increase the likelihood that she will enter pregnancy in a state of good health and enhance the probability of a healthy child. Let me encourage you to improve your diet.<br><br>Second, the first instruction given to Adam after eating the fruit of that certain tree was, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Genesis 3:19). Physical exercise becomes an important part of maintaining man's physical body. Our prophets have set the pattern. President Heber J. Grant has made the statement, "I do not know of anything that destroys a person's health more quickly than not working. It seems to me that lazy people die young while those who are ready and willing to labor and who ask the Lord . . . to help them . . ., live to a good old age" (G. Homer Durham, comp.,<i>Gospel Standards,</i>p. 183).<br><br>Our present-day prophet has to be a living example. President Kimball arises early each morning and daily completes a schedule that men half his age would find impossible.<br><br>My husband is one who carries out a program of physical fitness. It consists of an early-morning swim, walks to and from work--this includes coming home for lunch--and the practice of never driving when we can walk.<br><br>We have a nephew presently in the Language Training Mission--in fact, he is here tonight. In high school he was All-State in football and wrestling. The most difficult part of his experience in the LTM is the confinement and the long hours of study without physical activity. He states, "The exercise periods are a welcome relief." Communications to his younger brothers at home are full of instructions and counsel relative to maintaining a fitness program as they prepare for participation in high school athletics. He even expresses concern of his parents. For Christmas he sent them one of those special exercise jump ropes. His message to them was, "So you two won't get fat on me while I am gone." Let me admonish you to take advantage of your opportunities for physical activity on this campus.<br><br>And third, setting an example after six periods of labor in the creation of the earth, as the scriptures record, "On the seventh day I, God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the seventh day from all my work" (Moses 3:2). There was a built-in system from the very beginning to provide a day of rest, a time of renewal, and a recess from everyday activities. Do you take advantage of this special day as a time to rest from your labors? I was always grateful for the Sabbath, particularly when there were some needed tasks that I did not want to do. I could not do them and not feel guilty.<br><br>Then there is that important consideration: What about rest or sleep on a daily basis? I know the typical pattern for many college students. There is little time to sleep; other things take priority. The Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 124, states, "Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated." I have a confession. Prior to my marriage I was consistently a night person. Typically my day ended at twelve or one o'clock, despite the fact that I had to be at work by seven. That has all changed. We still observe the early schedule but I go to bed earlier. Now I wonder how I managed on the other routine.<br><br>We were recently in a home on Saturday night where everything was in preparation for the Sabbath. The children were bathed and shampooed, the house was in order, and dinner preparations were underway. My friend made the comment, "If I don't have order in my home, I am unable to do for others." The same is true of our bodies. To effectively serve our Heavenly Father, we need to be at our peak physically. Let me challenge you, as we begin this new year, to maximize your physical well-being by eating properly, by maintaining an exercise program, and by getting adequate rest.<br><h2><b>Elder Perry</b></h2><br>The second aspect of determining our needs is to achieve social-emotional stability. Let me call my second witness. This is one who distinguished herself as a young child as possessing a happy heart. She was even given a name to match her exciting spirit. The second witness I call is Linda Gay Perry, one of your fellow undergraduate students. Gay.<br><h2><b>Gay Perry</b></h2><br>Those of you who are like me and can hardly wait till this meeting is over can be thankful that there are only four of us here and that our name is Perry and not Packer.<br><br>Have you ever seen the stars up there shining lately? You know, they have been up there gleaming all my life, just patiently listening to my many dreams and urgent wishes. I guess that it is true that some nights I cannot see them, but I know that they are still there, glowing away behind those clouds as brightly as ever. You would think that at some future moment they would run out of sparkle, but they never do.<br><br>I met a great friend a few weeks ago. She was a little aged lady who twinkled herself. She stopped me on the street corner to tell me that it was a beautiful day. I had not noticed. I gazed up at the endless sky and it looked like it would soon rain, but it was a beautiful day. I wished that I could have thanked this lady, but she had disappeared. Instead I said a silent prayer and thanked my Heavenly Father for people like her.<br><br>I guess that everyone appreciates a happy, friendly, and interesting acquaintance. Every person in his own special way must develop within himself at least one trait or talent which he can find the thrill of achieving.<br><br>In junior high school we were all required to take a music class. In this class we all had to audition for the school choir. The teacher would call your name, and you would have to go stand in front of the sneering class, by yourself, and sing what you were asked to. The teacher called out the names Larson, and then Murphy, and then I knew that my time of reckoning was nigh. I started to panic and asked to be excused to get a drink of water. While I was out in the hall, I dreamed up the most elaborate plans for my instant escape. I wanted to run away, but my feet carried me back into class just in time to hear my name read. I walked slowly to the front of the room and was asked to sing one scale. That was all. My voice did not go nearly as high or quite as low as some of the others had, but at least it did not crack. I had wanted to sing more, to prove that I could miraculously do better, but I was told that I could now<i>please</i>take my seat. I was sure that I had not done well enough, but to my surprise, when the list of the choir members was posted, my name was on it. Now, singing is certainly not one of my stronger talents, yet my greatest victory was still to come.<br><br>One afternoon we were in the auditorium practicing for an upcoming concert. We were being arranged on the bleachers according to our height. I was near the top. Our director stood back to evaluate the scene, but she was not satisfied with our appearance. She told the girl who was next to me that she was not quite tall enough to stand on our row. The girl spoke up politely and said, "It helps me to stand here next to Gay because it's easier to get the notes right." At that moment I felt as if I had conquered all doubts.<br><br>Our talents need to be shared and it is through this that we find real happiness. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).<br><br>We need to be aware of others' needs and desires. We need to be sensitive and pray for others as well as for ourselves. My mother used to tell me that when I was little I would pray for everyone I knew and would often fall asleep doing so. She said that I would even pray for the devil that he would know better.<br><br>In everyone's life there are disappointments and temporary setbacks. You may drop your white gloves in a mud puddle, or your teacher might think that your literary masterpiece needs to be rewritten again, or your very most favorite baseball team might lose with two outs in the ninth inning in the seventh game of the World Series. But these tragedies can be overcome with hard work, a positive attitude, and the help and support of others. In the handmade program of the sixth grade's version of Alice in Wonderland, my name was not listed as playing Alice; instead it was listed as portraying the third girl dressed in red. But it did not matter so much to me because my mom was in the audience clapping more loudly than any of the other mothers. The rainbow comes only after the rain. A cheerful heart and a smiling face pour sunshine in the darkest place. When things go wrong, treat yourself to an ice cream cone and start smiling again. With Baskin and Robbins' thirty-one flavors, you can certainly become a well-rounded person.<br><br>I can remember one day at recess we had the whole second grade playing a lively game of Red Rover. The boy I liked more than any other boy in the whole class was it. He stood surveying the situation for a moment, and then he called, "Red Rover, Red Rover, send Gay on over." I took off running as fast as I could. I had to try to make it over to the other side without his catching me. I ran faster than I have ever run before; I guess I learned at an early age to play hard-to-get. This boy came really close, but I ran from one side of the field to the other without being tagged. Success! Unfortunately, I was running too quickly to stop, and I ran right into a barbed-wire fence. It is important that in our lives we do our best and work our hardest to achieve our goals, but we must be certain that the outcome leads us to where we want to be. Our goals must be directed to the future, to happiness, and to perfection. "Happy is that people, whose God is the Lord" (Psalm 144:15).<br><br>And one day when I am eighty or so, I will walk down the street telling those I pass that it is a beautiful day. Or maybe I will not wait till I am eighty. Maybe I will start at eighteen and see how long my sparkle lasts. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Elder Perry</b></h2><br>The next is the mental. The Lord, from the very beginning, commanded us to multiply, replenish, have dominion over, and subdue. He expected us to grow and develop. Essential in this is our mental growth and development. For my third witness, I call a graduate student who has distinguished himself here at this University for many, many, many, many years. My next witness is Lee Perry.<br><h2><b>Lee Perry</b></h2><br>Thank you. If I faint, why don't you catch me, okay? Looking around here tonight, I realize why some people have come to call this place the lions' den. Anyway, welcome back from vacation, lions--or is that cougars?<br><br>My assignment tonight is to talk about mental growth needs, or, more simply, our needs for learning. I think my philosophy can be summarized in a purposeful manipulation of those famous words at the west entrance of this University. My revision would read, "Enter learning, learn, go forth and continue learning." In other words, I consider learning to be a never-ending process. I have not always been a zealous advocate of learning. I was a typical dumb high-school athlete, the typical class-sloughing freshman, the typical marriage-minded RM (though it did not do me much good), even though I deny it and refuse to admit it to almost everybody. I did emerge for a breath of learning every semester in time to cram for finals, but, with the exception of a few days twice a year, I was in a mental coma. Nevertheless, my grades maintained the appearance of excellence; and I was satisfied, even proud, of my nonthinking state.<br><br>My emergence from the rut of a mental stupor is something of a miracle to me. It just so happened that the summer before I entered graduate school I had a great deal of free time I had not expected. To combat the discomforts of prolonged boredom, I finally did something I had not done for a long time: I picked up a book and read it. Fortunately the book was one of those only-put-down-to-sleep kind. I read it in two days. I was very excited, so excited about my accomplishment that I borrowed another book from a friend and read<i>it</i>in two days. From that very humble beginning, I committed myself to be involved in continuously reading unrequired books throughout my graduate school years. And they have been many, many years. I will not say that it has been easy to maintain that commitment, but I have maintained it. I consider reading to be the most important element in effective learning. If your goal is learning, you must commit yourself to reading. If everything else I say tonight is forgotten but you remember the importance of reading, then I will consider this talk to have been a great success.<br><br>Because most of us are students, let us talk about mental growth in the university setting. I want to take the liberty to be prescriptive. I want to prescribe a goal for all of us, namely, that we should be excited about the educative process. At a university this goal has two parts: first, teachers should be excited about teaching; and second, students should be excited about learning. What kind of teacher is excited about teaching? Or what are the attributes of an exciting teacher? Let us make an abbreviated list.<br><br>1. A teacher should be an interested and informed advocate of his chosen field of study. This is a given; it almost goes without saying.<br><br>2. A teacher should ask questions and not simply transmit<i>his</i>answers. This attribute subsumes a teacher's commitment to truth and an openness to new answers that he may not have previously considered. Also included is a touch of the socratic method. I had a professor last year who embodied this particular attribute. He came in the first day asking questions, destroying the endeared notions of me and my fellow classmates. He demanded that we build new premises we subsequently questioned, destroyed, and rebuilt. The cycle continued throughout the entire semester. I thought I was the dumbest kid at BYU until the final day of class, when this teacher told me that my intellectual toil and tribulation had been fruitful, saying, "I've appreciated your work."<br><br>3. A teacher should adapt his teaching to the situation. I enrolled in a statistics class. Even now I am not a statistician; I was afraid the class would be beyond my grasp, but at the same time I had a teacher who anticipated my apprehension. He realized that what I wanted from his class was a tool, not a profession. He designed his class, writing a special text, to satisfy my needs; and I learned.<br><br>4. A teacher should care that his students learn. My last final this past semester was in an MBA economics class. For some very complicated reasons I had to take the exam a day late, with one other student. The first problem was worth thirty points. I read it once; I read it twice; I read it over and over until I realized that I had no idea how to do it. I panicked, but decided I had better finish the rest of the exam, which I did. After two hours, this economics professor returned and asked me how I was doing. I was reluctant to say, obviously, but finally explained my dilemma. He was very understanding; he asked me some questions to see what I really knew; he gave me a hint. I went as far as I could, struggled, and panicked again. He looked at my work and suggested I do one more thing. I did and, to my surprise, the problem was solved. I felt like I owed him my life. I thanked him, and then he said, "There is no need to thank me. That exam taught you something, and, after all, that is what we're here for--to learn."<br><br>My final words about teaching come from a statement entitled "True Education Must Be Put to Use for Human Benefit," by John Taylor. He said,<br><br><i>I will tell you my idea of true intelligence and true eloquence. It is not as some people do to take a very small idea and use a great many</i>[rhetorical]<i>words without meaning something to befog and mystify it with something to tickle the ear and please the imagination only. That is not true intelligence. But it is true intelligence for a man to take a subject that is mysterious and great in itself, and to unfold and simplify it so that a child can understand it.</i>[G. Homer Durham, comp.,<i>The Gospel Kingdom,</i>p. 270]<br><br>Now, briefly, let us talk about some attributes of students who are excited about learning.<br><br>1. The excited student realizes that the responsibility for learning is his own. As recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 58, verse 28: "For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves."<br><br>2. An excited learner is humble. I can tell fifty stories about how pride has impeded my intellectual growth and modesty has stimulated it. We need to be keenly aware of how much we don't know before we can do anything about it.<br><br>3. An excited student learns offensively, and not defensively. (When I originally wrote this, I wrote, "An excited student is offensive about learning," but that did not sound right.) In other words, he senses his mission to be one of expanding the parameters of knowledge instead of protecting his already-formulated ideas about the world. Employing an appropriate seasonal analogy, a bit of truth is much like a very small present wrapped in many layers of newspaper in a very large box. When we look at the box, our perceptions of the gift are distorted. After we open the box and peel away layer after layer of wrapping, our perceptions gradually improve. Nevertheless, we do not completely understand what the present is until the final layer of wrapping is removed. Peeling off the layers of fallacy is usually far more tedious. Dogmas have remained because persons have defended them, or at least the traces of truth which underlie them, without removing the many layers of fallacy. Never defend an idea simply because it exists. Discover whether it is right or wrong.<br><br>4. An excited learner is disciplined. We live in a time of rapidly expanding knowledge--the age of future shock. If the intent of the learner is to stay current with new ideas, learning requires a day-after-day, disciplined effort. Block out hours of time every day in which studying is the overriding priority. Before you can become excited about learning, you need to learn something to get excited about.<br><br>In conclusion, I would like to tie everything together by reading from the 130<sup>th</sup>section of the Doctrine and Covenants, eighteenth and nineteenth verses:<br><br><i>Whatsoever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><br><br>I say these things humbly, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Elder Perry</b></h2><br>Thank you, family, for participating with me. It was not easy to convince them to appear tonight. Thank goodness we have had the holidays for me to work on them. My children kept saying, "It's difficult enough being a child of a General Authority without having to be put on display." But, obedient to their father, they have accepted their assignment.<br><br>Now, the final aspect of life I have reserved for myself--the spiritual. There was a Sunday School lesson taught back in the early 1950s which I have never forgotten. The lesson stated this: "For a wise and glorious purpose, we lose at birth all remembrances of our previous life and experiences. But for our guidance upon earth, God has graciously revealed certain truths about our former existence. Your lineage is divine. Your pedigree begins with God, the Eternal Father. There is within you an immortal spirit that existed as an intelligent being before your earthly body was formed and that will continue to exist after your mortal body has gone to the grave. Your spirit body was born to heavenly parents as one of their begotten children in a previous, heavenly abode. Thus God is actually and literally the father of your spirit body."<br><br>Brigham Young has added his witness by saying,<br><br><i>Things were first created spiritually; the Father actually begat the spirits, and they were brought forth and lived with him. . . .</i><br><br><i>There is not a person here today but what is a son or a daughter of that Being. . . .</i><br><br><i>We are the sons and daughters of celestial Beings, and the germ of the Deity dwells within us.</i>[John A. Widtsoe,<i>Discourses of Brigham Young,</i>p. 50]<br><br>Once we understand and accept this doctrine our lives can never be the same again, for we must think and act as eternal beings. God's law then governs our actions. The beautiful plan of salvation becomes our road map and guide to lead us through our mortal existence. I give you my witness: there is exceeding joy to be found in having a spiritual base to your life. There is no way to find real happiness without it.<br><br>In conclusion, let me tell you about a personal planning cycle I developed about the time that I was ending my formal education, with the hope that it will cause you to seriously reflect and plan the future. I was a little older than most when I graduated form college; a mission and World War II had slowed the process. I graduated from college just a few months before my twenty-seventh birthday. I was married, and the first child was on its way. Family responsibility has a special way of bringing a maturing process. I decided if I was to accomplish my life's objective I needed to form a plan and review my performance regularly against the determined plan. My decision was that I would hold an annual review on each of my birthdays to evaluate my progress. On my twenty-seventh birthday my first plan was prepared. On my twenty-eighth birthday I made my first annual performance evaluation and plan revision. This I have carried out each year until the present. The plan includes the same ingredients we have discussed here tonight. First, a physical plan: it is near my birthday each year that I go to the doctor and have an annual physical examination. My plan includes some established goals for an active and restive pulse rate, a blood pressure reading, and a weight range. Annually I check my performance in my physical plan.<br><br>My physical plan also includes a financial plan. I wanted to have thirty years of accumulation where I could become financially independent. My plan at the end of those thirty years was to be in a position where I could call the shots, be flexible, do what I wanted to accomplish. I would be able to fill a second mission, or to devote my time to community service or education. Each year I would prepare a personal balance sheet to evaluate my progress toward achieving this objective.<br><br>Second, I would evaluate my relationships with my wife, my children, my friends, and my business associates. I was continually asking the question, "What kind of an influence in the world am I for teaching righteous principles?" I wanted to be balanced socially and emotionally.<br><br>Third, I established a study program to improve my mind. I would mark a calendar each year with my study objectives of how many chapters I would read each day in a 365-day year. I am afraid that in my early years I was moving too much toward the objectives of my professional life. Now my program has changed, because I have discovered the great value of the scriptures. My program now is to read two chapters in the scriptures first thing every morning. By so doing I can cover the Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the New Testament each year.<br><br>Fourth, each year I gave myself a very careful temple worthiness interview. I would ask myself the questions, "Am I morally clean?" "Do I live the Word of Wisdom?" "Am I honest in paying my tithes and offerings?" "Am I regular in my attendance at my priesthood and sacrament meetings?" "Am I keeping my life in harmony with the principles of the gospel?" "Do I sustain my stake president?" "Do I sustain the prophet of the Lord?" "Is my testimony of the Lord and Savior vital, alive, and an active force in my life?" This process has had me focusing in a special way each year on what I wanted to accomplish within the time allotted to me in my mortal experience. Each year I would feel the thrill of accomplishment, but more strongly the determination to do better.<br><br>I remember many years ago, when we lived in New York, coming back to Utah on vacation and stopping to visit a ninety-one-year-old aunt of my wife's. She lived alone in a small but comfortable home. At her age, she was completely self-reliant. Her home was clean and orderly; her house was filled with beautiful plants, so well cared for. Around one chair we found the well-used scriptures and other church publications. In our conversations with her we were amazed at her knowledge of current events. At the end of our visit she taught us a great lesson. She said, as we prepared to leave, "You know, I have found in life that it is not enough just to<i>do</i>. You also have to<i>be</i>." I encourage you tonight to<i>be</i>. Be physically strong, living the Lord's code of health, making even more dramatic the difference between the children of the Lord and the children of the world. Be socially and emotionally acceptable to those you are privileged to associate with, and be comfortable in their presence. Show some life, some spirit, and some enthusiasm as you go about your activities each day.<br><br>Grow mentally each day. Prepare yourself for the eternities to come. Be close to the Lord. Understand the potential within you as one of his spirit children. I encourage you to start this new year with a plan, with new goals, with new objectives, to lift yourself physically, socially-emotionally, mentally, and spiritually to newer heights on your eternal course toward eternal life.<br><br>Again we would encourage you to recognize: "I Need Thee Every Hour," in every aspect of a life based on his plan, his law, and his way.<br><br>I give you my witness, his way is the right way, the only way that will lead us to life eternal. May the Lord's choicest blessings attend you in this special and new year which is before us. God lives; Jesus is the Christ; and we have a prophet of the Lord on earth today. May God bless us to realize our potential in this bright new year, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<h1>mith, the Mormon Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My young brethren and sisters of this great school, I am delighted to greet you this very first day you're back to school from your holidays. I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas and are on the road to a successful and happy New Year.<br><br>This is such a special time of the year--this holiday--Christmas and New Year. I trust we have been greatly blessed by the spirit of Christmas and the Christ child and that we may have that spirit to be with us and bless us in our lives all the year.<br><br>It would be interesting to know what your resolutions are in the New Year; and although one should not wait until the New Year to repent, it does furnish a good time to make a change. I like these verses in reference to the New Year.<br><h2><b><i>A Clean New Book</i></b></h2><br><i>Midnight strikes, and the old year is gone.</i><br><i>We close the tablets we've written on:</i><br><i>And, torn 'twixt hope and doubt and fear,</i><br><i>We open the book of an unlived year.</i><br><br><i>An unlived year. Ah, stained with tears</i><br><i>Are the well-thumbed volumes of other years.</i><br><i>Soiled by blunders and black regret</i><br><i>Are the pages we read with our eyelids--wet.</i><br><br><i>Close in our hearts, as the leaves are turned</i><br><i>Is the record of passions that flared and burned;</i><br><i>And panics and sorrow, and ghosts that leer,</i><br><i>Look out from the page of the dying year.</i><br><br><i>But fresh in our hands--once more--is laid</i><br><i>A clean new book, by the Master made;</i><br><i>Unmarred are the pages lying there</i><br><i>Twelve new chapters, fresh and fair.</i><br><br><i>It is ours to write the daily tale</i><br><i>Of how we conquer or how we fail;</i><br><i>Of struggle and effort and hope that wakes</i><br><i>Like a sun in the heart when a bright day breaks.</i><br><br><i>Once a year, when the glad bells ring,</i><br><i>And the old year nods to a baby King,</i><br><i>Fresh in our hands, with the title clear</i><br><i>And the leaves uncut, is an unlived year.</i><br>[Author Unknown]<br><br>Florence French wrote these verses:<br><br><i>I would like to change the picture</i><br><i>I painted yesterday;</i><br><i>The harsh tones would be muted,</i><br><i>The background be less gray.</i><br><br><i>The leafless trees of winter</i><br><i>Would take on tints of spring;</i><br><i>The silent, ice-bound river</i><br><i>Would be a sparkling thing.</i><br><br><i>The scarlet tanager would replace</i><br><i>The starling's somber shade;</i><br><i>The pink of wild rose fill the space</i><br><i>Where drifting leaves pervade.</i><br><br><i>I cannot change the picture</i><br><i>I painted yesterday,</i><br><i>But I can make a new one--</i><br><i>And I'll begin today.</i><br><br>A man who had been in the penitentiary applied to Henry Ford for employment. He had decided to tell Mr. Ford about his past as he applied. He had not been honest on several occasions as he had applied and after he was hired and working, his employer had found out he had been in the penitentiary and let him go. So now as he started to tell about his past, Mr. Ford stopped him and said, "I don't care about your past; start where you stand."<br><br>Berton Braley put these thoughts to verse:<br><br><i>Start where you stand and never mind the past;</i><br><i>The past won't help you in beginning new;</i><br><i>If you have left it all behind at last</i><br><i>Why, that's enough, you've done with it, you're through;...</i><br><br><i>Forget the buried woes and dead despairs;</i><br><i>Here is a brand-new trial right at hand;</i><br><i>The future is for him who does and dares;</i><br><i>Start where you stand. ...</i><br><br><i>What has been, has been; yesterday is dead</i><br><i>And by it you are neither blessed nor banned;</i><br><i>Take courage, man, be brave and drive ahead;</i><br><i>Start where you stand.</i><br><br>Repentance is one of the greatest principles of the gospel.<br><br>There is another important event that is often lost track of in the busy holiday season, or only little is made of it. I refer to the birthday of the Prophet Joseph Smith on December 23. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we recognize Joseph Smith as a prophet of God through whom the Church was restored in this dispensation. No one is more revered by us save Jesus Christ himself. Even though we revere him as our Prophet and the founder of the Church, it is unlikely that we fully comprehend his true greatness. May I share with you a few of the attributes and virtues that made him one of the greatest men ever to live upon the earth.<br><br>John Henry Evans wrote of him:<br><br><i>Here is a man who was born in the stark hills of Vermont; who was reared in the backwoods of New York; who never looked inside a college or a high school; who lived in six States, no one of which would own him during his lifetime; who spent months in the vile prisons of the period; who, even when he had his freedom, was hounded like a fugitive; who was covered once with a coat of tar and feathers, and left for dead; who, with his following, was driven by irate neighbors from New York to Ohio, from Ohio to Missouri, and from Missouri to Illinois; and who, at the unripe age of thirty-eight, was shot to death by a mob with painted faces.</i><br><br><i>Yet this man became mayor of the biggest town in Illinois and the state's most prominent citizen, the commander of the largest body of trained soldiers in the nation outside the Federal army, the founder of cities and of a university, and aspired to become President of the United States.</i><br><br><i>He wrote a book which has baffled the literary critics for a hundred years and which is today more widely read than any other volume save the Bible. On the threshold of an organizing age he established the most nearly perfect social mechanism in the modern world, and developed a religious philosophy that challenges anything of the kind in history, for completeness and cohesion. And he set up the machinery for an economic system that would take the brood of Fears out of the heart of man--the fear of want through sickness, old age, unemployment, and poverty.</i><br><br><i>In thirty nations are men and women who look upon him as a greater leader than Moses and a greater prophet than Isaiah; his disciples now number close to a million; and already a granite shaft pierces the sky over the place where he was born, and another is in course of erection over the place where he received the inspiration for his Book.</i>[John Henry Evans,<i>Joseph Smith, An American Prophet,</i>p. v]<br><br><i>Joseph Smith occupies a unique place among the prophets--his birth and his name, Joseph, were known nearly four thousand years before he came to the earth. Joseph who was sold into Egypt said of the great latter-day prophet:</i><br><br><i>"Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the lord unto me; a choice seer will I raise up....</i><br><br><i>"... Behold; that seer will the Lord bless....</i><br><br><i>"And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by this hand, but the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</i><br><br><i>"Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this thing. ..." (2 Nephi 3:7, 14–16).</i><br><br><i>Not only was the Prophet Joseph's birth known, but after his death, the Lord caused to have written and included as scripture the following:</i><br><br><i>"Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. ..."</i>[Leon Hartshorn,<i>Classic Stories from the Lives of Our Prophets,</i>p. 1]<br><br><i>He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood ...</i>[D&amp;amp;C 135:3]<br><br>Dr. John A. Widtsoe said of the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>Since I struggled as a boy to find the Church and the message of Joseph Smith I have been overwhelmed by the greatness of the Prophet. He towers above all men by his great teachings.</i><br><br><i>Of course he was a man with the frailties of the flesh, but he so lived that God spoke to men through him. Indeed, he is the biggest man in the history of the world since the Savior lived among men nearly two thousand years ago. He was a magnificent type of man.</i><br><br><i>The Prophet stands unique among the religious leaders of the world, for in practically all of his work in the restoration he had witnesses. Mohammed, Buddha, Confucius, as examples, each established his work without witnesses, but not so Joseph Smith.</i><br><br><i>There were witnesses to the Gold Plates and the Book of Mormon, in the visitation of heavenly personages, and in the receiving of many of the revelations. His work was inaugurated not by himself alone, but by and with witnesses.</i><br><br><i>His teachings clear up so many misconceptions, that any man who honestly investigates the Prophet and his work, must come to a conviction that he was indeed a Prophet.</i>[Church Section,<i>Deseret News,</i>January 30, 1952, p. 3]<br><br>Possibly few tributes have been given of the Prophet greater than that of Josiah Quincy in his<i>Figures of the Past.</i><br><br><i>It is by no means improbable that some future text-book, for the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a questions something like this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now living, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. History deals in surprises and para doxes quite as startling as this. The man who established a religion in this age of free debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct emissary from the Most High,--such a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets.</i>[Josiah Quincy,<i>Figures of the Past,</i>p. 376]<br><br>A Russian historian once visited the United States for something over a year studying the history of great Americans and American institutions. As he was about to board his ship to return to his native land, newspapermen interrogated him. One of them asked him this question: "In your study of great Americans during this past year, which of them do you consider to be the greatest?" His answer is most startling. He said, "You have only had one truly great American, one man who gave to the world ideas that could change the whole destiny of the human race--Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet."<br><br>The Prophet was tried and tested and suffered many indignities. He was falsely arrested 42 times but was always cleared by the law of the land. He was tarred and feathered. He spent nearly six months in Liberty Jail in terrible conditions and with food not fit for humans. Parley P. Pratt says of one of these occasions:<br><br><i>In one of those tedious nights we had lain as if in sleep till the hour of midnight had passed, and our ears and hearts had been pained, while we had listened for hours to the obscene jests, the horrid oaths, the dreadful blasphemies and filthy language of our guards, Colonel Price at their head, as they recounted to each other their deeds of rapine, murder, robbery, etc., which they had committed among the "Mormons" while at Far West and vicinity. They even boasted of defiling by force wives, daughters and virgins, and of shooting or dashing out the brains of men, women and children.</i><br><br><i>I had listened till I became so disgusted, shocked, horrified, and so filled with the spirit of indignant justice that I could scarcely refrain from rising upon my feet and rebuking the guards; but had said nothing to Joseph, or any one else, although I lay next to him and knew he was awake. On a sudden he arose to his feet, and spoke in a voice of thunder, or as the roaring lion, uttering, as near as I can recollect, the following words:</i><br><br><i>"SILENCE, ye fiends of the infernal pit. In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you, and command you to be still; I will not live another minute and hear such language. Cease such talk, or you or I die THIS INSTANT!"</i><br><br><i>He ceased to speak. He stood erect in terrible majesty. Chained, and without a weapon; calm, unruffled and dignified as an angel, he looked upon the quailing guards, whose weapons were lowered or dropped to the ground; whose knees smote together, and who, shrinking into a corner or crouching at his feet, begged his pardon, and remained quiet till a change of guards.</i><br><br><i>I have seen the ministers of justice, clothed in magisterial robes, and criminals arraigned before them, while life was suspended on a breath, in the Courts of England; I have witnessed a Congress in solemn session to give laws to nations; I have tried to conceive of kings of royal courts, of thrones and crowns; and of emperors assembled to decide the fate of kingdoms; but dignity and majesty have I seen but</i>once,<i>as it stood in chains, at midnight, in a dungeon in an obscure village of Missouri.</i>[<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt,</i>pp. 210–211]<br><br>One of the tests of a true prophet is whether his prophecies come true.<br><br><i>Elder John A. Widtsoe in his book, "Joseph Smith the Prophet," makes an interesting statement about the prophecies of Joseph Smith. He says: "From the revelations printed in the Doctrine and Covenants are found 1,100 statements that may be classed as prophecies of the future. Nearly 700 are of a spiritual nature; the other 400 deal directly with the things of the earth."</i><br><br><i>I will mention only five of his well-known prophecies to which we've all made reference time and again. He predicted that three witnesses should see the golden plates and should testify of their experience. He prophesied to Stephen A. Douglas in 1843 that the time would come when he, Stephen A. Douglas, would aspire to the presidency of the United States, but that if he ever turned his hand against the Latter-day Saints he would feel the weight of Almighty God upon him. The rest is history. Douglas did turn his hands against the saints, he went down to political defeat and died an embittered man.</i><br><br><i>In 1832 the Prophet Joseph Smith prophesied that war would shortly come to pass, beginning in the rebellion of South Carolina and that the Southern States would be divided against the Northern States, etc. He prophesied in that same revelation that the time would come when war would be poured out upon all nations. World War One and World War Two and what has followed after have been a vindication of his place as a foreteller of events. In 1842 he prophesied that the saints would be driven to the Rocky Mountains and some would assist in making settlements and building cities and see the saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.</i><br><br><i>But beyond being merely a foreteller of future events, what is it that characterizes a true Prophet of God? First he is God's mouthpiece of that day and to his group. Second, he restates the ancient truths, and seeks to hold the people to unchanging laws of the gospel. Third, he receives additional revelations from the Lord to meet the problems of the progressive unfolding plan. Such new truths emanating from Deity come only through the Prophet of the day. Such a man was Joseph Smith, in every sense a Prophet of God. Yes, truly as Prophet Amos has said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing save He revealeth His secrets unto His servants the Prophets."</i>[Church News,<i>Deseret News,</i>December 10, 1955, p. 13]<br><br>Miracles as great as those in the meridian dispensation were accomplished by Joseph Smith during his life. President Wilford Woodruff gives an account of some of these healings.<br><br><i>While I was living in this cabin in the old barracks, we experienced a day of God's power with the Prophet Joseph. It was a very sickly time and Joseph had given up his home in Commerce to the sick, and had a tent pitched in his door-yard and was living in that himself. The large number of Saints who had been driven out of Missouri, were flocking into Commerce; but had no homes to go into, and were living in wagons, in tents, and on the ground. Many, therefore, were sick through the exposure they were subjected to. Brother Joseph had waited on the sick, until he was worn out and nearly sick himself.</i><br><br><i>On the morning of the 22nd of July, 1839, he arose reflecting upon the situation of the Saints of God in their persecutions and afflictions, and he called upon the Lord in prayer, and the power of God rested upon him mightily, and as Jesus healed all the sick around Him in His day, so Joseph, the Prophet of God, healed all around on this occasion. He healed all in his house and door-yard, then, in company with Sidney Rigdon and several of the Twelve, he went through among the sick lying on the bank of the river, and he commanded them in a loud voice, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come up and be made whole, and they were all healed. When he healed all that were sick on the east side of the river, they crossed the Mississippi river in a ferry-boat to the west side, to Montrose, where we were. The first house they went into was President Brigham Young's. He was sick on his bed at the time. The Prophet went into his house and healed him, and they all came out together. As they were passing by my door, Brother Joseph said: "Brother Woodruff, follow me." These were the only words spoken by any of the company from the time they left Brother Brigham's till we crossed the public square, and entered Brother</i>[Elijah]<i>Fordham's house. Brother Fordham had been dying for an hour, and we expected each minute would be his last.</i><br><br><i>I felt the power of God that was overwhelming His Prophet.</i><br><br><i>When we entered the house, Brother Joseph walked up to Brother Fordham, and took him by the right hand; and in his left hand he held his hat.</i><br><br><i>He saw that Brother Fordham's eyes were glazed, and that he was speechless and unconscious.</i><br><br><i>After taking hold of his hand, he looked down into the dying man's face and said: "Brother Fordham, do you not know me?" At first he made no reply; but we could all see the effect of the Spirit of God resting upon him.</i><br><br><i>He again said: "Elijah, do you not know me?"</i><br><br><i>With a low whisper, Brother Fordham answered, "Yes!"</i><br><br><i>The Prophet then said, "Have you faith to be healed?"</i><br><br><i>The answer, which was a little plainer than before, was: "I am afraid it is too late. If you had come sooner, I think it might have been."</i><br><br><i>He had the appearance of a man waking from sleep. It was the sleep of death.</i><br><br><i>Joseph then said: "Do you believe that Jesus is the Christ?"</i><br><br><i>"I do, Brother Joseph," was the response.</i><br><br><i>Then the Prophet of God spoke with a loud voice, as in the majesty of the Godhead: "Elijah, I command you, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, to arise and be made whole!"</i><br><br><i>The words of the Prophet were not like the words of man, but like the voice of God. It seemed to me that the house shook from its foundation.</i><br><br><i>Elijah Fordham leaped from his bed like a man raised from the dead. A healthy color came to his face, and life was manifested in every act.</i><br><br><i>His feet were done up in Indian meal poultices. He kicked them off his feet, ... and then called for his clothes and put them on. He asked for a bowl of bread and milk, and ate it; then put on his hat and followed us into the street to visit others who were sick....</i><br><br><i>As soon as we left Brother Fordham's house, we went into the house of Brother Joseph B. Noble. Who was very low and dangerously sick.</i><br><br><i>When we entered the house, Brother Joseph took him by the hand, and commanded him, in the name of Jesus Christ, to arise and be made whole. He did arise and was immediately healed....</i><br><br><i>While waiting for the ferry-boat, a man of the world, knowing of the miracles performed, came to him and asked him if he would not go and heal two twin children of his, about five months old, who were both lying sick nigh unto death.</i><br><br><i>They were some two miles from Montrose.</i><br><br><i>The Prophet said he could not go; but, after pausing some time, he said he would send some one to heal them; and he turned to me and said: "You go with the man and heal his children."</i><br><br><i>He took a red silk handkerchief out of his pocket and gave it to me, and told me to wipe their faces with the handkerchief when I administered to them, and they should be healed. He also said unto me: "As long as you will keep that handkerchief, it shall remain a league between you and me."</i><br><br><i>I went with the man, and did as the Prophet commanded me, and the children were healed.</i><br><br><i>I have possession of the handkerchief unto this day.</i>[Wilford Woodruff,<i>Leaves from my Journal,</i>pp. 62–65]<br><br>Few men have been privileged to see God the Father and Christ while in mortal life as did the Prophet Joseph Smith. Few have been so honored with the many manifestations as he was. Quoting President George Albert Smith, President Harold B. Lee said of the Prophet Joseph in a general conference of the Church: "'... Many have belittled Joseph Smith, but those who have will be forgotten in the remains of mother earth, and ... their infamy will ever be with them, but honor, majesty, and fidelity to God, exemplified by Joseph Smith and attached to his name, will never die'" (<i>Conference Report,</i>October 7, 1973, p. 166).<br><br>There are those who would say, I can accept everything in the Church except that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God; or, I can belong to your church if you would do away with the principle of continued revelation. It is difficult for me to understand how one could accept the gospel without accepting him who was the instrument in its restoration, or reject the principle of continued revelation, upon which the Church is founded. It is important that each of us come to know for ourselves, individually, that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, that he did see God and Christ, and was an instrument in the establishment of the Church in this dispensation.<br><br>May I leave you with my witness of this fact, that I know that he did, that day in the grove, see God the Father and the Son, and that he was their instrument in the establishment of this work. I leave you with this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James A.

<br>
I am very happy to be here, brethren and sisters, and to speak for Brother Hinckley and Brother Monson and our associates. It's overwhelming to see an audience such as this and I wonder if you can sense the deep interest, love, and affection we have for the youth of the Church.<br><br>I came with five or six pages of notes that I had put together over the last several weeks in both anticipation, I suppose, and worry for this assignment. Once again I learned a lesson that I've learned many times: that sometimes you have to be right here on the ground before the right inspiration will come. So during the night those six pages have been replaced with other notes and other thoughts--not, I think, without some prompting. I would appreciate greatly an interest in your faith and prayers (we sustain one another in the Church that way) as I talk to you about one or two things that somehow seem, in my mind, to be of foremost importance to you at this time in your lives.<br><br>I remember very vividly the first time I was here in Laie. It was more than thirty years ago, and I think I'll mention one or two of the circumstances surrounding it by way of illustrating something I learned from that experience. The date is easy to remember because it was a signal date in recent world history--August 14, 1945. Some time earlier than that I had been in military training in the United States. World War II was in full course. A few months earlier Germany had surrendered and shortly after that we left for California, heading into the Pacific theater of war.<br><br>While I was at a base in California I had my patriarchal blessing. I hadn't had one when I was home. I went to a patriarch that I had never seen before and would not see again for twenty years, and received what Brother Richards has described as "a page from your book of possibilities." That became a very important element in my life and in the experiences I had in the Pacific.<br><br>We sailed from Seattle at night, for security reasons. The ship was very crowded--there were 60 men on deck, besides all those who we accommodated below deck--moving, as we were then, large numbers of troops into the war zone. As we boarded that ship that night and as I went to my bunk, I felt it was something of an end and a beginning in my life. I made a firm resolution that night that, should I come back from the war--and I expected that I would come back--I would know for sure that the gospel was true. I believed it was true; but I determined that, whatever awaited us, when I returned I would know. As part of the commitment to that, I began my first reading of the Book of Mormon. I had "read" it before, but this time I was determined to read it, and there is a difference.<br><br>We landed at Honolulu and then went to Kauai where, at Barking Sands near Kekaha, there was an airbase. We were there for some weeks and I desired greatly to see the temple. I didn't have a recommend and I couldn't go into the temple, but I wanted to be on the temple grounds. I was about 19 at the time and had just graduated from pilot training. A USO group, a group of entertainers--comedians and some other movie figures--had been to Kauai to entertain the troops. They were going back to Oahu by plane. I managed to get aboard that plane to Honolulu and hitchhiked here to Laie to spend part of a day on the temple grounds.<br><br>It was late that afternoon when I returned to Honolulu. I was in a little Chinese curio shop buying a small carved box for my sister when pandemonium broke loose. Someone came in and spoke in very great excitement to the proprietor of the shop, in Chinese, I assumed. He forthwith pushed me from the shop and pulled the blind down. Then I saw people pouring from the buildings into the streets and the cars all stopped. It had just been announced that the Japanese had surrendered--the war was over. I thought, "We can go home. It's all over." That, however, was not to be.<br><br>A few days later, on another ship, we set sail for the Philippines, to be part of the occupation forces. In the course of the next year we moved from the Philippines to Okinawa, then to Japan; and finally, more than a year later, returned home. During the interim I became acquainted with the revelations and the scriptures. I read the Book of Mormon, and read it again--and again.<br><br>I would like to talk for just a moment about scriptures. By way of introduction I'd like to quote from the New Testament, from Timothy, words written by Paul to Timothy. They might have been taken from the front page of today's newspaper; they're that pertinent. It's a familiar scripture that applies particularly to you who are young.<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents</i>[imagine reading that in the scriptures from ancient times !]<i>, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God:</i><br><br>[And then, strangely enough,]<i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i>[2 Timothy 3:1–5]<br><br>That was the prophetic description of what our day would be--all of those things. It's negative, as you contemplate it. Think that all of these things surround us.<br><br>It wasn't until recently that I happened to glance down the page and make a connection I never had before. That's often the case with scriptures, isn't it? Though we think we have command of them, they're a continued revelation. At the bottom of that page I read this:<br><br><i>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</i><br><br>And then, here's the answer for all of us to that which is ominous and negative and frightening.<br><br><i>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou has learned them;</i><br><br><i>And that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</i><br><br><i>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</i><br><br><i>That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</i>[2 Timothy 3:13–17]<br><br>On the one hand we have the ominous, frightening, prophetic declaration of what we face in our generation, and following it the antidote or the immunization from it in that we have the scriptures.<br><br>Last month I had an experience that was remarkable to me: I went to Sunday School. (I was regarded, of course, as a stranger in my ward since I am always somewhere else at Sunday School times.) The lesson there was directly from the scriptures. I also went to priesthood meeting that day and the lesson was directly from the scriptures. My wife was preparing a Relief Society lesson--directly from the scriptures. There has been great emphasis on scriptures in the Church. As general officers of the Church we urge all Church members to acquaint themselves with the scriptures.<br><br>I would like to take a phrase from what I've just read to illustrate something and then give you some specific counsel.<br><br><i>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</i><br><br><i>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of</i>[and this is the phrase I want to emphasize:]<i>knowing of whom thou hast learned them.</i><br><br>I repeat: "Knowing of whom thou hast learned them."<br><br>I now read from the 42nd section of the Doctrine and Covenants this verse:<br><br><i>Again, I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.</i><br><br>[D&amp;amp;C 42:11]<br><br>In our day it's manifestly impossible on this earth for someone to get off a plane somewhere and represent themselves, for instance, as a member of the Council of the Twelve and proceed to give instruction or to perform ordinations. That would be counterfeit. This couldn't be done. We're too well known in a very interesting way.<br><br>I'd like to tell you of an experience that happened just a short time ago. My oldest son took his little family to tithing settlement. When they went to the bishop's office there was a picture of all of the General Authorities. Our tiny granddaughter noticed the picture and got all excited and said, "Oh, Grandpa, Grandpa!" My daughter-in-law lifted her up and she pointed to Brother McConkie!<br><br>Some time ago my wife and I were coming home from New Zealand. We had left Auckland about midnight and landed in Papeete, Tahiti, to change planes in the wee hours of the morning. We had an hour or two to spend and were waiting for our flight to come in. A Pan American plane landed and we were watching that plane taxi in. I didn't know where it was from or where it was going, but I said to my wife, "I will know someone on that flight." It was just a flight out in the Pacific in the wee hours of Monday morning.<br><br>I went out and stood by the gate. I knew one man as he got off. Four other people came up and said, "You're Brother Packer, aren't you?" That's a handicap sometimes to us personally, but there's a great protection in that for the Church.<br><br>Some time ago I was with President Kimball in New York. We had gone to tape an interview that was going to go on the CBS nationwide broadcast. It was a beautiful Saturday morning in April and we decided to walk up 5th Avenue to the mission home. Thousands of people were out walking and President Kimball said, "Look at all of these people--and they're all ours. They all should have the gospel and not a one of them knows us. All of them are strangers to us," he said.<br><br>"I know how we can find someone we know," I said.<br><br>"How can we find them?" he asked.<br><br>We were passing a little French restaurant with tables sitting out on the sidewalk. I said, "We can just step over there and order coffee, and someone will find us in a hurry!"<br><br>Just as I said that, in a joking way, I heard the words, "Brother Kimball! Brother Kimball!" Out of the crowd came the wife of a stake president!<br><br>The point I make is that this phrase from Timothy strikes me as being monumentally important. "But continue thou in the things which thou has learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou has learned them." In the pattern of constituted authority in the Church we always know where revelation comes from. Revelation is always vertical. There is no horizontal revelation in the Church. It is all vertical. A bishop will get no revelation from a fellow bishop, or a stake president from a fellow stake president; but a bishop will receive it from the stake president, and his stake president from the general officers of the Church.<br><br>In your youth you can learn that the scriptures are powerful, that they're righteous; that in this Church we learn the scriptures, that we accept them, that we determine to live by them. Learn that there is a constituted authority--that our leaders are ordained by those who are in authority, and it is known throughout the Church. Nothing is done in the corner where there might be room for doubt or confusion or misunderstanding. We all have the right to go before the Lord to appeal in prayer and to receive inspiration and revelation for ourselves, so that each of us will know.<br><br>One of the things the scriptures do is to make it very clear that we're to follow the prophets. In the Doctrine and Covenants section after section states, "I the Lord am speaking," or "It is I, God, who speaks," and so on. Those declarations show that there is no doubt who is speaking.<br><br>Now I would like to touch upon two subjects that have application to you, my young brethren and sisters. You who are here studying in this school have been gathered from all of Polynesia and from the Orient. I would like to read from a letter dated September 26, 1973, signed by President Harold B. Lee, President N. Eldon Tanner, and President Marion G. Romney.<br><br><i>It has come to our attention that many Church members from</i>[and it names the specific areas]<i>are migrating to Hawaii and the mainland USA.</i><br><br><i>Now that stakes of Zion have been established in</i>[this land],<i>we encourage you to remain there and to learn and teach the gospel in your own tongue. By doing this and by organizing and building up wards, branches, and stakes in</i>[your homeland],<i>you will be entitled to all of the blessings promised to the faithful Saints.</i><br><br><i>As you serve among your people, you can be assured that the Lord will bless you greatly; and by doing so you will be helping to build the Church and kingdom of God here upon this earth.</i><br><br>And then this:<br><br><i>No necessary blessing will be withheld from you as you follow this counsel of the First Presidency.</i><br><br><i>We extend to you our love and appreciation for your devotion in the work of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Sincerely yours,</i><br><br><i>The First Presidency</i><br><br>There, then, comes some counsel from those who are ordained (and it is known to the world that they are ordained). This counsel has application to you who have come from your homelands to learn and then to face the question: "Where can I serve?" The counsel has been, and the counsel is, that you're to serve among your people, to bless your people now. Can everyone do that? There may be exceptions, of course. Some will not find their way back.<br><br>But I'd like to talk about exceptions. On one occasion when I was president of the New England Mission we were holding a Relief Society conference of several hundred women. Our Relief Society president was a convert. We were trying to get our sewing circles and gossip festivals turned into Relief Societies. We were setting standards for Relief Society, and this lovely sister was told to teach the sisters what a Relief Society should be.<br><br>At this Relief Society conference she was explaining that the Relief Society would no longer be held on Sunday, that they would hold it on weekdays so that they could have sewing and activities and so on. A woman stood up in the audience and defied her and said, "You don't understand. Things are different up in Vermont. This is different, we are an exception. We can't do that. You must make an exception."<br><br>The Relief Society president was quite puzzled at this confrontation. She turned around and looked at me, pleading for help. I thought she was doing pretty well, so I motioned for her to proceed. She did, and what she said next was so profound that I told her after the meeting I would be quoting that across the world, since I was sure it came by inspiration. For she stood there, frightened and puzzled, for a few minutes while that defiant woman, who was something of a ring-leader representing a faction, kept talking for a minute, re-emphasizing that they were an exception. Then sister Baker quietly, but firmly, said, "Dear sister, we'd like not to take care of the exception first. We'll see to the rule first and then we'll take care of the exception."<br><br>Now, what are you to do in your lives? Accommodate the rule first! If you're to be an exception, or if others are to be an exception, that will become obvious in the inspiration that comes. But there is great power and great safety in holding to the scriptures and having an abounding obedience to our constituted priesthood authority. We are able to pray and receive revelation on our own, then to consider something like this letter from the First Presidency and to obediently say, "Lord, I don't ask to be an exception."<br><br>I quote from the general conference talk of President Kimball of April 4, 1975.<br><br><i>The "gathering of Israel" is effected when the people of the faraway countries accept the gospel and remain in their native lands. The gathering of Israel for Mexicans is in Mexico; in Scandinavia, for those of the northern countries; the gathering place for the Germans is in Germany; and the Polynesians in the islands; for the Brazilians, in Brazil; for the Argentines, in Argentina.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>May 1975, p. 4]<br><br>You are here at a Church school and you have the opportunity to learn. You have the opportunity to test and to understand counsel, and then be willing to be obedient to it.<br><br>President George Albert Smith was showing visitors from the East around the Salt Lake Valley in the earlier days, when it looked a little more deserted than it does now. This man said, "Well, Mr. Smith, it must have been quite a trial for your people to leave the lush, beautiful eastern part of the United States and migrate out into this forsaken desert. That must have been quite a trial."<br><br>President Smith's answer was, "Oh, no, not at all. We came here willingly--because we had to!" There's some of that kind of obedience in all of our lives.<br><br>I was in Tonga not too long ago. I have an assignment, incidentally, that I've had for as long as I've been a General Authority, that puts me in close ties with the so-called minorities in the Church--Americans living in Brussels, Belgium, for instance. They're Americans living abroad, and they're a minority, so they are part of our worry. Part of our concern is for the Tongans in the United States, and for the Samoans and all of the minorities. I have worked in this assignment for many years with President Kimball and with others of the senior Brethren.<br><br>Last night as I pondered what I would say to you, I realized the counsel for us to gather to our own people was counsel from the prophets, who are known as the constituted authority, having been ordained and known to the Church. Now, there's great importance in your young lives in following that counsel. Sometimes when we are an exception and that there are so many more opportunities available in other lands.<br><br>I remember from my college days the report of an eminent historian. He had gone to southern Utah to gather some of the local historical facts. He had looked up the oldest man in the community--a man in his nineties. In the interview he suggested to the man that he was living in what might be termed "a forsaken little place on the desert." He asked him, "How did you get here?"<br><br>The man told him that he had been called there on a mission.<br><br>He said, "Who called you here on the mission?"<br><br>The man said, "The President of the Church." (I think it was probably John Taylor or Wilford Woodruff.)<br><br>The historian said, "But you've stayed here all your life. Why didn't you ever go back?" The old man did not have much of an answer and the historian pressed the point, asking, "Why didn't you go back to a better place?"<br><br>Then tears came to the old man's eyes and he said, "No, I could not go back. I was called on a mission and I have not been released." And then from the porch of this humble little house he pointed over to a sage brush hill where there were headstones and said, "I'll go there before I'll go back."<br><br>I thought of the young couple out in Samoa in those early days who were sent on a mission--a young man and his wife. This young married couple had arrived in Samoa on a ship and as they were being put ashore in a small boat the hardened seamen stood at the rails and wept over the young couple going to what they termed a "god-forsaken place." There are graves in Samoa, you know, as there are on the other South Pacific islands, of missionaries who were "forgotten," but not by the Lord. There is a conviction and a dedication that we can have, and that we ought to have, to be obedient.<br><br>We can do as Samuel did. Remember the story of Eli and Samuel? Eli, the old prophet, had the boy Samuel to train. The little boy came to him and said, "Somebody keeps calling to me at night."<br><br>The old prophet said, "What do they say?"<br><br>The boy said, "They just call my name: Samuel. I get up and look around, but there's nobody there."<br><br>The wise old prophet, teaching this young lad who himself would be a prophet one day, said, "When that happens again, your answer should be, 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth'" (see Samuel 3:3–10).<br><br>If we could build that in our lives--"Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth"--then we would find ourselves among our own people doing what we ought to do, living as we ought to live. The glitter of the enticements of other places would not persuade us.<br><br>I have a lingering, sensitive, prophetic idea that as you obediently follow the prophet you will live to know a stability and a fulness and a plenty in your own lands that by comparison now seem deprived economically. You will have far more of what matters most than you would have if you should go elsewhere seeking your fortune. When you come to find that which matters most, you will always find in the long run that to be the rule and not the exception is to see the fulness of life. Should there be exceptions, the Lord will designate those in an unmistakable way.<br><br>Now, one other subject. It's been the policy of the Church--and it's been spoken on many occasions--that as the gathering of Israel is in Mexico for the Mexicans, in Tonga for the Tongans, in China for the Chinese, and so on, so has been our counsel as it relates to marriage.<br><br>We've always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. The counsel has been wise. You may say again, "Well, I know of exceptions." I do, too, and they've been very successful marriages. I know some of them. You might even say, "I can show you local Church leaders or perhaps even general leaders who have married out of their race." I say, "Yes--exceptions." Then I would remind you of that Relief Society woman's near-scriptural statement, "We'd like to follow the rule first, and then we'll take care of the exceptions."<br><br>I was with President Kimball once some years ago when, in a small group, he told the story of his courtship and marriage to Camilla Eyring. They only knew one another for a short time. I'm even hesitant to say how short the time was before their marriage. He told of meeting this beautiful young schoolteacher who had come to the community, and in the course of a few weeks they were married. After hearing this, one young man in the group later said, "Well, if President Kimball can find somebody and be sure in that short of a time, I guess I can do that."<br><br>Someone else replied, "My boy, before you think that applies to you, you ought to be very sure you have the inspiration and power that is present in the beginnings of an apostle."<br><br>You may not be the exception. We counsel in the Church, for instance, that we ought to be old enough before we marry and we ought to know one another before we're married. Our courtships ought to be adequate. You may pick out a couple--he was 18 and she was 17 when they married--and see how happy and successful they've been. Yes, an exception! For every exception we can show you tens and hundreds, and I suppose thousands, who were not happy. Plan, young people, to marry into your own race. This counsel is good, and I hope our branch presidents are listening and paying attention. The counsel is good.<br><br>Now, someone may say, "Well, I've never heard that in general conference." I remember once that Brother Lee gave a talk at BYU, and he told me that he felt some unusual inspiration in that talk and gave emphasis to a point that he had not intended to discuss. A few days later one of the professors from BYU called at his office and interviewed him and said, "Brother Lee, I was very interested in your talk. I was very interested in one point particularly."<br><br>Brother Lee said, "Yes, I was quite interested too."<br><br>The professor said, "Would you mind citing the reference and the authority for that?"<br><br>Brother Lee thought for a few minutes and said, "Yes, the reference for that is Elder Harold B. Lee of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, speaking at a devotional assembly at BYU," and then he gave the date of his sermon. The point I make, simply, is this: It isn't a question of who said it or when; the question is whether it is true.<br><br>Of course, we always have the test. Somebody said, "No matter how tall your grandpa is, we've all got to do our own growing." Everybody in this Church may go to his own sacred grove to ask what is true. That is what happened to me in the Pacific. I came back a different man because I came to know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I know that there are great powers intervening in our lives.<br><br>I think I will mention a personal experience. I'm not sure I have told this publicly except once a few weeks ago in Tonga. While stationed in Tokyo, on one occasion we were assigned to take a B-17 bomber and go down to Saipan Island and then on to Guam, if necessary, to get a beacon light. I was an operations officer and we needed a beacon light at the base. We left Tokyo heading south into the Pacific. Because the war was just over, air flight safety was not put together as it is now. We did not know that there was forming, out in the central Pacific, a typhoon of major proportions.<br><br>Now, Pacific islands from airplanes are very difficult to see; clouds look like islands and vice versa. I remember the navigator said, "If we're on course, we should be over Iwa Jima soon." He began counting: "Ten, nine, eight," and so on and when he counted "zero," we tipped the plane and looked down through broken clouds and directly below us was Iwa Jima. We were right on course. We kidded him about being an expert.<br><br>Several hours later he said, "We're off course. Something's wrong!" We dropped down through the cloud cover. There were terrible winds. The ocean was white with waves. He said, "I don't know where we are." Then, of course, to add melodrama to the drama, the radios went out. There we were!<br><br>We began flying a "square search." Lost pilots don't just fly around aimlessly. They fly a definite pattern so that they know they're covering new territory and not just flying in circles. We flew a long course on compass. The other pilot said, "Let's turn." For some reason I said, "Hold it just a minute." We were just a few thousand feet above the water. Suddenly I could see a long line of white waves and we pulled up over some rocks sticking out of the ocean. We knew then that somewhere nearby was an island. We had no idea whether we were over the rocks south of it or north of it. We made a prayerful turn and in about five or ten minutes on our short range radio we could hear voices. Soon we pulled over Tinian Island where there was an airfield. As we landed the B-17 and were taxiing down the runway, one by one the engines went off. We were out of gas.<br><br>During the last hour of that flight, when I sat there wondering if we would or if we wouldn't make it, my patriarchal blessing kept coming to my mind. It said, "You will be warned of danger, and if you heed those warnings you will be privileged to return to your loved ones." I thought, "Well, I've tried." I sat there thinking, "The gospel's true and what else matters? That prophetic declaration will see us safely through this, and if it doesn't, we're in the hands of the Lord now."<br><br>Things are not always easy when we receive counsel, whether the counsel is to return to serve among our own people or whether it is counsel to marry among our own culture and racial backgrounds. Always there is a decision. Always we can say, "We're an exception." But I say, in the words of that Relief Society sister, "As for me, I'm going to follow the rule first; and then, should there be an exception, perhaps that will be made known."<br><br>I came back from that first journey out here in the Pacific some thirty years ago with a testimony that the gospel is true. I knew then and I yet know.<br><br>Brother Romney said once, "I don't know any more certainly right now that God lives than I knew when I was a missionary boy in Australia." There was one difference though, he said: "Then I came to know that the Lord lives. Since then I have come to know the Lord."<br><br>I bear witness that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. I bear witness that Spencer W. Kimball is the prophet of God and that prophetic, apostolic powers are on this earth. That power rests upon this Church and kingdom. You and I have the privilege and the obligation of bearing this kingdom away in such fashion that all mankind will be served by it. God grant that we might be worthy and able and inspired, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K.

<h1>onsibility of Parents - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and brothers and sisters, I am grateful for the privilege of meeting with you this morning. I have a matter I would like to discuss with you; I hope you feel, when it's completed, that it's appropriate. I'd like to talk about the responsibility of parents. Many of you young people are already parents, and hopefully the rest of you will be married in one of God's holy temples and become parents in the future.<br><br>Sir Winston Churchill once posed this question, "Where does the family start?" and answered , "It starts with a young man falling in love with a girl" (Richard L. Evans,<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 11; hereinafter cited as<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book</i>). President David O. McKay once said, "If I were asked to name the world's greatest need, I should say unhesitatingly wise mothers ... [and] exemplary fathers" (David O. McKay,<i>Secrets of a Happy Life</i>, p. 2; hereinafter cited as McKay,<i>Secrets</i>). The late Richard L. Evans said, "God has given us no greater blessing than that of belonging to a loving and loyal family--and it will be so, always and forever" (<i>Richard L. Evans' Quote Book</i>, p. 24). I wish to discuss your responsibilities as parents and as potential parents. I will primarily use the scriptures as a basis for my message.<br><br>Children are an inheritance of the Lord and are therefore precious to him and to their earthly parents. In the days when Moroni presided over the Nephites, there were disputations among them concerning the baptism of their little children. In seeking an answer to this problem, Moroni wrote to his father, Mormon, for counsel. Mormon answered with a letter advising:<br><br><i>And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for this intent I have written this epistle.</i><br><br><i>For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:</i><br><br><i>Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them.</i><br><br><i>And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.</i><br><br><i>But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world. ...</i>[Moroni 8:6–8, 11–12]<br><br>If children die before reaching the age of accountability, they shall be blessed with eternal life, for the Savior said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God" (Luke 18:16; see also Matthew 19:14, and Mark 10:14). He also said, "Except ye be converted [speaking to adults], and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 18:3).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith received a vision of the celestial kingdom and said, "And I also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven" (Joseph Smith--Vision of the Celestial Kingdom 10).<br><br>The Lord also gave the following revelation to Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 29:46–47]<br><br>These statements confirm the counsel Mormon gave to his son, Moroni.<br><br>Now what do these scriptural statements mean to you? To me, they are very meaningful. They inform parents that they have what we can refer to as "eight golden years," a time in the lives of their children when they are not capable of committing sin or being tempted by Satan. Parents have an opportunity to teach and mold the characters of their little children before Satan has the power to tempt them and before they reach the age of eight, becoming then responsible before God. These four scriptures, one from each of the four standard works of the Church, inform us that the Lord has granted parents these precious years, the first years of a child's life, when the children are not accountable for the things they say and do. It is a responsibility and blessing parents have to teach and train their children to live righteously.<br><br>The most effective way to teach righteousness and religion in a home is by example. Hopefully, parents will have kept their own lives sweet and clean and can therefore profitably use the example of their lives in the teaching and training of their own children. "If you would teach faith in God, show faith in Him yourself; if you would teach prayer, pray yourself; would you have them temperate, then you yourself refrain from intemperance; if you would have your child live a life of virtue, of self-control, of good report, then set him a worthy example in all these things" (McKay,<i>Secrets</i>, p. 11). To do so will make these teachings more impressive to your children; and they, receiving such guidance from parents, can fortify themselves against the temptations of Satan, whose goal is to destroy their lives when they do reach the age of accountability. Parents have the duty to be what they would have their children become in regard to courtesy, sincerity, temperance, and courage to do right at all times. Example is far more potent than precept.<br><br>Daily home life should conform to our Church principles and standards. Our business dealings should agree with our religion. Children are quick to detect insincerity. John Milton said that hypocrisy is the only sin that walks undetected save by God alone. Children, however, are sensitive to things that are wrong, and they resent insincerity and false pretensions. We know that children are influenced far more by the sermons we live than by the sermons we preach. Parents should always be honest with their children, keeping promises made to them and ever speaking the truth. It is the consistent parent who gains the trust of his child. When a child feels that you honor his trust and reciprocate it, he will not violate it, nor will he bring your name into dishonor.<br><br>Children should be taught from their infancy. Elihu Burritt gave this good advice: "Be ever gentle with the children God has given you. Watch over them constantly; reprove them earnestly but not in anger (<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 12). Dr. Lyman Abbott informs us, "Parents have a duty to govern their children, but the object of all good government is to prepare the subject for self-government" (<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 16). Benjamin Franklin advised that the child's first lesson be obedience. It is a real and continuing challenge to parents to prepare themselves to teach their children properly and to help them understand and obey the word of the Lord.<br><br>In another revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord gave the following instructions to parents:<br><br><i>And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.</i><br><br><i>For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized.</i><br><br><i>And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands.</i><br><br><i>And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 68:25–29]<br><br>Parents should consistently observe the Sabbath day, keeping it as God's holy day, and refrain from engaging in activities that are contrary to the spirit of the Sabbath. Continual absence from church makes continuous absence easy. Too many outside interests in life can make a growing youth indifferent to religion and its responsibilities. The Lord said, "Now I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for ... their children are ... growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness. These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them." [D&amp;amp;C 68:31]<br><br>I know there are many upright, faithful, clean, devoted young people in the Church, but I also know there are many who are not living righteously and are straying from the path God has counseled them to follow. Free agency should be used to choose the right and not the wrong. Free agency is no justification to choose evil. Do you know that as of February 28, 1977, there were 63,988 children nine to nineteen years old who have not been baptized into the Church, and yet one or both parents are Church members? What an indictment against parents who do not follow God's counsel! Many of these children will be forever lost to the Church. Parents will carry the burden of this neglect of duty for not having had their children baptized. The bishops, the home teachers, the Relief Society sisters, and the missionaries can give valuable assistance to help correct this problem.<br><br>What a responsibility to parents! Unless they teach their children the principles of the gospel and see that they are baptized, the Lord has said that "the sin be upon the heads of the parents." The Lord did not make it an optional instruction to parents to permit their children to grow up and decide for themselves whether they should be baptized or not. He made the duty of parents very plain when he said, "For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, ... and their children shall be baptized ... when eight years old, and receive the laying on of hands." Certainly there is no permissiveness involved in this firm instruction from the Lord. Richard L. Evans said, "The idea that we can leave entirely to children the vital choices of life is unsafe. Leaving such decisions to trial and error is unsafe" (<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 17). Spencer Kinard, in one of his sermonettes given in connection with the national Sunday broadcasts of the Tabernacle Choir, made this interesting and significant observation, "If God had wanted us to be permissive, he would have given us ten suggestions instead of ten commandments."<br><br>The laws of life place upon motherhood and fatherhood the responsibility of giving the children not only a good name but training in uprightness. I recommend that following morning and evening prayers, husbands and wives should declare their love for each other. To do so will help establish good family relationships, promote a more ideal home life, and avoid many divorces. Couples should not be married unless they are in love and have like desires and similar goals in the conduct of the home and the upbringing of their children.<br><br>Parents should never quarrel in the presence of their children. Sometimes quarrels arise out of an attempt to correct or discipline a child. One parent criticizes; the other objects. And the unified influence of the home, so far as the child is concerned, is nullified. Parents need to be united in knowing which way they want a child to go; otherwise, he may walk in wrong paths out of confusion. Richard L. Evans said, "Division between parents is unfair and confusing and weakens the foundations of the family. Those to whom a child should look for guidance must be united in the guidance they give" (<i>Richard L. Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 23). We know that children are sensitive to family moods and feelings; they can feel tensions and differences that they can't always understand or define.<br><br>Parents who participate in or permit cursing or the use of profanity in the home are particularly delinquent. Parents pollute their homes when they use such vile language and evils that lower the standards of an ideal home.<br><br>The family gives to the child his name and standing in the community. A child wants his family to be as good as those of his friends. He wants to be able to point with pride to his father and always to feel inspiration when he thinks of his mother. It is the mother's duty to so live that her children will associate her with everything that is good and beautiful. And the father should live his life in such a way that his children can emulate his example, living as good citizens of both church and community.<br><br>A child has the right to feel that in his home he has a place of refuge, a place of protection from the dangers and evils of the outside world. Family unity and integrity are necessary to supply this need. There is no place other than the home where true and lasting happiness can be found in this life. It is possible to make home a bit of heaven; indeed, I picture heaven to be a continuation of the ideal home life here on earth.<br><br>One of the most important things a father can do for his children is to love their mother. It has been said that marriage is a fine and sacred thing if you make it so. In regard to his sense of security, every child is entitled to food, shelter, and raiment, and he should also feel safe and comfortable protection within his home. The satisfaction of certain material and cultural needs is also important to a successful home life. Parents must magnify their talents in order to broaden their teachings to their children and meet these special needs.<br><br>In addition to being responsible for teaching their children the first principles of the gospel, parents are also counseled to "teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord." What a delight it is to me when I attend stake conferences and stay in the home of the stake president and have him call on one of his children to be voice in family prayer! These children are capable of giving beautiful and spiritual prayers, despite the presence of a stranger in their home. Ofttimes I also see a family gather around the table in the dining room or breakfast room to read, ponder, and discuss the scriptures. Each family member takes his or her turn in the study and discussion of the scriptures.<br><br>A mother needs to choose which activities should take priority during each season of her life: for example, while she has small children at home, wisdom would dictate that she limit outside activities, no matter how worthwhile they may be. The story of Emmeline B. Wells, an early Utah Latter-day Saint mother, reflects the power of a life covered by wise recognition of values. While her children were young, she devoted herself almost exclusively to her home and children. A natural and skillful teacher, she instilled into her children her staunch faith in the gospel and the Church and her love of the good and beautiful in life.<br><br>The Lord gives additional instruction to parents, found in the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 36 and 37, beginning, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake that evil one." "Light and truth forsake that evil one"; this statement is very meaningful. One who, by true faith, diligence, and prayer, obtains the light and truth of the gospel in his life will forsake all evil.<br><br>The Lord continues by saying:<br><br><i>Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.</i><br><br><i>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:38–39]<br><br>This scripture informs us that man was innocent in the beginning, but when we reach the age of accountability, "that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers." We must be careful to build good and righteous traditions in families. Parents, directed by the father of the home, have that responsibility and should give it thoughtful consideration.<br><br>The Lord continues by saying, "But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:40). Again, this is a charge and not a choice. It is a responsibility parents cannot escape, as the following scripture indicates. The Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, said to Frederick G. Williams:<br><br><i>You have continued under this condemnation;</i><br><br><i>You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your affliction.</i><br><br><i>And now a commandment I give unto you</i>--<i>if you will be delivered you shall set in order your own house, for there are many things that are not right in your house.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:41–43]<br><br>If children go wrong, is it because parents have failed to bring them up in the light and truth of the gospel? I realize that occasionally there is one in the best of families who may go astray, but the majority of those brought up in light and truth in an ideal Latter-day Saint home do not yield to the temptations of evil. If we do our part as parents in teaching righteous principles, setting proper examples, and giving love and security, we fulfill our responsibility.<br><br>You remember the Lord said to Frederick G. Williams, "You have continued under this condemnation; you have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your affliction." When the Lord said to "set in order your own house," I don't think he had in mind the physical orderliness of the home, although he had counseled both as being important. He said, "Set in order your houses; keep slothfulness and uncleanness far from you" (D&amp;amp;C 90:18). And cleanliness is next to godliness. But it is the spiritual orderliness of the home our Heavenly Father is mostly concerned about. A son or daughter of a family who faithfully holds the weekly family home evening is blessed in many ways. A missionary from such a home has a definite advantage, for it is now the goal of missionaries, and will continue to be in the future, to concentrate on converting complete families. In order for missionaries working with families to be really successful, they must be capable of organizing and carrying out a family home evening program, and must understand the importance of a family doing things together on an organized basis. We are taught in our family home evenings that families can be eternal--living, loving, and progressing forever by obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Following the Lord's reprimand to Frederick G. Williams, the Lord upbraided Sidney Rigdon by saying that "in some things he hath not kept the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in order thy house" (D&amp;amp;C 93:44). And the Prophet Joseph Smith also received a rebuke and warning from the Lord because of a laxity in governing his family. He was reprimanded by the Lord, who said, "Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place" (D&amp;amp;C 93:48). Later, they were removed out of their place, as the records show. The Presiding Bishop of the Church, Newel K. Whitney, was also chastened by the Lord through the Prophet: "[He] hath need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their place" (D&amp;amp;C 93:50).<br><br>In closing these admonitions to the then First Presidency of the restored Church, the Lord applied these instructions to all by saying, "What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place" (D&amp;amp;C 93:49). These revelations emphasize that all of us need to reassess ourselves and our families to see if we are fulfilling our responsibilities to them.<br><br>A well-known psychologist has penned the following wise prayer: "Dear Lord, make me a better parent. Teach me to understand my children, to listen patiently to what they have to say, and to answer all their questions kindly. Keep me from interrupting them, talking back to and contradicting them. Make me as courteous to them as I would have them be to me" (<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 26).<br><br>Our beloved President Spencer W. Kimball gave some very good counsel when he spoke to approximately 8,000 in the Tangerine Bowl Stadium in Orlando, Florida, recently. He said, "Nothing can renew the soul, and give youthfulness to the spirit like a home in which there is love and respect for each other, where there is faith in our Heavenly Father, and prayers to him both individually and as a family." President Kimball also said,<br><br><i>The family is the most important institution in the world. A happy home is not only heaven on earth, but it is the strength of the nation.</i>[it is also the strength of the Church.]<i>A people, a nation, cannot be great without happy, strong homes.</i><br><br><i>In the home is where this great country must do some strengthening if it is to achieve its divine destiny.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>Deseret News, December 25, 1976, p. 3]<br><br>I pray that this message will be helpful to all of you who are married, and to those of you who are not yet married. Young people, begin now to prepare for the most important responsibility you will have. Read, study, and plan for this responsibility. I suggest that all young couples and all unmarried young men and women read and ponder<i>Secrets of a Happy Life,</i>a book by President David O. McKay, and<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>fist chapter, entitled, "Home, Marriage, Mothers, Fathers, and Families." The counsel the Lord has given can be very helpful to a happy home and family life.<br><br>The gospel as we teach it is true. Christ lives; God lives, and glorious mansions are being prepared above for all his faithful and devoted children. Plan now the kind of home and family you desire, and how you will meet the needs of your children to keep them on a righteous path that will lead the family to eternal life in a celestial home. God bless all of you, my brothers and sisters. I think you can understand that much of what has been said pertains to you. And to organize and carry forward your home in a sacred manner is very important to the young people who come to bless your life. God bless you, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Delbert L.

<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is a sincere thrill to be here. I give a special welcome and recognition to those from the Meridian Idaho Stake in the Boise area whom I learned to love and appreciate. Some of the most cherished books in my library are the compilations of your<i>Speeches of the Year.</i>Now to be a contributor to the 1977 volume is, I do not mind telling you, a very humbling experience. And I certainly pray most earnestly that I might make a positive contribution to the spiritual content of this year's volume.<br><br>Communication is difficult at best. I recall a situation with Adlai Stevenson campaigning across the country. An overzealous and enthusiastic well-wisher, following his speech, came up and said, "Oh, Mr. Stevenson, I was so thrilled at your speech; it was simply superfluous."<br><br>He said, "Thank you, Madam, I'm thinking of having it published posthumously."<br><br>And she said, "Oh, good; the sooner the better."<br><br>Along that line, I heard of a couple of BYU students discussing the difference between ignorance and apathy--you have perhaps heard that mentioned over your scholastic career. One asked the difference; the other one said, "I don't know and I don't care."<br><br>Now this represents the twenty-fifth anniversary of my graduation from BYU. The son who patiently waited to be born until the night following the due date of our term exams is sitting here on the front row as a student. We appreciated his thoughtfulness in waiting until the term papers and exams were out of the way before he came into the world. I make no attempt to conceal my pride as an alumnus of this great institution. It certainly has to be, without question, the most unique institution for higher learning in the world. And just a few years ago I purchased a class ring--glad to see they still made them going back that far--which I wear with real pride. It serves as a reminder of the obligation which I feel to uphold the standards of this great institution.<br><br>One of my most prized possessions was given to me by the vice-president of our company--a wonderful man who is not a member of the Church. He presented me with a personally created coat of arms. I brought it here today. You cannot all see this, but it is made of emblems, selected and arranged in order of priority, which he had observed from our many years of close association--emblems of religion and family, our business profession, and self-improvement. It is really quite frightening to have someone, not a member of the Church, watching you and observing the priorities of your life and then molding a coat of arms indicating what that appraisal reflected. I have pondered this experience many times since that occasion. Perhaps you would like to be reminded of the origin, as I understand it, of the coat of arms, because it came to me rather forcibly.<br><br>A coat of arms is granted to a family by the head of the government or the crown by official proclamation, not given by right or sought for by application. It is awarded to the title holder or the head of the family. Although inherited by the eldest son and passed on through generations from father to eldest son, the coat of arms is granted only to worthy bearers. The right to use the coat of arms must be continually granted by the Crown for use on battle flags and gates and turrets and doors of the castle, the home. It is a seal of official documents. That ensign which is recognized by friend and foe is representative of its bearer--his creed, his character, and his commitments. And that is why I felt humbled at this gesture of kindness.<br><br>The story is told that when Leonardo da Vinci resolved to paint the Last Supper, he threw all of his energies into the work. He labored diligently; he spared no pains. He studied and probed and pondered the New Testament, which related the experience of the Master and recorded the first sacramental feast, in order that he might do his best to realize and to reproduce this great, memorable scene. After it was finished he invited a few very close friends, whose opinions he valued very highly, to critique the work that he had done. They gazed upon it with great concern and attention and then one of the critics viewing it spoke with great admiration of the golden chalice on the table at which our Lord and his disciples sat. He said, "Its shape, its color, its size, its symmetry--it represents all that could be desired." Then he said, "This is the most beautiful object in the painting." At this time da Vinci surprised everybody: he picked up a brush with black paint and immediately stroked across the face of the canvas. And then he said, "If what you tell me is true, then my picture is a failure, for I meant my Master's face to be the chief and most beautiful object." This reflects so much of life as it is. As we invest our lives and our talents, let us be sure that these investments reflect the highest of our intentions.<br><br>We observe so often that husbands invest the best of their talents in their occupations or in their extracurricular activities. If you should ask them, "What is the intent of your greatest interests?" they would say, "My family, of course." And so it is in so many other experiences. We invest the sacred hours that are afforded to us, only to look back over the years and say that our lives have not been invested in what we really intended them to be. Maxwell Anderson has his character, Joan of Arc, stimulate us with this statement:<br><br><i>Every man gives his life for what he believes. Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing. ... Our life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it's gone. But to surrender what you are, and live without belief--that's more terrible than dying--more terrible than dying young.</i>[<i>Joan of Lorraine,</i>act 2, interlude 3]<br><br>I am indebted to BYU for many things, but foremost, I suppose, for my exposure to the learning experiences and the friendships that expanded my view of the world and of myself. You are engaged here in a great partnership, as I see it, in learning, with more than a spectator responsibility. Judson Ward, vice-president of Emory University, said in a recent speech:<br><br><i>We tend to over-emphasize the role of the teacher to the neglect of the learner. Too often the teacher is portrayed as a potter seated at the wheel, molding the mind of the student, producing a finished product. The great teacher is better compared to a gardener. He nurtures, cultivates, and stimulates a mind and spirit to grow according to its own unique potential. Great teachers use their talents to arouse students to action. They cajole, taunt, provoke, flatter, inspire or whatever they think will work to send the learner to the library, to his books, to the laboratory, the computer, the field or bedside in order to test hypotheses, clarify issues, satisfy curiosity, or whatnot. Great teachers themselves continue to learn and share the excitement of learning with students. Teachers and students interact as a community of scholars.</i>[Judson C. Ward, Jr., Vice-president, Emory University, September 23, 1976]<br><br>Some months ago I spent a week at a management seminar in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the guest lecturers was Dr. James Gill--a remarkable individual. He heads the Department of Health Services at Harvard University. He spent twelve years in preparation as a Catholic priest, went on to medical school to become a physician, and then pursued a specialty in psychiatry. He made the comment that, to many people, we are living in a time that is considered the age of entitlement. He said that all his life somebody was trying to make something out of him. His parents were trying to make a good boy out of him, his teachers were trying to make a good student out of him, his coaches were trying to make a good ball player out of him, and, in the military service as a navy pilot, they were trying to make a good pilot out of him. He went to Marquette University, and addressing that freshman class on the opening day the head physician said, "You want to be a doctor? You want to be a good doctor? All right, if you're successful, this is what will happen. First of all you will have to spend at least four hundred hours in the library. You will have to cut up a cadaver at least once a week until you know every joint, every muscle, every bone contained in that human body. We have one of the finest faculties of anatomy anywhere in the United States. You will have to pick their brains and seek them out to try to gain from their experience. Now you should understand something," he said. "We don't check on you to see if you're attending class. If you want to stay home and sleep that's your business. We won't call your folks There are so many people waiting to take your place here that we couldn't care less whether you attend class or not. And so, just remember that sometime you will have to certify as a doctor. You will have to pass some very stiff boards, and you must use every resource you have in order to make it."<br><br>Dr. Gill said, "For the first time in my life I realized that somebody had put the monkey squarely on my back and I was almost entirely responsible for the results. I don't mind telling you I was pretty frightened, but I was also thrilled and provoked by the opportunity."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we hear a lot about rights these days. Everybody apparently has a right to be born healthy, a right to read, a right to be educated, a right to be employed, a right to be free, a right to be happy. But have you ever been endowed with a right without being at the same time saddled with a responsibility? Edward Opitz made a comment which I like very much. He said, "Life's alternate responsibilities of reward and punishment imply that men must choose. And because the universe does not jest, it has not given man the freedom to make a choice as to how he will commit his life without at the same time equipping that choice with the power to affect the ultimate outcome." He tells of a hillbilly preacher who put it very simply but very well when he said, "Now de Lord is votin' fo' ya, and de devil is votin' against ya. De way you vote gonna decide de election."<br><br>Another Southern friend of mine says that everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.<br><br>I thank God for the blessings of free agency and the opportunity to become whatever we want to become as we learn the laws that govern the blessing that we seek. And surely it's incumbent upon those of us so abundantly blessed to extend our hand and resources to those whose opportunities are limited. But we must never deny them the divine right to grasp those opportunities. As one great Indian football player from Washington said, "The minorities must rise above their environmental problems, but we will never be able to do it as a group. Each one of us must climb the ladder one at a time." We're so fortunate to have this great attitude as a Mormon legacy.<br><br>Last month I heard one of the most astounding stories I have ever heard. I sat in an audience as we were electrified by a young juvenile court judge in Los Angeles, whose name was Joseph Sorentino. He has written a book entitled<i>Up from Never.</i>He told us this incredible story. His home in Brooklyn was the scene of three pool halls in four blocks, rampaging street gangs, and Mafia killers. By the time he was twenty he had served time in the reformatory, the jail, the brig, and a padded cell for incorrigibles. He flunked out of school four times, went through thirty jobs, and was booted out of the Marines. That's quite a record by age twenty. The second oldest of seven children, Joe's constant desire was to acquire a "rep," or become known. A dropout with no skills, he turned to professional boxing but then quit when he found that his mind was being eroded by heavyweight poundings.<br><br>One night, passing Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High School, he noticed a sign that invited passersby to register for night school. At that moment Joe realized, "My only chance for a better life is through education." He enrolled. He fell in love with learning and graduated with the highest average in the history of the night school. He then enrolled in the University of California at Santa Barbara, became president of the student body, and graduated magna cum laude.<br><br>He reenlisted in the Marines to remove another blemish from his record. After an honorable discharge, he entered Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1967 as the valedictorian of his class. He said, "You can't imagine how I felt looking down over the pulpit and seeing Henry Kissinger and some of the Kennedys and other notables of government sitting on the front row, and me delivering the valedictory address." In this address he recounted the story of his life and then he ended with these words: "Do not look for tragedy or trauma to explain this change. It was mainly a resolution from within." And then he concluded, "I come here today not just to tell my story, but to emphasize that in America we can make such things possible."<br><br>My brothers and sisters, life is not, as some people believe, like a slot machine in which we put as little as possible, always hoping to hit the jackpot. It is rather a careful, intelligent investment from which we receive in terms of what we put in. We must have the faith in the great God of Heaven, who declared, "Thou mayest choose for thyself" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3.17?lang=eng#16">Moses 3:17</a>). Not only must we make the right choices and the best choices, but we must be willing to change and to improve, to recognize that we may indeed change our lives if we have incentive enough and faith enough.<br><br>Now may I conclude by sharing one of my favorite stories told by a great American educator, Dr. Kenneth McFarland. Dr. McFarland was the superintendent of schools in Coffeyville, a small Kansas community. They had a very interesting tradition in that small town: they had the commencement exercises for the junior college and the high school at the same time. It had grown over the years to become a marvelous event. They held it at the football stadium and it was not uncommon that they had four or five thousand spectators and students all in that football stadium attending the commencement. The last year that he was there, the day before commencement, Dr. McFarland was in the dean's office going over some matters with the dean and into the office came one of the very lovely, beautiful young graduating students. She was one of the most popular on campus, a student leader, and a smart girl with a fine scholastic record. This was her concluding year in that junior college. He heard her say that she wanted one ticket for the parents' section; she paid for her cap and gown, and then she left. Her name was Nancy Hollingsworth. Dr. McFarland concluded his business and stepped out into the hall. Waiting for him there was Nancy, and she said, "Dr. McFarland, I've wanted to talk to you for some time about something that's been on my mind, but I simply haven't had the courage because it really is kind of a personal thing. But," she said, "I have a story I'd like to tell you and see if there's something that you can do to help me."<br><br>He said, "She told me a fascinating story of how her father was an engineer on the railroad and how he had been killed. She and her two older brothers, in the early years, were raised by their mother, who was employed in a ladies' ready-to-wear shop." She said that some of the very happy moments of her life were in the evening following dinner after they had dressed in their pajamas.<br><br>"We could talk about anything we wanted to talk about at this time. Mother would tell us stories and we'd laugh. I can remember as though it were yesterday, a time when we were sitting there and we got to laughing. I developed cramps in my stomach and it was so much pain that Mother had to rub my stomach to relax the muscles. She finally tucked us in bed, kissed us good-night, and went to her bedroom. I don't know what happened," Nancy said. "During the night Mother died. We woke up on the morning and, of course, were hysterical. We didn't know what to do. The only living relative we had in the area was Mother's bachelor brother, Uncle Ben. Mother didn't want people to know about her brother because he was the town drunk. About the only time he worked was when he ran out of whiskey. He would work to get enough and then go on a long 'binge.' But," she said, "we loved him so much because he seemed to have plenty of time for us kids. He was the only one we could turn to. So we called him on the telephone and he came right over. We said, 'Uncle Ben, what are we going to do?' and he said, 'I don't know, kids, but whatever it is it won't be as good as you had. But when things quiet down a little bit after the funeral, I'll go down to the court and if you kids want to come and live with me, I'll pray God to give me the gumption to try to raise you right.'"<br><br>Nancy said, "Dr. McFarland, you just can't know what kind of a job he's done. In all those years he has never touched one drop of liquor. In all those years he has never missed one day's work. Everybody's got to feel bad sometime, but if he felt bad, he didn't tell us because he never missed a day's work." Then she said, "Tomorrow is the sixth commencement he has attended. My oldest brother Jim is a medical doctor and he is in his residency now. Tom graduates this spring from MIT as an engineer, has had some wonderful job opportunities, and is going to take one. Tonight I'm graduating with a junior college degree and then I'm going to Pittsburgh Teacher's College to become a teacher. So this is the sixth graduation that he has attended and not once has he been willing to sit in the parents' section. Each time we ask him why, he says he just doesn't think it's the proper respect for Mom. So this is my last chance, Dr. McFarland. I've got a ticket for the parents' section but he won't accept it. After you've introduced the parents and you have them stand," she said, "is there something special that you might do to recognize Uncle Ben?"<br><br>Dr. McFarland replied, "I'd have been very disappointed if you hadn't shared this with me. You just leave this to me and I'll figure something out."<br><br>The graduation was wonderful. There was just enough breeze to float the flags. The students looked wonderful in their robes; the college students came in first, and then the high school graduates came in and sat down. They had the band playing "Pomp and Circumstance" for the processional. As the band faded out, the orchestra came in and picked it up. As they faded out, the organ came in. For the grand finale, when the graduates were all seated, the band, orchestra, and organ came in together and filled the air with vibrant notes. Dr. McFarland went through the introduction and then, as usual, the parents stood up and were recognized with a big hand of applause. He then looked down on the second row and there was Nancy, sitting with a face about a foot long. She thought that he'd forgotten. But he said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I want all the Uncle Bens in the audience who have a graduate representative in the graduating class to please stand." Suddenly a hush went over that audience. He said, "I knew I'd really hooked on to something big. But nothing happened." Finally he said, "Surely with an audience this size there has got to be at least one Uncle Ben who has a representative in the graduating class. We will not proceed with this commencement exercise until he stands." And then slowly, up on the back row, way up near the top of the bleachers, a tall, gangly figure began to stand. Kids on the top row of the graduating class were expecting it and were the first ones to clap. That triggered a gigantic applause from the entire stadium until it rocked all the chairs and those who were sitting there. They knew more about Uncle Ben than he thought they knew. He seemed so embarrassed that he was telling people to sit down.<br><br>Commencement exercise continued and after the graduates were dismissed, everyone came together and began to shake hands as they usually do. Down the middle row came Nancy Hollingsworth, dragging a very reluctant Uncle Ben. As they approached the stand, Dr. McFarland came down and said, "I am so happy to meet you, sir. I have two questions which I must ask you. First of all, what were you thinking when this gigantic applause roared through the stadium?"<br><br>Uncle Ben began to laugh and said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I thought I was dreaming. I said to myself, if I'm dreaming I must be asleep. And if I'm asleep, I'm going to be missing Nancy's graduation and I'd better get going."<br><br>Dr. McFarland said, "Now the second question is--and I've given a lot of thought to this--what did you tell the authorities when you went down to get permission to take over the kids? You didn't have a very good case, did you?"<br><br>Uncle Ben replied, "Doc, I don't mind telling you that I didn't have a case at all. But the judge asked me"--of course they were well acquainted-- "'Ben, why should I give you the kids?' I looked right at him and I said, 'The Master said a man can be born again. He said that a man can change and he can stay changed--can change completely. And I believe that he meant<i>any</i>man can do that, even a drunken ne'er-do-well like me.'"<br><br>"The judge took off his glasses, and he turned around and looked out the window for a few moments, and then he said, 'I believe that deal included you, Ben. We're going to turn the kids over to you. You take them home, and in thirty days we're going to come out and see how you're getting along. If you're doing a good job tending the kids and providing for them, we'll leave them with you. But if you aren't, then we'll have to take them and find another home for them.'"<br><br>"Those three kids went with me back to my house, and we knelt down the very first thing around my bed. I promised God that if he'd hold on to me, I'd hold on to the kids. The<i>five</i>of us have been getting along real good ever since."<br><br>Now brothers and sisters, we sometimes give a lot of lip service to the meaning of change. Most of us do not really believe that it is possible in our case. We think that we have unusual circumstances about our lives, and we alibi our way around building the resistance that is necessary to overcome the habits. Habit is the enemy of change and we must deal with the habits we have accumulated. But my testimony to you is that our Creator, our Heavenly Father, has endowed us with great potentials that we are not aware of. We must grasp our opportunities and we must do all that we can to bring about the changes so that we might realize the foreordained blessings, the divine rights, and the great opportunities that God has given us. I bear witness to you that the gospel is true and that Jesus is the Christ, the author of our eternal salvation, and our great exemplar for change and for perfection. I further testify to you that Spencer W. Kimball is one of the most choice of all the Lord's prophets who have ever been privileged to come to this earth. How very fortunate we are to live at a time when this noble man is able to be with us and to set such a great example of those principles that we are talking about today. His entire life has been dedicated to the process of change and improvement that he might more fully fulfill his stewardship. That we may have a similar incentive and the power of our Heavenly Father to bring about those changes which we desire, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<h1> of Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning. I think I am glad to be here. I have been thinking a lot about this assignment. Last week, after Bishop Clarke was here, I asked him how he got along and how he felt about what went on. He said, "Well, they gave me every chance to be a success, and if I wasn't, it wasn't their fault." My favorite people are, of course, women because I have five daughters and no sons. And then to have the Women's Chorus sing one of my favorite numbers ["The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close"] has thrilled me. Over the years our daughters have learned to play several numbers on the piano that are my favorites and this is one of them. I have told them that those are the numbers I would like to have them play at my funeral, and this may be it.<br><br>After Bishop Clarke spoke last week, my secretary, in a very casual but concerned way, said, "Bishop, I think that they may call from the Y and want to know what you're going to talk about." You see, she had only taken a couple of notes at that point and was not sure<i>I</i>knew my subject either. She was trying to help me get something in my mind. Rather quickly I told her, "I think I'll talk on how to be happy and enjoy it."<br><br>I have thought since then about what I said to her. I am one who believes that happiness is kind of a do-it-yourself project. It is home made. I have had some interesting conversations over the years with many people, and I have found we vary in degree of happiness. Some of us are up here, and others down here, and many fall in the range between. Happiness and peace are not always constant; but we have our peaks and our valleys. I have found some who are always waiting for happiness to happen. They are always waiting for it to come, and waiting for the right conditions and circumstances so that they can be happy.<br><br>Over the years I have talked with many married couples who have had or are having marital problems. I have had many of them tell me, "Well, I guess if we just weren't married we might be happier." And then I have talked with hundreds of young people who get to be a certain age and tell me, "If we could just be married, I know we'd be happy." And I have had others tell me, "Oh, if I could just get out of school and get to work I'd be happy." And then I have had others who are out of school and working tell me, "Oh, for the good old days! To be back in school, where I was really happy!" I have had some say, "If I just had more money I would be happy." (I have not had many tell me, "If I didn't have so much money I would be happy.") Some have said, "If I were just a little taller I could be happier," or "If I were just a little shorter I could be happier," "If I were just a little bigger . . . a little smaller. . . ." It seems that many of us are constantly waiting for something to happen so that we can enjoy happiness. That is why I said, "how to be happy<i>and enjoy it</i>."<br><br>Interestingly enough, there are those who have found the secret to happiness. And, may I say, we must understand this eternal principle: Happiness does not mean our lives are void of problems--that does not mean happiness, and those who understand that recognize problems as blessings. Life is filled with blessings that are made up of problems--our mountains to climb that we might be even happier than we may think we are. But those who have found this secret have found a secret that will bring happiness to them in this life and through the eternities. There are two or three steps that I would like to talk to you about this morning. They are rather simple steps; you will not even have to make any notes because I think you will be able to remember them.<br><br>First I would like to refer to the scriptures to what I think is one of the cardinal principles of success as it relates to happiness. I am going to read to you out of the eighteenth chapter of Mosiah, starting with the seventh verse--these words are not new to you, but maybe I can expand them in a way that might bring a little more meaning in your lives. This is Alma speaking:<br><br><i>And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus they were called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God</i>[now he gives the secret; as we read this he is giving the secret elements of happiness],<i>and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, . . .</i>[then he goes on a bit further and says this:]<i>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts</i>[now the desire again, the desire to "bear one another's burdens," the desire to "mourn with those that mourn," the desire to "comfort those that stand in need of comfort," the desire to "stand as witnesses of God," he said]<i>, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</i>[Mosiah 18:7–10]<br><br>In that last passage I read, there was the secret word, the first of the secrets to happiness: serve. As you review again, sometime, those elements that Alma talked about, you will recognize that he is talking about service, that being one of the key elements of happiness. There are several other scriptural references which let us know how important this point of service is and what it can do for someone who believes it. True disciples of Christ, brothers and sisters, are those who serve. Some of us may not understand what we really mean by service--remember the experience that two of the brethren had after the Savior had been crucified. It is found in Acts. Remember that Peter and John went to the temple past the Gate Beautiful, and as they went by the gate into the temple, there sat a man who had been lame since he was born. He had his hand out and was asking for alms; he was begging. Peter and John came by and the man looked up at Peter and held his hand out.<br><br><i>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said</i>[speaking to the lame man]<i>, Look on us.</i><br><br><i>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. Then Peter said</i>[now these are some more secrets]<i>, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he</i>[meaning Peter]<i>took him by the right hand, and lifted him up.</i>[Acts 3:4–7]<br><br>Peter gave us another secret there. Remember the words, "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee," as you think of service to others.<br><br>Another time in the New Testament, the Twelve were gathered together with the Savior just before he was to be crucified, and he was instructing them; I suppose they were having quite a conversation about instructions. At one point in the conversation James and John, who were, as you know, brothers, asked the Savior if he would grant unto them their wish, and as the Lord asked them, "What would ye that I should do for you?" they said simply, "Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory." They wanted to be lifted up above the crowd, so to speak, and the Savior told them, "To sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give" (see Mark 10:35–40).<br><br>Then we read in Mark this account: "And when the ten heard it [this is the other ten of the Twelve], they began to be much displeased with James and John" (Mark 10:41). You see, they saw James and John as wanting to be lifted up, in a sense, above the others.<br><br><i>But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</i><br><br><i>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</i><br><br><i>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</i><br><br><i>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</i>[Mark 10:42–45]<br><br>Some time ago I was attending a stake conference in another state. The stake president met me at the airport, and we had about an hour's drive to the stake center. As we were driving we talked about many things, and the conversation began to center on an individual who lived in the stake. The stake president told me about a young lady who had gone on a mission about twenty years ago, and while she was there she contracted polio. She walked into the hospital in this New England city to take some tests, and she never walked again. She was paralyzed. And he said, "For twenty years she's been paralyzed from her neck down; she's not able to move any muscles below her neck, except a few in her fingers. But she's an unusual young lady. She has a spirit that is something wonderful." Well, before stake conference I always get very nervous--not quite as nervous as before I come to BYU, but just about--and I said, "I need to be built up, President; let's go by and see the young lady."<br><br>So we went by her home; she was living with her parents. We went into her room, and there she lay on a bed, surrounded by the things that would keep her interested and busy during the day. As I walked into the room, I saw this physically pitiful sight, but I felt a spirit that I have felt in very few places. I was overcome by her spirit. I began to ask her some questions. As she lay there I saw that she could move a few fingers on one hand and a few on the other, but she could not raise or lower her arms. She had an air pump on a table by her side. She would hold the tube in her hand and every few minutes put it into her mouth. It would blow air into her lungs. She would then turn away and her lungs would deflate. She did this several times an hour to keep the air moving into her body. And I said, "Tell me what you do during the day. Here you have lain for twenty years with this physical condition."<br><br>And her parents said, "We'll show you what she does during the day."<br><br>So they brought a typewriter and put it in front of her on her bed. Her mother laid one hand on the typewriter keys, and then she took the other and laid it on the typewriter keys. She then showed us how with these few fingers she would type. She said, "During the day I find those who are sick and discouraged and write poetry and letters to them and send them good wishes that will make them happy. I try to help those who are less fortunate than I am." There she lay with hardly anything physical going for her, but with a spirit that could perform miracles.<br><br>Then her parents brought a phone and put it in her hands and moved it up to her ear and mouth, and then she, with two fingers, punched the telephone dial. And in this way she called those who are not as well off as she is and cheered them up during the day. Remember what Peter said: "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee." This is also what Alma was talking about. If you have a desire to bear one another's burdens, if you have a desire to comfort, these are the acts that bring happiness in spite of physical conditions that, maybe, are not the best.<br><br>Now let me give you a second suggestion. The first is service, or thinking of others before you think of yourself; now the second. In my conversation over the years with husbands and wives, parents and children who make up family groups, I find that if we would read this, believe it, and practice it, we would have very few problems in marriage relationships, or in relationships between children and parents or between brothers and sisters or with each other. It is a very simple eight-word passage contained in 1 John, the fourth chapter, and is recorded in verse nineteen: "We love him, because he first loved us," the secret being,<i>"He first loved us."</i><br><br>Many of us seem to be waiting for others to give an expression. I am not talking particularly of a dating situation, so be careful there; but I am talking about marriage and family situations. Many of us in our homes, many of us in our relationships with brothers and sisters, many of us in our dealings with people seem to be constantly waiting for them to say something that would let us know that they feel good about us. But the lesson is, "We love him, because he first loved us."<br><br>Many of us have committed ourselves, I suppose, to the proposition that we will go fifty percent of the way when there is a problem situation: "I'll go halfway if you go halfway." The problem is that we get mixed up and there are not too many who know what fifty percent is. Sometimes instead of going fifty percent we may find later it was only forty-nine and a half percent. If one of the parties goes forty-nine and a half percent, there is still a narrow slit there before we get together. And that is where the important things drop through the crack--the important things that cause happiness to occur. So may I suggest to you in your pattern of life, as you get into marriage situations, that the girls particularly ought to go eighty percent of the way in making things happy in the home. And then, to you brethren I would suggest that you especially ought to go eighty percent of the way. When you each go eighty percent of the way, you do not have to worry about that little narrow area that the problems occur in because you have both gone over enough, so that there is no room for error. If you happen to miss by one percent you still do not blow the marriage out of the water. There is still room for those kinds of mistakes.<br><br>Remember what was recorded in John: "We love him, because he first loved us." I remember some years ago listening to a father bless a little baby, his first child, at a fast and testimony meeting. After the blessing, as you all know, we have time for testimonies, and the father came to the stand and expressed his love for this little baby and his thanks to Heavenly Father for this little child. He said to us something that I have not forgotten: "But you know, this is an interesting experience having a little baby, especially the first one. He doesn't seem to understand anything we say to him. We talk to him and he doesn't talk back, nor does he react. So it seems all we can do is just hold him in our arms and cuddle him and kiss him and squeeze him and tell him we love him, and do things for him that will let him know that we love him." After the testimony, I thought, "I hope that young father never forgets that principle, regardless of the age of his little boy or little girl: Love him first,<i>love him first,</i>and then he will love you." I hope that into his adult life the father would feel comfortable in holding that boy or even man in his arms and letting him know that.<br><br>I am sure that here among us today there are those of you who have never had someone to express to you, in such a way that you have really felt it, this feeling of love and acceptance. I have met with many, many young people, college-age and younger and older, who have never really known how they stood with their parents or brothers and sisters. I remember not long ago I was touring a mission in a foreign country and while we were there I asked the president, "Are there any particular problems in the mission?"<br><br>He said, "Well, we have one missionary that wants to go home. The only reason he hasn't gone home is that I still have his passport." You brethren who have been out know what that is like. "But," he said, "I think I'm gong to have to let him go."<br><br>I said, "Can I talk to him? Would I be able to help you in any way?"<br><br>He said, "I don't really think so. I think we've done all the talking we can."<br><br>I met him before the meeting--I was shaking hands with a group of missionaries and I shook hands with this one young man and did not know who he was, except I felt a little different spirit with him, and afterwards I asked the president who that young man was and he said, "He's the one that wants to go home."<br><br>I said, "Do you mind asking him after the meeting if he would come up and let me visit with him?"<br><br>He said, "That's fine."<br><br>So after the meeting, the elder came up to the stand and I shook hands with him and said, "I appreciate your coming up. I wonder if you'd mind if I visited with you?"<br><br>And he kind of shrugged his shoulders and said, "I don't care. It's up to you." You know, as if to say, "It's your nickel; spend it how you want it."<br><br>So we went over to the side, and in this particular meeting room in this chapel we were in there was a large stained glass window on one side. I have talked with missionaries before about not going home before they were supposed to go home, so I had a really good talk prepared on that subject--at least I thought it was. And as I talked to him he kept looking out the stained glass window. Never did I get his eye. I kept giving my speech. I was right in the very key part of it where I thought, "If anything will turn him this will."<br><br>Then he said to me, "Bishop Peterson, if you look out the window very carefully you'll see it's snowing."<br><br>I heaved a sigh and thought, "Oh, boy. He doesn't even know I'm here, except he wants me to see the snow. He hasn't heard a thing I've said." I looked out with him and said, "You're right, elder. It's snowing."<br><br>We finished the talk like that, and for the next two days I was around and with him in different meetings. As I was speaking in one meeting he was sitting over at the side reading a newspaper. That unnerved me just a bit. You can see what his attitude was and how I was developing an attitude toward him.<br><br>The last evening we were together in a meeting. After the meeting was over, I was down in front shaking hands with some young people and saw him just a few feet away out of the corner of my eye. Then something happened to me that I had not yet experienced. I had been asking for help; I had been praying about some way to help this young man. And then for a fleeting moment something happened to me that I had not experienced up to that point as it related to this young man. I had a feeling about this young man come over me that almost consumed me. I excused myself from talking to the other folks and went over to him and took hold of his hand, and as he was about three or four inches taller than I was I looked up into his eyes and said, "Elder, I've enjoyed getting acquainted with you. I want you to know that I love you. I really do." And I left him and did not say any more. And he did not say anything.<br><br>I walked to the back door, and as I was about to go out, there he was again. I went up to him, put my arm around him, and said, "What I said up in front a few minutes ago is true; I really love you."<br><br>And then he held onto my hand a minute and he said, "Bishop Peterson, that's the first time in my life anyone has ever told me they loved me." Now, you see, I could understand why he was discouraged, why he was confused, why he wanted to go home, why he did not know what to do. Remember the principle, brothers and sisters: "We love him, because he first loved us." That is the second secret.<br><br>The third is very simple, and that is not to give up. There are those who try and try and then give up; and then there are those who try and try and never give up, and to those comes the success. Remember the story about the fishermen; remember how, after the Savior was crucified, some of the apostles were fishing, and remember how they fished all night and did not find a fish. They cast their nets into the water, brought them back, and every time they brought them back empty. They were tired and discouraged. Morning came and they went toward the shore. As they approached, they saw a man walking on the shore. It was the Savior, but they did not recognize him at that time. And as they got closer to him, he said to them, "Brethren, lower your nets in the water over here." And they put their nets in one more time, and did not question him; they did not say, "We're tired; we've been trying; we've fished all night; there aren't any fish; why should we do it again?" They did not ask him that question, but they listened, obeyed, cast theirs nets in, and pulled them back, and this time they pulled them back filled with fishes (see John 21:1–6).<br><br>May the Lord bless you, my brothers and sisters, to remember these elements of happiness: service, love first, and perseverance. I leave my testimony with you that Jesus is the Christ. I want you to know that I know that he is coming. And I pray that we will all be ready when he comes, that we might enjoy that eternal happiness that is promised to those who are faithful. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>H.

<h1>ourself: Losing Yourself in Service - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good evening, brothers and sisters. You're really quite a picture as I see you here--tremendous, a very remarkable group. I suppose that most of you have been fasting today. I would suppose that on this campus at least 20,000 people have been fasting and that you have accompanied your fasting with earnest prayer. I think that's a most remarkable phenomenon. Most of you, I assume, have fasted and prayed with a purpose--that you might find answers to perplexing personal problems or the needs of others, or that moisture might fall upon these arid western lands. I hope you haven't prayed for snow with the hope that you could go skiing on Sunday.<br><br>I believe that the Lord will hear our earnest supplications, if we will back up our fasting and prayers with goodness in our lives. To ancient Israel he made a remarkable promise in these words:<br><br><i>If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</i><br><br><i>Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</i><br><br><i>And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely....</i><br><br><i>For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you....</i><br><br><i>And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</i>[Leviticus 26:3–5, 9, 12]<br><br>That to me is a marvelous promise, and I believe the Lord will fulfill his word in this day, as he promised to do anciently, if we will live as we ought to live.<br><br>Last Sunday morning I was in the home of a stake president in a small Idaho town. Before the morning prayer, the family read together a few verses of scripture. Among these were some of the words of Jesus as recorded in John 12:24: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." No doubt he was referring to his own forthcoming death, declaring that except he die his mission in life would be largely in vain. But I see in this a further meaning. It seems to me that he is saying to each of us that unless we lose ourselves in the service of others our lives are largely lived to no real purpose, for he went on to say, "He that loveth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" (John 12:25). Or, as recorded in Luke, "Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it" (Luke 17:33). In other words, he who lives only unto himself withers and dies, while he who forgets himself in the service of others grows and blossoms in this life and in eternity.<br><br>That morning in stake conference the president with whom I had stayed was released after thirteen years of faithful service. There was a great outpouring of love and appreciation, not because of this man's wealth, not because of his stature in the business community, but because of the great service he had unselfishly given. Without thought of personal interest, he had driven tens of thousands of miles in all kinds of weather. He had spent literally thousands of hours in the interest of others. He had neglected his personal affairs to assist those who needed his help. And in so doing he had come alive, and had become great in the eyes of those he had served.<br><br>A new president was installed that morning and there were many who were proud and happy concerning him; but most proud and most happy was a little man who sat at the stake clerk's table, a rural mail carrier by profession. He it was who, twelve years ago, had with quiet, patient labor persuaded his totally inactive neighbor to come back into activity. It would have been so much easier to have let that indifferent neighbor go his own way, and it would have been so much easier of the mail carrier to have lived his own quiet life. But he had put aside his personal interests in the interest of another; and that other, last Sunday, became the honored and respected leader of a great stake of Zion. As the people sustained their new president, the little man at the clerk's table wept tears of gratitude. In living beyond himself, he had brought to life the man sustained that morning as president of the Jerome Stake of Zion. Phillips Brooks once made this significant observation: "How carefully most men creep into nameless graves, while now and again one or two forget themselves into immortality."<br><br>We recently visited an old friend in southern India. We had first come to know him twelve years ago when we went to New Delhi in response to his request that someone come to baptize him. Ten years earlier he had found a tract, but how or by whom it had come into that part of the world he did not know. He wrote to the Church offices in Salt Lake City. Other pieces of literature were sent to him, which he read. We did not baptize him when first we met him; we felt he was not ready. But we arranged for him to be taught the gospel and he was baptized some months later.<br><br>He works as an accountant in a cement plant in that part of the world. His salary is meager--less than the salary that some of you get pushing brooms around this campus. His house is small; it would fit into the front room of the homes that most of you come from. But his heart is large and overflowing. Out of a great love for others that has come of the gospel of Jesus Christ, he has built with his own hands, on a piece of ground he bought from his savings, a school. It is a simple, rough building; but here some four hundred poor children are being brought out of the darkness of illiteracy into the light of learning. What this will mean in their lives is almost beyond calculation. And near the school is another small building which he constructed with his own hands. It is an orphanage with forty-five little children, tiny babies and children up to five years of age, unwanted by others, cast away by their parents. As my wife looked at them lying on boards because he could not afford cots or mattresses, the tears welled in her eyes. But a man with a great heart and a thin purse sees those tiny undernourished babies as children of God, and feels a great and compelling responsibility to do something to help them.<br><br>Then through his efforts, there are five small branches of the Church in those poor rural villages of southern India. Here the members have constructed three or four little buildings, neat and clean, and over the door of each is a sign, in both English and Tamil, that reads, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." The floors are concrete and without benches. To seal the concrete, cow dung mixed with water was spread on, allowed to dry, and then polished. It made for a clean-looking floor where the people sat as together we met, shared our testimonies, and partook of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.<br><br>There are now about two hundred members of the Church among the vast millions of India. Somehow, someday, under the plan of the Lord, the time will come when the gospel will be preached in that land with power, and the harvest will follow. And someone will write the story of the Church in India. That story will be incomplete unless there is a chapter on my friend, Paul Thiruthuvadoss, a man who has lost himself in the service of others.<br><br>On that long, recent journey around the earth, we met another friend who once was on the faculty of Brigham Young University. Now his children are grown; and he and his wife concluded that rather than retire into idleness as they could well have done, and as millions of others in this land are doing, they would find someplace in the world where they could help some of our Father's children by teaching them the truths that will save them. They found such a land. They sold their beautiful Utah home; they sold their Lincoln Continental; they left friends and relatives for a distant, less comfortable place. As they have cast their bread upon the waters, the Lord has opened opportunities for them to teach and lift and help. No one can foretell the consequences of their pioneering. As I have thought of this man and woman, who have left the comforts of their home and the society of their friends at an age when most people want to slow down and take it easy, I have thought of the words of the Lord, "And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life" (Matthew 19:29).<br><br>Generally speaking, the most miserable people I know are those obsessed with themselves; the happiest people I know are those who lose themselves in the service of others. I think there is a vast amount of that kind of misery among students. I hear much complaining--I hear complaints about the pressures of school as if it were a burden rather than an opportunity to partake of the knowledge of the earth. I even hear complaints about housing and about food. I picked from my library shelf the other evening a volume of American verse. I would like to read you the words of Lucinda Matlock from Edgar Lee Masters'<i>Spoon River Anthology.</i><br><br><i>I went to the dances at Chandlerville,</i><br><i>And played snap-out at Winchester.</i><br><i>One time we changed partners,</i><br><i>Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,</i><br><i>And then I found Davis.</i><br><i>We were married and lived together for seventy years.</i><br><i>Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,</i><br><i>Eight of whom we lost ere I reached the age of sixty.</i><br><i>I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,</i><br><i>I made the garden, and for holiday</i><br><i>Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,</i><br><i>And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,</i><br><i>And many a flower and medicinal weed--</i><br><i>Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.</i><br><i>At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,</i><br><i>And passed to a sweet repose.</i><br><i>What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,</i><br><i>Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?</i><br><i>Degenerate sons and daughters,</i><br><i>Life is too strong for you--</i><br><i>It takes life to love life.</i><br>[<i>The Book of American Poetry,</i>p. 378]<br><br>If the pressures of school are too heavy, if you complain about your housing and the food you eat, I can suggest a cure for your problems. Lay your books aside for a few hours, leave your room, and go visit someone who is old and lonely. There are many such right here in this valley. Or visit those who are sick and discouraged; there are hundreds of that kind here, including not a few on this campus, who need the kind of encouragement you could give. If you are complaining about life, it is because you are thinking only of yourself. There was for many years a sign on the wall of a shoe repair shop I patronized. It read, "I complained because I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet." The most effective medicine for the sickness of self-pity is to lose oneself in the service of others.<br><br>There are some girls on this campus who are worrying themselves almost sick over the question of whether they will have opportunity for marriage. Of course marriage is desirable; of course it is hoped for and worked for and sought after. But worrying about it will never bring it. In fact, it may have the opposite effect, for there is nothing that dulls a personality so much as a negative outlook. Possibly some of you will not be married; but don't forget that there are other things in life, other pursuits to be followed. I would like to suggest that you read the story of Dr. Anne G. Osborne in the March issue of the<i>Ensign</i>magazine. Here is a highly trained instructor at the University of Utah medical school, an eminent specialist in her field, and a member of the Sunday School General Board. I like the title of her short article. She calls it, "The Ecstasy of the Agony: How to be Single and Sane at the Same Time." Speaking candidly of her age as thirty-three, she mentions marriage as a promised blessing, but she soon makes it clear that there is a stimulating and productive life for those single young women who will get interested in serving the needs of others. Says she,<br><br><i>As single Church members we can either engage in morose personal recrimination and self-flagellation, bemoaning our single status and living on the edge of desperation, or we can use this interim period in our lives as a time of active, creative waiting. ...</i>[She continues,]<i>When discouragement weighs heavily, look around. ... I have found that a sure cure for depression is to realize someone out there needs me. In blessing someone else, my needs and problems are quickly consumed in the warm glow of knowing that I have brightened another's life and that what I have done is pleasing to the Lord.</i><br><br>[She concludes with these words:]<i>Let us then rejoice in this precious treasure, time, and thank the Lord for a special gift. We truly have time to become interesting because we are interested.</i><br><br>I want to commend those of you who are eligible to go to the temple and who go. In this work in the House of the Lord is found the very essence of selfless service. In my judgment, one of the miracles of our day is the great consecration of time and effort on the part of hundreds of thousands of busy people, including many of you busy students, in behalf of the dead. Those of you who engage in this service know that out of it all comes a sweet and satisfying feeling. It becomes literally a medicine to cure many of the ailments of our lives. From such experience we come to realize that only when we serve others do we truly serve the Lord.<br><br>Declared the Lord in this dispensation, "Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness." And then he adds these significant words: "For the power is in them..." (D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28). The power is in us, my dear brethren and sisters--the power to do significant things on our own initiative, if we will become anxiously engaged.<br><br>I think of some of the people who have had to do with the work in some of the areas where I have had responsibility. One able thinker, and I do not remember whether it was Emerson or Carlyle--I took them both the same semester--said that every great institution is but the lengthened shadow of a great man. I have thought, as I have met some Koreans here, of the status of our work in Korea, where today we have two strong missions and a strong stake of Zion. All of this is the lengthened shadow of Dr. Kim and the two young men who taught him the gospel while he was a student at Cornell University--Oliver Wayman and Don C. Wood. They stirred within their associate student an interest in reading the Book of Mormon. Their interest in him, their activities with him were entirely separate from the reasons for their working on an advanced degree that could have consumed every minute of his waking time, but they took time to teach and to learn; and when the Korean Ph.D. returned to his native land, he took with him his love for the Book of Mormon and for the Church whose services he had attended in Ithaca, New York. American servicemen involved in the Korean War had also shared the gospel with some of their associates. And the presence of Dr. Kim, man of learning and man of responsibility in the nation of Korea, became a catalyst that led to the establishment of the work, including the sending of missionaries from Japan. Dr. Kim is dead, but the work lives on in splendor, touching for eternal good an ever-increasing number of lives in the "Land of the Morning Calm."<br><br>In the Philippines today we have more than 20,000 members of the Church. We have two strong missions and a stake of Zion; it is one of the more productive areas in the entire world. When the history of the work in the Philippines is properly written, it must include the story of Sister Maxine Grimm, whom some of you may know--a girl from Tooele, Utah, who served with the Red Cross in the Pacific campaigns of the Second World War. She married an American army officer, and after the war they established their home in Manila. She did all she could to teach the gospel to others; she pleaded that missionaries be sent. Her husband had legal work done and did many other things to make it possible for the missionaries to come. It would have been much easier for them to have simply gone along their way, making money and enjoying the fruits of it; but Sister Grimm was unceasing in her efforts and in her pleas.<br><br>I had responsibility for the work in Asia at that time, and I carried her pleas to the First Presidency, who, in 1961, authorized the extension of formal missionary work to that land. In May of 1961 we held a meeting to begin the work. We had no place to meet and received permission from the American Embassy to do so at the American Military Cemetery on the outskirts of Manila. There, where are solemnly remembered the sacrifices of more than 50,000 men who gave their lives in the cause of freedom, we gathered together at 6:30 in the morning. Sister Grimm played the little portable organ she had carried through the campaigns of the Pacific war, and we sang the songs of Zion in a strange land. We bore testimony together and invoked the blessings of heaven on what we were to begin there. Present was one native Filipino member of the Church.<br><br>That was the beginning of something marvelous, the commencement of a miracle. The rest is history, discouraging at times and glorious at others. I was there for the area conference held a year and a half ago with President Kimball and others. Some 18,000 members of the Church were assembled in the great Aranetta Coliseum, the largest indoor meeting place in the Republic. I wept as I thought of the earlier years, and I remembered with appreciation the women who largely forgot her own interests as she relentlessly pursued her dream of the day when the Church would be strong in the land in which she then lived, bringing happiness of a kind previously unknown to thousands of wonderful people. But, you say, if we were in an exotic place like the Philippines, we would do likewise. I would hope so. But let me say that opportunities are all around us to stretch our lives and our interests in behalf of others.<br><br>The other evening in Phoenix, Arizona, I interviewed a young man who had traveled for four or five hours to see me. He wanted to go on a mission, but his previous behavior had cast a serious cloud over that possibility. He told me that he had been totally divorced from the Church, as had been every other member of his family. But at his job he met a man who was a member of the Church and who lived in the same ward in which he lived, and the man asked the bishop for the opportunity to try to touch this boy. The man started by telling the boy that he was a home teacher. The boy asked what that was. The man explained, and invited the boy to go with him. The boy, out of curiosity, agreed to try it. They went the first time; it wasn't too bad. Another time followed. The man suggested that the boy read the Book of Mormon.<br><br>"Who do you think I am that I would take time to read that long book?" was the response.<br><br>The man pleaded with the boy, "Read just five minutes a day."<br><br>"Not on your life," came the reply.<br><br>"Then read just one minute a day," the man challenged.<br><br>The boy finally agreed to read one minute a day. A glow came into his eyes as he told me that the one minute became five minutes, and then thirty minutes, and then an hour, and he added, "That's why I've driven five hours to come to see you, to see if I can go on a mission."<br><br>Well, in conclusion I just want to say to you who are here tonight, forget yourselves and reach out. Occasionally, put in the background your own personal, selfish interests. Reach out in service to others. In so doing, you will find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it" (Mark 8:35). Those words are as true today as when they were first spoken. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."<br><br>I have known a little of that of which I speak tonight. I testify that it is true. I testify that God, our Eternal Father, lives. I testify that Jesus is the Christ. I testify that this is their work. I invoke the blessings of heaven upon each of you as you reach out to help others, that in so doing you may find your true selves and bless greatly the world in which you live. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1>ter and Hogwash: Mark Twain and Religion - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When discussing Mark Twain's religious attitudes, his biographers have characteristically focused on the last decades of his life, those final, frustrating years in which Twain said going to church gave him dysentery. Nevertheless, the early years--the western years as it were--are crucial to any real understanding of Twain's attitude toward religion, revealing moments of a remarkable religious experience and providing the backdrop against which those last decades, so full of financial strife and personal tragedy, must be seen. It is of that early period, completed before he was 50 years old, that I wish to speak.<br><br>Twain frequently called his religious life "Presbyterianism," the faith of his mother's family, but that label became for him a kind of shoebox repository into which he shoved everything from the faith John Knox espoused to the most nebulous sort of Christian belief. Unlike his friend William Dean Howells, who worried a great deal about the difference between a Unitarian and a Universal, Twain did not have a mind turned to fine theological distinctions. But he did have a soul gripped by the Puritan fathers, a grip which relentlessly affected his moods and his metaphors. He named his house cats, rather apocalyptically, Famine, Pestilence, Satan, and Sin; he thought the height of confidence was a Christian with four aces; smugness was a friend waiting for a vacancy in the trinity; and so on ad infinitum--or, for him, ad nauseum. Fear, punishment, conscience, duty, the hand of God, death--these were the staples in his moral pantry. A compulsive guilt seeker, he blamed himself for at least the deaths of a brother, a son, and a daughter, and he finally despised the human race because it included men like himself. As his closest minister-friend, Joseph Twitchell, once said, Sam Clemens was too orthodox on the doctrine of total human depravity.<br><br>This religious preoccupation and subsequent struggle is brilliantly if unwittingly posed in that earliest boyhood image of the ponderous word of God suffocating an already dying man. Twain wrote in his<i>Autobiography:</i><br><br><i>The shooting down of poor Smarr in the Main Street at noonday supplied me with dreams and in them I always saw again the grotesque closing picture--the great family Bible spread open upon the profane old man's breast by some thoughtful idiot ... adding the torture of its leaden weight to the dying struggles. We are curiously made. In all that throng of gaping and sympathetic onlookers there was not one with common sense enough to perceive that an anvil would have been in better taste there than the Bible, less open to sarcastic criticism and swifter in its atrocious work. In my nightmares I gasped and struggled for breath under the crush of that vast book for many a night.</i>[Samuel L. Clemens,<i>The Writings of Mark Twain</i>(Definitive Edition) 36:17; hereinafter cited as<i>Writings</i>]<br><br>For the most part, he gasped and struggled under the crush of it for most of his life.<br><br>The first Sunday School Sam attended in Hannibal, Missouri, was held in the then newly finished Methodist church known as "the Old Ship of Zion," and the teacher of Sam's class there was a stonemason by the name of Richmond. "He was a very kindly and considerate Sunday School teacher," Sam recalled more than half a century later, "and he was never hard on me" (<i>Writings,</i>37:214). For the nearly three years he attended the Old Ship of Zion, Sam remained under Mr. Richmond's spiritual care and out of those few years and fond memories came the seeds of a remarkable literature. As his literary advisor and most perceptive friend later observed, "There are no more vital passages in his fiction than those which embody character as it is affected for good as well as evil by the severity of the local Sunday schooling and church going (William Dean Howells,<i>My Mark Twain,</i>p. 172; hereinafter cited as Howells).<br><br>It is unlikely that Sam ever attended the Old Ship of Zion after his eighth year, yet perhaps because of the fondness with which he remembered his experiences there it remained in his imagination as the setting for episodes which took place well into his adolescent years.<br><br>In 1848 all the Clemens family but Sam's father formally joined the Presbyterian Church, much to the delight of his grandmother Casey who always said her favorite doctrine was predestination. It was then that young Sam learned, in Howells's famous phrase, "to fear God and dread the Sunday School" (Howells, p. 125).<br><br>As often as it seemed advisable, the boy would violate the Sabbath by rolling rocks down Holiday Hill or by swimming in the Mississippi River. Of course providential displeasure with this latter sin was serious wrath to incur and it was done at the very peril of one's soul. Sam said he was nearly drowned nine times as a boy, and he didn't need any sermons to read the divine warnings in those fateful moments. Twain once recalled a schoolmate who had fallen out of a flatboat in which the boys had been playing. "Being loaded with sin, he went to the bottom like an anvil," Twain remembered (<i>Writings</i>12:434). That night the deceased was the only boy in the village who slept--the others were awake and repenting, a funeral sermon on special providence fresh in their ears. As if by appointment there was the attendant electrical storm with its vicious window-rattling rain and silence-splitting thunder. The description of this youthful horror is so basic to Twain's work that it deserves to be quoted here at some length.<br><br><i>I sat up in bed quaking and shuddering, waiting for the destruction of the world and expecting it. ... Every time the lightning glared I caught my breath, and judged I was gone....</i><br><br><i>I endured agonies of remorse for sins which I knew I had committed, and for others which I was not certain about, yet was sure that they had been set down against me in a book by an angel who was wiser than I and did not trust such important matters to memory.</i><br><br><i>... I resolved to turn over a new leaf instantly; I also resolved to connect myself with the church next day, if I survived to see its sun appear. I resolved to cease from sin in all its form, and to lead a high and blameless life forever after. I would be punctual at church and Sunday School; visit the sick; carry baskets of victuals to the poor ...; I would instruct other boys in right ways, and take the resulting trouncings meekly; I would subsist entirely on tracts; I would invade the rum shop and warn the drunkard--and finally, if I escaped the fate of those who early became too good to live, I would go for a missionary.</i>[<i>Writings</i>12:435–37]<br><br>This is a boyish view of fierce providence and fearful penitence but it appears one way or another throughout Twain's life and literature. Indeed Twain usually saw life, religious and otherwise, through the eyes of a child; his best books are about them and his wife called him "Youth" all of their married life.<br><br>After his father's death in the boy's twelfth year, Sam left school and came even more fully under the supervision of Jane Clemens. He teased and tormented and exasperated his mother all of his life, a devilry she both loved and dreaded. When the neighbors brought Sam to the doorstep to dry out after one more near-drowning she assured them that "people born to be hanged are safe in the water" (Dixon Wecter,<i>Sam Clemens of Hannibal,</i>p. 58).<br><br>But, indeed, his heart belonged to the river that ran past his Hannibal home. After nearly twenty years of a life that included mining, journalism, travel, and fiction, Sam told the readers of the<i>Atlantic Monthly:</i><br><br><i>I loved the piloting profession far better than any I have followed since, and I took a measureless pride in it. The reason is plain: a</i>[riverboat]<i>pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived on the earth ...</i>[<i>Writings</i>12:163]<br><br>To a friend he once wrote that all men--kings and serfs alike--are all slaves to other men and circumstances, "save, alone, the pilot--who comes at no man's beck of call, obeys no man's orders and scorns all men's suggestions." Indeed, in later walks of life it would upset him to have to express his wishes in the "weak shape of a request, instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order" (<i>Writings</i>12:120). It seems clear that Mark Twain would never have quarreled with his Presbyterian gods if he only could have been one. On the river he came as close to that as he was able.<br><br>With the onset of the Civil War, Sam lost his job on the river and felt he was drifting toward "the ministry or the penitentiary": one or the other had seemed an inevitable destination. But his older brother, Orion Clemens, one of the strangest fellows ever born, saved him from either fate. Orion had been appointed Secretary to the new Territorial Governor of Nevada and when he offered Sam the non-paying position of secretary to the Secretary, "it appeared" said Sam "that the heaven and earth passed away and the firmament was rolled together as a scroll" (Writings 3:2). With such providential favor working in his behalf, Sam headed west.<br><br>The trip to Carson City actually took nineteen days rather than the usual seventeen, however, because the Clemens boys discovered they could not pass so hastily through that newly famous desert kingdom of Brigham Young, Salt Lake City. From his earliest years Sam Clemens had heard of the Mormons. John Clemens had moved his family into Marion County in eastern Missouri just months after Jackson County on the western side had been declared the New Jerusalem of the Latter-day Saints. The written history of Marion County indicates that Joseph Smith later visited nearby Palmyra, Missouri, considering it as a possible town in which the beleaguered Saints might gather. His interest in a city so named will be obvious to Latter-day Saints. Sam Clemens would have been too young to be aware of such a visit to his neighborhood, but he was not too young to have heard tales of the Hannibal militia men who were alerted at the height of the Mormon conflict and he may have seen the cannon that was ready to fire on Mormon immigrants if they steamed too near on their way to Nauvoo just forty miles up the river.<br><br>Twain's response to his Utah visit, including his encounter with Brigham Young, his opinions about polygamy, and his literary fun with the Book of Mormon are now part of Mormon folklore. We do not have time to review that material from<i>Roughing It,</i>but I'm certain that those of you who have read it will assume you already know everything there is to know, and those who haven't read it will be thoroughly ashamed.<br><br>His two-day stay in Salt Lake City left Sam generally impressed with what he called "the kingdom," and though he was well fed and happy at the hands of those multitudinous Mormon women, he was not much wiser regarding the "Mormon Question." "I left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things existed there," he admitted, and "sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a state of things existed there at all or not" (<i>Writings</i>3:121). Tautology notwithstanding, he determined that the Mormon issue could not be settled in forty-eight hours, though, he admitted, some eastern journalists had been doing it regularly in twenty-four. As he started into the desert he wrote:<br><br><i>Neither hunger, thirst, poverty, grief, hatred, contempt, nor persecution could drive the Mormons from their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst for gold which gleaned the flower of youth and the strength of many nations was not able to entice them! That was the final test. An experiment that can survive that is an experiment with some substance to it, somewhere.</i>[<i>Writings</i>2:307, Appendix A]<br><br>Sam and Orion made it to Carson City, but after two months in his nonprofit position as observer of affairs of state Sam succumbed to the silver fever that was by then an epidemic in the Washoe country. What with buying into a few holdings with painfully ironic names like "The Golden Fleece," Sam's mining efforts were a disaster by any standard. Most of the time he was destitute financially and depressed emotionally.<br><br>In the midst of such anxious moments over his prospects, Sam Clemens's personal and professional life was altered forever. As he became more and more disillusioned with mining, he had begun contributing a few humorous pieces to the Virginia City<i>Territorial Enterprise.</i>The sketches caught the eye of the paper's editor and he offered Sam a position on the<i>Enterprise</i>staff. Reluctant to leave mining but weary of the disappointments, Sam accepted the offer. It was August of 1862 and Sam later recalled that he thus "stumbled into literature without intending it" simply because he had failed in all of his other endeavors. In that month he said "I [was] never so near the ministry in my life" (Bernard De Boto,<i>Mark Twain in Eruption,</i>p. 391). Sam later confided in his brother regarding such occupational joys and sorrows, revealing in a recently discovered letter that the two most powerful ambitions in his life had been to be a pilot on the Mississippi River and a Presbyterian minister.<br><br><i>I accomplished the one and failed in the other,</i>[he said,]<i>because I could not supply myself with the necessary stock in trade--i.e., religion. I have given it up forever. I never had a "call" in that direction anyhow and my aspirations were the very ecstacy</i>[sic]<i>of presumption. But I have had a "call" to literature, of a low order, i.e., humorous. It is nothing to be proud of, but it is my strongest suit, and if I were to listen to that maxim of stern duty which says that to do right you must multiply the one or the two of the three talents which the Almighty entrusts to your keeping, I would long ago have ceased to meddle with things for which I was by nature unfitted and turn my attention to seriously scribling</i>[sic]<i>to excite the laughter of God's creatures. ... I wanted to be a pilot or a preacher, and was about as well calculated for either as is poor Emporer Norton for Chief Justice of the United States.</i>[Samuel L. Clemens,<i>My Dear Bro: A letter from Samuel Clemens to His Brother Orion,</i>pp. 6–7]<br><br>Let me digress into a lengthy aside. There is in fact considerable evidence that Clemens seriously considered becoming a minister several times in his life, almost always at times when he was out of work and desperate. He joked that this "most earnest ambition" was not prompted so much by his piety as by the fact that it looked like a secure job. "It never occurred to me," he said, "that a preacher could be damned" (Albert Bigelow Paine,<i>Mark Twain, A Biography</i>1:84). More privately Clemens was genuinely disappointed that in sixty years Hannibal had not "turned out a solitary preacher" and he was even more dismayed that there had not been at least one minister in the immediate family. Twain himself tried to fill the gap, always running with those he called "the fast nags of the cloth" and admitting he himself was but "a moralist in disguise" (Writings 35:719). Indeed, he frequently felt he did a better job of preaching than did the ordained. At thirteen years of age Susy Clemens wrote in her biography of her father:<br><br><i>He doesn't like to go to church at all, but why I never understood until just now. He told us the other day that he couldn't bear to hear anyone talk but himself, and that he could listen to himself talk for hours without getting tired, of course he said this is a joke, but I've not dought</i>[sic]<i>it was founded on truth.</i>[<i>Writings</i>37:83]<br><br>But I return to the time of vocational crisis and decision.<br><br>It was in those first difficult months in Nevada that Twain found in territorial Christianity one form of the only real religious stance that would appeal to him for any length of time. Like his river experience, it was unorthodox, informal, free-wheeling, unfettered. To express it, he took the shooting death of Virginia City saloon owner Tom Peaseley and fictionalized it into the immensely popular "Buck Fanshawe" episode in<i>Roughing It.</i><br><br>As Twain wrote it, a friend and fellow fireman named Scotty Briggs appointed himself as a committee of one to arrange for funeral services with the local minister, a young man fresh from an eastern theological seminary. The following is a condensation of that verbal encounter between New America and New England.<br><br><i>(Scotty): Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?</i><br><br><i>(Minister): Am I the--pardon me, I believe I do not understand.</i><br><br><i>(Scotty):The boys thought maybe you would give us a lift, if we'd tackle you--that is if I've got the rights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door.</i><br><br><i>(Minister): I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door.</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): The which?</i><br><br><i>(Minister): The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary adjoins these premises....</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): Well, you've ruther got the bulge on me. Or maybe we've both got the bulge, somehow. ... You see, one of the boys has passed in his decks, and we want to give him a good send-off, and so the thing I'm on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome.</i><br><br><i>(Minister): I seem to grow more and more bewildered. Your observations are wholly incomprehensible to me. Would it not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and allegory?</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): I'll have to pass, I judge. You've raised me out, pard. Why that last lead of yourn is too many for me. I can't neither trump nor follow suit. What we want is a gospel-sharp. See?</i><br><br><i>(Minister): A what?</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): Gospel-sharp. Parson.</i><br><br><i>(Minister): Oh! Why did you not say so before. I am a clergy-man--a parson.</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): Now you talk! You see my blind and straddle it like a man. Now we're all right, pard. Let's start fresh. You see, one of the boys has gone up the flume--</i><br><br><i>(Minister): Gone where?</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): Up the flume--throwed up the sponge--kicked the bucket--</i><br><br><i>(Minister): Ah--has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveler returns.</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): Return! I reckon not. Why pard, he's dead!</i><br><br><i>(Minister): I understand. ... Had deceased any religious convictions? That is to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power?</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): I reckon you've stumped me again, pard. Could you say it over once more, and say it slow?</i><br><br><i>(Minister): Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?</i><br><br><i>(Scotty): All down but nine--set 'em up on the other alley, pard. When you get in with your left I hunt grass every time. Every time you draw, you fill; but I don't seem to have any luck. Let's have a new deal.</i><br><br><i>(Minister):</i>[What?]<i>Begin again?</i><br><br>[<i>Writings</i>4:44–50]<br><br>The distinctiveness of each man's idiom in the dialogue (a dialogue which is, of course, two mutually exclusive monologues) is reinforced by other images in the sketch--Scotty's flaming red flannel shirt against the colorless black of the ministerial cloth, Briggs' brawny paw with the priest's delicate hand, and so on. But the ultimate contrast is language, always the most sensitive index to cultural distinctions.<br><br>On the frontier there would seem to be little place for men or organizations "sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifices in the interests of morality." Twain is inviting this "fragile, gentle, spiritual new fledgling ... as yet unacquainted with the ways of the mines" (Writings 4:44) to come down from the summit of his Sinai and "dive," as Herman Melville would say, into the bedrock of human experience and need.<br><br>From Nevada, Twain's nascent newspaper and lecturing career took him on to seances in California, "proselyting work" in the Hawaiian Islands, and ultimately to the midnight missions of New York. In the orthodox East Sam found institutional religion to be very unlike Scotty Briggs's more preferable frontier variety, but it was booming business and, as always, he threw himself into the midst of it. Jamming his way into Henry Ward Beecher's church, Twain sat in the congregation and was smitten not with Beecher's theology but with his mesmerizing platform performance, a style Twain could only describe with phrases like "rockets of poetry" and "mines of eloquence." As he observed the effect it had on the crowd, Twain nearly suffocated with the desire to clap his hands and see if it would break the spell.<br><br>A short time after attending his first sermon at Brooklyn heights Sam presented his letter of introduction to the Reverend Mister Beecher and accepted an invitation to dinner. Perhaps it was from Beecher himself that he learned of the proposed pilgrimage to the Holy Land being sponsored by Plymouth Congregational. Sam agreed to go as a dignitary, no less. Once on board the<i>Quaker City</i>Twain found 67 passengers, including three ordained ministers. As the gong sounded that first Saturday evening for the first of an endless succession of prayer meetings, Twain thought he sensed "damaging premonitions of the future"--storm without, pilgrims within, and prayer meetings everywhere. This was obviously going to be pleasuring with a vengeance.<br><br>With every mile traveled and every day spent, relationships among the<i>Quaker City</i>group degenerated until somewhere on the plains of Syria Twain read aloud from Numbers 22 and announced to them all that then and forever Balaam's ass was to be the patron saint of the entire group. Yet there were private, reflective moments when Sam was touched by what he saw.<br><br><i>Night is the time to see Galilee. ...</i>[At night]<i>Galilee is a theatre meet for great events; meet for the birth of a religion able to save the world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed to stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees. But in the sunlight one says: is it for the deeds which were done and the words which were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand 18 centuries gone that the bells are ringing today in the remote islands of the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference of the huge globe? One can comprehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and created a theatre proper for so grand a drama.</i>[<i>Writings</i>2:244–45]<br><br>In a sense this passage is as revealing as any Twain ever wrote about the real contours of his religious imagination. Not unlike Scotty Briggs's language, it was only a fresh, fanciful, imaginative Christianity he would ever be able to entertain. The harshness of life's sunlit immediacy would conspire to forbid any extended periods of such spiritual contemplation. But he did, however briefly, have his moonlight moments.<br><br>The return trip from Palestine went from bad to worse. "The pleasure trip was a synagogue, ... a funeral excursion without a corpse," Twain wrote for the New York<i>Herald</i>as soon as they landed (Writings 2:400); but, like the difficulty of the mines, that discouraging trip was to lead to another monumental turning point in his life and again a period of intense religious interest. Through the youngest passenger on board the<i>Quaker City</i>, eighteen-year-old Charles Langdon of Elmira, New York, Mark Twain met and fell immediately in love with the boy's older sister, Olivia.<br><br>As it turned out, falling in love with Livy Langdon was the closest thing to an orthodox religious conversion Sam Clemens ever experienced. On the first anniversary of their meeting Sam would write,<br><br><i>I did have such a struggle the first day I saw you ... to keep from loving you with all my heart. You seemed to my bewildered vision a visiting Spirit from the upper air. A something to worship, reverently and at a distance.</i>[Dixon Wecter, ed.,<i>The Love Letters of Mark Twain,</i>p. 43 hereinafter cited as<i>Love Letters</i>]<br><br>Indeed she came to be his goddess, the only one in which he ever fully believed.<br><br>He immediately tried to press his relationship beyond the genteel brother-and-sister language Livy insisted upon and, grimly earnest, proposed marriage. Stunned by his abruptness, Livy recovered only to say something about his being her brother for as long as he liked. Byronically he fled Elmira and wrote back--"I do not regret that I have loved you, still love you and shall always love you." Pleadingly he wrote,<br><br><i>Write me something from time to time--texts from the New Testament if nothing else occurs to you--or dissertations on</i>[the sin of]<i>smoking--or extracts from your book of sermons--anything whatever.</i>[Knowing it is from you]<i>will be sufficient.</i>[<i>Love Letters,</i>pp. 19–20]<br><br>When a reply arrived with a small picture enclosed, Sam rushed off a letter worthy of any nineteenth-century tract.<br><br><i>You say to me "I shall pray for you daily." Not any words that have ever been spoken to me have touched me like these ... I beg that you will continue to pray for me--for I have a vague, faraway sort of idea that it may not be wholly in vain. In one respect, at least, it shall not be in vain--for I will so mend my conduct that I shall grow worthier of your prayers and of your goodwill and sisterly solicitude as the days go by. Furthermore, (It has taken me long to make up my mind to say these grave words which once said cannot be recalled).</i>[sic]<i>I</i>will<i>"pray with you" as you ask; and with such faith and such encouragement withall as are in me though feeble and of little worth I feel they must be. It seems strange enough to me--this reverence, this solemnity, this supplication--and yet you must surely have some faith that it will not necessarily be useless else you would not have suggested it.</i>[<i>Love Letters,</i>p. 21]<br><br>Sam rushed to Elmira and arrived almost as soon as his letter. Within twenty-four hours he had again proposed marriage. Again he was refused. A carriage accident as he was leaving the house kept him at the Langdons' for two more weeks, at the end of which he proposed marriage a third time. A third time the answer was no. Nevertheless, such determination over the following months was finally successful. Ready to leap over church steeples at Livy's acceptance, Sam wrote to a friend:<br><br><i>I touch no more spirituous liquors after this day (though I have made no promises) I shall do no act that ... Livy might be pained to hear of and shall seek the society of the good--I shall be a</i>Christian.<i>I shall climb--climb--climb--towards this bright sun that is shining in the heaven of my happiness until all that is gross and unworthy is hidden in the mists of darkness of that lower earth. ... I shall be worthy--yet. Livy believes in me ... I believe in</i>myself.<i>... I believe in God--and through the breaking clouds I see the star of hope rising in the placid blue beyond. I bow my reverent head.</i>[<i>Love Letters,</i>p. 50]<br><br>Sam began to pray for Livy. Livy, of course, prayed for Sam. It appears, however, that Mr. And Mrs. Langdon prayed for themselves. They were not entirely taken with this young humorist and in fact would not give their permission for the marriage. Mr. Langdon wrote a frank letter to his daughter's suitor, rebuking him for some of his drawing-room indiscretions and asking him to relax the pace of the courtship until some reliable character references could be obtained. Unfortunately there were none to obtain. Shaken, Sam wrote his prospective father-in-law that while his life had not been entirely unblameworthy on the Pacific coast, nevertheless, "Men as lost as I have found a Savior, and why not I?" (<i>Love Letters,</i>p. 37). He wrote to Livy and reassured her that he was reading not once but several times the sermons of Henry Ward Beecher contained in the Plymouth pamphlets she regularly sent him. With painful candor he confessed, "You know the child must crawl before it walks--and I must do right for love of you while I am in the infancy of Christianity; but then I can do right for love of the Savior when I shall have gotten my growth" (<i>Love Letters</i>, p. 34)--a growth he never obtained and yet one more way in which he was always a "youth." His earlier zeal was simply not sustaining him in such difficult times and he confessed to her that religion seemed "well nigh unattainable" and he felt like "giving up in despair." Yet at that very moment both of Livy's parents wrote to express their confidence in him. The Millennium itself could not have been more gratefully--and enthusiastically--received. Now less than a month away from formal engagement, Sam wrote a letter which probably indicates the summit of his Christian journey, however modest the mountain. It seems by every standard to be both genuine in its tone and truly religious in its intent.<br><br><i>Livy--</i><br><br><i>Let us believe that God has destined us for each other. ... Let us hope and believe that we shall walk hand in hand in love and worship of Him-- ... and so journeying, pass at last the shadowed boundaries of Time and stand redeemed and saved, beyond the threshold and within the light of that land whose Prince is the Lord of rest eternal. God will bless you in it--will bless us both, I fervently believe.</i><br><br><i>I bless you for your religious counsel, Livy--and more and more every day, for with every passing day I understand it better and appreciate it more. I am "dark" yet--I see I am still depending on my own strength to lift myself up, and upon my own sense of what is right to guide me in the Way--but not always, Livy, not always. I see the Savior dimly at times, and at intervals, very near--would that the intervals were not so sad a length apart! Sometimes it is a pleasure to me to pray, night and morning, in cars and everywhere, twenty times a day--and then again the whole spirit of religion is motionless within me from the rising clear to the setting of the sun. ... But I have hope-- ... I fear I would distrust a religious faith that came upon me suddenly--that came upon me otherwise than deliberately, and prove, step by step as it came. You will blame me for this, Livy--but be lenient with me, for you know I grope blindly as yet.</i>[<i>Love Letters,</i>pp. 44–45]<br><br>As a matter of fact, Twain would never again have intervals "so very near," nor would he ever again grope less blindly.<br><br>Primarily to please Livy, Sam faithfully rented a pew for the two of them at Joseph Twitchell's Hartford church, which he always called the Church of the Holy Speculators. Sam never formally joined the congregation, however, although Joe Twitchell did become perhaps the closest personal friend he had in life. Through his period Sam was still maintaining some semblance of an orthodox religious life--continuing to say grace at meals, for example, but even that ritual was becoming so<i>mal apropos</i>that houseguest Thomas Wentworth Higginson equated it to asking a blessing over European minstrels.<br><br>With Livy threatening to miscarry, Sam got them away from Hartford in the spring and summer of 1873. It was a refreshing stay in Elmira and a happy, productive time. He began a manuscript on which he averaged fifty pages a day. The book was to be titled<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>and in the mind of the author was, at least in the early stages of the manuscript, a kind of religious reverie, the first act in a proposed<i>Divinia Tragoedia</i>set in a celestial St. Petersburg but concluding in hellish Calvinistic reality.<br><br>The book had been initially prompted by a visit from an old Hannibal Sunday School superintendent whose voice had brought back trooping phantoms of the past. A church service Twain attended while on the lecture circuit a short time later had then reinforced those haunting images. He wrote with evangelical fervor, frequently never moving from his desk for hours. When the book was finished he considered it "a sermon, ... a hymn put into prose form to give it a worldly air" (<i>Writings</i>35:477). But<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>was in several ways a flawed work and Twain sensed that, though he was never a good judge of his own effort. He had not plumbed the real depths of his religious concerns.<br><br>In the meantime, his life, particularly his business life, was becoming unbearable, and after trying to find relief up and down the eastern seaboard and on to Bermuda, and finally in Europe, Twain got away from it all by returning to Hannibal to write a book about his river. He enjoyed much of the venture, but for the most part he was deeply disappointed. He wrote to his wife,<br><br><i>That world which I knew in its blossoming youth is old and bowed and melancholy now. Its soft cheeks are leathery and wrinkled; the fire is gone out of its eyes and the spring from its step. It will be dust and ashes when I come again. I have been clasping hands with the moribund--and usually they say "It is for the last time."</i>[<i>Writings</i>36:418]<br><br>The Clemenses had already lost their only son, Langdon, and more recently Livy and the girls were suffering everything from scarlet fever to diphtheria. Sam, drained economically and emotionally, struggled with the bite of an annual $100,000 in expenses and knew less real peace than he had ever felt in his life. Largely disenchanted with the river book and the scenes he put into it, he immediately began what he had wanted to do in the first place: to make a purely<i>imaginative</i>return to his Hannibal home; to get a truer, if less factual, account of a boy's life on the river. Researching<i>Life on the Mississippi</i>had triggered a number of ideas and by midsummer of that year, 1883, he was back at work on the epic that had been on his mind through (and had informed parts of)<i>Tom Sawyer,</i>"The Recent Carnival of Crime,"<i>A Tramp Abroad,</i>"What is Happiness," and<i>Life on the Mississippi.</i>Twain now hoped to pull together these piecemeal statements he had been making for over a decade; his view of man, religion, and civilization were coming into clearer, if nevertheless darker, focus. Thus at the height of his creative powers (and farther away than ever from any kind of orthodox religious sympathy) Mark Twain settled down to write The adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He worked more feverishly than at any other time in his life. In August of 1883 he wrote to Howells,<br><br><i>I've done two season's work in one. I've written eight or nine-hundred manuscript pages in such a brief space of time that I mustn't name the number of days; I shouldn't believe it myself and of course I couldn't expect you to.</i>[Henry Nash Smith and William M. Gibson, eds.,<i>Mark Twain--Howells Letters: The Correspondence of Samuel L. Clemens and William Dean Howells, 1872–1910</i>1:438; hereinafter cited as<i>Smith</i>]<br><br>A month earlier he had written to his mother, "I haven't had such booming work days for many years. I'm piling up manuscripts in a really astonishing way" (Smith 1:440).<br><br>From the beginning Twain clearly conceived Huck's quest as an escape from the fetters of Protestant American civilization. In<i>Tom Sawyer</i>Huck had painted in somber tones the orthodox life he was subjected to at Widow Douglas's home. As he explained to Tom,<br><br><i>I got to go to church and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornry sermons! I can't catch a fly in there, I can't chaw, I got to wear shoes all Sunday ... the widder won't let me smoke; she</i>[won't]<i>let me yell, she</i>[won't]<i>let me gape or stretch, nor scratch before folks--and dad fetch it, she</i>[prays]<i>all the time. I never see such a woman. I had to shove, Tom. I just had to.</i>[<i>Writings</i>8:288–89]<br><br>So in his own book Huck moves away from "the bars and shackles of civilization: and toward the river, that stream of freedom which Twain said symbolized "the heaven pictured by priest and prophet."<br><br>Once on the river, Huck tries to work out his own salvation, moving in an Adamic peacefulness back to a state before sin and civilization. "We was always naked, day and night," Huck said, "whenever the mosquitoes would let us" (<i>Writings</i>8:65). From this mosquito-blemished Eden, Huck would occasionally venture into The World but the men he found there were fallen indeed. The Grangerfords could read their<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>and<i>Presbyterian Observer,</i>listen to Sunday sermons fit for printing in either, and still continue a senseless feud that would take the life of their handsome young son. In what is still the most chilling and understated description of death I know, Huck describes the horror of seeing his helpless friend shot down like a duck on a pond. In addition to being "mighty good" to Huck, Buck Grangerford was a civilized alter-ego for him; same age, nearly same size, nearly same name. Buck's death was a brutal, vicarious reminder of life in that "civilized" world. "I wish I hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things," Huck confessed. "I ain't never going to get shut of them. Lots of times I dream about them [still]" (<i>Writings</i>8:160). Less personal but still repugnant reminders of traditional evangelical Protestantism are portrayed in the camp meeting and in the string of charades performed by the Duke and the Dauphin. The moral apex of the book is, of course, on the raft between Huck's sound heart and deformed conscience, a battle in which Huck determines to resist the sins of society even if it will mean going to hell. Huck simply cannot take Jim back into civilization, for he himself has suffered bondage there and he cannot wish that on anyone in good--that is, bad--conscience. In their flight Huck and Jim are quite literal soul brothers.<br><br>But the brackets of civilization which encase this story inexorably begin to close in when Huck is socially born again into the society of the Phelps farm (Huck becomes Tom, Tom becomes Sid, etc.). The much-discussed conclusion of this book is, it seems to me, infinitely stronger than most critics have understood. It does, among other things , remind Huck and the reader how cruel, or at the very least, how capricious Miss Watson's Presbyterian providence really is. After making a black-faced fool out of Jim, Tom/Sid smugly reveals that Miss Watson had already set him free. It was precisely this kind of unaccountable and unaccounting God Sam Clemens was never able to understand. With that reminder of such Calvinistic victimization reawaiting him, Huck heads out "for the territory" of religious and cultural unorthodoxy. Life would be much more attractive, certainly freer and safer, out beyond the demarcated boundaries of civilization where pale theology students from the East had very little to teach fellows like Scotty Briggs and Huckleberry Finn.<br><br>With the publication of that book and Huck's intended, though undoubtedly never realized, return to the frontier, Mark Twain passed over a threshold as decisively as a double-minded man was able. When he put down his pen at the close of that manuscript, he was just three months away from his forty-eighth birthday. A half-dozen years before his death he jotted in his notebook, "The man who is a pessimist before he's 48 knows too much; the man who is an optimist after he is 48 knows too little" (Albert Bigelow Paine, ed.,<i>Mark Twain's Notebook,</i>p. 380).<br><br>Paul Tillich has suggested in his examination of history that the substance of culture is religion, and the form of religion is culture. With only a modest shift of Tillich's meaning, that proposition was axiomatic for Mark Twain. Wearing shoes and going to church meant the same thing to Huck Finn, and this child who was father to the man struggled to be rid of both. The man succeeded, or, perhaps more accurately, acceded, only a few times--in the cabin of a riverboat, around the mining camps on the western frontier, under the moonlight of Galilee, with the love of a wife and children, and, finally, full circle, on a raft floating down that first powerful river. In spite of that genuinely bitter pessimism ahead, that is somehow where Sam Clemens ultimately remained--on the river, on the line, in between, divided and dividing. He could not live with traditional American Protestantism, but he could not live without feelings of innate religious hunger either. East or west, so much was, in Huck's phrase, simply "hogwash," but occasionally there was that genuine soul-butter, too, and an almost desperate need for it. As Huck said about this lifelong anxiety that seemed always to be marking Twain:<br><br><i>Sometimes the widow would take me to one side and talk about providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe the next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two providences, and a chap would stand considerable show with the widow's providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there wasn't no help for him anymore. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, thought I couldn't make out how he was a going to be any better off than what he was before, seeing I was ignorant, and so kind of low down and awnry.</i>[<i>Writings</i>8:16]<br><br>Sitting one evening in the darkened Hartford home of their friends, the Charles Dudley Warners, Sam and Livy Clemens watched a beautiful full moon rise outside the large bay window. The faithful Clemens housekeeper Katy Leary later reported:<br><br><i>Suddenly Mr. Clemens got right up without any warnin' and began singin' one of them Negro spirituals. A lady that was there told me he just stood up with both his eyes shut and began to sing kind of soft like--a faint sound, just as if there was a wind in the trees, she said: and he kept right on singin' kind of low and sweet, and it was beautiful and made your heart ache. And he kept on singin' and singin' and became kind of lost in it, and he was all lit up--his face was. 'Twas somethin' from another world, she said, and when he got through, he put his hands up to his head, just as though all the sorrow of them Negroes was upon 'im; and then he began to sing, "Nobody Knows the Trouble I Got, Nobody Knows but Jesus". ... When he came to the end, to the glory hallelujah, he gave a great shout--just like them Negroes do--he shouted out the "Glory, Glory, Hallelujah." They said it was wonderful and none of them would forget it as long as they lived.</i>[Katy Leary (with Mary Lawton),<i>A Lifetime with Mark Twain,</i>p. 213]<br><br>And the world and American literature will never forget him.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<br>
I feel honored, brothers and sister, to have been invited to address this devotional assembly and dedicate the enlarged Harold B. Lee Library. It is always an inspiration to be on the campus of this great University in the presence of President Oaks, faculty members, and you students. And it is a distinct and much-appreciated privilege to pay respect to our late Church prophet, president, and my close friend and associate, Harold B. Lee.<br><br><i>More than any other institution, the library of a university</i>[to quote Dr. Lyman Tyler]<i>"is the custodian of the world's actual knowledge and the reservoir of its potential knowledge." It preserves and makes available the results of previous human seeking. It makes possible a fruitful continuation of that search. . . . "A quality education is impossible without a quality library."</i>[Brigham Young Alumnus, September–October 1961, p. 2]<br><br>I shall not here undertake to describe nor to appraise the merits of the library. Each of you have had and will yet have better opportunities to do this than will I. We are grateful for it and want to make maximum use of it as we follow the Lord's direction to "study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 90:15). For, said he, "it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6). "A man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge," added the Prophet Joseph Smith (Joseph Smith,<i>History of the Church</i>4:588).<br><br>The Lord also said that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36) and that<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. . . .</i><br><br><i>If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>And again, "Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should . . . obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 93:53).<br><br>Brigham Young University was established, as we all know, to facilitate our compliance with these commandments. A major reason for the establishment of the J. Reuben Clark Law School here on the BYU campus was that there might be an institution in which students could obtain a knowledge of the laws of man in light of the laws of God. For this same purpose the enlarged Harold B. Lee Library is to be dedicated today.<br><br>All knowledge and learning available in the library, however, is not of equal value. The knowledge in which we are particularly interested is that referred to by the Lord when he said: "Truth and Knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). Having so declared, the Lord added: "Whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning (D&amp;amp;C 93:25).<br><br>The resources of the enlarged library will contain much information which will contribute to a knowledge of the truth; that is, to a "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come." Unfortunately they will also contain more or less of that information which the Lord says "is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning" (D&amp;amp;C 93:25). Our great challenge is to be able to always distinguish between the two kinds of information. My purpose in these remarks is to review and emphasize the basic knowledge revealed by the Lord, by means of which the distinction between these types of knowledge can always be made. These bases concern (1) God--his identity and nature; (2) man--his origin and potentiality; and (3) the purpose of mortal life. An understanding of these three bases and a constant use of them is indispensable to the attainment of a knowledge of the<i>truth</i>as defined by the Lord.<br><br>As to the first base, "God himself" as described by the Prophet Joseph Smith who had seen him<br><br><i>was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! That is the great secret. If the veil were rent today, and the great God who holds this world in its orbit, and who upholds all worlds and all things by his power, was to make himself visible,--I say, if you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form--like yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man; for Adam was created in the very fashion, image and likeness of God and received instruction from, and walked, talked and conversed with him, as one man talks and communes with another.</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith, comp.,<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 345]<br><br>With respect to<i>man</i>, the psalmist, as he considered the wonders of the heavens, observing the sun, the moon, and stars moving in their glory, and contemplated the creations of the earth, the beasts of the field, the fish "and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas" (Psalm 8:8, and then beheld man in his majestic preeminence among them all, cried out:<br><br><i>O Lord . . .</i><br><br>what is man,<i>that thou art mindful of him? . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.</i><br><br><i>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.</i>[Psalm 8:1, 4–6; emphasis added]<br><br>Perhaps no one has put the query in more picturesque language than has the psalmist. But he was neither the first nor the last to raise the question, "What is man?" "From the days of the first apostasy--the heathen in his idolatry, the savage in his ignorance, the scholar in his study, the scientist in his laboratory, the philosopher in his musings--all men--Christian, falsely so-called, and pagan--ignorant of divine revelation, have stood confounded before the question" (Anonymous). I suppose there were never so many people so confounded about that question as there are today.<br><br>I am advised that recently a member of a so-called Christian church claiming a membership of millions said that that church does not believe in man's preexistence; that it believes and teaches that God created man at the time he came into this world; that He created him out of nothing, not in the likeness of God, because God is a mystery and has no manlike semblance; that, though man will persist in some manner after death, he will not go on in eternal progression. Such ignorance of God and man's relationship to him has prepared the seedbed which has sprouted the troubles that today vex men and nations. And one of the saddest things about it all is the fact that such ignorance has been, and now is, willful and manmade. Of course, men have had guidance from Satan in their descent into darkness, but that guidance has been voluntarily accepted.<br><br>All through the ages "the light [has been shining] in [the] darkness, and the darkness [has comprehended] it not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:21). Men need not have been so uninformed on this most vital matter. To Adam, the first man, God revealed himself as the Father of man. And he has renewed that revelation in every dispensation since.<br><br>In the Garden of Eden, both before and after the Fall, God walked and conversed with Adam, who was his son, even as one man walks and talks with another. After Adam was driven from the Garden, he was visited and taught the truth of these things by holy beings from the presence of God.<br><br><i>And Adam and Eve . . . made all things known unto their sons and their daughters.</i><br><br><i>And Satan came among them, saying: I am also a son of God.</i>[Moses 5:12–13]<br><br>This claim by Satan that he was "also a son of God" is proof that he knew Adam had instructed his children and that they knew that they were sons and daughters of God. While admitting that he and Adam's children were the sons of God, he commanded them not to believe what Adam and Eve had taught them, "and they believed it not, and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish. Doing so is their own responsibility, however; it is not God's because under his direction<br><br><i>the Gospel began to be preached, from the beginning, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>. . . And a</i>[divine]<i>decree</i>[was]<i>sent forth, that it should be in the world, until the end there of.</i>[Moses 5:58–59]<br><br>And thus it has been, and thus it will continue to be.<br><br>Jacob said, "I have seen God face to face" (Genesis 32:30). The Lord stood at the door of the tabernacle and "spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend" (see Exodus 33:9–11). On another occasion, the Lord told Moses that He "created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them" (Genesis 1:27). I am not, in these citations, distinguishing between those which refer to the Father and those referring to the Son, because Paul informs us that Jesus is "the express image" (Hebrews 1:3) of God's person. And Jesus himself said, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 14:9).<br><br>Notwithstanding the oft-repeated teaching in holy writ of the nature of God and man's relationship to him, men's understanding thereof remained darkened. To remove every vestige of excuse for ignorance in the matter, God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, in the spring of 1820 in New York State, revealed themselves anew. This they did for the sake of the whole world. Whatever doubts can conceivably arise from other accounts concerning the form and nature of God were cleared up by this superb theophany. Two heavenly persons in a pillar of light stood before the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. One of them spoke, calling Joseph "by name and said, pointing to the other--<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</i>" (Joseph Smith 2:17). The Son conversed with the Prophet. Later the Prophet described God as an exalted man. "The Father," said he, "has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22).<br><br>With respect to God and his form and nature, this is final truth. To seal his testimony of it, Joseph Smith gave his life's blood in martyrdom. His Testimony is binding upon all men.<br><br>The fact that men had a pre-earth existence as spirits, is settled in the third chapter of Ether in the Book of Mormon. Recorded there is an account of a manifestation of the spirit Jesus Christ to the brother of Jared some two thousand years before His birth as the babe of Bethlehem. This prophet had such faith in God that the Lord, Jesus Christ, showed himself unto him and said: "Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence" (Ether 3:13). This statement is of itself evidence of preexistence because one could not be brought back into the presence of the Lord unless he had been there before.<br><br><i>Therefore</i>[continued Jesus,]<i>I show myself unto you.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. . . .</i><br><br><i>Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</i><br><br>[Moroni, the historian who recorded this account, added this comment:]<i>. . . I could not make a full account of these things which are written therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus</i>[this was two thousand years before He was born]<i>showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he showed himself unto the Nephites.</i>[Ether 3:13–17]<br><br>We know, of course, that when he showed himself unto the Nephites he was a resurrected person, and he appeared to them in the form of a man.<br><br>That our spirits are the offspring of God the Father has likewise been taught through the ages and confirmed in modern revelation. Jesus so taught when he instructed us to pray, "Our Father which art in heaven" (Matthew 6:9), and when he said to Mary, "Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (John 20:17).<br><br>Paul put it plainly when he said that in God "we live, and move, and have our being; . . . for we are . . . his offspring" (Acts 17:28). In this latter day, the Lord declared to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon that the inhabitants of all "the worlds . . . are begotten sons and daughters unto God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:24).<br><br>Now I have dwelt at length upon the identity, form and nature of God the Father, Jesus Christ, and men, with particular emphasis upon their relationship to each other. This I have done deliberately because a knowledge of these revealed truths is essential to an understanding of the purpose of man's mortality.<br><br>As the offspring of God, man inherits and possesses the capability of attaining, in final maturity, to the stature of his Heavenly Father, who has a body of flesh and bones. As spirits in the spirit world, men had no such body. Mortality is the means provided by the Father for men to receive physical bodies. Mortality was also to be and is the situation in which men were to be and are now being proved to see if they are worthy to return to the Father and inherit the glory in which he dwells.<br><br>As the Lord stood among the spirits of men in that primeval realm, contemplating and planning for their growth and happiness, he said:<br><br><i>We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</i><br><br><i>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</i>[Abraham 3:24–26]<br><br>In this excerpt from the eternal record of heaven, the Lord refers to mortality as man's second estate--the time and place during which each person is proved. Passing or failing the test in this life is final and controlling, eternal life--joy and happiness in full felicity--being the reward for success here. The promise is : "They who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever."<br><br>With these great eternal basic truths--first, the identity and nature of God; second, the origin and potentiality of men; third, the purpose of mortality--with these great basic truths in mind, I invite you now to join me in dedicating the enlarged Harold B. Lee Library building.<br><h2><b>Dedicatory Prayer</b></h2><br>Our beloved Father in Heaven, in humility and thanksgiving we bow our heads and invoke thy spirit upon us in prayer. We thank thee, Father, for the Brigham Young University--for the inspiration given by thee to President Young which moved him to establish its beginnings.<br><br>We thank thee for the succeeding presidents of the Church, including President Spencer W. Kimball, our present president, all of whom have contributed to the growth of this institution; for all members of the successive boards of trustees; for the presidents of the University, including President Dallin H. Oaks who now presides, we are grateful. We are grateful for the faculty members and the students.<br><br>We are grateful and give thanks to all who have helped finance the enlarged Harold B. Lee Library, including the tithe-paying Saints; the students, with their tuition, building fees, and through the projects sponsored by their Student Development Association; the contributions made by members of the faculty, the staff, and other employees of the University; and all others who have contributed financially.<br><br>Father, we remember with deep appreciation our late, beloved Harold B. Lee whose name the library bears. For his inspiration, love of learning, and his authorization for the construction of the enlarged building, we thank thee.<br><br>And now, Father, we call attention to the building itself--its beauty, its facilities, and its content which may be and will be used by innumerable people in their search for the knowledge thou has counseled us to seek and obtain. For all these things our hearts swell with gratitude and thanksgiving to thee.<br><br>In this spirit, Heavenly Father, and in the authority of the holy priesthood we dedicate unto thee the enlarged Harold B. Lee Library to be used by thy children for the purposes for which it has been erected.<br><br>We dedicate the land on which it stands; its walkways and other approaches; its landscaping; its foundation, walls, floors, partitions, ceiling, roofs, rooms, furnishings, other contents; and surroundings of every kind and nature. We dedicate its books, maps, and all types of teaching and learning helps. We ask thee to bless the architects, the builders, and other workmen who have labored on it, and all who will labor on and in it in the future.<br><br>Especially, Father, bless the students and others who will use the facilities of the library. Help them to never forget the great underlying bases we have reviewed here today, and to always judge the teachings of men by these truths. Bless them with the spirit of discernment and help them to remember thy declaration that "truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come; and [that] whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24–25). Bless them, O Father, that they will not be deceived, but receive by the gift of faith a "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<br><br>These favors we ask, these thanks we give, and this dedication we make in the authority of the holy priesthood, and in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion G.

<h1>ome Storage - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I am very pleased to be with you tonight. You represent my favorite congregation.<br><br>Tonight I would like to direct your thoughts toward home storage. I hope it won't be too disappointing for you to hear I have selected this subject as my topic of discussion. And before some of you tune me out, let me put your minds at ease. I am not going to talk to you about honey, salt, wheat, water, and peanut butter. Rather, within the framework of real family storage, I am going to talk to you about money, children, mother, father, husband, and wife.<br><br>In recent weeks, some--with the advent of severe weather, possible water shortages, and future food uncertainties--have moved with great haste to hurriedly surround themselves with food commodities. There has actually been some panic buying on the part of the unprepared and frightened. While I wholeheartedly recommend family and personal preparedness in the accumulation of basic foods on continuing and orderly basis, I take this occasion tonight to sincerely remind us all that there should be a continuing personal home storage, if you please, going on without delay, interruption, or misunderstood priority.<br><br>It is true that "man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live" (Deuteronomy 8:3). The kind of storage I am advocating today is sometimes better performed by casting your bread upon the waters rather than in the freezer. The only real home storage you can take with you is yourself and your family. Once stored, the things I am talking about can constantly be shared and your supply will never be depleted. We need to be anxiously involved in the type of family storage that will sustain eternal life: "Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life" (1 Timothy 6:19).<br><br>Now, let me get back to home storage--avoiding at this time honey, salt, wheat, water, and peanut butter, and dwelling on money, children, mother, father, husband, and wife. "Life is more than meat, and the body is more that raiment" (Luke 12:23). Happiness is more important than money. Certain gifts and powers you and I possess are far more important than money. Money cannot buy those priceless gifts you have in your possession to store and share. In the past some of us have had a great deal to say about money and the importance of proper money management, but tonight I want to emphasize that money makes available none of the basics of the kind of family storage I believe to be of the greatest importance.<br><br><i>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</i><br><br><i>And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</i><br><br><i>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</i><br><br><i>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</i><br><br><i>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something to them.</i><br><br><i>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</i><br><br><i>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</i><br><br><i>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</i><br><br><i>And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</i><br><br><i>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</i><br><br><i>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</i><br><br><i>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</i>[Acts 3:1–12]<br><br>Peter was able to lift, lead, and act because he had stored his priestly powers in a clean vessel and knew the processes of sharing. The certain lame man did not purchase Peter's powers with money nor did the apostle of God acquire them through worldly wealth. They were accumulated by the grace of God and by personal preparedness.<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heat be also.</i>[Matthew 6:19–21]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, eighty-two years of age tomorrow, stores as he shares. I thank God for his leadership, his example, and his love.<br><br>Some of my recent experiences and observations I would like to share with you at this time. I hope they will give a new light on real home storage.<br><br>A few weeks ago we had the opportunity of being in Suva, Fiji. I was surprised after registering at a motel to have the clerk look up and say, "Elder Ashton, could my husband and I and our children visit with you tonight?" I didn't know that she knew who I was. Because we had meetings until ten o'clock in the evening, I told her the situation and she said, "We'll come at ten o'clock in the evening." And at ten o'clock in the evening this lady--and we will call her Jessie because that is her name (I would hate to try and pronounce her last name)--and her husband and six children crowded into our motel room.<br><br>After proper introductions and getting as comfortable as possible in almost impossible conditions, Jessie led off with this question. "Our son over here is nineteen years of age. The question we want to ask you, Elder Ashton, is, should we continue to save our money so that our son can go into the mission field, or should we continue to save our money so that some day all of us can go to the temple in New Zealand and be sealed to each other?"<br><br>My answer: "In the Church we do both."<br><br>Another question. "Is it true that some missionaries can get money from other families for assistance when the missionary's own family doesn't have very much in the way of money?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, that is possible, but never deprive your family of the opportunity of taking part in some way to furnish money monthly to your son. Do not let that opportunity escape your family no matter how slight the contribution." Brothers and sisters, money, like people, is only valuable when it is put to worthy purposes. In this case, money will be nothing more than a means to an end. It is not money, but a lack of it, that is making this family strong.<br><br>Just last Friday Sister Ashton and I had a letter from Suva, Fiji, indicating that the nineteen-year-old son was now in the mission field. I am pleased to add that to the remarks tonight.<br><br>A few days after we returned from a trip to Fiji, I had a private talk with a six-year-old-boy friend of mine--when he is on good behavior I recognize him as a grandson. When he is not on good behavior, he just belongs to Sister Ashton. I said, "Michael, I know a good guy who lives on an island a long way from here, away out in the Pacific Ocean. He's old enough to go on a mission, but he doesn't have much money. Would you like to help him?"<br><br>"Yeah, I'll help him. My mom and dad will too."<br><br>"Michael, how much would you like to give?"<br><br>"Would a quarter be all right?" May I say in passing: you and I know that Michael's quarter is not much, but his willingness to give and share is everything. It also makes grandparents proud and talkative.<br><br>We need to teach our youngsters in the home today that it is not enough to save for a mission, but we need to teach them to assist others who may not have the opportunity to save or have the advantage of home life that recommends this type of conduct. May I say today that the unwise pursuit of money is a deterrent to missionary service.<br><br>May I share another recent experience to try to put over in our minds tonight the values as well as the opportunities of proper home storage by using the occasions of the day to store as we share and grow.<br><br>During a recent stake conference assignment, I was accompanied by an outstanding regional representative of the Twelve. As we flew between Salt Lake City and San Francisco, I was interested in his telling me about his wife, three sons, and two daughters. One daughter, the youngest of the five children, born about seventeen years ago, passed away within the last year. At birth she suffered severe brain damage and, as a result, in the sixteen years of her life was never able to grow or develop. Constant care from a loving mother, patience and warmth from a kind father, and understanding from three noble brothers and a thoughtful sister made her presence special in the family. I was moved to new depths of understanding when this traveling companion told me what a blessing this soul had been to their household. He said, "Nothing that money could buy could have ever brought us together in love, patience, and humility like just taking care of her did." Here was a tragedy, here was a trial if you please, turned into an opportunity for blessings for eternal family storage and sharing. I thank this noble father, mother, and children for sharing with me out of their home storage.<br><br>I sometimes am not only disappointed but amused as well as being amazed when I see young couples of college age, married one, two, three, or four years, kind of proud of their year's supply--yet in public they take the occasion to cut each other down by remarks that are intended to impress their associates. Young married couples who take the occasion to cut each other down in public or in private are all mixed up in their home storage priorities. As we learn to build up each other, our personal family storage will grow.<br><br>Let me share with you another choice recent experience. It has to do with a calling of a new patriarch. I asked this good brother, following the call, "If you had your choice, where would you like to have your ordination take place?"<br><br>"Elder Ashton," he said "we will come to your office."<br><br>"That isn't what I asked you," I said. "Where of all the places would you choose to have your ordination take place?"<br><br>He said, "As long as you put it that way, we would love to have it take place in our home with our children and grandchildren present." He said this with great feeling.<br><br>Sister Ashton and I went to their home and participated in an enlarged family home evening. We heard children pay appropriate tribute to a deserving father and heard grandchildren say, "Grandpa is neat." At the close of the hour, all expressed deep appreciation for this choice experience. It was a long-to-be-remembered evening for us. As Sister Ashton and I drove back to our home--quite a few miles--our thoughts were turned to the fact that proper home experiences with children, mother, father, and even grandmother and grandfather are priceless. We had another evidence of the wisdom found in Doctrine and Covenants 20:47. "And visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties." Here again is home storage of eternal significance going forward.<br><br>May I share another experience. In Tonga during a missionary preparation session, with a twinkle in my eye, I was impressed to say jokingly to the full-time missionaries. "Perhaps one of the best ways to increase our baptisms and convert all of the people of Tonga would be for one of you lady missionaries at a later date to become acquainted with the king's son--late in his twenties and unmarried--and to fall in love with him and start the process of conversion from the top level."<br><br>To this quip, one of the native Tongan lady missionaries stood up and in broken English said, "None of us would go with him, Elder Ashton. He doesn't hold a temple recommend." I do not mind telling you my mind went again to money, children, mother, father, husband, and wife. Here was a beautiful young lady missionary teaching the lesson, with a smile on her face, that a happy home with children, mother, and father is much more important than money, thrones, and earthly possessions. These attitudes, properly stored and shared, whether they be by missionaries or students or leaders, will prevent spiritual famine.<br><br>Let me share with you part of a letter recently received to indicate again how it is possible on a continuing basis to store as we share eternal goods.<br><br><i>Dear Elder Ashton,</i><br><br><i>At the beginning of the conference session, as I sat meditating, I was overwhelmed with the beauty of the people in attendance and the spirit I felt, but I was still tremendously sad. I knew the talks would be all about the importance of children, and I felt I was a failure as a mother. When you spoke, even though there were thousands in the building, I knew you were talking just to me. You said we are never failures until we give up on family members and weary in well-doing. You also said that our trials and experiences with our own children will make us more sensitive to the problems of other children that we may be later called upon to serve and lead. I pray that our Heavenly Father will bless our son. It was not his fault that his father and I made mistakes in rearing him. And since he has helped us to better understand other boys, he has done us a good service the hard way. Our son is sixteen. Every time I feel sad, I will remember what you said. We will try to lift others wherever God chooses us to serve without apology and without regret. Thank you for what you have done for me.</i><br><br>I have never met the lady who wrote this letter, but wherever she is, I take this opportunity to publicly thank her for her attitude, her priceless lesson on life--children, mother, father, and true values. Certainly money could not buy the wisdom she shares and stores.<br><br>In regard to this family situation and with the hope that it may provide strength and encouragement to some of you this evening, I share a thought I made in general conference a few years ago as follows--again indicating that hopefully someone can be helped as we meet situations this day that are challenging or discouraging, or family tragedies or opportunities in families where we have question to wonder and to ask why.<br><br><i>I believe we start to fail in the home when we give up on each other. We have not failed until we have quit trying. As long as we are working diligently with love, patience, and long-suffering, despite the odds or the apparent lack of progress, we are not classified as failures in the home. We only start to fail when we give up on a son, daughter, mother, or father.</i>[Conference Report, April 3, 1971, p. 15]<br><br>and, may I add, a husband or a wife. I believe this with all of my heart. In case some of you need to be reminded, this kind of home storage that we have the possibility to accumulate will never be nil as long as we don't give up.<br><br>I humbly suggest that in the days ahead we not only think upon the basics of family food storage--even honey, salt, wheat, water, and peanut butter--but more importantly, upon the eternal basics not available through money--even children, mother, father, husband, and wife wisely sharing as they store eternal nonperishable foods. May I again remind all of us that the only real home storage we can take with us is ourselves and our family. This kind of home storage is replenished as it is shared, and we are able to share only that which we have. I hope and pray that we will look to the future with a positive attitude. There will be a general conference, there will be missionaries called who will go into the field and serve, there will be opportunities for us to be about our Father's business. Be not deceived. Do not be stampeded into doing unusual things because of quotes or misquotes that are given that some people seem ready, willing, and anxious to grasp even though they have no foundation. It is disturbing to me to be way out in the islands of the Pacific and have some missionaries say, "Is it true we will not finish our missions because there will be a famine?" I want all of us to know that the work of the Lord is going forward and it will go forward according to his plans. President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God. I bring you his love and greetings this night and remind you that he is about his Father's business and he stores as he shares and he shares as he stores.<br><br>May the Lord help us to be prudent in our daily storage and in our sharing processes and help us to realize that only through children, mother, father, husband, and wife relationships can eternal home storage be realized. This type of family home storage doesn't cost money, but the benefits will go on through eternity. To these truths I leave my testimony and my witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>nd in Our Nation’s History - Ezra Taft Benson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brethren and sisters, I was very pleased that you were kind to me as I came in late. I remember Elder Orson F. Whitney, a member of the Twelve who was traveling out to a stake conference years ago by train. He was concentrating on the scriptures as he rode, and he went right by the place where he should have gotten off for the conference. He found himself two or three miles beyond at another town. He got out and hired a livery rig (horse and buggy) to drive him back. The stake president had waited and waited and finally decided he had better start the meeting. As Brother Whitney walked in, the choir was singing "Ye Simple Souls Who Stray." I would have not been surprised if you had been singing that as I came in.<br><br>I had an anxiety about coming here. For thirty-three years I have had the honor and privilege of coming here and enjoying communicating with the students, speaking to them. I have had a fear that sooner or later you would place me in the embarrassing position that an old lady placed a railroad conductor in up in Boise, Idaho. This good woman had never had a ride on a train. Her family were all married and she was on a little, rocky farm, all alone. She wanted to have a ride on a train before she passed on. Her children also wanted her to have that experience, and so it was decided she would take a trip to a distant town and visit some relatives during the holidays. When the time arrived, she came down to Boise all aflutter with excitement. When the train pulled in, her excitement increased. Soon the conductor waved his hand and called, "All aboard." The old lady got on the train and took her seat. Then the conductor came down the aisle picking up tickets, and she said, "Conductor, I don't know much about railway trains. Now, I knew what you meant when you called, 'All aboard,' but I didn't know what you meant when you waved your hand."<br><br>The conductor, a rather rough sort of fellow, said, "Oh, that was just my signal for the engineer to get the h-- out of here." It answered her question, but she didn't like it, and as the conductor went on picking up tickets his conscience began to smite him. He thought that was not a very gentlemanly way to speak to a lovely old lady. So when he finished the car, he went back and began to apologize, but she just waved her hand. Sooner or later I fear this may happen to me if I keep coming to BYU, but I hope it isn't tonight.<br><br>Seriously, I am very, very happy to be here. I appreciate the kind words of introduction by President Fox, this choice music, and this lovely patriotic number by my lovely daughter.<br><br>This has been a lovely Sabbath for me. I had the pleasure of conducting a five-hour meeting with my Brethren on the fourth floor of the Temple this morning. Then Sister Benson and I had the opportunity of going to a sacrament meeting in our ward which proved to be a Primary conference. I made the mistake, as they asked me to say a few words, of saying the first time I had ever had an assignment requiring me to appear alone in a song was when I was seven years of age in our ward up in Idaho. I said I sang this song with the encouragement of my mother and the wonderful Primary teacher. The song was "A Mormon Boy," and I said if I weren't afraid of losing the audience I would sing it. They pledged they would remain regardless, and so I sang the song. I have had quite an experience today!<br><br>Now to come here, and to look into your faces and realize something of your quality, your opportunities, your background, is an inspiration. I am thankful to the Lord for this student body, under the leadership of our great President and under the leadership of these stake presidencies, and the twelve stakes that operate on this campus.<br><br>I have been uplifted by this music, and I express appreciation to those who have participated. Their talent has provided, I believe, a rather fitting background and a setting to the remarks which I hope to leave with you this evening. The song "God Bless America" by Irving Berlin was given to the Boy Scouts of America--dedicated to them. All the returns from the sale of the song, which have run into many, many thousands of dollars, are still going to the Boy Scouts of America. Having served on the board for many years, I appreciate this song.<br><br>I come to you tonight with a message that has lain close to my heart for a number of years. Because of the nature of it I have committed most of it to writing. Tonight I will speak to you about our beloved republic and the inspired agents whom God raised up to establish the foundation upon which our liberty rests. I will speak to you also about some mischief that has been afoot for a number of years, a mischief that intends to undermine our republic, its founders, and the Church. I address you as students and faculty of this great University; but more importantly, I speak to you as members of the "household of faith," the Lord's true church, and remind you of your solemn charge to uphold, sustain, and defend the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>Prophecies About America's Destiny</b></h2><br>The destiny of America was divinely decreed. The events which established our great nation were foreknown to God and revealed to prophets of old. As in an enacted drama, the players who came on the scene were rehearsed and selected for their parts. Their talents, abilities, capacities, and weaknesses were known before they were born.<br><br>As one looks back upon what we call our history, there is a telling theme which recurs again and again in this drama. It is that God governs in the affairs of this nation. As the late J. Reuben Clark, Jr., has said, "This is the great motive which runs through our whole history."<br><br>A statement which Harold B. Lee was fond of quoting was this: "The frequent recurrence to fundamentals is essential to perpetuity."<br><br>As one who is vitally concerned about the perpetuity of our liberties, our freedoms, and the principles laid down by the founders of this country, I refer to some fundamentals with which most of you are familiar. To do so, I quote liberally from modern revelation from which I want you to sense this recurring theme that those whom we uphold as prophets of God repeatedly emphasize. This is appropriate this Bicentennial year, particularly.<br><br>Unto the prophet Lehi the Lord revealed:<br><br><i>There shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.</i>[2 Nephi 1:6–7]<br><br>To the prophet Nephi, son of Lehi, the Lord said: "And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands" (1 Nephi 2:20). Later Nephi saw this in vision: "And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, and it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters" (1 Nephi 13:12). Though unnamed, the man this passage refers to is Columbus. His own testimony about this epic voyage is recorded in a letter to the Spanish hierarchy and reads as follows: "Our Lord unlocked my mind, sent me upon the sea, and gave me fire for the deed. Those who heard of my enterprise called it foolish, mocked me, and laughed. But who can doubt but that the Holy Ghost inspired me?" (Jacob Wasserman,<i>Columbus: Don Quixote of the Seas</i>[Boston: Little, Brown &amp;amp; Co., 1930], pp. 19–20).<br><br>Nephi then continues his record:<br><br><i>And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles [the American colonies] and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance. . . .</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity</i>[from Europe]<i>did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.</i>[1 Nephi 13:15, 16]<br><br>This refers, of course, to the American colonists.<br><br>Nephi then foresaw the great War of Independence. He said:<br><br><i>And I beheld that their mother Gentiles</i>[the British]<i>were gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them.</i><br><br><i>And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those who were gathered together against them to battle.</i><br><br><i>And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.</i>[1 Nephi 13:17–19]<br><br>All this was foreseen over twenty-three hundred years before it took place. Nephi's brother Jacob declared:<br><br><i>But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.</i><br><br><i>And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.</i><br><br><i>And I will fortify this land against all other nations.</i><br><br><i>And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God.</i><br><br><i>For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words.</i>[2 Nephi 10:10–14]<br><br>America is a choice land, a land reserved for God's own purposes. America and its inhabitants are under an everlasting decree. The Lord revealed this decree to the brother of Jared. He declared:<br><br><i>And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity.</i><br><br><i>For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands, wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ.</i>[Ether 2:9–10, 12]<br><br>Many great events have transpired in this land of destiny. This was the place where Adam dwelt; this was the place where the Garden of Eden was located. It was here that Adam met with a body of great high priests at Adam-ondi-Ahman shortly before his death and gave them his final blessing, and the place to which he will return to meet with the leaders of his people. This was the place of three former civilizations: Adam's, the Jaredite, and the Nephite. This was also the place where our Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph Smith inaugurating this great and last dispensation.<br><br>The Lord has also decreed that this land should be "the place of the New Jerusalem, which should come down out of heaven, . . . the holy sanctuary of the Lord" (Ether 13:3). Here is our nation's destiny! To serve God's eternal purposes and to prepare this land and people for America's eventual destiny, he "established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom [he] raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood" (D&amp;amp;C 101:80).<br><h2><b>Inaccuracies of Secular History</b></h2><br>No man, however brilliant and perceptive, shall have a complete perspective of our nation's history without this understanding and conviction. He must be persuaded by God's truth if he is to obtain a true and complete picture of our nation's origin and destiny. Secular scholarship, though useful, provides an incomplete and sometimes inaccurate view of our history. The real story of America is one which shows the hand of God in our nation's beginning.<br><br>Why is it that this view of our history is almost lost in classrooms in America? Why is it that one must turn to the writers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to find this view implied or stated? The answer may, perhaps, be found in Abraham Lincoln's proclamation:<br><br><i>We have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God who made us.</i>["A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America," 30 March 1863]<br><br>As a nation we have become self-sufficient. This has given birth to a new religion in America which some have called secularism. This is a view of life without the idea that God is in the picture or that He had anything to do with the picture in the first place.<br><br>In the first century of our nation's history, the university was the guardian and the preserver of faith in God. In this present century, the university has become ethically neutral, by and large, agnostic. Our country is now reaping the effects of this agnostic influence. It has cost us an inestimable price. For who can place the price on the worth of a human soul or the cost of the cynicism that many young people have toward our republic and its leaders?<br><br>I would have you consider soberly how this secular influence has affected the treatment of our nation's history in the textbook in the classroom. Today, students are subjected in their textbooks and classroom lectures to a subtle propaganda that there is a "natural" or a rational explanation to all causes and events. Such a position removes the need for a faith in God, or belief in His interposition in the affairs of men. Events are<i>only--</i>and I stress that<i>--only</i>explained from a humanistic frame of reference. At least that's what they say.<br><br>Historians and educational writers who are responsible for this movement are classified as "revisionists." Their purpose has been and is to create a "new history." By their own admission, they are more influenced by their own training and other humanistic and scientific disciplines than any religious conviction. This detachment provides them, they say, with an objectivity that the older historians did not have. Many of the older historians, I should point out, were defenders of the patriots and their noble efforts. Feeling no obligation to perpetuate the ideals of the founding fathers, some of the so-called "new historians" have recast a new body of beliefs for their secular faith. Their efforts, in some cases, have resulted in a new interpretation of our nation's history.<br><h2><b>Secular Reinterpretations of American History</b></h2><br>May I illustrate a few of these reinterpretations: First, that the American victory in the War of Independence, they say, was only the result of good fortune, ineptitude by the British generals, and the entrance of France into the war. All these facts are evident, but what is significantly left out are additional explanations which could provide the student with a spiritual perspective of our history.<br><br>Why is it we do not read in our history of explanations such as this from George Washington? "The success which has hitherto attended our united efforts, we owe to the gracious interposition of heaven, and to that interposition let us gratefully ascribe the praise of victory and the blessings of peace."<br><br>Our second reinterpretation is that the political thought of the founding fathers was the result of borrowed ideas from the eighteenth-century philosophers. Again, it is evident that the founders were men well schooled in the political thought of their times as well as of ancient civilizations, but how does one account for the unity which came out of the impasse among the delegates at the Constitutional Convention? It was at this point that Benjamin Franklin made his great speech. He solemnly counseled:<br><br><i>I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth: that God governs in the affairs of man. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid?</i><br><br><i>We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings that "except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it." I firmly believe this. And I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little, partial, local interest. Our projects will be confounded, and we, ourselves, shall become a reproach and a byword to future ages; and what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance, war, and conquest.</i><br><br><i>I therefore make the move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy in this city be requested to officiate in that service.</i><br><br>Some historians have ignored this dimension because Madison, who reported the Constitutional Convention, said nothing about it. Others report that the motion was not acted on. Another member of the convention, Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey, who also reported it, said the motion was acted on favorably by the convention.<br><br>Again, I would ask: Why is it that the references to God's influence in the noble efforts of the founders of our republic are not mentioned? Listen to the convictions of two of these delegates to the Constitutional Convention. First, Charles Pinckney: "When the great work was done and published, I was struck with amazement. Nothing less than the superintending hand of Providence that so miraculously carried us through the war . . . could have brought it about so complete upon the whole." Here is another testimony, this from James Madison, sometimes referred to as the "Father of the Constitution": "It is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution."<br><br>Third, the charge has been made that the founders designed the Constitution primarily to benefit themselves and their "class" (property owners) financially and that the economic motive was their dominant incentive. Such was the thesis of the American historian, Dr. Charles Beard. Yet Madison said: "There was never an assembly of men . . . who were more pure in their motives." We must remember that these were men who had pledged in many cases their fortunes and their sacred honor.<br><br>Shortly after the turn of this century, Charles Beard published his work,<i>An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States.</i>This book marked the beginning of a trend to defame the motives and integrity of the founders of the Constitution. It also grossly distorted the real intent of the founders by suggesting their motivation was determined by economics--a thesis which had originated with Karl Marx. Beard himself was not a Marxist, but he was socialist in his thinking, and he admitted there was much we could learn from Marx's ideas. Before his death, Beard recanted his own thesis, but the damage had been done. This began a new trend in educational and intellectual circles in the United States.<br><h2><b>Intellectual Trends Defaming the Founding Fathers</b></h2><br>Not infrequently this penchant for historical criticism has resulted in the defamation of character of the founding fathers. It is done under the guise of removing the so-called "myths" that surround their background. A favorite target of this defamation has been George Washington, our nation's most illustrious leader. Some of these so-called "new" historians have questioned his honesty, challenged his military leadership and executive ability, and impuned his moral character.<br><br>Others who have taken measure of the man have assessed matters differently. John Lord, author of a well known work of the nineteenth century,<i>Beacon Lights of History,</i>wrote this of Washington:<br><br><i>Washington . . . had . . . a transcendent character. . . . As a man he had his faults, but they were so few, and so small, that they seemed to be but spots upon a sun. These have been forgotten, and as the ages roll on, mankind will see naught but the lustre of his virtues of the greatness of his services.</i>[<i>Beacon Lights of History</i>(New York: Fords, Howard, and Hulbert, 1884), 7:168]<br><br>Winston Churchill also estimated Washington thus:<br><br><i>George Washington holds one of the proudest titles that history can bestow. He was the Father of his Nation. Almost alone his staunchness in the War of Independence held the American colonies to their united purpose. . . . He filled his office with dignity and inspired his administration with much of his own wisdom. To his terms as President are due the smooth organization of the Federation Government, the establishment of national credit, and the foundation of foreign policy.</i>[<i>A History of the English Speaking People: The Age of Revolution</i>(New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company, 1962), p. 347]<br><br>General William Wilbur, author of the commendable little volume entitled<i>The Making of George Washington,</i>which I commend to all, made this appraisal of Washington:<br><br><i>. . . greatness of moral character, forthright honesty, quiet modesty, thoughtful consideration of others, integrity, thoroughness, kindness and generosity.</i><br><br><i>During the American Revolution and for more than fifty years thereafter, young Americans were inspired to attain these qualities by the vivid recollection of men who had served with George Washington--men who knew him from intimate daily association. As years went by, books, stories, and living personal memories all combined to present this great hero in such a way as to make him an inspiring and potent influence for good.</i><br><br><i>Unfortunately, the last seventy-five years have produced a marked change. In these years it has come to be standard practice for Washington authors to proclaim it as their purpose to "humanize" the Washington image. Most of them have instead succeeded in belittling him. They have replaced a glorious, inspiring memory with a tawdry, warped picture.</i>[<i>The Making of George Washington,</i>pp. 19, 20, 21]<br><br>Elder Mark E. Petersen has recently written a remarkable little book entitled<i>The Great Prologue.</i>It provides the prophetic history to our nation's history and its founders. The Deseret Book Company has published a Bicentennial edition in paperback. I would heartily recommend that you read and study this book. Within that volume Elder Petersen assesses Washington's character in these words:<br><br><i>In many respects</i>[Washington]<i>was like Moroni, the noted general of the Book of Mormon who . . . hoisted his banner of liberty. Washington was the personification of honesty, even as Lincoln, with whom he became a supreme example of integrity in public office. He had the true vision of one united nation of separate states with an inspired Constitution to give strength to the whole but with liberty assured to the several units.</i>[<i>The Great Prologue</i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1975), pp. 90–91]<br><br>And lest these testimonies are not convincing, President Wilford Woodruff said of the founders collectively, and of Washington specifically, the following:<br><br><i>I am going to bear my testimony to this assembly, if I never do it again in my life, that those men who laid the foundation of this American government . . . were the best spirits the God of heaven could find on the face of the earth. These were choice spirits, not wicked men. General Washington and all of the men that labored for the purpose were inspired of the Lord . . . . Everyone of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence with General Washington called upon me as an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ in the temple at St. George two consecutive nights and demanded at my hands that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the House of God for them. . . .</i><br><br><i>Brother McAllister baptized me for all of those men, and then I told those brethren that it was their duty to go into the temple and labor until they had got endowments for all of them. They did it. Would these spirits have called on me, as an elder in Israel, to perform this work if they had not been noble spirits before God. They would not.</i>[<i>Conference Report,</i>April 1898, pp. 89, 90]<br><br>The temple work for the fifty-six signers of the Declaration of Independence and other founding fathers has been done. All these appeared to Wilford Woodruff when he was president of the St. George Temple. President George Washington was ordained a high priest at that time. You will also be interested to know that, according to Wilford Woodruff's journal, John Wesley, Benjamin Franklin, and Christopher Columbus were also ordained high priests--by proxy, of course--at that time.<br><br>When one casts doubt about the character of these noble sons of God, I believe he or she will have to answer to the God of heaven for it. Yes, with Lincoln I say, "To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is . . . impossible. Let none attempt it. In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on." That is the charge I would leave to people everywhere, faculty, students, others of this and every other university--leave Washington's name "shining on."<br><br>May no teacher, in the name of scholarship, attempt to blemish Washington's illustrious character.<br><br>If ever this country needed the timeless wisdom of the Father of our Country, it is today. How much our country could benefit by following the wisdom of our country's first president. Here are a few among many of his maxims:<br><br><i>Let the reigns of government then be braced and held with a steady hand and every violation of the Constitution be reprehended: if defective, let it be amended, but not suffered to be trampeled upon whilst it has an existence.</i><br><br><i>To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.</i><br><br><i>The love of my country will be the ruling influence of my conduct.</i><br><br><i>A good moral character is the first essential in a man. . . . It is therefore highly important that you should endeavor not only to be learned, but virtuous.</i><br><br><i>Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations to spread his holy protection over these United States: to turn the machinations of the wicked to confirming of our constitution: to enable us all at times to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight: to perpetuate to our country that prosperity which his goodness has already conferred, and to verify the anticipation of this government being a safeguard to human rights.</i><br><br>It would profit all of us as citizens to read again Washington's Farewell Address to his countrymen. The address is prophetic. I believe it ranks alongside the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.<br><br>My feeling about this tendency to discredit our founding fathers was well summarized by the late President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., in these words:<br><br><i>These were the horse and buggy days, as they have been called in derision. These were the men who traveled in the horsedrawn buggies and on horseback; but these were the men who carried under their hats, as they rode in their buggies and on their horses, a political wisdom garnered from the ages. As giants to pygmies are they when placed along side our political emigres and their fellow travelers of today who now traduce them with slighting words and contemptuous phrase.</i>[<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution,</i>pp. 136–37]<br><h2><b>Current American Self-Criticism</b></h2><br>Today we are almost engulfed by this tide of self-criticism, depreciation, and defamation of those who served our country honorably and with distinction. A most recent victim of the tarnish brush is J. Edgar Hoover. I knew J. Edgar Hoover personally over many years. He was a God-fearing man and one of the most honorable and able men I have ever known in government service. By innuendo, lesser men, whose own motives are questionable, have maligned his motives and good character.<br><br>I know the philosophy behind this practice--"to tell it as it is." All too often those who subscribe to this philosophy are not hampered by too many facts. When will we awaken to the fact that the defamation of our dead heroes only serves to undermine faith in the principles for which they stood, and the institutions which they established? Some have termed this practice as "historical realism" or moderately call it "debunking." I call it slander and defamation. I repeat, those who are guilty of it in their writing or teaching will answer to a higher tribunal.<br><br>It should not, therefore, cause us to be astonished when other nations view the United States as a "faltering democracy." How long would a basketball team, ranked number one in the polls, remain in that position if the studentbody, the school paper, and supporting faculty constantly pointed out its weaknesses? Soon the team would begin to lack confidence and fail. This is what we have been doing in our blessed country. Our heroes and institutions have been tarnished. We are constantly being reminded of what is wrong in our country, via the press and other media. A recent editorial in the<i>London Daily Telegraph</i>appealed to us:<br><br><i>The United States should know that her European cousins and allies are appalled and disgusted at the present open disarray of her public life. The self-criticism and self-destructive tendencies are running mad with no countervailing force in sight. . . . Please America, for God's sake, pull yourself together.</i><br><br>It is the job of the historian and educator and church leader to help us as a nation to "pull ourselves together," to help us regain perspective and vision and the respect of all nations. This will not be done by showing that this is merely a phase through which we are passing. No, it will be done by men who possess a love of country, a vision of our country's future, and the assurance of her divinely guided destiny.<br><h2><b>Humanistic Trends in Church History</b></h2><br>This humanistic emphasis on history is not confined only to secular history; there have been and continue to be attempts made to bring this philosophy into our own Church history. Again the emphasis is to underplay revelation and God's intervention in significant events and to inordinately humanize the prophets of God so that their human frailties become more apparent than their spiritual qualities. It is a state of mind and spirit characterized by one history buff, who asked: "Do you believe the Church has arrived at a sufficient state of maturity where we can begin to tell our<i>real</i>story?"<br><br>Implied in that question is the accusation that the Church has not been telling the truth.<br><br>Unfortunately, too many of those who have been intellectually gifted become so imbued with criticism that they become disaffected spiritually.<br><br>Some of these have attempted to reinterpret Joseph Smith and his revelations; they offer what they call a psychological interpretation of his motives and actions. This interpretation suggests that whether or not Joseph Smith actually saw God, the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, or other visions is really unimportant. What matters is that he<i>thought</i>he did. To those who have not sought after or received a testimony of Joseph Smith's divine calling, he will ever remain what one called "the enigma from Palmyra."<br><br>I recall the prophetic pronouncement made by President George Albert Smith when one of our own apostatized and wrote a biography about the Prophet Joseph Smith. President Smith made this statement before the general conference of the Church. It has been repeated a number of times by President Harold B. Lee and others. I quote:<br><br><i>There have been some who have belittled</i>[Joseph Smith],<i>but I would like to say that those who have done so will be forgotten and their remains will go back to mother earth, . . . and, the odor of their infamy will never die, while the glory and honor and majesty and courage and fidelity manifested by the Prophet Joseph Smith will attach to his name forever.</i>[George Albert Smith,<i>Confer</i>ence<i>Report,</i>April 1946, p. 182]<br><br>No writer can ever accurately portray a prophet of God if he or she does not believe in prophecy. They cannot succeed in writing what they do not have in personal faith. That is why the best biography on Joseph Smith to date was one done by one who knew him and who served the Church as an apostle and member of the First Presidency. I refer to George Q. Cannon's inspiring work,<i>The Life of Joseph Smith.</i><br><br>Another prophet whom some historians like to humanize is Brigham Young. One writer accuses him of being "an accessory after the fact" to the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre incident. He is sometimes referred to as an autocrat. Another fictionalized version of him is that he was continually groping for a revelation which never came to him. Among many testimonies to the contrary are these. Brigham Young himself declared:<br><br><i>God has shown me that this is the spot to locate this people. . . . We shall build a city and a temple to the Most High God in this place. We will extend our settlements to the east and west, to the north and to the south, and we will build towns and cities by the hundreds and thousands of Saints will gather in from the nations of the earth. This will become a great highway of the nation. Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here.</i>[Quoted in<i>Autobiography of James Brown,</i>pp. 119–23]<br><br>Wilford Woodruff said this of Brigham Young: "Brigham Young saw the Salt Lake Valley in vision, . . . and . . . the future glory of Zion and Israel, as they would be, planted in the valleys of the mountains."<br><br>More recently, one of our Church educators published what he purports to be a history of the Church's stand on the question of organic evolution. His thesis challenges the integrity of a prophet of God. He suggests that Joseph Fielding Smith published his work,<i>Man: His Origin and Destiny,</i>against the counsel of the First Presidency and his own Brethren. This writer's interpretation is not only inaccurate, but it also runs counter to the testimony of Elder Mark E. Petersen, who wrote this foreword to Elder Smith's book, a book I would encourage all to read. Elder Petersen said:<br><br><i>Some of us</i>[members of the Council of the Twelve]<i>urged</i>[Elder Joseph Fielding Smith]<i>to write a book on the creation of the world and the origin of man. . . . The present volume is the result. It is a most remarkable presentation of material from both sources</i>[science and religion]<i>under discussion. It will fill a great need in the Church and will be particularly invaluable to students who have become confused by the misapplication of information derived from scientific experimentation.</i><br><br>When one understands that the author to whom I alluded is an exponent of the theory of organic evolution, his motive in disparaging President Joseph Fielding Smith becomes apparent. To hold to a private opinion on such matters is one thing, but when one undertakes to publish his views to discredit the work of a prophet, it is a very serious matter.<br><br>It is also apparent to all who have the Spirit of God in them that Joseph Fielding Smith's writings will stand the test of time.<br><h2><b>The Profession of History</b></h2><br>Tonight I have spoken plainly to you. Lest there be some who get the impression that I am an antagonist to the discipline of history and historians, let me declare my feelings about that noble profession. I love to read history and historical biography. I have great respect for the historian who can put into proper perspective events and people and make history come alive. I believe the maxim that "those who do not understand the lessons of the past are doomed to repeat those errors anew." I love history books that tell history as it was--as the Book of Mormon tells it--with God in the picture, guiding and directing the affairs of the righteous. I love to read history for its timeless lessons and the inspiration I can gather from the lives of great leaders. I have been privileged to know many in my lifetime who have made history both in the world scene and in the Church.<br><br>I suppose there will be some who will suggest that a fireside is neither the time nor the place for these kinds of remarks, that they would be better confined to the closed door of a faculty forum.<br><br>My purpose this evening is to help you to discern a trend that has been destructive to the faith of many of our people in our nation's founders and our country's divine origin and destiny. My purpose further is to forewarn you about a humanistic emphasis which would tarnish our own Church history and its leaders.<br><br>My plea to you tonight is to stir up the gift that is within you. You will recall the Lord told us why we needed to exercise the spiritual gifts he has given us: "Beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts" (D&amp;amp;C 46:8). If there was ever the need to apply that counsel, it is now. Those gifts of the Spirit are needed to discern truth from error.<br><br>This University was built by the consecrated funds of the Church for the purpose that our youth could be taught the truth, both secular and spiritual. That commission places a great responsibility on both teacher and student. Of that unique commission, President Marion G. Romney has said:<br><br><i>The unique commission of the Brigham Young University has always been and now is threefold. First, to help you recognize that there are two sources of learning--one divine, the other human; second, to urge and inspire you students to drink deeply from both sources; and third, to teach and train you to correctly distinguish between the learning of the world and revealed truth, that you may not be deceived in your search.</i><br><br><i>This unique commission puts peculiar responsibility upon both teachers and students not imposed by any other university on the globe. The teacher at Brigham Young University has an obligation to keep these distinctions clear in his own thinking and in his own heart and to make sure that they are indelibly stamped upon the minds and hearts of his students. The student has the obligation to realize that an acquaintance with the learning of men, as well as a knowledge of the revealed word of God, is essential to the proper discharge of our teaching obligation to the world.</i><br><br><i>Don't let anyone persuade you there is anything narrow-minded or provincial or bigoted about this view.</i><br><br><i>Both the teacher and the student who have been born again, who have been on the mountain top and beheld in vision the mighty mission of this university in saving the souls of men, enjoy here a freedom available in no other university--the freedom to seek learning, both human and divine, "by study and also by faith," and the freedom to teach without restriction the finite wisdom of men by the glowing light of the infinite wisdom of God, so far as He has revealed it. The spiritually reborn do not have their academic freedom restricted but greatly extended at Brigham Young University.</i><br><br><i>Equipped with the fruit of an education on this campus, you should continue your quest for truth with the certain knowledge that "the spirit of truth is of God," with a fixed determination to unceasingly pursue the goal inspired in the promise, "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things." (D&amp;amp;C 93:28.)</i>["Your Quest for Truth," Baccalaureate Services, 30 May 1957]<br><br>It is now my privilege as one of the Lord's witnesses to bear my testimony to you concerning the matters we have been discussing this evening.<br><br>I bear witness to you that America's history was foreknown to God; that His divine intervention and merciful providence have given us both peace and prosperity in this beloved land; that through His omniscience and benevolent design, He selected and sent some of His choicest spirits to lay the foundation of our government. These men were inspired of God to do the work which they accomplished. They were not evil men. Their work was a prologue to the restoration of the gospel and the church of Jesus Christ. It was done in fulfillment of the ancient prophets who declared that this was a promised land, "a land of liberty unto the Gentiles," and that is us.<br><br>I testify to all of you--young and old--that God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son Jesus Christ have visited this land. They appeared in the state of New York to Joseph Smith, Jr. I testify that their appearance was a reality. Since that time the work of God has moved forward under the inspired leadership and prophetic direction of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and our prophet today, Spencer W. Kimball. This is the kingdom which Daniel of old saw in vision--a kingdom "which shall never be destroyed: and . . . shall not be left to other people" (Daniel 2:44). This Church and kingdom is on course in fulfilling its prophetic destiny.<br><br>I testify that this is the Lord's church. He presides over it and is close to His servants. He is not an absentee master; of that you can be assured. Yes, you young people are privileged to live in this choice land--a land of Zion--a land reserved for the second coming of our Lord and Savior, and the Lord's base of operations today. When all these events are finished and written, we will look back and not be astonished to see that the prophecies, ancient and modern, about this land and these events were but our history in reverse. For that is what prophecy is.<br><br>May God bless us all to be faithful and true to this vision and to uphold, sustain, and defend this nation, its founders, and the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 28 March 1976.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

My beloved brethren and sisters, humbly and gratefully I stand before you this morning and seek an interest in your faith and prayers that the message that I have may be accompanied by the Spirit. It is a wonderful sight that I view here this morning. It is good to be with you, my beloved young friends, distinguished members of the faculty, and special guests.<br><br>My wife and I have just returned from a glorious weekend at St. George, where I had the privilege of addressing three overflow audiences, two in the largest auditorium they have at Dixie College and made up largely of young people, and one on the fourth floor of the temple in a Solemn Assembly. We were honoring the centennial of the dedication of the St. George Temple, the first one to be erected in the western part of the country. We are still basking in the aftermath of another great general conference of the Church. Never in my memory have we had more explicit warnings from prophets of God; and nowhere in the world are there men better prepared or more obligated to issue such warnings.<br><h2><b>The Celestial Kingdom</b></h2><br>Today I want to discuss some principles and laws of the celestial kingdom, and some of the fallacies of their perverted counterfeits in the world. I share with you a vision of your eternal possibilities. The celestial kingdom, residence of God, our Eternal Father, is comprised of men and women who have complied with divine law and who were not deceived by the craftiness of men or the doctrines of devils. They are just men made perfect through the mediation and atonement of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 76:69). They are obedient to celestial law; for, as the Lord has said, he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory (D&amp;amp;C 88:22).<br><br>Celestial laws, embodied in certain ordinances belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ, are complied with by voluntary covenants. The laws are spiritual. Thus, our Father in Heaven has ordained certain holy sanctuaries, called temples, in which these laws may be fully explained, the laws include the law of obedience and sacrifice, the law of the gospel, the law of chastity, and the law of consecration.<br><br>I want to speak more particularly this morning about this one law--the law of consecration. It is that one's time, talents, strength, property, and money are given up to the Lord for the express purpose of building up the kingdom of God and establishing Zion on the earth. Or, as we read in Doctrine and Covenants 105:5, "Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom."<br><br>Much has been written about this law and its attempted implementations in the early history of the Church; and much deception has taken root, even among some of our members, because of misinformed opinion or misguided interpretations. Some view it as merely an economic alternative to capitalism or the free enterprise system, others as an outgrowth of early communal experiments in America. Such a view is not only shortsighted but tends to diminish in importance a binding requirement for entrance into the celestial kingdom. The law of consecration is a celestial law, not an economic experiment.<br><br>The vehicle for implementing the law of consecration is the united order. The basic principle underlying the united order is that everything we have belongs to the Lord; and, therefore, the Lord may call upon us for any and all of our property, because it belongs to him. The united order was entered by "a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken" (D&amp;amp;C 42:30), according to the scriptures. In other words, an individual conveys his titles to all his property to the Church through the bishop. The property becomes the property of the Church. You read about this in the forty-second section of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>The bishop then deeds back to the consecrator by legal instrument the amount of personal property required by the individual for the support of himself and his family, as the Lord declares, "according to his circumstances and his wants and needs" (D&amp;amp;C 51:3). This becomes the private, personal property of the individual to develop as he sees fit. It is his stewardship. When an individual produces a profit or surplus more than is needful for the support of himself and his family, the surplus is then placed in the bishops storehouse to administer to the poor and the needy. Under the united order, idleness has no place, and greed, selfishness, and covetousness are condemned. The united order may therefore operate with only a righteous people.<br><br>It has been erroneously concluded by some that the united order is both communal and communistic in theory and practice because the revelations speak of equality. Equality under the united order is not economic and social leveling as advocated by some today. Equality, as described by the Lord, is "equal[ity] according to [a man's] family, according to his circumstances and his wants and needs" (D&amp;amp;C 51:3).<br><br>Is the united order a communal system? Emphatically not. It never has been and never will be. It is "intensely individualistic." Does the united order eliminate private ownership of property? No. "The fundamental principle of this system [is] the private ownership of property" (J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1942, p. 57).<br><br>Two separate groups of saints have fully implemented this divine law. The first was the united order under Enoch, wherein the Lord designated this people Zion, "because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them." We read of this in the seventh chapter, eighteenth verse, of Moses, in the Pearl of Great Price. A second instance was the Nephite civilization following the visit of the Savior to the Western Hemisphere after his resurrection. This is recorded in 4 Nephi, the third verse particularly. The failure of the early Saints in this dispensation to live according to the fulness of the law is explained by the Lord in revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants, sections 101 and 105.<br><br>I repeat and emphasize that the law of consecration is a law for an inheritance in the celestial kingdom. God, the Eternal Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and all holy beings abide by this law. It is an eternal law. It is a revelation by God to his Church in this dispensation. Though not in full operation today, it will be mandatory for all Saints to live the law in its fulness to receive celestial inheritance. You young people today abide a portion of this higher law as you tithe, pay a generous fast offering, go on missions, and make other contributions of money, service, and time.<br><h2><b>Satan's Counterfeit System</b></h2><br>But whenever the God of heaven establishes by revelation his design, Satan always comes among men to pervert the doctrine, saying, "Believe it not." He often establishes a counterfeit system, designed to deceive the children of men. His aim, as it was before the foundation of this earth was laid, is to thwart the agency of man and to subjugate him. Throughout all ages of mankind, the adversary has used human agents and despotic governments to establish his purpose. Satan is determined to destroy all that is dear, all that will ennoble and exalt man to a celestial kingdom.<br><br>Isaiah foresaw the time when a marvelous work and a wonder would come forth among men (see Isaiah 29:14). Isaiah also predicted that there would be those that "seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they [shall] say, Who seeth us?" (Isaiah 29:15). He saw the time when the work, man, shall say of him that made him, "He made me not," denying his creation (see Isaiah 29:16). It is well to ask what self-proclaimed atheists came on the human scene following the restoration of the gospel, who established secret works of darkness to overthrow nations by violent revolution and who blasphemously proclaimed the atheistic doctrine that God made us not. Yes, Satan works through human agents. We need only look to some of the ignoble figures in human history who were contemporary to the restoration of the gospel to discover fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy. I refer to the infamous founders of communism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Today, if we are alert, we can see further fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecies.<br><h2><b>Communism--a System Antithetical to the Gospel of Christ</b></h2><br>Through the instigation of Marx and Engels, a most successful counterfeit to the united order was introduced into the world. The declaration of principles found in their Manifesto to the World advocated the overthrow of capitalism and free enterprise, the abolition of private property, the elimination of the family as a social unit, the abolition of all classes, the overthrow of all governments, and the establishment of communal ownership of property in a classless, stateless society. All this was to be accomplished by revolution.<br><br>On July 3, 1936, the First Presidency published this warning to Church members. I quote it in part; I hope you will get a copy of the full statement for your files. In part, the statement reads:<br><br><i>. . . Communism is not a political party, nor a political plan under the Constitution; it is a system of government that is the opposite of our Constitutional government. . . .</i><br><br><i>Since Communism, established, would destroy our American Constitutional government, to support Communism is treasonable to our free institutions, and no patriotic American citizen may become either a Communist or supporter of Communism.</i><br><br><i>To our Church members we say, Communism is not the United Order, and bears only the most superficial resemblance thereto. Communism is based upon intolerance and force, the United Order upon love and freedom of conscience and action. . . .</i><br><br><i>Communists cannot establish the United Order, nor will Communism bring it about. . . .</i><br><br><i>Communism being thus hostile to loyal American citizenship and incompatible with true Church membership, of necessity no loyal American citizen and no faithful Church member can be a Communist.</i><br><br><i>We call upon all Church members completely to eschew [and shun] Communism. The safety of our divinely inspired Constitutional government and the welfare of our Church imperatively demand that Communism shall have no place in America.</i><br><br><i>Signed,</i><br><i>President Heber J. Grant</i><br><i>J. Reuben Clark, Jr.</i><br><i>David O. McKay</i><br><i>The First Presidency</i><br><br>You students have only to read some of the speeches and writings of the exiled Russian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to appreciate this farsighted warning of the First Presidency.<br><br>I have been on both sides of the Iron Curtain several times. I have talked to these godless leaders face to face. I say to you with all the sincerity of my soul that since 1933 this godless counterfeit to the gospel has made tremendous progress towards its objective of world domination, for over one-third of the human family are now under totalitarian subjugation.<br><br>Today we are in a battle for the bodies and souls of men. It is a battle between two opposite systems: freedom and slavery, Christ and anti-Christ. The struggle today is more momentous than a decade ago, yet today the conventional wisdom, so called, is that we have got to learn to live with communism, to give up our ideas about national sovereignty. You hear that repeated today. Tell that to the millions--yes, the scores of millions--who have met death or imprisonment under the tyranny of communism. Learn to live with communism? Such would be the death knell of freedom and all we hold dear.<br><br>The gospel of Jesus Christ can prosper only in an atmosphere of freedom. As members of his Church, we have a major responsibility to do all in our power to see that freedom is preserved and safeguarded. I pray that God will bless you to see communism for what it really is: the greatest system of human slavery that the world has ever known. May you not be deceived into believing that the communists have moderated their goal toward world domination. I say to you that so-called detente is a fraud. Time will prove it to be such.<br><br>There is no excuse for any BYU instructor to grant a forum to an avowed communist for the purpose of teaching communism on this campus. It may be done on other campuses in the United States, but it will not be done here.<br><h2><b>Socialism--a Philosophy Incompatible with Man's Liberty</b></h2><br>Another notable counterfeit system to the Lord's plan is collectivized socialism. Socialism derives its philosophy from the founders of communism, Marx and Engels. Communism in practice is socialism. Its purpose is world socialism, which the communists seek to achieve by revolution, and which the socialists seek to achieve by evolution. Both communism and socialism have the same effect upon the individual--a loss of personal liberty. As was said so well by President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., "The two are as two peas in a pod in their ultimate effect upon our liberties."<br><br>Why is socialism incompatible with man's liberty? Socialism cannot work except through an all-powerful state. The state has to be supreme in everything. When individuals begin to exert their God-given rights, the state has to suppress that freedom. So belief in God must be suppressed, and with that gone freedom of conscience and religion must also go. Those are the first of our liberties mentioned in the Bill of Rights.<br><br>There are some among us who would confuse the united order with socialism. That is a serious misunderstanding. It is significant to me that the Prophet Joseph Smith, after attending lectures on socialism in his day, made this official entry in the Church history: "I said I did not believe the doctrine" (Joseph Smith,<i>History of the Church</i>6:33).<br><h2><b>Socialism Disguised under Welfare State Measures</b></h2><br>As citizens of this noble land, we have marched a long way down the soul-destroying road of socialism. If you question that statement, consider the recent testimonial from the Nobel prize-winning economist, Milton Friedman. He indicated that government spending in the United States at all levels amounts to over forty percent of today's total national income. If we continue to follow the trend in which we are heading today, two things will inevitably result: first, a loss of our personal freedom, and second, financial bankruptcy. This is the price we pay when we turn away from God and the principles which he has taught and turn to government to do everything for us. It is the formula by which nations become enslaved.<br><br>This nation was established by the God of heaven as a citadel of liberty. A constitution guaranteeing those liberties was designed under the superintending influence of heaven. I have recounted here before what took place in the St. George Temple when the Founding Fathers of this nation visited President Wilford Woodruff, who was then a member of the Twelve and not president of the Church. The republic which was established was the most nearly perfect system which could have been devised to lead men toward celestial principles. We may liken our system to the law of Moses which leads men to the higher law of Christ.<br><br>Today, two hundred years later, we must sadly observe that we have significantly departed from the principles established by the founders of our country. James Madison opposed the proposal to put Congress in the role of promoting the general welfare according to its whims in these words:<br><br><i>If Congress can employ money indefinitely to the general welfare, they may take the care of religion into their own hands; they may appoint teachers in every state, county and parish and pay them out of their public treasure; they may take into their own hands the education of children, establishing in like manner schools throughout the Union; they may assume the provision of the poor. . . . Were the power of Congress to be established in the latitude contended for</i>[and it was an issue then]<i>, it would subvert the very foundations, and transmute the very nature of the limited Government established by the people of America.</i>[quoted in Donald L. Newquist,<i>Prophets, Principles, and National Survival,</i>p. 342]<br><br>That statement, given as a warning, has proved prophetic. Today Congress is doing what Madison warned about. Many are now advocating that which has become a general practice since the early 1930s: a redistribution of wealth through the federal tax system. That, by definition, is socialism!<br><br>Americans have always been committed to taking care of the poor, aged, and unemployed. We have done this on the basis of Judaic-Christian beliefs and humanitarian principles. It has been fundamental to our way of life that charity must be voluntary if it is to be charity. Compulsory benevolence is not charity. Today's socialists--who call themselves egalitarians--are using the federal government to redistribute wealth in our society, not as a matter of voluntary charity, but as a so-called matter of right. One HEW official said recently, "In this country, welfare is no longer charity, it is a right. More and more Americans feel that their government owes them something" (<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>April 21, 1975, p. 49). President Grover Cleveland said--and we believe as a people--that though the people support the government the government should not support the people.<br><br>The chief weapon used by the federal government to achieve this "equality" is the system of transfer payments. This means that the federal governments collects from one income group and transfer payments to another by the tax system. These payments are made in the form of social security benefits, Medicare and Medicaid, and food stamps, to name a few. Today the cost of such programs has been going in the hole at the rate of 12 billion dollars a year; and, with increased benefits and greater numbers of recipients, even though the tax base has been increased we will have larger deficits in the future.<br><br>Today the party now in power is advocating and has support, apparently in both major parties, for a comprehensive national health insurance program--a euphemism for socialized medicine. Our major danger is that we are currently (and have been for forty years) transferring responsibility from the individual, local, and state governments to the federal government--precisely the same course that led to the economic collapse in Great Britain and New York City. We cannot long pursue the present trend without its bringing us to national insolvency.<br><br>Edmund Burke, the great British political philosopher, warned of the threat of economic equality. He said,<br><br><i>A perfect equality will indeed be produced--that is to say, equal wretchedness, equal beggary, and on the part of the petitioners, a woeful, helpless, and desperate disappointment. Such is the event of all compulsory equalizations. They pull down what is above; they never raise what is below; and they depress high and low together beneath the level of what was originally the lowest.</i><br><br><i></i><br><br>Are we part of the problem or part of the solution?<br><br>Recently a letter came to my office, accompanied by an article from your<i>Daily Universe,</i>on the matter of BYU students taking food stamps. The query of the letter was: "What is the attitude of the Church on taking food stamps?" The Church's view on this is well known. We stand for independence, thrift, and abolition of the dole. This was emphasized in the Saturday morning welfare meeting of general conference. "The aim of the Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership" (Heber J. Grant,<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1936, p. 3).<br><br>When you accept food stamps, you accept an unearned handout that other working people are paying for. You do not earn food stamps or welfare payments. Every individual who accepts an unearned government gratuity is just as morally culpable as the individual who takes a handout from taxpayers' money to pay his heat, electricity, or rent. There is no difference in principle between them. You did not come to this University to become a welfare recipient. You came here to be a light to the world, a light to society--to save society and to help to save this nation, the Lord's base of operations in these latter days, to ameliorate man's social conditions. You are not here to be a parasite or freeloader. The price you pay for "something for nothing" may be more than you can afford. Do not rationalize your acceptance of government gratuities by saying, "I am a contributing taxpayer too." By doing this you contribute to the problem which is leading this nation to financial insolvency.<br><br>Society may rationalize immorality, but God cannot condone it. Society sponsors Sabbathbreaking, but the Church counsels otherwise. Society profanes the name of Deity, but Latter-day Saints cannot countenance it. Because society condones a dole, which demoralizes man and weakens his God-given initiative and character, can we?<br><br>I know what it is, as many of your faculty members do, to work my way through school, taking classes only during winter quarters. If you don't have the finances to complete your education, drop out a semester and go to work and save. You'll be a better man or woman for so doing. You will have preserved your self-respect and initiative. Wisdom comes with experience and struggle, not just with going through a university matriculation. I hope you will not be deceived by current philosophies which will rob you of your godly dignity, self-respect, and initiative, those attributes that make a celestial inheritance possible. It is in that interest, and that only, that I have spoken so plainly to you.<br><h2><b>My Hope for You, the Youth of Zion</b></h2><br>In opening my remarks to you, beloved youth of the Church, I attempted to share with you a vision of your eternal possibilities. In closing my remarks, I share with you my hope for you:<br><br>I hope that you learn through your struggles the joy of achievement.<br><br>I hope that you recognize in the gospel of Jesus Christ a solution to our problems, temporal and spiritual.<br><br>I hope that you marry well, live together in love, rear a family in righteousness, and have joy and rejoicing in your posterity.<br><br>I hope that you follow the example and counsel of him whom the Lord has appointed as prophet, seer, and revelator.<br><br>I hope that you learn the joy of work, the ability to postpone wants, and the economic independence not to be a slave to any man.<br><br>I hope that you keep yourselves clean morally and spiritually, that your confidence will wax strong in the presence of God, as the scriptures say, and the Holy Ghost will be your constant companion (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45–46).<br><br>I hope that you will be united in philosophy, purpose, and action to the laws of the celestial kingdom.<br><br>I pray God's choicest blessings on you, my beloved brethren and sisters. May I say to you that there isn't anything in this world that's right that the leadership of this Church wouldn't do for the youth of the Church; and so I hope and pray that you realize the hope of those who love you and serve you and the possibilities of your potential as sons and daughters of God. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 April 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
My brothers and sisters, I appreciate very much this opportunity to be with you in these wonderful surroundings at this great University. Somebody has said that a thing is usually not only important for itself alone, but it is sometimes even a lot more important for what it is a sign of; and the fact that you are here at this University is a sign of something very important that is going to happen in your life and in the world. Tonight I would like to say something that might be of some benefit or encouragement to you. I do not know that I can do that, but I promise you that I would like to.<br><br>I am going to borrow my text from the prophet Amos as he talked about two particular kinds of famine: one was a famine of bread and a thirst for water, and the other was a famine for hearing the word of the Lord (see Amos 8:11). Our earth has frequently been devastated by this famine for bread, but the famine for hearing the word of the Lord can be even worse and can take place in the very midst of the greatest material abundance.<br><br>The people of our world have suffered a great deal from each of these two kinds of famine. We remember that in the days of Elijah the Lord shut up the heavens so that no rain fell for three and a half years, and in our own day we begin to worry when the precipitation starts to fall below normal. We are usually not so concerned when our apostasy from God or our lack of study brings upon us a famine for hearing the word of the Lord. And as a foundation for my remarks, I would like to tell you something about two of the great inventions of the world intended to help offset these two serious plagues, each of which has caused so much trouble in our human society.<br><br>If you had lived in the year 1800 and you owned a most magnificent peach orchard, those peaches would be valuable to you only during the harvest season, as they would soon spoil after harvest time had passed. However, at about this time the French government commissioned one of its greatest scientists, a man by the name of Nicolas Appert, to invent some process by which this fruit could be preserved and carried over for use at a later date. In the year 1809, the year that Abraham Lincoln was born, Appert announced to the world his new process of putting food in bottles and cans and heating it and sealing it so that it could be preserved and carried over beyond the growing season. The press announced that Appert had made the seasons stand still, that now one could have peaches not only in September, but on Christmas, or even ten years later. Our ability to preserve perishable food has done a great deal to avert this famine for bread and this thirst for water.<br><br>The other invention that took place was the development of the ability to put ideas down on paper so that they could be carried over from one century to another and from one continent to another. Only then could people utilize great ideas beyond the time of their development. This also meant that, in the night of the darkest apostasy, men and women could read the discourses of former-day prophets and relieve their most urgent needs for hearing the word of the Lord.<br><br>A story illustrating the magic of writing is told in connection with two explorers who were working several hundred miles apart in the then-dark continent of Africa. One of the explorers wanted to send a message to the other; and having a native who knew the way and who agreed to carry whatever he wanted to send, the explorer made some marks on a piece of paper with his pen, folded the paper up, put it in an envelope, and gave it to the native. After some weeks in the jungle the native arrived at the camp of the other explorer and delivered the envelope. The explorer unfolded the message and looked at the marks on the paper; and without one single word having been spoken, the man to whom the message was delivered knew where his explorer friend was and what his problems and needs were. He knew about his health and several other personal things just by looking at the mysterious marks on the paper, which meant nothing at all to the native. This miracle so astounded the native that he fell down on his face and worshiped the writing.<br><br>And, next to obeying God, those of us who are inclined to worship would probably do well to learn to obey the great ideas written down by wise men for our benefit. Each of us should have in his possession a great collection of these miracle-working papers. We may have our religious papers, and the papers containing our occupational know-how; we may have some self-improvement papers, some papers of patriotism, papers of loyalty, papers of inspiration, and some entertainment papers. For our convenience, these papers can be made into books. Thus we may make available to ourselves all the messages that have been thought by the greatest minds in past ages, from every continent, on every conceivable subject having a benefit for us. Then, in case of any mental, spiritual, or emotional, famines we may take down the appropriate papers from their place on the bookshelf and devour the message to our heart's content.<br><br>Occasionally I like to go down into my wife's fruit room and be reassured by inspecting our year's supply. My wife has made ample preparation against the famine of bread by using Mr. Appert's invention. In seasons of plenty, she has provided shelves of bottles containing preserved peaches, cherries, apples, pears, apricots, and all other necessary kinds of fruits and vegetables enough to last us for many months.<br><br>But I get an even greater thrill when I go up into the library and see my bookshelves loaded with their magic papers containing the finest ideas and motivations to sustain my mental, spiritual, social, and emotional health. I have those papers written by the finger of God when he descended onto Mount Sinai in a cloud of fire, accompanied by the thunders and lightnings of that sacred mountain. I have the papers of Jesus giving the account of his three-year ministry among the children of this earth, including that greatest of all discourses, the Sermon on the Mount. I have many wonderful papers from the prophets, poets, playwrights, historians, and captains of industry, all neatly bound into books to minister effectively to my every cultural need. I even have some of the papers of the great musicians containing their most inspiring music, which took them a lifetime to develop. It gives me a great charge of enthusiasm to know that in our family library we not only have a year's supply of great ideas but are also made secure for a lifetime against any encroachment upon our success by famines, spiritual hungers, mental boredom, or any lack of culture or faith or character that may beset us. And while I would like all of you to have that year's supply of food that you put into bottles to protect you against the famine for bread and the thirst for water, I would also like to have you insure yourselves against mental want, emotional poverty, and moral hard times with that lifetime mental and cultural supply that has already been put into books to protect you against that more serious famine for hearing the word of the Lord, of success, of culture and faith and happiness.<br><br>To help motivate you in this direction, I would like to give you a little bit of a sales talk for the preservation and use of great ideas and the great thoughts of great men and women as they have been made available to us in their papers, where they may be continually devoured by us and at the same time remain undiminished on our bookshelves. Someone has said that "books are among life's most precious possessions. They are the most remarkable creation of man. Nothing else that man builds ever lasts. Monuments fall, civilizations perish, but books continue. The perusal of a great book is, as it were, an interview with the noblest men of past ages who have written it."<br><br>Charles Kingsley said,<br><br><i>Except a living man there is nothing more wonderful than a book! A message to us from the dead, from human souls we never saw, who lived perhaps thousands of miles away. And yet these [little sheets of paper speak to us,] arouse us, . . . teach us, . . . open their hearts to us as brothers.</i><br><br>Without books, God is silent, justice dormant, philosophy lame.<br><br>John Milton said,<br><br><i>Books are not . . . dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy . . . of that living intellect that bred them</i>[Areopagitica]<br><br>On many occasions I have heard President David O. McKay refer to Ralph Waldo Emerson as the greatest thinker that America has ever produced. And what a thrilling possibility it is that I can run through my little weak brain every idea, so far as it has been recorded, that was ever run through the brain of the greatest thinker that America has ever produced! I can also run through my mind the greatest moral and cultural stimulants from the prophets, the statesmen, the poets, the playwrights, and the philosophers.<br><br>We can live with Abraham; or we can go up onto the Mount of Transfiguration with Jesus as he was transfigured and appeared in shining garments talking with Moses and Elias before Peter, James, and John. We can have all of these great experiences out of the past and bring them down and put them right on the piston head to produce for us the inspiration of a good life lived at its best.<br><br>William James, the great Harvard psychologist, once asked this question: "How would you like to create your own mind?" And isn't that exactly what each of us does? Professor James said the mind is made up by what it feeds upon. He said the mind, like the dyer's hand, is colored by what it holds. If I hold in my hand a spongeful of purple dye, my hand becomes purple. But if I hold in my mind great ideas of righteousness and faith and devotion to God, my whole personality is colored accordingly.<br><br>The greatest possession I have in the world is made up of twenty-five idea notebooks. They are just regular eight-and-a-half-by-eleven-inch, three-ring looseleaf binders with about three hundred pages in each one. That would be seventy-five hundred pages of the most valuable ideas that exist in the world, so far as I know. Victor Hugo once said that the most powerful thing in the world is an idea whose time has come, and an idea's time comes when we are able to get a harness on it so that we can get it to work for us, doing those things that we most want it to do.<br><br>However, I am not equally interested in all ideas. Some ideas are better workers than others, and even in the Bible itself there are some ideas that do not have great value for me. For example, the other night I reread Moses' instruction to the Israelites on how to cure their leprosy. Well, it just happens that at the moment I am not interested in leprosy. I just do not happen to have any leprosy at the moment. Now if someone had put a paragraph in there about a deteriorating retina, I would eat that up in a hurry; but leprosy I am not interested in.<br><br>I read another idea about Zedekiah, who went out and killed sixty people, and I tried to figure every possible way I could use that skill of his to promote my own personal program, but I did not come up with any answers. So I am not going to spend any more time with that part of Zedekiah's success. But when in my reading I come to some little nugget of an idea that sends a chill up and down my backbone and gives me an ambition to do something important, I take that out and put it in my idea bank, and then when I have time I memorize it.<br><br>I would like to tell you about one of the most profitable experiences that I have ever had in my life. In 1943, I heard Adam S. Bennion give a talk on the value of great literature. He tried to get us to form the habit of appraising and doing something about becoming familiar with great human thought. You can sell the idea of the value of being familiar with great ideas to anybody, but most people lose their share of the benefit by saying, "I don't have time to read." We have time for everything else, but we do not have time to read; and as a consequence, we are pretty well forgetting how to read effectively.<br><br>But Dr. Bennion tried to get around this idea by saying: "Suppose that you didn't have anything to do but read." And inasmuch as we were then nearing the end of the Second World War he said, "Suppose that you were going to be a prisoner in a Japanese concentration camp for the next four years, and suppose that you would be allowed to take into the concentration camp with you the complete works of any ten authors. Which would you take, and what would you expect to get out of them?" It is a well-known fact that people get pretty hungry for great ideas when they get into a concentration camp where they are purposely deprived of good reading material. Then Dr. Bennion told us which authors he would take and why.<br><br>At that time I was teaching a class in salesmanship, and under his stimulation I decided that I would like to reread the Bible with the idea of getting out of it its salesmanship. The Bible is the world's first book of religion, the world's first book of knowledge, the world's first book of poetry, the world's first book of history, and the world's first book of business success and the world's finest sales manual.<br><br>The very best way that has ever been discovered to be a good salesman is to be a good man. The very best way that has ever been discovered to be a good attorney, or a good husband, is just to be a great human being. Just to have these great qualities of character and personality that are talked about in the holy scriptures and that the Lord has always tried to get his children to develop in themselves tends to make us healthy, wealthy, and wise. I therefore decided to reread the Bible with the idea of getting out of it its salesmanship.<br><br>When you read the Bible to get its theology, it is quite a different book than when you read it to get its salesmanship. Whenever you read the Bible with a new purpose, it becomes a new book. I had a thrilling experience reading the Bible for its salesmanship, and I tried to master those fundamental success principles given in the Bible on which all success is predicated. But there are also some successful sales<i>methods</i>given in the Bible. And I would like to tell you about just one of them.<br><br>As Moses was about to start across the desert with this great group of Egyptian slaves, he needed somebody who knew the desert to go with them to be their guide. There was a man by the name of Hobab who lived on the edge of the desert. Moses wanted him to go with them, but Hobab did not want to go. So it was Moses' job to try to persuade him to go and be their guide in the wilderness. He approached him and said: "Come thou with us, and we will do thee good." And Hobab said, "I will not go." We know that that was not a very good approach, because it did not get the job done.<br><br>But Moses needed Hobab, and so he tried again. And this time he did much better. He said, "Leave us not. I pray thee; . . . and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes [in the wilderness]." And that is an entirely different idea. The first time Moses said, "Come with us and we will do thee good." That is, he said, "You come with us and it will be good for you to associate with nice people like us." And while that may be a good idea, it does not usually work very well. We sometimes make that kind of approach in the Church. We say, "You come to church and we will do you good." That is, "It will be good for you to associate with nice people like us." But nobody wants anyone to do him good on the basis. Too many people have had someone<i>do</i>them<i>good</i>under those circumstances.<br><br>Then Moses said to Hobab, "Look Hobab, if you let us get out there in the desert alone, we will probably get lost and all of us will die of starvation. You come and be our eyes in the wilderness. You come and show us the way." We sometimes also make that kind of an approach in the Church. We say "You come and teach this class; we don't have anyone who can do it as well as you can." This is the service approach, and it has a much stronger appeal. And before Moses had finished, Hobab had on his hat and was ready to go (see Numbers 10:29–33).<br><br>I had a thrilling experience learning the salesmanship of the Bible, and I have written quite a little bit on this subject. Then I decided that I would like to take up Shakespeare. Shakespeare comes pretty near the top of most peoples list of great authors, and so I decided to read every word that Shakespeare wrote. That is, I decided to rethink every idea that Shakespeare ever thought, to run through my brain every idea that ever went through his brain. I got started, and I had a pretty hard time--he wrote a long time ago, and a lot of things I did not understand, and I had to look up and go back and reread some things many times, and in the meantime I let my work drag a little bit. I decided a number of times to discard the whole idea, but I had made myself a promise and I do not like to disappoint myself. So I would go back and work at it some more; and finally the clouds began to part and a little bit of the sunshine began to come through, and I had a tremendous experience with Shakespeare as I read his great speeches, felt the power of his motivation, and watched the players upon his stage as they acted and reacted upon each other. Let me give you just one idea from Shakespeare.<br><br>When Henry V was the King of England, France was one of his subject nations, and Henry had a little trouble with some of these Frenchmen. He therefore took an army and sailed across the Channel to put these Frenchmen in their place. But the job was a little bigger than he had expected. An early winter cut off their retreat and they were forced to spend the winter near the little French village of Agincourt. It was a heavy winter; many of them died, and they did not have supplies, and they were in hostile territory. The next spring, when they might have expected to get on their way, they found themselves surrounded by a great army of 60,000 well-fed, well-trained, well-horsed, well-armored Frenchmen, intent on wiping out the British and getting their freedom.<br><br>Now what would you do if you were met with a circumstance like that? What do you do when things get a little tough, the lessons get harder, the finances get low? What do you do? One thing you can do is to quit. You can just give it all up. But that is not what Henry did. He was not that kind of a person. He got his people together to talk it over with them, and we might say that he gave them a pep talk. This is what he said to his soldiers before the battle of Agincourt. (That is, this is Shakespeare edited by Brother Sill. When Shakespeare does not say it as I think he ought to, I just cross off what he said and write it in as I think he should have said it. I do not read Shakespeare to please Shakespeare; I read Shakespeare to please me, and if he does not say it to please me I change it so that it does.)<br><br>This is what he said as the battle was about to begin:<br><br><i>Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;</i><br><i>. . . The blast of war blows in our ears. . . .</i>[act 3, scene 1]<br><i>The French are bravely in their battle set,</i><br><i>And will with all expedience charge upon us. . . .</i><br><i>'Tis a fearful odds . . .</i><br><i>There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh. . . .</i>[act 4, scene 3]<br><i>. . . 'Tis true</i>[there is]<i>great danger;</i><br><i>The greater therefore</i>[must]<i>our courage be.</i>[act 4, scene 1]<br><br>Then he said:<br><br><i>O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;</i><br><i>Possess them not with fear; . . .</i>[act 4, scene 1]<br><i>God b' wi' you, princes all; . . .</i><br>[We may never meet again]<i>till we meet in heaven. . . .</i><br><i>God's arm strike with us! . . .</i><br><i>All things are ready if our minds be so.</i><br><i>Perish the man whose mind is backward now!</i>[act 4, scene 3]<br><br>And then he said,<br><br><i>. . . On, on you noble English, . . .</i><br><i>I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,</i><br><i>Straining upon the start. The game's afoot;</i><br><i>Follow your spirit. . . .</i><br>[I'll to my task.]<br><i>. . . There is throats to be cut and works to be done.</i>[act 3, scene 1]<br><br>Now Henry did not say, "This is going to be an easy job." He said, "Probably none of us will live until sundown; we'll never meet again till we shall meet in heaven." But just notice some of these great lines: "God's arm strike with us!" Or think of this one: "All things are ready if our minds be so." If we just make up our minds, then usually we do not have very much else to worry about. Sometimes we cannot do that. I heard of a psychiatrist who asked a patient, "Do you ever have any trouble making up your mind?" And the patient said, "Well, yes and no." We do not get very far in anything when we are in a "yes and no" state of mind. You students, if you would like to get good grades, just make up your minds about them. Just make a program and decide that you are going to stick to it.<br><br>After his speech, one of Henry's backwardlooking soldiers came up to him and said, "Look, King, we've got a million Englishmen over across the channel that are asleep in bed right now. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had them over here to help us with these sixty thousand Frenchmen?"<br><br>Henry got after him and said, "That would dilute our honor. What honor would there be in a million Englishmen whipping sixty thousand Frenchmen? If twelve thousand weak, sick footsoldiers can whip sixty thousand well-horsed, well-trained, well-armored cavalrymen, that is honor!" He indicated that if a million men should come across the channel to help them, he would send them back. He gave his soldiers the spirit of wanting to win the victory on their own power.<br><br>Then said this negative-thinking soldier, "God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,/Without more help, could fight this royal battle: (act 4, scene 3). That is, he said the two of them alone could whip those sixty thousand Frenchmen. That may not be very good judgement, but that is courage, and that is what most of us need more than about any other thing.<br><br>It just happened that the battle of Agincourt was fought on Saint Crispian's Day. Crispian was a Christian martyr. He was a shoemaker who had given his life for the church a few hundred years before, and they celebrated the feast of Saint Crispian on his birthday. Henry said to his soldiers:<br><br><i>This day is call'd the feast of Crispian:</i><br><i>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,</i><br><i>Will stand a tip-toe when this day is name'd, . . .</i><br><i>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</i><br><i>Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here . . .</i><br>[To fight]<i>with us upon Saint Crispin's</i>[sic]<i>day.</i><br>[act 4, scene 3]<br><br>I imagine that those British soldiers who fought the battle of Agincourt would feel very grateful that they were not among those poor, unfortunate people over in England who were asleep in bed and who were deprived of the privilege of giving their lives for their country in this famous battle. When any soldier or anyone else can learn to think like that, then he will not have very much difficulty in winning the victory.<br><br>Incidentally, the British won the battle of Agincourt. You may have seen in the movies how they drove stakes into the ground to stop the horses, and then the footsoldiers stood behind and from their English longbows shot arrows over among the French and knocked their horses down. They got the heavily-armored Frenchmen down in the mud where they could not get up, and then they went around with their spears and gave them some individual attention while they were lying there on the ground. But anyway, the English won the battle of Agincourt.<br><br>After Shakespeare, I read nine hundred eighty-seven of the great classics that have stood the test of time, and I have all of the potent passages and other great ideas all catalogued in my notebooks, a substantial part of which I have memorized.<br><br>One of my heroes for many years was the famous sports writer of a long time ago named Grantland Rice. For fifty years, Grantland Rice went around the country following the great champions of sport to find out what it was that made men champions in athletics, and then he isolated these traits and wrote seven hundred poems about them so that the virtues of the champions could be made negotiable in the bloodstream of those people who read his column. One of these explanations of virtue he entitled "Courage"; in it he said:<br><br><i>I'd like to think that I can look at death and smile and say,</i><br><i>All I have left now is my final breath; take that away,</i><br><i>And you must either leave me dust, or dreams, or in far flight,</i><br><i>The soul that wanders where the stardust streams through endless night.</i><br><i>But I'd rather think that I can look at life with this to say:</i><br><i>Send what you will of struggle or of strife, blue skies or gray,</i><br><i>I'll stand against the final charge of hate by peak and pit,</i><br><i>And nothing in the steel-clad fist of fate can make me quit.</i><br><br>That is, he was not about to become a drop-out. Grantland Rice was not a quitter. And I can get a harness on his courage and make it do work for me.<br><br>Ernest Henley was a hopeless cripple when he wrote "Invictus" and said:<br><br><i>Out of the night that covers me,</i><br><i>Black as the Pit from pole to pole,</i><br><i>I thank whatever gods may be</i><br><i>For my unconquerable soul.</i><br><br><i>In the fell clutch of circumstance,</i><br><i>I have not winced nor cried aloud:</i><br><i>Under the bludgeonings of chance</i><br><i>My head is bloody, but unbowed.</i><br><br><i>Beyond this veil of wrath and tears</i><br><i>Looms but the Horror of the shade,</i><br><i>And yet the menace of the years</i><br><i>Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</i><br><br><i>It matters not how strait the gate,</i><br><i>How charged with punishment the scroll,</i><br><i>I am the master of my fate:</i><br><i>I am the captain of my soul.</i><br><br>If any of you are interested in going up a few notches on the success scale, get the spirit of the following idea into your muscles and keep it there for a few hours every day. Someone put an ability into verse under the title of "The Champion." He said:<br><br><i>The average runner sprints until the breath in him is gone</i><br><i>But the champion has the iron will that makes him carry on.</i><br><i>For the average runner begs when limp his muscles grow,</i><br><i>But the champion runs on leaden legs; his spirit makes him go.</i><br><i>The average man's complacent when he's done his best to score,</i><br><i>But the champion does his best and then he does a little more.</i><br>[Author unknown]<br><br>If you want to be a champion, all you need to do is follow this poetic recipe.<br><br>I understand that there are quite a number of missionaries in this group tonight. You are going out for two years into the mission field. What are you going to do about it? Suppose you get into your muscles this little verse on "Conquest" so that it can be said of you two years from now when you come home.<br><br><i>Two years ago the stubble leered at him,</i><br><i>And great boulders stood to bar the way.</i><br><i>Old dying trees with twisted trunk and limb</i><br><i>Snarled in defiance like wild beasts at bay.</i><br><br><i>Others from time to time had scanned the space</i><br><i>But had not dared the struggle to begin;</i><br><i>So tangled was the growth that ruled the place</i><br><i>That few who passed it by would venture in.</i><br><br><i>And then he came and vowed to clear the land.</i><br><i>With drag and chain he slowly inched his way.</i><br><i>At night some new attack he sat and planned'</i><br><i>At dawn, undaunted, he resumed the fray.</i><br><br><i>I saw him once in battle, and I thought</i><br><i>His courage and his patience all in vain.</i><br><i>Today I passed the field whereon he fought</i><br><i>And it was flaming gold with ripening grain.</i>[Author unknown]<br><br>Whether the debris we are trying to clear away is rocks and tree trunks or whether it is sins and weaknesses, it does not make very much difference if we just make up our mind; and then, if we do not allow too many exceptions, we have it made.<br><br>Anyway, I got off Shakespeare. After I had finished Shakespeare I read twenty-eight volumes of Elbert Hubbard--and I love Elbert Hubbard. And then I read the Harvard Classics. Many years ago President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard got some of his finest scholars together to compile the greatest ideas that had ever been thought or spoken in the world into one set of volumes called the Harvard Classics; I can go through them now and make myself the beneficiary of many lifetimes of work. I read very slowly and maybe not very comprehendingly, but I always read with my pen. I mark only those ideas that do something important for me. Now if you think the ideas that were lived by the apostle Paul or Emerson or Shakespeare or Jesus of Nazareth, your mind will start responding as their minds did.<br><br>At President Eisenhower's first inaugural he said, "The great driving forces of the world are not intellectual, but emotional." That is, how we<i>feel</i>about things. I walk three and a half miles to work every morning, which gives me about an hour in which I have nothing to do; and if I want to build spirituality or faith, I get those ideas and run them through my brain. Let me just give you one:<br><br><i>O God, I thank thee for each sight</i><br><i>Of beauty that thy world doth give;</i><br><i>For sunny sky and air and light--</i><br><i>O God, I thank thee that I live.</i><br><br><i>That life I consecrate to thee,</i><br><i>And ever as the day is born,</i><br><i>On wings of joy my soul doth flee</i><br><i>To thank thee for another morn;</i><br><br><i>Another morn in which to cast</i><br><i>Some silent deed of love abroad</i><br><i>That, greatening as it journeys past,</i><br><i>May do some earnest work for God.</i><br>[Author unknown]<br><br>I would like to close with another great poem. John Gillespie Magee was an American fighter pilot connected with the Royal Canadian Air Force who was shot down over London in the Battle of Britain in the first part of the Second World War. Before going into the service, John Gillespie Magee had done the usual things that seventeen-year-olds do; and then, after his basic training had been completed, he felt for the first time in his hands the controls of these powerful engines capable of sending his air craft through space at stupendous speeds. Feeling the exhilaration that came from doing well his part of the work of the world, he wrote this great poem entitled "High Flight," which is now found in the Library of Congress under the title of "Poems of Faith and Freedom." I share this with you tonight because you are also engaged in a high flight. You are engaged in the greatest high flight ever known in the world. John Gillespie said:<br><br><i>Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth</i><br><i>And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;</i><br><i>Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth</i><br><i>Of sun-split clouds--and done a hundred things</i><br><i>You have not dreamed of--wheeled and soared and swung</i><br><i>High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,</i><br><i>I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung</i><br><i>My eager craft through footless halls of air.</i><br><br><i>Up, up, the long, delirious, burning blue</i><br><i>I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace,</i><br><i>Where never lark, or even eagle, flew;</i><br><i>And, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod</i><br><i>The high untrespassed sanctity of space,</i><br><i>Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</i><br><br>That is the purpose of our lives, my brothers and sisters. The greatest good fortune in the life of any of you is that every one of us, in this building and out of this building, was created in God's own image; we have been endowed with a set of his attributes and potentialities, and we have inherited his destiny. The Lord himself said, "Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High" (Psalm 82:6).<br><br>May the Lord bless you, my brothers and sisters, that, as you go forward and take up your share of the work the world or the work of the Lord, his spirit may be with you to inspire and direct you in all of the things that you do. This I sincerely pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Sterling W.

<h1>Means to Establish a Relationship with Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Oaks. I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you today, and I, too, enjoyed the music very much. It does set quite a pattern for us today. As I greet you on this occasion, it is with a feeling of great responsibility and awe. Today we have a new baby daughter at our house. That is my wife's other assignment and the reason she could not be here today. That baby daughter, Amy, has caused a great deal of reflection to occur in my life, and I'd like to talk with you about part of that reflection. It relates to establishing a relationship with Christ.<br><br>On that early morning when this infant was born, I had the privilege of being in the delivery room. I waited in anticipation--in anxiety, really as into my mind flooded all the experiences that I thought my wife would be going through: her concern, her anguish, her excitement, and yet her awareness that she would have to wait upon the Lord. It would come in his time. And it did.<br><br>When that beautiful, perfect infant was placed upon its mother's breast, into my heart came a great and wonderful feeling, and yet a feeling of deep concern that I do not know that I have felt before. As I saw that little infant, into my mind came the thought : "Look there. A real person." Sounds strange, doesn't it? Of course an infant is a real person, but I could not just see her as an infant. I saw her as a grown individual, one of distinct personality, one who had great potential and was sent here to the earth to realize that potential; and now a great part of the responsibility to help her reach that potential rested upon me, as she rested upon her mother. I pictured in my mind four other beautiful baby daughters--now growing into lovely womanhood. I could see the lovely lady Amy can become, and I contemplated the great potential that promises blessings even beyond her experiences and growth here on the earth.<br><br>What is this potential that Amy has? What is there ahead for her, and what is my responsibility to her? Well, I thought, she is a daughter of our Heavenly Father, one who, having just come from his presence, may return again to our Heavenly Father and there reside in joy and happiness eternally. She is one who can qualify and prepare herself for her own eternal family of which she will always be a part, and need never be alone; she can be one who is a worthy companion to an eternal mate who holds the priesthood and who therefore can care for her spiritual needs as well as provide for the physical needs that she has. She has within her the power to become whatever she desires to become. Yes, this is her potential. The responsibility, then, that rests upon me is the responsibility to teach her and to help her know what powerful potential she has. I must help her to remain beautifully pure, and to become the best Amy that she can become on this earth and throughout all eternity.<br><br>As I gave solemn thought to that, I realized that I must do all I can to help her develop a close relationship with Christ very early in her life--actually, to help her retain that relationship, for I felt her closeness to him as she entered this life. Now that thought is on my mind as I meet with you and as I feel a responsibility to you. Each of us has that same responsibility and capability to develop a personal, warm, and loving understanding with the Savior--our Savior, the One who came here to the earth that you and I might have the privilege of realizing our greatest potential. With that in mind, I should like to talk with you about what it means to have a personal relationship with Christ. To illustrate this, let me give you some examples.<br><br>In my office I have some great experiences. I have people come by who are there to change their lives. As I discuss this matter with them, almost always I can ask them the question, "Well, what makes it different now? Why do you want to change now?" And almost always they will say something like, "I believe I now have somewhat of a vision of what I can be, of who I really am." Then it begins.<br><br>Such was the case with a young man just two weeks ago. He came in; he was tall, he was dark, he was a nice-looking man, and as I looked at him I thought, "Here's someone who could be without troubles." He looked happy, he appeared strong and well kept, and he looked like he had the confidence of a man who knew where he was going. I asked him, "Will you please tell me about your life?" He did. He told me that he was a convert to the Church of just six years. He was twenty-three years of age. His introduction to the Church had come about after a life of some trouble and turmoil, but he met a special young lady--you know how that is; it changes your whole life, doesn't it? Well, that is what happened to him. He met a young lady who had some standards that he had not been keeping himself but which he admired. The more he came to know her, the more he realized that the reason he so admired her was that she held to these standards of morality, of good conscience, of industry and concern. And the more he realized why he admired her, the more he wanted to find out about her source of strength. She told him that her source of strength was the gospel of Jesus Christ as taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He began to listen, and he began to change his life. He joined the Church.<br><br>After he had joined the Church, she left the town in which they lived and came to Brigham Young University. He decided that if she were going to come here he ought to, too, and so he followed. When he arrived here, he said he thought, "Oh, boy! Look at the field!" He could hardly believe what he saw. "I could see that I could date any one of thousands of young ladies and be perfectly safe."<br><br>"Now, what do you mean, safe?" I asked.<br><br>"Well," he said, "the young ladies I had been dating before were not safe for me to be with. Their standards were not what they should be and did not help me. Oh, how delighted I was to enter BYU!"<br><br>Well, for the first half of the semester his hopes and dreams were realized, and then he met a young lady on this campus who was seemingly a strong member of the Church. On the first date, though, he discovered that she was much like girls he had known before, and he found himself slipping, sliding, falling, until he had reverted to an earlier immoral behavior. He said, "Brother Pinegar, I couldn't believe it; I couldn't understand it. I thought everyone at BYU held to the standards of the gospel--why didn't she? I felt I would be protected from my former self. Doesn't everyone at BYU have the relationship with Christ that this first girl I knew had?"<br><br>"You'll have to answer that," I replied.<br><br>"Well," he said, "I discovered that I could find on the campus what evil I was looking for, and so I left the campus to protect myself. I returned home. It took me two years before I felt strong enough to come back to Brigham Young University."<br><br>I commented, "That's really an indictment against a great and marvelous student body."<br><br>"Oh, don't get me wrong. I understand that they're not all the way this girl was, but," he said, "I had expected more." Then he said something that I felt was very profound. "I expected my strength to come from others. I began to realize that if anyone was going to help me it would have to be myself. If I expected anyone to have a relationship with Christ that protected me from the sins of the world, it would have to be me. I discovered there were those on the BYU campus who could help me become strong and help me develop a personal relationship with Christ, such a relationship as would bring me strength of testimony, power of decision, and firmness of commitment." He developed such a relationship here at BYU, and that was why he was in my office. He said, "I feel now that I am prepared; I am ready to go on a mission, if the Lord will have me." Well, after our discussion and prayerful consideration, it was my feeling, even my knowledge, that the Lord would have him; and today he is awaiting his call.<br><br>I would call your attention to a scripture--1 John 3. If you have your scriptures with you, I would like you to turn to that and read it with me, if you will. Here John describes for us who we really are, and what in very deed our relationship with the Christ and with our Heavenly Father is. When I read the scriptures, I like to read them for myself, because I believe that they were written for me, and so as I read them I put my name in them--as the one to be instructed, not the one giving the instruction. Join with me as we read from 1 John 3:1–3 this is John speaking to Rex.<br><br><i>Behold,</i>[Rex,]<i>what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore</i>[, Rex,]<i>the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</i><br><br><i>Beloved</i>[Rex]<i>, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be</i>[, Rex]<i>: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</i><br><br><i>And</i>[Rex,]<i>every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he</i>[or Christ]<i>is pure.</i><br><br>What a marvelous description of our relationship with Christ! To think that we shall see him as he really is--the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world--and then we shall see ourselves purified even as he is pure. We shall see ourselves as being related to him as his brothers, as his sisters, as his family. Will it not be wonderful, then, to realize our relationship with our Heavenly Father, to recognize our relationship to him as his children? Knowing this, we can develop a better relationship with him now.<br><br>I believe prayer to be of key importance. Knowing that we really are his offspring should affect how we pray, should help us to understand that when we speak with our Heavenly Father in prayer he really is our Father. I can tell you from my personal experience that realizing our true relationship to our Heavenly Father has changed my life significantly. I have come to realize that I can actually have a conversation with my Heavenly Father. As I kneel in prayer, in private, there are two of us there. I am not alone but am there with someone who really cares, with someone who knows my innermost feelings and thoughts. Not only does he know, and not only does he care, but he can do something about it. He is the one whose power is so great that he can arrange for me to receive instruction that will lead me into paths that will lead me away from evil and toward happiness right now. I do not know of anything that brings more happiness than to realize that what we have done or are doing is correct and right. Such is the desire of our Heavenly Father, to provide us with that kind of instruction, and so he has provided for us a messenger, a messenger from his own home, even the Holy Ghost; and that messenger can speak to our souls, to our minds, and enlighten us with truth so that we may be able to make judgments which are correct in every situation.<br><br>As I say that, I realize that you're often in situations where you would like to know the truth and you'd like to know the answers to questions. Some of the questions are difficult to answer. Most of those questions relate to, "What's going to happen to me? What will I become? When will I find an eternal companion? And what will he be like? What will she be like?" Those questions really can be turned inward: "Can I qualify to be an eternal companion? What am I going to do about myself?" Then make the decision to do it, the decision to change from what you are to what you really ought to be. Prayer provides the key to such important decisions. Through prayer and your personal relationship with Christ, you will be enabled to make decisions that are correct, decisions in which you can have confidence, decisions which will bring you to a realization of your greatest potential.<br><br>I would like to share another story. This is about a young man whose name was Jack. He had a desire and was worthy to serve a mission, which he did properly and well. All the time he was gone he wrote to a beautiful young lady. She waited for him, and when he returned he found her even more beautiful than when he left her. Because of her good looks and talent, she had a successful job with a performing group which rehearsed on Sundays. It was a job that also required that she wear a rather revealing costume. He was disappointed and concerned. He expressed his feelings to her, expecting that she would quit this job and seek for one that would not compromise the gospel standards. She felt he was asking too much. After all, she was mature and she could make up her own mind, make her own decisions. She wanted him to understand that what she was doing was important to her. He said, "Well, that's true; but if you decide to remain where you are, you've made a decision that we're through."<br><br>She did not believe him. He did not believe she would stay. She continued, and he meant it, and soon they parted. He began searching for someone else.<br><br>He found someone here at BYU and they began dating. He enjoyed her company and she lived the standards he believed in. Yet somehow he could not get the feeling that she was the one for him, that she should be his eternal companion. But this young man had developed a special relationship with the Lord. He went to him in prayer. He talked it over with the Lord and said, "I've decided not to date this girl any longer. Help me to know if this decision is right." He said he felt the answer to his prayer was that his decision was wrong. Well, he thought, I didn't think she was the one, but the Lord must feel differently.<br><br>Several nights later, however, Jack found out how the Lord had been working with him. As they returned from a date, the girl discovered that she had left her key inside and could not open her apartment door. She sent him to the apartment next door for help. He knocked and a young lady came to the door. Her hair was in curlers, her face scrubbed clean. He asked her if he could borrow her activity card. She thought that was an unusual request until he explained he needed it to unlock a door. (Still a rather unusual reason!) As he walked back to where his date waited, he studied the activity card. (Maybe he was curious to know how she looked when her hair was not in curlers.) Something he saw prompted him to say--after unlocking his date's door and saying goodnight--"That's alright; I'll return the activity card to Melanie." He thought it was the only polite thing to do. Soon he was introducing himself to Melanie and asking her where she worked. The next day and for the next several days he appeared at her place of work. He seemed to have a lot of business of that kind to accomplish! Finally, in order to keep him from coming to her work, she agreed to go with him on a date. And so they began dating, and he discovered that he had found the one. He had found the one who had the same commitment to the gospel, the same relationship with Christ that he himself had decided to have. He learned that she had been waiting for the right one also. Because they had made the right decision and because of their relationship with Christ, they found each other. Today those two are happily married.<br><br>An example of how the Lord brings happiness into people's lives is shown in an experience which he had at the well. You'll recall that there was a woman at the well drawing water. He wanted a drink and asked for one, and she wanted to know what he had to do with a woman of Samaria, he being a Jew. But he discussed a few things with her, and through that discussion she discovered that he really knew who she was, and she wanted him to tell her the truths he offered about this well of living water that could grow up within her.<br><br>He said, "Well, I'll tell you, but first go get your husband." He knew that you don't teach a woman without teaching her husband the truths of the gospel.<br><br>She answered, "But I have no husband," and he responded, "Yes, I see that. You've had five husbands, and the man you're living with now is not your husband."<br><br>She recognized right away that this was a man different from anyone she had ever met before, and exclaimed, "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet." And she was correct; he was the Christ. So impressed was she with the respect that he gave her that she went into the village and gathered thousands of people to come out to listen to the Savior, this Christ, this man who had told her all she had ever done. They came and he taught, and a renewal of the commitment came into her life--a testimony was born. (see John 4:7–30, 39–42).<br><br>The Savior had a way of meeting with the people and improving their lives. He honored them by his mere presence and by his attention to them. I suppose that one of the reasons he was so effective was that he was a good listener. He is still a good listener and will hear the pleadings of our soul if we desire to develop our relationship with him.<br><br>A young man went to his mission president not too long ago and confessed to him some things which he had done prior to going on a mission. He was repentant. He desired to change his life. He asked the mission president to forgive him for lying to him in an interview. He said, "Do you think I can ever make this thing straight?"<br><br>The mission president put his arm around the young man and told him, "We'll try. Let's work at it."<br><br>And so they did. They contacted the proper priesthood authorities and asked them for their forgiveness and contacted the other people who were involved and received from them a forgiveness. Then it was up to the Lord. The young man went before the Lord, and the answer he received was, "Work. Thrust in your sickle with all your soul. Prove thyself." The young man was so elated that he would be able to remain in the mission field and that he had this opportunity to repent that he labored with all his might.<br><br>What a great contribution that young man has made on his mission and continues to make with his life! Why? Because someone listened. The Lord listened to the pleadings of his soul. Forgiveness is part of the character of Christ and as we repent it becomes an important part of our relationship with him.<br><br>In the 64th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, beginning with verse eight, the Lord teaches us the importance of forgiveness in our lives. He tells us how important it is for our own welfare that we forgive others. In describing this characteristic of forgiveness, the Savior spoke of those disciples who had been with him while he dwelt in the flesh and this is what he said:<br><br><i>My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil</i>[, Rex,]<i>they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore,</i>[Rex,]<i>I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</i><br><br><i>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive,</i>[Rex,]<i>but of you it is required to forgive all men.</i><br><br><i>And ye ought to say in your hearts,</i>[Rex,]<i>--let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:8–11]<br><br>The Savior, in teaching us this principle of forgiveness, has taught the very purpose of his mission on the earth. He came that you and I might be forgiven through repentance and through diligent and faithful efforts. He came because he forgave. Even on the cross he said, "Father forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). I believe that most of us, if not all, could honestly say that about others who offend us--"they know not what they do." Then let us forgive them and forgive all others who might offend us, and then we shall develop an even closer relationship with Christ; and in that relationship we shall repent and qualify for the forgiveness of our Heavenly Father and draw nearer to him. Such a relationship will enable us to experience the joy of seeing Christ as he really is and ourselves as we truly are--joint heirs to our Father's Kingdom--and that relationship can be an eternal, joy-filled association with Christ and our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Let us review some important principles for Amy, and for each of us to follow if we are to develop this relationship with Christ which will enable us to realize our greatest potential:<br><br>First, we must recognize that our Heavenly Father is the literal father of our spirits, making us his children. This principle enables us to grasp the vision of our potential.<br><br>Second, through the principle of prayer we develop a relationship with Christ who serves as our mediator with the Father. Effective use of prayer leads us to correct decisions on our journey toward our potential.<br><br>Third, living the twin principles of repentance and forgiveness enables us to retain the Spirit and the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Thus we are led in truth toward our greatest potential.<br><br>Fourth, the companion principles of hearing, listening, and doing are essential elements of our lives. Just as Christ listens to our Heavenly Father and then obediently does the will of our Father, so we learn to listen and obey. We demonstrate these Christlike attributes by our service to others. Such service places us in the service of our God and therefore takes us toward our greatest potential.<br><br>Our greatest potential is to become like Christ--worthy, exalted, loving, faithful children of our Father in Heaven. May each of us develop a relationship with our Savior which will enable us to realize that potential. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Rex D.

<h1>e Brings Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters; it is a great honor and privilege to greet you here this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are met in his name, it is because of him that we are here, and I presume that everything in this life that is really worthwhile comes through the Lord. He has a special program for you and me. It is vitally important that we understand the Lord's program, for it is calculated to make us happy, which is, of course, the object and design of our existence. "Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). That is a collective term--it means woman, too.<br><br>We are here upon the earth, you and I, to be happy; but if we are not careful we look for happiness in the wrong places. There are those who think that it has to do with accumulation of material wealth, power, or position--and yet these do not make people happy. Happiness has to do with living in obedience to the Lord's commandments and being thankful for what one has. It does not make any difference how much one has, for he will not be happy unless he is thankful for it. It is, like wealth, very relative. One man who has hardly anything considers himself wealthy, while another man with many material possessions is not happy because he does not think he has anything. It is all in the mind<br><br>The Lord Jesus Christ has taken upon himself the responsibility to save everyone who will ever be born on this earth. That is a great task, and he has done everything godly possible to bring that to pass, even to taking upon himself the sins of everyone who has ever been born or will be born. And he has broken the bands of death, which means that everyone is going to be resurrected. It will not make any difference whether they want to be or not; they are going to be resurrected anyway. There are going to be a lot of these people resurrected that will not want to be but they are going to get it. So you are going to get it whether you want it or not. You do not have to be good; it is a free gift from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>In this particular day and time he has given us a program by which we can prepare ourselves for that which is to come, and there are great and momentous occasions ahead of us. In the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord outlined, "Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 1:17)--because of the calamities that were coming. Prophets in all ages have known that there were going to be calamities coming in this particular day and time. We need to be aware of the fact that we are living in a time of calamity, and we have to be ready for it. There is a great and dreadful day of the Lord ahead. It always seemed to be a little incongruous to call it "great" and "dreadful" at the same time, but as we think about it, it is very simple: It will be great if we are ready and dreadful if we are not.<br><br>Paul, in a letter to his friend Timothy (in verses 1 to 7 and 10 to 12 of 2 Timothy, third chapter), wrote telling him that there were going to be perilous times ahead. He said, "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves"-- I am not exactly sure what he means by that. President Kimball came here to the BYU assembly and told the student body the same thing he has been telling everybody all over the world; the prophet tells everybody the same thing. In the first speech he gave to a general conference of the Church after he became president of the Church, he made this statement: "We say again, we members of the Church marry. All normal people should marry" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1974, p. 8). He's saying this because there are a lot of people today who are going along with the program that comes from the other side, which says, "It's not necessary to get married; you can live together without having to be married. In fact, trial marriages are recommended." Not so with the Lord.<br><br>President Kimball's remarks generated a number of letters from the student body here at BYU, saying, in essence, "President, are you saying that because we're not married we're not normal?" And as he rehearsed this to us he said, "I had to write them back and say, 'Yes, that's what I'm saying.'" He expects all young people to marry.<br><br>A letter came to the office shortly thereafter from a little girl here at BYU. She said, "I know I'm supposed to be married and I'm willing, but there are a lot of these returned missionaries here at BYU who don't seem to be as willing. As a matter of fact, they draw near unto me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me." I think that that is what Paul was talking about. He said, "Men shall be lovers of their own selves." They do not want to take upon themselves the responsibility of a family, which, of course, is the first commandment given on this earth to our first parents. They were told to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. Why? So that they would be happy, "that they might have joy and rejoicing in their posterity." Everything the Lord has done is calculated to make his children happy. President Kimball says also that you should not get out of your twenties before you are married, and that gives you a goal.<br><br>Paul continues, "Men shall be . . . covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection. . . ." I saw in the paper not long ago that two men got married. That's right--they performed a ceremony to marry two men. That is not natural--that is not natural affection. And they wanted to adopt a child. Thank heaven they had enough sense not to let them do that. Paul said there will be<br><br><i>trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away.</i>[2 Timothy 3:2–5]<br><br>It does make a difference whom you associate with. I have interviewed many young men who have had problems--they had violated the laws of chastity and been involved in the drug scene, yet they came from good families. I ask them, "Just how did you get so involved?" Many times their answer is: "Well, Elder Rector, I started running around with the wrong crowd, and I found myself doing the things that they were doing." It is important that you "run around" or associate with good people. And as for those who are running around with the wrong crowd, those who know the Lord and delight in keeping his commandments should go and bring them back. You can do that; and that is part of the responsibility of membership in this Church.<br><br>"Of this sort," Paul continued, "are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts." I am not exactly sure what he is talking about there, but I do know that here in the Salt Lake Valley there are over six thousand people trying to practice polygamy. There are many lovely sisters who would like to get married and have a family, who want to, but who have never had the opportunity; and so to one of these sisters will come a character who says he knows more about the revelations of the Lord than the prophet does. The Lord has "revealed" to him that he is supposed to have this one and this one and this one and this one as his wives. Now, sisters, if you get involved in this, the very least we are going to call you is silly. Paul continues: "Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth." Now I am skipping a bit to where he said to Timothy,<br><br><i>But thou has fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</i><br><br><i>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions.</i>[2 Timothy 3:7, 10–12]<br><br>You may expect it. If you live the gospel today you must expect to be persecuted. Yes, it will come in many different forms because there is much false information abroad in the land today as to what we are supposed to do and what our responsibilities are. If you insist on having a family, which is your basic responsibility here upon the earth, people are going to say that you are selfish. I cut a piece out of the paper recently, dateline Singapore. It says:<br><br><i>Parents who insist on having more than two children will lose tax benefits, face discrimination in public housing, and pay more maternity costs, the government announced. Earlier the Health Ministry said that some discriminatory measures would be taken against new additions to large families in nine and a half months.</i>[They figured that would be fair warning, I guess.]<i>For the Singapore of the 1970s, the third child is luxury, the fourth and fifth are antisocial acts. The new measures include vigorous family planning campaigns coupled with sterilization and abortion programs. The government hopes to reduce the natural increase in the birth rate to less than one percent by 1980.</i>["Family Size Labels a Guy,"<i>Deseret News,</i>October 25, 1972]<br><br>That is a plot against the Lord's children. Part of the plan of salvation said that we would come to this earth and take a body of flesh and bone, that we would have earthly parents who would provide that opportunity for us. And we agreed to do it too. We must have agreed to do it or we would not be here. And we agreed to provide opportunities for others to come to this earth; that is the only way the Lord can send his children. This business of birth control, which is so rampant throughout the land today, is contrary to the will of the Lord. That is not his program. To give you a couple of paragraphs from a statement from the president of the Church, dated April 14, 1969:<br><br><i>Where husband and wife enjoy health and vigor and are free from impurities that would be entailed upon their posterity</i>[I assume that would be physical or mental defects]<i>it is contrary to the teachings of the Church artificially to curtail or prevent the birth of children. We believe that those who practice birth control will reap disappointment by and by. However, we feel that men must be considerate of their wives, who bear the greater responsibility not only of bearing children, but also of caring for them through childhood.</i><br><br>That makes it very plain that there is a division of responsibility in raising a family. The brethren are to provide for the family members. They have to feed them, clothe them, shelter them, educate them, send them on missions--that is very expensive; it costs a lot of money. So young men need a good education to do that, and need to be willing to hold a good job and work hard and bring home everything they make and give it to their wife. That is called sacrifice. Of course, sacrifice does not go one way; she will make a burnt offering over the stove from time to time. She also has to cook the food and wash the dishes--over and over again--and bear the children and care for them through childhood. Sisters, this does not mean that you cannot have some help from your husband. Get all that you can--insist on it--but do not expect too much because you will probably not get it. You see, he has a different responsibility.<br><br>"To this end," the statement continues, "the mother's health and strength should be conserved, and the husband's consideration for his wife is his first duty and self-control a dominant factor in all their relationship" (Statement from the First Presidency, April 14, 1969). I think that is very plain. It says you ought to have your family when you can; and you will find that you cannot make a decision as to when to have children anyway. Any couple that has ever had children knows that they did not make that decision. The Lord decides when you are going to have children. You can only decide that you are not going to have them, and you cannot afford that. So have your family when you can, but not so fast that you destroy the health of the mother. The mother's health is the only real criterion of judgement. It is not a convenience consideration; it is not an education; it is not an economic consideration. The health of the mother is the<i>only</i>consideration.<br><br>It is vitally important that you raise a family unto the lord. Do not be taken in by all this misinformation about birth control--and make no mistake about it, it is affecting the Church. There was a birth rate study done not long ago that covered the twenty-year period from 1950 to 1970; as I recall, two young men here at BYU did it. They found that in 1950 the average number of births per thousand in the Church was thirty-eight and in the United States as a whole was twenty-six. In 1970, twenty years later, the average births per thousand for the Church was twenty-six, while the average for the United States was eighteen. In other words, births have dropped by almost the same percentage in the Church as in the country. They also figured out that out of every one hundred births there are fifty-two boys and forty-eight girls. (Yes, sisters, there are more boys than girls, contrary to what you may think.) What we have lost through the reduction in birth rate in the Church would amount to twenty-two thousand missionaries today. That would be enough missionaries to take care of the needs of India if we could freely enter. It makes a difference.<br><br>About this business of abortion: I presume that there will be a million of them in the United States this year; there were a million last year. It is destruction of the Lord's children at a horrendous rate. I cut an article out of the<i>Washington Post</i>recently; it says:<br><br><i>For the first time the number of legal abortions obtained by Washington residents exceeded the number of live births, according to the figure for last year compiled by the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources. The department said that eighty-five percent of the abortions were paid for by the government, either at private hospitals and clinics through the Medicaid program or the country's free public hospital, D.C. General. Officials of Planned Parenthood said Washington was the first major American city to report that abortions outnumbered births,</i>["Capital Reports More Abortions than Births,"<i>Los Angeles Times,</i>November 17, 1976]<br><br>which they applauded. That is wrong. That is so wrong. If you would like to know how the Lord feels about abortion, here is a statement from President Lee. President Lee had a way of saying things so plainly that you could not misunderstand them. He said here:<br><br><i>May I say here that we in the Church are unalterably opposed to abortion. The only exception would be in cases where doctors found it necessary to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother</i>[mother's health again].<i>We reaffirm that the first purpose of marriage is to bring children into the world. They ought to be welcome.</i>[Harold B. Lee, Strengthening the Home (motion picture), 1973]<br><br>President Kimball has added that abortion could be considered if conception took place because of criminal rape and there is a traumatic effect on the mother. He said that, even then, you would only want to consider it after you have had counsel with the competent medical authority, had interviews and consultation with your priesthood leaders, and made it a matter of fasting and prayer and had a confirmation of the Spirit. No, abortion is not the Lord's program. His program is to provide opportunities for his children to come to this earth. We need to help him in this.<br><br>"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus," said Paul, "shall suffer persecution." No doubt about that. It is important that you take a stand on these questions in this day and time, because it is up to you. You are the Lord's people--if you do not, who will? The Master, when some were offended in him and left him, asked the apostles, "Will ye also go away?" and Peter replied, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life" (John 6:67–69). The words of eternal life and salvation are in the Church and kingdom of God and we must follow the living prophet of God. Yes, you are going to be persecuted if you do, but do not worry about it. Paul continues,<br><br><i>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</i><br><br><i>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</i><br><br><i>And that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</i>[He makes it plain that we ought to stick with the scriptures, and then this is what Paul says about the scriptures:]<br><br><i>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</i><br><br><i>That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</i>[2 Timothy 3:13–17]<br><br>We need to look to the scriptures. The scriptures have the answer; they come from the Lord.<br><br>Not all scripture is contained in what we call the standard works of the Church, but everything that we talk about ought to be found in the scriptures. A quote from President Lee:<br><br><i>All that we teach in this Church ought to be couched in the scriptures. It ought to be found in the scriptures. We ought to choose our texts from the scriptures. If we want to measure truth, we should measure it by the four standard works, regardless of who writes it. If it is not in the standard works, we may well assume that it is speculation, man's own personal opinion; and if it contradicts what is in the scriptures, it is not true. This is the standard by which we measure all truth,</i>[<i>Improvement Era,</i>January 1969, p. 13]<br><br>the standard works of the Church. He also said:<br><br><i>Through these generations</i>[meaning the generations from the beginning of man down to this time]<i>the messages from our Father have been safeguarded and carefully protected and mark you likewise that in this day the scriptures are the purest at their source, just as the waters</i>[are]<i>purest at the mountain source; the purest word of God, and that least apt to be polluted, is that which comes from the lips of the living prophets who are set up to guide Israel in our own day and time.</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Ye Are the Light of the World,</i>pp. 55–56]<br><br>So we look to the standard works of the Church and we look to this type of publication,<i>The Ensign--</i>and it is<i>ensž¯gn.</i>I had a letter the other day from a sister who said, "Elder Rector, I wish you'd learn how to say<i>ensž¯gn</i>. It's not ensun<i>.</i>It's not like a naval officer." And I have to admit that I have made that mistake a few times, but she has corrected me now. (It was interesting, though--the letter was addressed to Hartford Rector, H–a–r–t–f–o–r–d.)<br><br>This<i>Ensign</i>of November 1974 contains the first talk that the prophet gave in general conference after he became President of the Church. There are twenty-two commandments in here--twenty-two. That is a few more than the Lord gave to Moses on Mount Sinai, but we have things to put up with today that Moses did not have to put up with in his day. After all, we have television today, and X-rated and R-rated movies, and numerous other Satan-inspired things. President Kimball is so specific in enunciating the Lord's program today that it is very difficult to misunderstand. The first thing he said he wanted us to do was to clean up around our own homes. "Broken fences should be mended, or removed. Unused barns should be roofed and repaired and painted, or removed. Sheds and corrals should be repaired and painted, or removed. Weedy ditchbanks should probably be cleared. Abandoned homes should be razed. We are looking forward to the day when in all of our communities, both urban and rural, there will be a universal contingent movement to clean and repair and paint barns and sheds, build side walls, clean ditchbanks, and make our properties a thing of beauty to behold." He says clean it up--that includes your garage too. It also includes your room here at BYU. That includes the missionaries' quarters too. (I don't see them here today--they're not here, are they?)<br><br>He is very specific. He said,<br><br><i>We call attention . . . to the habit in which many buy their commodities on the Sabbath.</i>[That is counter to a commandment of the Lord: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Genesis 20:8).]<i>Many employed people would be released for rest and worship on the Sabbath if we did not shop on that day. Numerous excuses and rationalizations are presented to justify the Sunday buying. We call upon all of you to keep the Sabbath holy and make no Sunday purchases.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>November 1974, p. 6]<br><br>Now, that is rather specific. And he said, "We hope that faithful Latter-day Saints will not use playing cards which are used for gambling. . . ." That means spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. (I have a friend who said: "You know, you can play bridge with a set of Rook cards if you know what you're doing." I guess the prophet can't cover everything, right?) ". . . Either with or without the gambling," he added. "As for gambling in connection with horse racing or games or sports, we firmly discourage such things." What the Lord has given us through a living prophet is very specific, and it is for our benefit; so we ought to follow the scriptures.<br><br>The program the Lord has outlined for us to follow today first deals with literacy and education. It is important that you put it up here in the head. Studying the scriptures is the most important thing you can do. It means you should all have a set of the scriptures. You can pay almost anything you want for a set of scriptures. I was looking today at a quadruple combination, large print edition, bound in leather and indexed; it sells for about seventy-five dollars. But the seminary department sent me a copy of the triple combination they are going to use for next year; it is going to sell for two dollars and a half, and it is adequate. Couple with that a Bible priced at about two dollars and fifty cents, and one can get a set of the scriptures for five dollars. Everybody should have his own set of scriptures and ought to be using them on a regular basis, fifteen minutes a day at least. If we read the scriptures fifteen minutes a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, we can read all the standard works of the Church in one year. But it is not enough just to read the scriptures; we ought to put into practice what we find in the scriptures. It is the Lord's handbook for our day and time, and for every day and time.<br><br>There are other books to read. I read a book recently called<i>Life after Life</i>. I would recommend it to you. It contains a hundred and fifty case histories of people who have had a near-death experience--so near death, in fact, that they all left their body, but they all came back again. They all reported essentially the same thing. Among other things they said they were met by a being of light. The atheists call it a being of light, but among the Christians some called it God, some said it was Christ, and some said it was an angel. But all agreed it was a being of light. He came to them and in his presence they felt complete peace and contentment. He asked them questions, such as, "What have you done with your life that would make it important to other people?" That question called an immediate panoramic replay of everything they had done in their life. They saw themselves and their whole life pass in review; and, of course, they saw themselves doing some very selfish things. He was watching it with them and it seemed he commented on it; in fact, he made excuses for some of the things they did. He said, "Now, when you did this you hadn't learned; you were still learning." Does that sound like you may have an advocate with the Father? You know, we may need an advocate with the Father one day. Some said that he laughed about some of the things that he saw there, that he had a sense of humor. That is nice to know too, isn't it?<br><br>After they had had this panoramic replay of their life, they moved on to an area where there was a barrier erected. Some said it was a curtain, some a screen, some a line; but all agreed it was a line of demarcation. They were given to understand that if they crossed that line they could never return to their mortal body again. None of them crossed it. They all came back to their body, every one of them. No one really wanted to return, but they came back. Each of them came back for some completely unselfish reason. One woman came back because she had five small children and wanted to take care of them. Another had aged parents she wanted to take care of. One woman came back to do her genealogy--no doubt a Latter-day Saint. (It may take that kind of an experience to get genealogy done, too.)<br><br>When they came back, once again they had basically the same experience. Number one, no on had any fear of death anymore; in fact, they were looking forward to it. Well, I will take that back. Five of the people had tried to commit suicide, and they had a completely different experience. One man's wife had died; he was distraught with grief and wanted to join her. So he tried to take his own life. He said he knew immediately that he had done a horrible thing. As a matter of fact, he was given to understand that he had done the second worst thing he could do on this earth by taking his own life. The worst thing he could do would be to take someone else's life. He said, "I didn't go where she was. I went to an awful place" (Raymond A. Moody,<i>Life after Life,</i>afterword). There was nothing but moaning and groaning and weeping and wailing there, and he was delighted to get out of it. The rest of them, however, when they returned, had no fear of death; they knew that they were going to die and they were looking forward to it but not rushing it. The attempted suicides were even more glad to get back into their bodies.<br><br>Number two, there were no atheists anymore. Some were before their experience, but not when it had finished. Number three, they all got involved in some sort of philanthropic-type activity trying to help other people And four, none of them could tell his experiences because people thought him crazy.<br><br>I do not see that these experiences are in disagreement with what Alma said:<br><br><i>Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection--Behold, it has been made known unto me by and angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</i>[Alma 40:11]<br><br>I have heard speculated about Alma's statement: "God rules in the spirit world, and if you go back in the spirit world you'll be in the presence of God." Not so; that is not what Alma says, and that is not what these hundred and fifty people said either. However, they did not cross that line, the point of no return. If they had crossed that line, I am sure they would have found that verses twelve through fourteen would be true too.<br><br><i>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace; where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.</i>[You are going to rest if you are righteous. It does not mean that you have nothing to do; it just means that you will not get tired. That is rest of a sort. We call Sunday a day of rest, don't we? Do you have anything to do on Sunday?]<br><br><i>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil--for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house--and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.</i><br><br><i>Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them</i>[that does not sound very good, but it is a good description of what the attempted suicides reported];<i>thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.</i><br><br>I think there are a lot of truths that we could get out of good books; but check it against the scriptures and make sure it does not contradict what you find there. It is important that you improve your mind.<br><br>The second area in which the Lord would like to have you prepared we call career development. That means you ought to have a skill. You ought to have an education, but you ought to learn how to do something with that education. I do not think it makes much difference what you do. A lot of young people have asked me, "What shall I do with my life?" They are going to school here, but they do not know what they want to do. I do not think it makes any difference what you do, as long as you do something that you like. If you do something you like, you will do it better. The better you do it, the more compensation you will receive for it. It is important that you do something that allows you to earn a good living, because you have to provide for a family; and that is what education is all about, in my opinion.<br><br>As I travel around the Church, I frequently look at tithing records. I was in a stake not long ago where the stake president was a Ph.D., a college professor; a smart man, excellent man as a matter of fact. His first counselor was a plumber. Would you believe that the plumber paid twice the tithing that the stake president paid? I heard a story recently that illustrates this circumstance. A dentist had a leak in his pipes, so he called the plumber. The plumber fixed the leak and gave him a bill, and when the dentist saw the bill he just about dropped his uppers. "Well, I've never seen such fees!" he said. "I don't even charge my patients fees like this."<br><br>And the plumber said, "When I was a dentist, I didn't either."<br><br>It is important that you learn a trade and get yourself qualified to do something and do it well. And you ought to go where your trade can be performed. I visited with a stake president down in Miami, Florida, some years ago. In the conversation, I asked him how he happened to be in Miami, because he was from Idaho. He said he had come down with the space agency, and when he got down there the space agency finished their business and he lost his job. They offered him a job up in Portland, Oregon, as I recall, at the same salary he was receiving down in Florida, but he said, "I didn't go, even though I suffered a severe reduction in salary, because I knew the Lord wanted me here. I was the stake president."<br><br>And I said, "I think you may have made a serious mistake. How do you know the Lord wasn't trying to get you to go to Portland, Oregon?" Do you know what it took to get the Smith family from Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, over to Palmyra, New York, where they had to be? President Joseph Fielding Smith said in his<i>Essentials in Church History</i>that it took three crop failures and an impending drought--then they moved of their own accord. It is just as President Tanner said one time: "The Latter-day Saints came to the Rocky Mountains of their own free will, because they had to." We know the Lord could have sent an angel to Brother Smith. He did just a few years later. He could have said, "Brother Smith, I'd like you to move your family over to Palmyra, New York, for there is something we want Joseph to do over there." But he did not. He just made it untenable for them to stay in Vermont, so they moved to New York.<br><br>I heard of another case of a bishop who was called in Idaho. I think he was a bishop for about two months; then he lost his job. They offered him a job in Seattle, Washington. He went. Three months later he was a stake president. The Lord can move you around; he will if you let him. You ought to go where your opportunities are because you have to provide for your family. Yes, President Lee has said, "The most important of the Lord's work you'll ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home." President David O. McKay said, "No success can compensate for failure in the home." Provide for your family. That has to do with your career.<br><br>Under the heading of financial and resource management, you need to be prepared financially for that which is to come. The most important thing you could do in this area would be to pay your tithing. That is the Lord's financial plan. When you pay your tithing you have a promise from the Lord that you will always have sufficient for your needs; you will be able to provide for all the choice spirits the Lord will see fit to send you. You will be active, you will be happy, and you will be a great success. He also said, "He that is tithed shall not be burned at my coming" (D&amp;amp;C 64:23). It is great fire insurance.<br><br>But you ought to pay your tithing when you get it, with the first tenth going to the Lord. It belongs to him. If you pay it as soon as you get it, you get by with paying ten percent; if you wait until you have spent ninety percent, it will cost you a hundred percent to pay it. It is much easier to pay it when you can pay a tenth than it is when you must pay everything. It is also important that you budget your money and live within your income and not get involved in a bunch of credit cards. Save your money. Pay cash. Yes, you can do that. You still get a cash discount.<br><br>I recommend that you never buy a new car. You pay entirely too much for the smell of a new car. If you drive a new car out of the showroom, drive it around the block, and bring it straight back, they will not offer you within a thousand dollars of what you paid for it. That is too much to pay for the smell of a new car. You should buy a car that someone else bought on time and cannot pay for. You will get a great discount that way.<br><br>It is also vitally important that, after you give the Lord his tenth, you take the second tenth and put it away in a savings account under your own name. Do not give it to your wife or husband, as the case may be; do not give it to your children, do not give it to your in-laws, do not give it to your bishop, do not give it to your stake president, do not give it to anybody in this world--except the president of the Church; if he asks you for it, you can give it to him. Let it draw interest. If you will do that, if you will save one-tenth of what you earn throughout your working life, when you get to be sixty--retirement age--you will be ready to go on your second mission. That is what we are going to expect of you: go not only when you are nineteen, but again when you get your family raised, with your companion--eternal this time. You will have enough for your mission. In fact, you will be independently wealthy, because it will be drawing interest all the time. President Grant said, "Those who understand interest collect it. Those who do not pay it." You should learn to understand it.<br><br>Take better care of your possessions, that which you have right now. Wipe your car off. Wipe off your washing machine when you get through using it, and do not let it rust out. It is important that you take care of what you have.<br><br>Under the heading of home production and storage, let me give you one little statement on that; I guess I do not have to say much about it. The Lord has been saying for over forty years that you ought to have a year's supply of food. That is all; just about forty-one years. It will not do any good to go stand before the bar, slightly scorched, and say, "Lord, you really didn't give us enough time; you know, it wasn't fair. You only gave us forty years of warning and you know you gave Noah a hundred and ten years. It's not fair." This is what the prophet said, at the dedication of the Kaysville elevator back on June 10 of 1976:<br><br><i>And I hope--and this is my brief message to you today--that no one ever reads one word about the terrible flood, the sadness that it brought, the loss of life, the loss of livestock, destruction of farms, the suffering that has come to those good people</i>[that was the Teton Dam disaster];<i>I say again, I hope that no one here will ever read another word about that disaster, without saying quietly to himself again, "No moment will ever pass when I will not be prepared as the Brethren tell me to do." One year's supply of commodities well cared, well selected, is a minimum. It is the minimum, and no family, if they've been married for only a day or a week, they should begin to have their year's supply. Now that's basic and we mean it.</i>[When a prophet says, "We mean it," can you disregard that? Not without suffering.]<i>And there should be no family under the sound of my voice who is not already prepared for whatever eventuality may come.</i><br><br>When you are prepared you shall not fear.<br><br>Under the heading of physical health, it is important that you be healthy. You ought to take care of yourself. Of course, the Word of Wisdom is given to you for that particular purpose. We do not know all the reasons why we have the Word of Wisdom. I know that you can live the Word of Wisdom all your life and die of lung cancer. It has happened. It does not mean that you will not die of cancer, but it does mean that you will feel better while you are alive. I know that--I have had experience on both sides of this commandment. Living the Word of Wisdom will make you feel better, and you have to feel good if you are going to live the gospel. You know you have to love people--not just those that love you; that is too easy, you see--you have to love everybody, and you have to treat them with love and kindness and respect. It is easier to do that when you feel good. If you get up in the morning with a headache and someone says something cross to you, what do you say? "Lord bless you"? No; if you are not careful you will resort to the Law of Moses. You cannot be saved in this dispensation by living the Law of Moses. Not an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth--you have to live the Law of the Gospel that says you have to do good to those that spitefully use you, turn the other cheek, and go the second mile. You will feel better if you live the Word of Wisdom.<br><br>President McKay, back in April of 1968, also said that if we will live the Word of Wisdom we will learn something about self-control that will allow us to control our passions and desires when we need to (<i>Improvement Era</i>, June 1968, p. 4). I know it is true. Since he made that statement, I have interviewed probably five thousand or more young men and women, some not so young, who have violated the laws of chastity. I have never found one that had not broken the Word of Wisdom first. I made that statement some time ago at a stake conference, and as I was leaving the meeting, a young man followed me to the door, and he grabbed me by the hand and jerked me back inside and said, "Elder Rector, I want you to know that I've violated the laws of chastity, and I didn't break the Word of Wisdom first."<br><br>I said, "Oh, is that right? Why not?"<br><br>And he said, "I never did like the taste of the stuff."<br><br>I told him, "I'm not going to change my testament on the basis of your story. How did you know you didn't like the taste of the stuff?"<br><br>"Oh," he said, "I tasted it."<br><br>And I said, "That's just what I said."<br><br>It is also important that you maintain proper weight control. When I came home from a mission down in Florida, five years ago now, I was thirty pounds overweight. So I got up at 5:30 every morning and went to the Deseret Gym at 6:00 for about an hour and fifteen minutes of racquetball. I lost that thirty pounds. I feel great. We need to take care of ourselves, and it is important that we do.<br><br>Practice preventive measures to preserve good health. Everybody should know how to take care of a burn, or a cut artery or vein. You learn this at church, in Relief Society, Primary, Scouts, Mutual. (Yes, Mutual, that is what it is going to be; we have returned to the name<i>Mutual</i>. Isn't that great? Because no one knew what to call it.)<br><br>Under the heading of social and emotional strength--and this is the last area we will consider--it is important that you read the scriptures, as we said before, but it is also important that you have personal and family prayer. Brethren, each of you should always kneel with your wife in prayer before you retire in the evening. If some problems have developed during the day, the best way to smooth them out, President Lee said, is as you kneel together in the evening in prayer and when you finish that prayer you ought to kiss your wife and tell her you love her. That is the minimum--once a day for all eternity. And if you will follow that simple rule, you will never have so many problems during the day that you cannot handle them in the evening.<br><br>Repent of wrongdoings. You can repent of anything, except murder where you shed innocent blood, or the sin against the Holy Ghost. Anything else you can repent of; it takes time, but you can do it, because we have a gracious and kind Elder Brother that made it possible. He did not have any sins of his own. He took upon himself our sins. We caused him to suffer; but he did it because he loves us, and he says, "If you'll come unto me and confess your sins and forsake them and follow me, you will go free." We would be silly not to take advantage of that offer.<br><br>It is important to attend church meetings regularly and participate, hold family home evening on a regular basis, and perform frequent acts of service for family members and others. As a matter of fact, that is how we are going to be judged at the last day, on the basis of what we have done for other people. This is made very plain in the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew, where Jesus said,<br><br><i>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angles with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying: Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i>[I don't ever remember us seeing you like that. You must have us mixed up with someone else. People do look a lot alike, you know.]<br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:31–40]<br><br>That is the way we are going to be judged. John said,<br><br><i>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</i><br><br><i>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.</i>[Revelation 20:12–13]<br><br>That is how it is going to be. We are going to be judged on the basis of what we do for other people. But we must do it with love; that is the only way they will accept it. If you really want to help somebody, then you have to love them. If you do not they will not listen.<br><br>So the Lord wants us prepared both personally and as a family. We have to be prepared, if we do not want to be afraid; "[when] ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30), because there will be a crown of righteousness laid up for you that cannot pass away. James told us what will happen if we get involved in helping somebody else. The last two verses of the book of James make it very plain. He said:<br><br><i>Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;</i><br><br><i>Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</i>[James 5:19–20]<br><br>We know what hides the sins of the person that comes into the Church, don't we? Yes, it costs you something to join this Church; it costs you your sins. That is one reason it is hard to bring people in. After all, their sins belong to them, and they want to hold on to them. But they cannot. They have to leave them on the outside. So it hides the sins of the person that comes into the Church, but the inference is very plain that it also hides the sins of the missionary or the member who brings them in. I would not dare give you that interpretation of that scripture if I had not heard Harold B. Lee say that is what it means. If you would like to get more evidence on it, you will find it in<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>by Spencer W. Kimball; but when you bring somebody into the Church it will hide your sins at the last day.<br><br>May the Lord bless you to be prepared, yes, and to enjoy this probation where you are being prepared to meet God. It is important that you be happy, but "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10), and the Master said: "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John 13:17). I bear witness to you that God our Heavenly Father is our Father, that he knows us all by our first name--he could call you by your first name--and that he hears and answers prayers. I know he does. He has heard and answered mine. I bear witness to you that Jesus is the Christ and that he lives. I know that he lives--yes, and that he has reestablished this, his true Church, on earth. You are a product of it, and this University is a product of it. It is through the great prophet Joseph Smith that we have a living prophet of God on earth today. That is Spencer W. Kimball--follow him and you will never go wrong, for he leads us in the path of righteousness as he communes with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, whose Church it really is, and whose plan we must follow if we would be happy. May you be happy, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 31 May 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Man? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a humbling experience to be with you this morning; it is an honor and a privilege. President Oaks, I appreciate that introduction, and the beautiful music to which we have listened, and that lovely prayer offered by Brother Spencer. I think sometimes that we do not fully appreciate the prayers that are given in our services. They come from the heart, and they are prayers unto our Heavenly Father through his beloved Son. This morning I hope and pray that I may have the Spirit of the Lord to be with me in the remarks that I make.<br><br>The religious world is confused as to who man is, and what the purpose of life is. Many have sought in vain to obtain the answers to this question. The writer of psalms has said,<br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou has made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.</i><br><br><i>Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.</i>[Psalms 8:4–6]<br><br>Dr. James E. Talmage has also given us an answer to this question, from which I quote:<br><br><i>What is man in this boundless setting of sublime splendor? I answer you: Potentially now, actually to be, he is greater and grander, more precious according to the arithmetic of God, than all the planets and suns of space. For him were they created; they are the handiwork of God; man is His son! In this world man is given dominion over a few things; it is his privilege to achieve supremacy over many things.</i><br><br><i>"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork" (Psa. 19:1). Incomprehensibly grand as are the physical creations of the earth and space, they have been brought into existence as means to an end, necessary to the realization of the supreme purpose, which in the words of the Creator is thus declared:</i><br><br><i>"For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." (Pearl of Great Price, page 4.)</i>[James E. Talmage,<i>The Earth and Man,</i>pp. 11–12]<br><br>Think, then, of the great tragedy, the terrible responsibility that men take upon themselves when they treat so lightly, as is sometimes the case, the destruction of human life.<br><br>May I emphasize the statement in the foregoing quotation relative to the Son of Man and his work, namely, that it is his work and his glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (Moses 1:39). The Jews, particularly the Pharisees, seemed to be very much interested in eternal life; however, they did not understand the true meaning of the term, nor how to attain eternal life. You will recall that on one occasion a Pharisee came to the Savior and asked, "Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" The Savior, answering him, said, "Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is, God" (Matthew 19:16–17).<br><br>On one occasion soon after I became secretary to President Grant I met Dr. James E. Talmage, one of the brethren of the Twelve, as he entered the Church administration building; and in his kindly, sociable way he greeted me with a salutation, "Good morning, Brother Anderson."<br><br>"Good morning, Dr. Talmage," I replied.<br><br>He continued, "How are you this morning?"<br><br>And I answered, "Very good, thank you, Dr. Talmage."<br><br>He then made this interesting remark, "Brother Anderson, the Lord says there is none good but one, and that is God." My answer should have been, "Very well, thank you." Elder Talmage was a great scholar and one who was very technical as to proper English. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and other scientific societies, and was also on the board of directors of Webster's Dictionary.<br><br>We are indeed vastly inferior to God. We are human, subject to the weaknesses of the flesh. He has given us the gospel of our Lord and Savior; and if we will live in accordance with the principles thereof, if we fulfill the purpose that we came here to accomplish, we will become more like our Heavenly Father and obtain eternal life, that great goal for which the Lord gave his life, the goal which the Pharisee mentioned and the goal that the rich young ruler was seeking when he asked what he should do to obtain eternal life. I like the following statement by President Kimball upon this subject: "If I were to tell you in all seriousness that in your own backyard you could find an acre of diamonds, would you ignore the suggestion and take no trouble to search? Today, I am telling you with all the fervor of my soul that in easy reach there is a prize of inestimable worth. Diamonds can buy one food and shelter. Diamonds can embellish and decorate. But the prize that is within your grasp is more brilliant than jewels. It will not lose its sparkle, nor can it be stolen by thieves. I speak of the greatest gift--the gift of eternal life. It may not be obtained through mere asking; it cannot be purchased with money; hopeful wishing will not bring it; but it is available to men and women the world over who comply with the requirements" (Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle,</i>p. 83).<br><br>Everyone who accepts the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ--which one can do only through faith in the Lord, true repentance, and baptism, and the reception of the Holy Ghost when conferred by one having authority thus to act--can receive the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Spirit to point the way to eternal life.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we are told that when Lehi and his family were in the wilderness after leaving Jerusalem and before building a ship to take them to the promised land, Lehi "arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, [and] to his great astonishment he beheld upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither [they] should go into the wilderness" (1 Nephi 16:10). I like to think that in a sense each of us has the guidance of a Liahona which we call the Holy Spirit. If our life is to be a happy one we must bring our thinking, our urges, our passions under control and direct them into the proper channels--channels such as virtue, honesty, love, truth, unselfishness, and so forth. When we keep the commandments of the Lord after having fulfilled the requirements of membership, the Holy Spirit directs our way. When we fail to keep the Lord's commandments it does not work; and this, of course, was the case with the Liahona. When there was contention and wickedness among the Nephites the spindle did not point the way. The same is true in regard to the guiding influence we have through the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The Lord has given us certain gifts and talents whereby we can obtain righteous and eternal goals. Sometimes we may envy others who, we think, have talents that surpass our own. We must have faith in ourselves. We are children of our Heavenly Father. We are not necessarily like the other man, but we have our own personalities and our individual talents which, if developed, will bring us success and happiness in life. We have challenges to bring under control certain powers which, if not controlled, will result in disappointment and unhappiness. Edgar A. Guest, with whom I had the privilege of spending some time on a visit to Detroit with President Grant, has given us the following sentiments as set forth in the poem, "How Do You Tackle Your Work?"<br><br><i>How do you tackle your work each day?</i><br><i>Are you scared of the job you find?</i><br><i>Do you grapple the task that comes your way</i><br><i>With a confident, easy mind?</i><br><i>Do you stand right up to the work ahead?</i><br><i>Or fearfully pause to view it?</i><br><i>Do you start to toil with a sense of dread</i><br><i>Or feel that you're going to do it?</i><br><br><i>You can do as much as you think you can,</i><br><i>But you'll never accomplish more; . . .</i><br><br><i>Success! It's found in the soul of you,</i><br><i>And not in the realm of luck! . . .</i><br><i>You can do whatever you think you can,</i><br><i>It's all in the way you view it. . . .</i><br><br><i>How do you tackle your work each day?</i><br><i>With confidence clear, or dread?</i><br><i>What to yourself do you stop and say</i><br><i>When a new task lies ahead?</i><br><i>What is the thought that is in your mind?</i><br><i>Is fear ever running through it?</i><br><i>If so, just tackle the next you find</i><br><i>By thinking you're going to do it.</i><br>[<i>Collected Verse of Edgar A. Guest,</i>pp. 37–38]<br><br>God has given us no law which, if obeyed, will not bring us a desirable reward. We must be determined to obey God's laws if we expect the blessings.<br><br>In the New Testament, we have an account of the suffering of our Lord and Master when he was on the earth. At the conclusion of his mission, when he had arrived at the time when he was soon to lay down his life for mankind, we are told of the great agony that he underwent. Some people take the view that others have suffered as much as Christ did when he was crucified upon the cross. This is truly a mistaken idea. No man has suffered to the extent that the Savior of the world did, not only when he was hanging on the cross, but particularly when he was praying to his Father in the Garden of Gethsemane. We are told that so great was his suffering that he sweat drops of blood. His suffering was beyond our understanding in that he was carrying the weight of our sins. President McKay has said that the glory of mortal man is character, and it must be developed through obedience to the laws of life as set forth in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In discussing character, President McKay mentioned four pictures that had appealed to him. First was the picture of Christ as he stood before Pilate and Pilate said to the angry mob, "Behold the man," pointing to Jesus crowned with thorns and wearing a purple robe. The angry crowd sneered and condemned him as a felon and blasphemer (see John 19:4–6). When Pilate said, "Behold the man," he referred to one who was perfect in character, a conqueror over weaknesses and temptations, one who said "I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>Artists over the years have attempted to portray on canvas and other wise a likeness of Christ, our Master and Savior, but none of the paintings that have been made give us a reliable portrayal of our dear Lord. It is natural that we should visualize him in our minds according to the paintings and pictures we've seen. He is indeed our great ideal. He was a man of strength: physical, mental, and spiritual. He indicated that strength when he drove the moneychangers from the temple. He was not fearful of them, but they recognized his power and his authority. The later Orson F. Whitney, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, in referring to a dream or a vision that he had of the Savior, mentioned that as he gazed up into his face he recognized that the Savior was taller than he. Elder Whitney was a large man. As I think of Elder Whitney, it seems to me that he was two or three inches taller than six feet.<br><br>The Savior passed through temptations, as does mortal man. Maybe they were not just the same as ours, but they were somewhat similar in nature. You will recall that when he was tempted by the devil, after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry; and the tempter came to him and said, "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."<br><br>He resisted that temptation and answered, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."<br><br>Then you will recall that the devil took him into the city, Jerusalem, and the account records, "and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone."<br><br>The answer of the Master was, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."<br><br>Again, the record indicated that the tempter took him to a high mountain and showed him "all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."<br><br>Then Jesus responded and said, "Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." And then it was that the devil left him (see Matthew 4:1–11). We too have temptations of various kinds. If we are going to follow the Master we must say to the evil one, as the Savior did, "Get thee hence, Satan."<br><br>The second picture that President McKay referred to was the picture of the Savior as a youth. I have seen that picture and no doubt some of you have seen it also. It depicts purity and strength in a young boy. We look upon you young men and say that if you will keep the commandments that the Lord has given you will have the character that will shine in your face and give unto you a strength that you otherwise could not have.<br><br>The third picture was a picture described by Nathaniel Hawthorne in "The Great Stone Face," a story of a boy who, as he grew to manhood, lived in an area where there was a formation of a great stone face on the mountainside. It was a picture of virtue and character. It impressed the young man so much that he looked at it time and time and time again until, as he developed in life, the same virtues that he visualized in that great stone face developed in his own life.<br><br>President McKay mentioned as a fourth picture the picture of a youth whose clear eyes indicate the strength of young manhood and the purity of the life he is living. He said, "We love [purity] in womanhood: we also love [purity] and strength in young manhood, and [these things] come as a result of true living" (David O. McKay,<i>Man May Know for Himself,</i>pp. 29–30). I am thinking of that great stone face.<br><br>Two or three years ago, I was privileged to be the author of a book entitled<i>Prophets I Have Known.</i>And on the cover of that book are imprinted profile pictures of the faces of five prophets of the living God in this dispensation: Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, and Harold B. Lee. If I were writing it today I could add Spencer W. Kimball. And I also had the good pleasure to be fairly well acquainted with President Joseph F. Smith, the one who preceded President Grant. Why do I mention these men? They are not what some would normally call handsome men. You would not pick them out in a crowd because of their beauty of form or figure; but they were men of character, each one of them. They have wielded an influence upon the lives of the people of this Church during the periods of their leadership. They were men of purity, cleanliness, devotion, faithfulness, and determination, men who resisted the pitfalls and snares of the adversary. Their predecessors were also men of character--men who walked and talked with the Lord, as it were.<br><br>We cannot normally look upon the face of the Savior in our present mortal condition, but we can recognize great and good men whose lives we would like to imitate. A chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court said of one who influenced his university career, "I admired him for his learning, loved him for his goodness, profited greatly from both. He believed that scholastic attainments were better than riches, but that better than either were faith, love, charity, clean living, clean thinking, loyalty, tolerance, and all other attributes that combine to constitute that most precious of all possessions--good character."<br><br>In thinking of these men whom I have known so well and who have passed to the great beyond--excepting President Kimball, who is still with us--I think of how the purpose of religion has been exemplified in their lives. Then I think of our greatest exemplar, our Redeemer and Savior.<br><br>The Church is a great character-building organization. The purpose of its various organizations is to teach those principles and doctrines which, if lived, will lead us on the path of righteousness to a happy mortal life and an eternity of joy in the life to come. We should remember always that we are sons and daughters of God, that we have in us a spark of divinity. We will be tempted and will sometimes succumb to temptations; we will make mistakes; but we must get up again and fight for the right. Jesus promised his apostles at the Passover: "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John 14:26). When Isaiah was urging the backsliding Israelites not to forsake or forget what they had learned of God's law, he said, "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left" (Isaiah 30:21).<br><br>What do you think you are? John said, "Beloved, now are we sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:2).<br><br>President George Albert Smith was a man of love, a man without guile. He stated that as a young boy, when he was attending the Brigham Young Academy in Provo, he heard the principal of the school, Karl G. Maeser, make a statement to the effect that not only will we be required to give an accounting for our deeds done in the flesh, but for our very thoughts. This gave him some concern because he realized that sometimes his thoughts were not entirely what they should be. However, in thinking of the matter in depth, the thought came to him, "Of course we must give an accounting for our thoughts, because our thoughts lead to actions." In other words, "As [a man] thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Proverbs 23:7). I think these thoughts that came to President Smith at that time influenced his entire life; and he conducted his actions in accordance with his thoughts, which thoughts were clean and pure. His life was devoted to helping his fellowmen.<br><br>In this connection I like the statement by President McKay wherein he said: "Entertain upbuilding thoughts. What you think about when you don't have to think shows what you really are." President Brown has reminded us that each one of us must live with himself throughout eternity, and each one of us is now working on the kind of man he must live with throughout eternity. (And in speaking of man, we also mean his counterpart, woman.) Man is God's greatest creation. He has unlimited potentiality. He is God's son. He is an eternal entity made in the image of his Heavenly Father, the Father of his spirit. He lived in a spiritual state before he came here, undoubtedly in the presence of his Father. He knew his Father very well. His Heavenly Father loved him.<br><br>God loved us, his spirit children, so greatly that he provided a plan whereby we might become more like unto him, and he gave his beloved Son, one who stood high in the councils of heaven, higher than any other of his children. It was necessary, in order to bless his other children--you and me and all his children--with the necessary opportunities for progression, that there be a great atoning sacrifice, which sacrifice involved our redemption from sin in order that our earthly experience might be fulfilled and that it might be made possible for us to continue on into a further state, eventually resurrection from the dead and eternal life in the presence of our Heavenly Father. Our Savior, our beloved Brother, has said that this is life eternal, that we might know the only true God and his beloved Son, Jesus Christ (John 17:3). He has made it possible for us in our school of learning and preparation that we might return into the presence of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>To know God, however, is more than to know the nature of God, great as that knowledge is. To truly know him, we must love him and we must keep the commandments that he has given us. We can therefore, in a sense, understand why the Savior, in answer to the question as to what is the greatest of commandments, should say,<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord they God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all they mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</i>[Matthew 22:37–39]<br><br>The love of God is to us incomprehensible. The fact that he would make provision that his beloved son should die for us in an ignoble manner indicates a far greater love than meets our understanding. Shakespeare glimpsed somewhat the nature of man when he said: "What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! In form and moving, how express and admirable! In action, how like an angel! In apprehension, how like a god!" (<i>Hamlet</i>, act 2, scene 2). God is indeed mindful of man, and the Son of Man, and man should never fail in his mindfulness of God and his determination to serve him and keep his commandments.<br><br>I reiterate, we are children of God. We must keep in communication with him to receive of his power, inspiration, and guidance. The scriptures say of Jesus: "In him was life"--eternal life (see John 1:4). Yes, in him is hope, eternal hope. In him is understanding and physical as well as spiritual strength. In him we will develop character such as will help us to become more like unto him. In him and his teachings we may attain eternal life, which is the true purpose of our existence.<br><br>May the Lord help each of us to realize who we are, and help us in our determination to be successful in fulfilling life's purposes, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Joseph Anderson was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on June 14, 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ry Work: A Joyous Obligation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a very pleasant but humbling experience to be in your presence. You of our rising generation are very special, and I salute you not only for what you are, but for what you can become. I appreciate that kind introduction given by Brother Gundersen. He has been rather generous in listing positions held and personal achievements; and, as is generally the case, he made them sound more auspicious and significant than they really are. I have often wondered how the Lord reacts to such introductions when he monitors our meetings. You will recall that he, the resurrected Christ and Savior of all mankind, received this simple but profound seven-word introduction: "This is My Beloved Son: Hear Him!" (Joseph Smith 2:17).<br><br>These past several weeks I have prayed and pondered at great length about this assignment and uppermost in my mind has been the thought that I must instruct by the Spirit of truth--otherwise my words will not edify nor cause you to rejoice. Uppermost in my heart has been the desire to present a message which the Prophet would approve and endorse. Also, I have felt a nagging concern for two groups of people: those who have not tasted the joy associated with missionary service, either as full-time or as stake missionaries; and those who have served as missionaries at one time or another and have tasted the sweetness of such service, but who have since excused themselves from further involvement.<br><h2>The Imperative Duty of Missionary Work</h2><br>In section 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants reference is made three times to "an imperative duty." This imperative duty, we are told, is owed to God, to angels, to our wives, to our children, to widows, to the fatherless, to all the rising generation, and to all the pure in heart. What is this duty? To establish truth, to make public the facts concerning the Church and the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Why should this be done? Why publish truth? To combat the powers of the evil one and to overcome that satanic spirit which oppresses and enslaves men. Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord spoke of<br><br><i>the influence of that spirit which hath so strongly riveted the creeds of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption, and the whole earth groans under the weight of its iniquity.</i><br><br><i>It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band; they are the very handcuffs, and chains, and shackles, and fetters of hell.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:7–8]<br><br>What then, according to this scripture, is our imperative duty, our urgent and not-to-be-avoided task? It is to bring to light all the hidden things of darkness and to build the kingdom of God. It is to be ambassadors of truth and active participants in the Lord's great missionary cause.<br><br>Three weeks ago, I had the privilege of meeting a very unusual convert, a former Protestant minister. This young man, as I was told, upon completion of his training for the ministry, became a spokesman for his church against the Mormons. He studied carefully the anti-mormon literature and developed powerful presentations to discredit the Church. In time he became rather popular and famous. I am told that on one occasion he attended a lecture given by an LDS professor. He was impressed by what he heard and stayed after class to meet the Mormon instructor. He proceeded to tell the professor of his work, his special ministry in opposition to the Mormon faith. The professor listened politely and responded somewhat like this: "I suspect you should do what you think is right; however, be certain that what you teach about Mormonism is true."<br><br>The minister could not get these words of the professor out of his mind. A few days later he revisited the Mormon and invited him to read and criticize the text of his anti-Mormon talks, stating that he was sincere in his desire to teach the truth. As you might guess, the professor found a few errors in the material and proceeded to make the necessary corrections. He also suggested that the minister might obtain further truth about Mormonism by attending meetings of the Church, listening to the missionaries, and fellowshipping with the Saints in that particular area. He did all of these things and more. The time came when truth overcame error, and prejudice was replaced by understanding and love.<br><br>Allow me to describe the concluding scene of this conversion story as it was told me. A great high priest, one of the finest missionaries I know, visited the minister and invited him to be baptized. The minister admitted that he knew the Church was true, but evaded the baptism issue by saying that he did not want to break up his marriage.<br><br>"Well," said the high priest, "have you spoken with your wife about joining the Church?"<br><br>"No," he said, "I haven't dared to do so."<br><br>"Do it now," urged the Church member.<br><br>So he did; he called his wife into the room and announced his desire to become a Mormon. The wife--and I should say that she had been fellowshipped well by the Relief Society sisters--flew across the room and jumped into her husband's arms, exclaiming. "I've been waiting weeks to hear you say this!" As I said earlier, I met and visited briefly with this remarkable couple. Their expression of testimony to me was simply, "We have never known such joy."<br><br>Over and over again the Lord has made mention of our imperative missionary duty. Do you remember that significant portion of the baptismal covenant taught among the Nephites at the Waters of Mormon? Those baptized committed to "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places . . . , even until death" (Mosiah 18:9). Do you remember the commandment contained in the revelation given to the Church in 1831? Please note these words:<br><br><i>And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.</i><br><br><i>And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:40–41]<br><br>Do you remember the instruction found in modern revelation which reminds us of our need to warn our neighbors? It reads: "Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor. Therefore, they are left without excuse, and their sins are upon their own heads" (D&amp;amp;C 88:81–82). President Kimball makes frequent reference to the concluding verses found in the gospel according to Matthew:<br><br><i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</i><br><br><i>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</i>[Matthew 28:19–20]<br><br>These and other scriptures make it abundantly clear that those who find truth have the holy responsibility to share that new found truth with others. God does expect us, his children, to advance his cause. Our work and glory, like his, should be "to bring to pass the immortality an eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). This business of saving souls is serious, and we must do whatever is within our power to save our Father's children. It is our imperative duty.<br><br>Recognizing that the gospel was restored to the earth nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, the question is asked, "How are we doing? What progress are we making in terms of carrying the gospel to all lands and to all peoples?" In my youth I heard local priesthood leaders read and expound on many occasions the following scripture: "The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 65:2). Though these words were part of a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1831, and though I trusted in the scriptures and the words of my leaders, I seriously wondered whether they would ever be fulfilled. After all, at that time our numbers were comparatively few, our missionary force was small, and Church growth came slowly. In recent years, however, certain things have occurred in our proselyting effort to change my point of view from one of skepticism to one of prospect and hope. Note these interesting statistics included in a report made by President Kimball in the October 1976 general conference. I quote:<br><br><i>It is estimated that it took 117 years, from 1830 to 1947, to attain one million members. Then it took sixteen years, from 1947 to 1963, to reach the second million members, and then nine years, from 1963 to 1972, to attain the third million. It will probably take about four or five years to move up to the four-million mark, and then we can guess what the future holds.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>November 1976, p. 4]<br><br>Who can read such statistics and still doubt the word of the Lord?<br><br>Let me share other facts related to the Church missionary effort which provide further evidence that the stone is rolling forth to fill the whole earth. Did you know that we now have one hundred fifty-six full-time-missions in addition to the nearly nine hundred stake missions organized? We now have more than twenty-five thousand full-time missionaries in the field. Thirty years ago we boasted when we reached the three-thousand mark. We obtained upwards of 140,000 convert baptisms in 1976, a forty-eight percent increase over the missionary productivity in 1975; again, thirty years ago we were proud to reach 6,000 converts. We now have organized missions located in fifty-three countries.<br><br>Other statistics could be cited to confirm the truth that prophecy is being fulfilled, that we are engaged in the Lord's divine work. Still, however, our work must be accelerated. We must see the urgency of the missionary cause as the prophet sees it and fulfill our imperative duty of sharing the gospel with all people. If we expect to keep pace with the prophet in this business of saving souls we must accept his vision. He has declared to Church members:<br><br><i>We expect to have complete cooperation between the stake and full-time missionaries, and to involve the members of the Church generally in opening the gospel door to our Father's other children. . . .</i><br><br><i>I seem to envision . . . thousands . . . prepared and anxious . . . for missionary service . . . until the army of the Lord's missionaries would cover the earth as the waters cover the mighty deep.</i><br><br><i>. . . It is unrealistic to expect 19,000 or even 100,000 missionaries to cover the globe. . . . We call upon priesthood leaders to teach every family in the Church to assume its responsibilities.</i>[Regional Representatives Seminars, April 4, 1974, and April 3, 1975]<br><br>In my mind there is one undergirding belief and one undergirding desire associated with successful missionary work; if one does not embrace this belief and desire, the challenge to be a full-time missionary or a member is just so many words. With this belief and desire, however, one's participation in missionary activities assumes a sense of urgency and excitement. The imperative duty of which I speak becomes a labor of love, not just another Church assignment. Allow me to explain. The undergirding belief of which I speak is this:<br><br>[That]<i>there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:12]<br><br>A few days ago my wife and I attended a youth conference in Texas. The concluding meeting was a testimony meeting, and among the forty-five or fifty who expressed themselves was a beautiful young lady. She began by saying, "I do not belong to your church, but y'all have something great going good here and I want to be a part of it."<br><br>Another participant, a rough and tough young man, stood and said, "Y'all will have to forgive me. I ain't been a member long, and I ain't had all the rough edges cut off yet."<br><br>Earlier this year we received a touching letter from a young lady in the East. I would like to read a part of that letter.<br><br><i>I'm so excited and moved by the Family Home Evening program. I can hardly wait to show it to my friends. My husband and I are newlyweds--we're both college students. Having both been brought up with strong religious backgrounds, he Catholic and I Baptist</i>[and that's an explosive combination],<i>we're now looking for a church that will meet our needs and one where we can meet its needs.</i>[Isn't that interesting? Note this:]<i>By this I mean that we want to find a Church were we can expand our knowledge and get involved by giving up part of our time and ourselves.</i>[She doesn't know what she's in for.]<i>We don't believe in just attending church on Sunday morning, and we want to believe that we live the teachings of Jesus Christ all week long rather than just on Sunday.</i><br><br>[She states further,]<i>We know very little about the Mormon church, its history, its present, or its future hopes. We're trying now to find material to broaden our understanding and we would greatly appreciate any information you could send to us or recommend to us.</i>[And, I assure you, that request has been filled.]<i>We're so excited and thrilled. This is like a whole new world opening up before us and we can hardly wait to walk into it. Thank you so very much for your inspiration.</i><br><br>One more illustration. A number of years ago, while presiding over the Texas North Mission, I had occasion to fly from Dallas to Lubbock, and as I boarded the plane I looked for someone interesting to sit by. Upon entering the plane I saw a young lady seated by herself reading the Bible. At first I thought she was a lady missionary en route home from her mission; however, as I looked more closely I could see that her Bible was not the King James version. So I asked if she minded if I sat by her. She invited me to do so. Once into the air, I commented that it appeared as if she loved the scriptures. In response she held up the book and shook it in my face and said, "Mister, that book saved my life. It means everything to me."<br><br>Then she proceeded to tell me her story. Among other things she had been a dropout from her family, school, and church. In fact, she confessed that her life had become so sordid and confused that she had even entertained the idea of committing suicide. When life seemed darkest someone introduced her to the Bible, and it was the word of the Lord that turned her around. I was touched by her testimony.<br><br>In the middle of our conversation the pilot announced that Lubbock was overcast with heavy clouds and that our destination had been changed. This announcement disappointed everyone. Quietly and privately I prayed that the clouds would lift and that we would be able to land in Lubbock. I had a very special meeting that I needed to attend. A few minutes later, the pilot again interrupted the conversation by announcing that the storm had moved on and that we would land in Lubbock as scheduled. Everyone cheered. I turned to my traveling companion and said, "Now, there's a quick answer to a prayer."<br><br>"Oh," she replied, "were you praying, too?" For the rest of my life I will wonder whose prayer was heard, whose faith worked the miracle.<br><br>Many more cases and stories could be added in support of the belief that there are many good and faithful God-fearing people who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it. The undergirding desire of all missionary work should be the same as that which motivated Alma and the sons of Mosiah in their labors. It was said of them: "They were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble" (Mosiah 28:3). It has been my experience that most new converts to the Church share this desire. Having tasted of the gospel fruits, they desire that others, particularly family members, partake of it also. For they know, as Lehi knew, that it is desirable above all other fruit. One young convert expressed his desire to share the gospel when he said about his family members: "I want them to know as I know. I want them to feel as I feel. I want them to do what I have done."<br><br>I feel that the undergirding belief and desire of missionary work that I have discussed constitutes the spirit of missionary service. Can one sit back and do nothing about gospel-sharing when he recognizes the value of souls and knows that these souls thirst for truth? I think not. I have spent many hours pondering the problem of member involvement in missionary work, including my own; and gradually I have reached the conclusion that productive participation in the Lord's proselyting effort begins with the spirit, grows as confidence is gained, and matures through full involvement in friendshipping and fellowshipping activities. I do not have the time to discuss this involvement process in great detail, but I would like to outline three simple steps.<br><h2>Step One: Catch the Spirit</h2><br>The first step is to catch the spirit by sustaining the missionary effort. This step invites members to sustain the missionary effort by modeling the gospel, by fasting and praying that the doors to nations and hearts of men will be opened, and by supporting full-time and stake missionaries. Such sustaining actions are rather simple but very important. Almost invariably, it seems, modeling of the truth by a Church member is chapter one in conversion stories.<br><br>Not long ago I attended a stake conference where a recent convert was called upon to bear his testimony. He began his story by saying that his initial interest in the Church was sparked by a business associate--a member of the stake presidency. After relating the incidents leading to his conversion the man said, pointing to the counselor, "I'm here because of him. Thank God he modeled the gospel and caused me to want to be like him."<br><br>We must also remember the precious nature of souls and the power of prayer and thus request God's help in obtaining success in labors with others. We need to lift our voices to heaven as Alma did and cry,<br><br><i>O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.</i><br><br><i>Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.</i>[Alma 31:34–35]<br><br>Many times I have heard President Kimball invite Church members to pray that our work will succeed, that doors will be opened. By doing these and similar things we direct our thoughts beyond ourselves toward others and become concerned for the welfare. In this way the missionary spirit is felt and caught.<br><br>Speaking of the power of prayer and the power of fasting and the redemption of souls, let me share this story. Recently I interviewed a prospective missionary with a very unusual history. At age seventeen she ran away from home and lived with a man without bothering with a formal marriage. Her partner was an evil, conniving, conspiring businessman. He used the young lady in various ways to gain business advantages. On many occasions he arranged for her to sleep with clients. After two years of such wallowing in sin, the young lady woke up with a start one morning, wondering, "What am I doing? What is this doing to my family? Where is this leading?" She had not entertained thoughts like this before--it came new. It bothered her to the point that she dressed, left the apartment, and wandered the streets. She was confused and wondered what she should do. Finally, she determined that she should return home, like the prodigal son, and seek help from loved ones. Upon her return home she learned that her parents, brothers and sisters, and others were fasting and praying at that moment that she would find her way home. A loving father and serviceable bishop accepted her confession and did what was necessary to help her clean up her life. In fact, they put her on a cleanup program that lasted three years.<br><br>As this young and beautiful lady completed her program and was accepted back into the Church in full fellowship, her one desire was to serve the Lord as a full-time missionary. She explained to me that she had received many proposals, but that she had turned them down because, as she stated, "I have a debt to pay. I was reclaimed through the grace of God and I want to do something in return." There is power in fasting and prayer and it should be applied in our efforts to redeem souls. We should fast and pray that all of God's children will find their way home.<br><h2>Step Two: Build Confidence by Sharing</h2><br>Once the spirit of the work is with us we generally want to share our blessings with others. This is the second step, in which we build confidence by sharing. The desire to share should motivate us to serve missions if we are the proper age and have not served previously, to prepare our sons and daughters for missions, to send our money on missions by contributing to the missionary fun, to share copies of the Book of Mormon, to share subscriptions to Church magazines, and to seek referrals. These sharing actions tend to build confidence in the program, and they can be done by the most timid of us. I thrill each time I reflect upon the sharing exemplified in the James R. Boone family of Jacksonville, Florida. Brother Boone, his first wife, and thirteen sons and daughters have all served full-time missions. A second wife also served a mission. Just imagine, sixteen returned missionaries in one family--what joy and confidence they have reaped!<br><br>Each time I think of sharing a copy of the Book of Mormon, I am reminded of a young lady in Texas who was introduced to the gospel by my daughter. This prospective convert had a difficult time accepting the teachings presented by the missionaries in the first few discussions, and at one time--when informed that her previous baptism, conducted by a Protestant church, was invalid--walked away from the mission home vowing never to return. Weeks later, however, because of some faith-promoting experiences, the young lady did return to hear more and was baptized into the Church.<br><br>After her baptism I asked, "What brought you back?"<br><br>"It was the book," she said, "the Book of Mormon." The Book of Mormon and Church magazines are great missionary tools--they should be shared liberally with others. They help to teach and testify of the truth even while you and the missionaries sleep.<br><h2>Step Three: Continue to Fellowship</h2><br>Steps one and two should promote a desire to become fully involved in friendshipping and fellowshipping of nonmember families, which is step three. Regardless of the number in your family unit, regardless of where you are living, the process is the same: You prayerfully select a nonmember friend or family, plan friendshipping activities, invite them to learn more about the Church, and continue fellowshipping those friends or families after they become members of the Church. I was thrilled when we lived in Hawaii--our son brought home an associate of his, one that he had met at work, and invited him to share a family home evening with us. I have to admit that he did not look all that clean, and I wondered why our son was associating with him; but it was no long at all, after some friendshipping and fellowshipping activities, that this young man cleaned himself up and was baptized into the Church. What a thrill it was for me, a few months ago when I visited the California Arcadia Mission, to see this young man sitting with the missionaries. He is there serving a full-time mission.<br><br>I have a friend, Brother George Goff, who attributes his conversion and continued growth in the Church to this kind of friendshipping and fellowshipping. Let me read a part of his story.<br><br><i>When my wife, Linda, and I moved to Waco, Texas, in 1969, I could feel something unusual was going to happen. We were active Southern Baptists and had a conservative life-style. When we attended our first company party, we felt a little uneasy, but soon identified with some people who felt as we did. When Leo Weidner entered, the group started to ask him jokingly if he had brought his own root beer again. It soon became apparent that he didn't need alcohol to have a good time. I was impressed with his jovial spirit and the next day asked him about his religious beliefs. He immediately told me he was a Latter-day Saint and invited us to his ward to a missionary meeting on the Book of Mormon.</i><br><br><i>As soon as I heard the Joseph Smith story and saw his picture in the grove, I knew the Church was true. I bore my testimony to family and friends and they expressed how disturbed they were with my "odd behavior."</i><br><br><i>Brother Weidner gave us constant attention and soon introduced us to a new couple who had joined the home office. This couple, Del and Vergie Rogers, became a tremendous force in our conversion. They became our friends and discovered our individual needs. Although the Spirit had touched me, I still had an unquenchable desire to know doctrine. They supplied full-time missionaries, standard works, missionary seminars, and everything possible to help us gain this knowledge.</i><br><br><i>Linda made it apparent that she really wasn't interested in changing churches. Vergie Rogers told us later that she decided to "just become Linda's good friend and not mention religion anymore." Through this friendship she found that Linda had a great interest in genealogy and food storage. Linda even became so enthusiastic that we bought a full year's supply of food before we joined the Church.</i><br><br><i>Because Texas was our home and there were few Latter-day Saints in our area, these three people had tough resistance in convincing us to make a religious change. They fellowshipped us constantly for a year before we were baptized. Almost every week we were invited to their homes for dinner or ice cream, or we were invited to movies, Church socials, and Church meetings. They were so sincerely interested in us that we really couldn't feel intimidated. At our baptism and afterwards we had total evidence of the sincerity of these Saints:</i><br><br><i>1. A former mission president (Sanford Eliason) traveled 120 miles to speak at our baptism.</i><br><br><i>2. The new mission president (Carlos E. Asay) wrote a letter of congratulations and gave us constant encouragement after our baptism.</i><br><br><i>3. Del and Vergie Rogers traveled 1,400 miles to attend the Los Angeles Temple with us a year after our baptism.</i><br><br><i>4. Recently Leo Weidner told me how he considered me as a brother and has really proved it by being close when I needed a helping hand.</i><br><br><i>Everyone who fellowshipped us has shown as much help and friendship over the last seven years as they did before our baptism.</i><br><br><i>Although the Spirit moved with us quickly, we could have never had the strength to face the adversity of leaving family beliefs and old friendships without these new friends. No material goods ever replace the true and sincere friend. And these friendships have survived even though hundreds of miles now separate all of us.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>October 1977, pp. 18–19]<br><br>Isn't that beautiful? I would that this story were repeated hundreds and thousands of time over. Too often, I fear, members avoid or procrastinate their missionary opportunities because they do not know how to become involved. They do not understand the process which I have described; consequently, they deny themselves choice blessings and experiences. I invite you, even though many of you have served full-time missions, to think about the three steps I have outlined. I encourage you to take careful inventory of your circle of friends and to carry on with your missionary activities. In this way enthusiasm will replace apathy, confidence will overcome fear, and involvement will crown your efforts with success.<br><h2>Missionary Work: A Never-Ending Call</h2><br>Occasionally, I fear, returned missionaries excuse themselves from member missionary activities by saying that they have served and done their part. To such persons I say: "Repent; repent before you lose the sharing spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ." When I served as a mission president I included in my termination interviews this practice: I would ask the missionary to reflect upon his experiences and to list the habits formed over the one-and-one-half-year or two-year period. Almost without exception the missionary would compile a list of twenty or more habits, including rising early, retiring early, daily scripture study, daily prayers, good dress and grooming, and on and on. Then I would ask the missionary to cross off his list those habits which would have no application in his postmission life. Generally only one or two would be eliminated: tracting and other things like that. I would discuss with the missionary the relationship between character and habits and I would encourage him to cling to those habits associated with the missionary character and the Christlike life. My intent was to draw from the missionary a firm resolve to live and serve throughout life so that the benefits of his full-time mission experience would not be wasted.<br><br>What a waste of time and effort and energy and money when a missionary returns home and abandons his missionary habits and character! We should strive to claim on a lifetime basis the benefits of serving as missionaries. We should always be missionaries. I love this thought expressed by Amasa M. Lyman when he said:<br><br><i>I am not glad to be here because my mission is ended, for such I do not consider to be the case at all. We often say we have been on a mission, and have fulfilled a mission, and have returned as though that something had been completed and accomplished. . . . I have been on a mission; I have come home from a mission; I am still on a mission. The obligations of that mission, I feel, are not ceasing, not becoming less, but they increase from day to day and from year to year with the increase of knowledge and understanding and the apprehension of the principles of truth.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>10:83]<br><br>The imperative duty to share the gospel takes on greater urgency when we understand that our salvation is intertwined with the salvation of others. One writer expressed his thought in these words: "Heaven's gate is shut to him who comes alone; Save thou a soul, and it shall save thy own" (John Greenleaf Whittier, "The Two Rabbis"). It was President John Taylor who warned: "God will hold you responsible for those whom you might have saved had you done your duty" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>20:23). This warning must not be taken lightly.<br><br>At the beginning of this talk I made reference to the 123rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let me turn back to that reference once again. In it we read this conclusion:<br><br><i>Therefore, . . . we should waste and wear out our lives in bringing to light all the hidden things of darkness, wherein we know them; and they are truly manifest from heaven--</i><br><br><i>These should then be attended to with great earnestness.</i><br><br><i>. . . Let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:13–14, 17]<br><br>I pray that we will understand our imperative duty and that we will take seriously our responsibility to share the gospel of Jesus Christ always. May we follow one of the greatest missionary prophets of all time, President Spencer W. Kimball. May we catch his vision of this great work and move forward to fulfill holy prophecy. I bear you my testimony that it is our sacred responsibility to establish truth, and to be ambassadors of truth and righteousness and saviors of men. I know that God lives, that we are his children, and that we must do everything within our power to qualify us to return to his presence. I bear you that testimony humbly and sincerely and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E. Asay was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 August 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
As I look upon this vast audience, I feel as if it must be the finals of the NCAA with BYU playing for the championship. But this is a thrilling sight to see all of you here and to be here in your presence. What a glorious occasion and opportunity for me to be here and to feel of your warmth and spirit and affection this night! Now I pray that I may have an interest in your faith and prayers; and that the light of Christ, the spirit of truth which emanated from the source of all intelligence and that lighteneth every man (see D&amp;amp;C 88:6, 11–13), will bless us all so that you will understand what I am impressed to say; and that I will feel your spirit and acceptance of what I have to say. I was impressed with the song by the choir: "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee." I hope and pray that we might have that spirit here this night that we might communicate with one another.<br><br>As has been announced, this is the first twelve-stake fireside of the new academic year. Many of you are new on campus, I understand--some six thousand freshmen. We also welcome tonight some twelve hundred missionaries sitting over here in the dark suits. They are studying a new language at the Language Training Mission, and we welcome them and all the other returning students and faculty members here this night. It is an exciting experience to learn, to stretch our minds at this most unusual University. This is a wonderful time to be alive and to be on this campus with the inspired leadership of this University. President Oaks and his wife are sitting here with us tonight--isn't it wonderful that he can be here with us, the president of this great institution? And in addition there are here on campus student branches and stakes, to give each of you encouragement and guidance in preparing for your life's opportunities. What a unique opportunity and combination, all to assist you personally!<br><br>Alma wrote, "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God" (Alma 34:32). As part of God's plan, the spirits of men come to this earth and follow a journey from infancy to childhood to youth, marriage, and old age--all the time learning, growing, and developing character and wisdom. Fortunately, all of us in this vast audience tonight have at least a partial understanding of what the Lord wants us to do or become or accomplish. For his divine purpose is clearly stated in scripture and by living prophets: it is to save all mankind. Many young people like you in other settings and in different climates from this tonight, being without purpose or destination, lose their way; but others through fortunate circumstances make wise decisions, recognize divine truths, and arrive at the destination God has planned for all of his children: "To bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). You will be taught and encouraged by men and women at this University who believe that the true gospel of the Savior has been restored and is again upon the earth. Your professors will not cause you to doubt divine truths. They will not teach of the anti-Christ, but in a positive manner will help each of you to gain an understanding of this mortal existence, to enter into covenants, to understand the commandments which will result in your eventually occupying a glorified place in our Father's kingdom.<br><br>President Kimball, in a motion picture now being shown at stake conferences throughout the world to encourage missionary involvement of all Church members, points to a world map and quotes the Savior's direction to the apostles: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations" (Matthew 28:19). The prophet emphasizes that the Savior knew the bounds of the earth when he said that. He did not say to go only to Egypt or Greece or the Arab world or Rome; He knew of all the nations that existed then, and the nations that would emerge. He, the Creator, knew what growth would take place then, today, and in the future.<br><br>The Lord told Moses, "For mine own purpose have I made these things." In speaking of the Creation, he said, "I also created them for mine own purpose; all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them" (Moses 1:31, 33, 35). We know that when he directed the apostles to go to all nations God knew not only the geography and physical development of the earth, but where people would eventually settle and live. He knew not only that, but he also knew and knows so well the weakness of people and how we might or will succumb to the ways and evils of the world. The possibility is ours to fall into the trap of the tempters who, like ourselves, have their free agency and will try to persuade us to "eat and drink; for tomorrow we die" (1 Corinthians 15:32), as Paul told the Corinthians, and to become as miserable as they.<br><br>I quoted the Lord's words: "For mine own purpose have I made these things." "Mine own purpose"--isn't that an interesting word, "purpose"? The Lord's purpose is to save all mankind. Can you think of a more majestic purpose, to save us all--all who will hearken and obey? Have you new students coming to this campus established a purpose for your life, your own purpose? What are you trying to do or what do you want to get or to accomplish? The establishment of a worthwhile purpose is a beacon for all to follow, a guide, a white line down the middle of the highway on a foggy night.<br><br>What do you expect to achieve? What do you want to become? Many of you are just beginning at the University and, rather than waiting for a commencement speaker to suggest lofty goals four years from now, what a blessing it would be if you would establish a clear purpose now, even tonight. You are adults with responsibilities; you are a chosen group with unlimited potential. Establish goals; identify them, study them, follow them. Set in neon lights your purpose, your plans, your future, your hopes--and if they are right they will be in harmony with God's purpose for you.<br><br>There is so much potential in each of us, and a story told of Michelangelo illustrates this point. As the sculptor was chiseling a block of marble, a boy came every day and watched shyly. When the figure of David emerged and appeared from that stone, complete for all the world to admire, the boy asked Michelangelo, "How did you know he was in there?" If we merely dream without doing any chiseling, our dreams return unfulfilled to the never-never land where the word "impossible" is supreme. The enjoyment of achievement comes only to those who see a vision of what might be, form a purpose, and then get busy.<br><br>The other afternoon, as a break from a busy day, I took a few minutes and strolled amid the flowers and lawn and trees and people of Temple Square. I stood off to one side in the shade of a tree and gazed at the scene--people, people, people everywhere, all shapes and sizes, in vacation outfits of every color, going from building to building with cameras clicking. I watched the people looking at the temple and I stared at it with them. Massive, majestic--of course it looks like it will last forever, spires touching the sky. Others were admiring the Tabernacle; it is unusual of course, a pioneer engineering feat. As I watched the scene I thought, "Why do people come to Temple Square? Why these particular people? Why these particular people that I see on this day?" Well, they are hungry, but not for tourist hamburgers. They are seeking and they are hoping.<br><br>A few months ago I recall running my hands through thousands of letters at Church headquarters. Over ninety thousand had been received, requesting a little pamphlet we had offered to those wanting information about how to help their families. Millions in the United States had watched a television program about family life. We offered some solutions and the phones started to ring from all over America. Parents phoned, or took time to write. And as I picked up those letters from the bags full I noticed that most read, "Please send me the booklet that you offer. If you can help my family, please send it." Others read, "My family needs help." Many people were asking for answers to their questions and concerns. Other people are now wandering around on Temple Square looking for answers. Deep in their hearts they must feel that something is missing. They must feel that we have answers to their concerns.<br><br>During my visit to Temple Square that other morning, I walked over to four large stone tablets that are placed in an unusual setting. I hope sometime you take time to read them. Read them slowly, carefully, thoughtfully. The first one is "The Law." Words chiseled in the stone--words the Lord himself wrote in stone with his finger for Moses to show and teach the children of Israel--these are the great governing principles by which all mortal men are judged, by which we will all be judged. These commandments are still part of the basic law governing mankind. You will read on the first table, as you stand there and admire this setting,<br><br><i>The Law</i><br><i>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</i><br><i>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.</i><br><i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</i><br><i>Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.</i><br><i>Honor thy father and mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</i><br><i>Thou shalt not kill.</i><br><i>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</i><br><i>Thou shalt not steal.</i><br><i>Thou shalt not bear false witness...</i><br><i>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house ... thy neighbor's wife ... nor anything that is thy neighbor's.</i><br><br>After reading this clear warning of the pitfalls that we must avoid at all costs, I then moved over and read the last stone, on which are carved the firm, gentle words of the Savior, and which is entitled "The Way." From John, fourteenth chapter, sixth verse: "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." Then from Matthew, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Matthew 22: 37–39). Then from the seventh chapter of Matthew, twelfth verse: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." And then the last one on that stone from the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants: "Give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God."<br><br>There are many phases of our Lord's teachings that we might mention here tonight, but if you could only resolve to build into your life's purpose a commitment to live fully and completely the Ten Commandments as well as "the Way" as quoted from the New Testament, then I would remind you that your life would be rich and meaningful and happy. You wonderful young people who mean so much to the Lord, and whom the Lord needs so much in this great challenge we have to carry this message of hope and salvation to all the world, must not be among those who flaunt the Lord's commandments, particularly the commandments regarding sex sin. It is destroying more lives and breaking more homes and families than ever in the history of man. It is the curse of our civilization. Sexual immorality stands next to murder in the category of personal crimes. It is the "most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost," wrote Alma (Alma 39:5). And as the world becomes more wicked, you who have been raised and taught and guided as you have will lead people unto Christ by your faithfulness, by your example of being pure and clean before the Lord. Do not deny yourselves rich blessings by violating God's laws. They are for a purpose, for your good, for your spiritual blessings, for your salvation.<br><br>Now, my dear young friends, you may feel at times that the Lord's commandments restrict your freedom as compared with that of other people. Freedom does not mean license, nor does it imply the absence of all restrictions and discipline. The savior did not teach undisciplined, permissive-type freedom. When he said, "Know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32), he was telling us that his truth if followed will free us from falsity and from deception, and that his gospel if followed will free us to gain eternal life. You must be strong and influence those who are weak, for the Savior taught us to be the salt of the earth and not to lose our savor (see Matthew 5:13; Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34–35).<br><br>Some time ago a high school senior and student body leader was asked about his relationship to his peer group. This young man said, "I find great strength in the example of my peers. To get up and walk out of an offensive movie, to stand up and defend or even befriend a person whom everyone else ridicules, to be the only one in the crowd to say no to drinking, dishonesty, breaking the Sabbath day--all of these actions take a person of strong character. Such people among my friends have given immeasurable courage to me and to others."<br><br>He continued, "I remember a night when some friends and I sneaked into a movie through the exit without paying. We were laughing and feeling smart and smug about it when, without a word, one of my friends got up and left the theater. Suddenly, being dishonest didn't seem funny any more. One by one each of us walked out each secretly wishing we had had that much courage."<br><br>This young man went on to say, "Probably the most well-respected boy I know is a young man who makes friends with all kinds of people, regardless of their belief or status. He is loved among Church members and classmates. He is always the life of the party and a fun date, yet he has never lowered his high standards in any way to win a friend or to get a laugh. He gravitates naturally toward positions of leadership because his peers, even the weakest ones, sense his strength of character. He has changed the lives of many young people."<br><br>One of the great powers in the world is that of example. People need a model to see and at times to lean on. Henry David Thoreau wrote: "If you would convince a man that he does wrong, do right. Men will believe what they see." Such an example is the story of Mervyn Sharp Bennion; I would like to take just a few moments to tell you about it.<br><br>Mervyn Sharp Bennion, who became one of the renowned heroes of World War II, was born in the small village of Vernon near Tooele, Utah. He grew up in a faithful Latter-day Saint home and was taught by his parents and according to the scriptures the principles of faith, reverence, respect and regard for others, confidence in himself, a strong sense of right and wrong, and an understanding of the full measure of his purpose of life. Because of his excellent reading ability as a result of studying the Bible as a small boy, he became an outstanding student. He attended school in a one-room log schoolhouse in Vernon; there were usually thirty or more pupils in all grades from the first to the eighth, ages six to twenty-five, with one teacher in the one-room schoolhouse. There was little time for instruction, but they were taught the attributes of a good character and wholesome habits, and they developed their personalities in this one-room schoolhouse with plays and programs in which everyone participated.<br><br>Near the close of his high schooling, Mervyn Bennion took a competitive examination and was admitted to the Annapolis Naval Academy. There he continued his character and personality development, resulting in his being number one in his class for the first three years; however, in his fourth year, he dropped back to third in his class because he was tutoring as free service some of the other midshipmen who were having difficulties. He was a sought-out companion and developed all the wonderful attributes of an outstanding young man, this product of a humble Mormon home and a one-room schoolhouse. Upon graduation from Annapolis he was awarded the sword offered every year by the Daughters of the American Revolution for excellence.<br><br>Mervyn Bennion continued through the usual duty assignments of a young naval officer, growing in stature and ability and always living close to the Lord. He married Louise Clark, the eldest daughter of President J. Reuben Clark. They had one child, Mervyn, Junior. In his various naval assignments he was called to be Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance in Washington, D.C., a distinguished position. This was after he had commanded a number of ships.<br><br>Even though he would be on duty assignment for only a brief period, he was always active in the Church and would always seek out a little branch of the Church somewhere in the world and attend the meetings. But while living in Washington he became a counselor in the branch presidency and later in the first bishopric of the Chevy Chase Ward. They needed priesthood leaders in those early days; they were particularly short of priesthood home teachers, and even though Mervyn was heavily involved at the Navy headquarters, he was completely devoted to his Church calling with all of the time available. As an example, he had thirty home teaching families to visit and made it a point to visit each one every month. Everyone who came in contact with Mervyn Bennion in the Church or in the Navy felt of his great spirit and devotion, because he knew so well his purpose in life and his responsibility.<br><br>His last assignment was as the commanding officer of one of the Navy's largest battleships stationed in Hawaii, the U.S.S.<i>West Virginia</i>. Our country was then at peace. Commanding officers of large ships usually had free time for social life and personal affairs; however, Captain Bennion, because of his dedication and love of his country and his built-in desire to serve well and faithfully, was careful with the use of his time. As an example, on December 6, 1941, a Saturday, Captain Bennion was invited to have dinner in the Honolulu home of President and Sister Ralph Woolley, then president of the Oahu Stake. After a pleasant evening, the Woolleys suggested that Captain Bennion stay overnight and go to Sunday School with them the next morning. But he said that his place was on his ship.<br><br>The following morning, Sunday, December 7, 1941, at a few minutes before eight o'clock, Captain Bennion was in his cabin shaving, preparing to leave the ship to go to Sunday School and fast meeting in Honolulu, when a sailor on watch from the bridge dashed in to report a Japanese air attack approaching. Captain Bennion instantly gave the command, "Air attack! To your battle stations!" Then he ran to his own, the conning tower on the flag bridge.<br><br>In a few minutes torpedo planes flew in close, letting go torpedoes that struck the U.S.S.<i>West Virginia</i>in rapid succession. Almost immediately bombers flew overhead and hit the U.S.S.<i>West Virginia</i>. Captain Bennion, anxious to see what had happened to his ship, stepped out the door of the conning tower; he had scarcely taken two steps when he was hit by a splinter from a bomb. This splinter tore into his body, and a fragment hit his spine and his left hip. He fell to the floor. Instantly his plight was observed and the pharmacist's mate came to place a bandage over his abdomen and to try to ease the pain, but it was clear to him and undoubtedly to Captain Bennion that the wound was beyond any hope of mending, though the captain did not say a word to indicate that he knew of this serious condition.<br><br>As soon as the wound was given the simplest of dressing, Captain Bennion sent the man below to work with the wounded and refused to be attended further while there was work to be done for others. As men and officers came to him, he briefly asked what was transpiring and gave orders and instructions to meet the conditions as they arose. Only two lives were lost from that ship's complement that morning: Captain Bennion and one seaman. The wounded were attended to promptly and evacuated from the ship with dispatch.<br><br>Captain Bennion was courageous and cheerful. His spirit was reflected in the conduct of his crew. He resisted all efforts to remove him from the bridge with a firmness and vigor that astonished his officers. He talked only of the ship and the men, how the fight was going, what guns were out of action, how to get them in operation again, who was wounded, what care the wounded were receiving, and how to evacuate them from the ship.<br><br>At about nine-thirty a.m. fire broke out, cutting off the escape of Captain Bennion and two others. The officers tied him onto a ladder and tried to lift him out, and with some great difficulty and with the ship on fire they carried him up to a navigation bridge to a corner at the rear that seemed to be free from smoke. But Captain Bennion told them to leave him and to save themselves if it were possible. They made him as comfortable as they could.<br><br>On the battleship alongside, most of Captain Bennion's men watched the lone, whiteclad figure lying on the navigation bridge of the ship. A young ensign, Delano, deeply touched by Captain Bennion and deeply attached to him, watched for hours. He said that twice in the first half-hour after Captain Bennion was left alone he saw him stir, rise up on his elbows, look about, and then drop back. The grandeur of this heroic death scene as it unfolded profoundly moved the men of the stricken fleet, and the executive officer of the ship wrote,<br><br><i>"Be assured, Mrs. Bennion, that every person in the West Virginia shares your grief. We are all proud to have served under Captain Bennion and his kindness, cheerfulness and courage will always be remembered by all of us who had the privilege and pleasure of being under his command."...</i><br><br><i>Thus closed in glorious death a naval career without fault or blemish.</i>[Howard S. Bennion,<i>Mervyn Sharp Bennion: One of the Lord's Noblemen,</i>p. 19; hereinafter cited as<i>Bennion</i>]<br><br>The following morning, when the superstructure had cooled off sufficiently to permit, Captain Bennion's body was removed from the ship. The spot where he lay had been untouched by fire. Some remarked that he was protected from the fire because he wore a special type of underwear.<br><br>The president of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, at that time posthumously awarded Captain Bennion the Congressional Medal of Honor. A camp in the Farragut Naval Training Station in northern Idaho was named Camp Bennion. On July 4, 1943, a destroyer launched at the Boston Navy Yard was christened the U.S.S. Bennion by Louise Clark Bennion. Admiral David Sellers wrote to Sister Bennion, "His complete unforgetfulness of self and devotion to duty to the last has set an example that will serve as an inspiration in years to come to the officers and men of the United States Navy" (quoted in<i>Bennion,</i>p. 20). His dying conduct is now cited in naval training classes as one of the outstanding examples to be found in all United States naval history.<br><br>"The most important of all his characteristics was his constant and sincere desire to keep the commandments of God," wrote his bishop. "He did not think of himself overly righteous, but his sincerity and his ever present desire to live in accordance with God's laws and to perform the full duty required of him, impressed all who knew him" (quoted in<i>Bennion,</i>p. 20). His characteristics, his purpose, his desire, his faith, his conduct were steadfastly the same. Of course, he had grown in stature and in influence, but inherently he was unchanged. He was started out on the right path by his parents in a little Mormon town, and he kept going straight ahead, his purpose clearly identified. He influenced many, many lives for good. He was a great and devoted member of this Church. We honor his name, his family, and his good works.<br><br>Each of us has been given a lamp to carry. Your lamp will light the way for you and hopefully for others, but it must have oil. Oil for your lamp will not come from the good works or the righteousness of your parents or friends; but from your faithfulness in keeping the commandments of God; from your actions and desires and, of course, your love of the Master. The psalmist wrote:<br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou are mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor...</i><br><br><i>O Lord our Lord,</i>[the psalmist concluded,]<i>how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</i>[Psalm 8:3–5, 9]<br><br>To you, my dear young friends, as one of those called to be a special witness to you and to all the world, I testify in all solemnity that I know that God lives, that he is real, that he is our Father. President Kimball and his counselors and all the Twelve ordained me an apostle in the temple a little over a year ago; they left me alone after this sacred occasion and I had the opportunity to be all alone in that upper room in the temple, to get on my knees and to pour out my heart and soul to my Heavenly Father. I had an event happen to me at that time that I may testify and witness to you that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, that he lives--<i>that he lives--</i>that he is real; that this is the church of Jesus Christ restored to the earth in these latter days; and that Spencer Woolley Kimball is a prophet of God, a living prophet here upon the earth now for you to see, to listen to, to read what he says, to follow the direction that he gives to you as the living prophet who understands your challenges. I bear my witness to you that these things are true, for the witness is mine.<br><br>I leave you my love and my blessing and my hope and desire that each of you will somehow sense your responsibility in this great scheme, that you will not fall victim to the things that are going on in the world, but that you will be able to stand up tall and straight and look the world straight in the eye unblemished, unscarred, and unspotted, to become servants of the Lord and of mankind. I leave you my witness and my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David B. Haight was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 September 1977.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> Truth - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, what a joy it is to be with you on your first devotional for the new school year! I am glad to be here and I greet you with my affection and deep-seated love.<br><br>I wrote, some time ago, a letter to a disbeliever. Much of what was said in that letter has been on my mind lately and I wish to share the substance of those thoughts in this talk to you. With that explanation you will better understand the point of view assumed and the style in which it is given. Writing to this young man, who was battling with his thoughts, I said:<br><br><i>Dear John:</i><br><br><i>Your resistance and argument against the truths of the gospel have given me grave concern.</i><br><br><i>I realize I cannot convince you against your will, but I know I can help you if you will only listen and let me call to your attention some salient truths, and if you will listen with a prayer and a desire to know that what I say is true. I would not, even if I could, force your thinking, for free agency is the basic law of God and each one must assume the responsibility for his own response; but certainly each of us must do his part in influencing for good those who might need some assistance.</i><br><br>The Lord said unto Enoch:<br><br><i>Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency.</i>[Moses 7:32]<br><br>I have lain awake many long hours contemplating and have offered many fervent prayers on my bended knees, hopeful that I might say the right thing, and that you would receive it in the humble spirit in which it is given.<br><br>This true way of life is not a matter of opinion. There are absolute truths and relative truths. The rules of dietetics have changed many times in my lifetime. Many scientific findings have changed from year to year. The scientists taught for decades that the world was once a nebulous, molten mass cast off from the sun, and later many scientists said it once was a whirl of dust which solidified. There are many ideas advanced to the world that have been changed to meet the needs of the truth as it has been discovered. There are relative truths, and there are also absolute truths which are the same yesterday, today, and forever--never changing. These absolute truths are not altered by the opinions of men. As science has expanded our understanding of the physical world, certain accepted ideas of science have had to be abandoned in the interest of truth. Some of these seeming truths were stoutly maintained for centuries. The sincere searching of science often rests only on the threshold of truth, whereas revealed facts give us certain absolute truths as a beginning point so we may come to understand the nature of man and the purpose of his life.<br><br>The earth is spherical. If all the four billion people in the world think it flat, they are in error. That is an absolute truth, and all the arguing in the world will not change it. Weights will not suspend themselves in the air, but when released will fall earthward. The law of gravity is an absolute truth. It never varies. Greater laws can overcome lesser ones, but that does not change their undeniable truth.<br><br>We learn about these absolute truths by being taught by the Spirit. These truths are "independent" in their spiritual sphere and are to be discovered spiritually, though they may be confirmed by experience and intellect (see D&amp;amp;C 93:30). The great prophet Jacob said that "the Spirit speaketh the truth. . . . Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be." (Jacob 4:13). We needed to be taught in order to understand life and who we really are.<br><br>God, our Heavenly Father--Elohim--lives. That is an absolute truth. All four billion of the children of men on the earth might be ignorant of him and his attributes and his powers, but he still lives. All the people on the earth might deny him and disbelieve, but he lives in spite of them. They may have their own opinions, but he still lives, and his form, powers, and attributes do not change according to men's opinions. In short, opinion alone has no power in the matter of an absolute truth. He still lives. And Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Almighty, the Creator, the Master of the only true way of life--the gospel of Jesus Christ. The intellectual may rationalize him out of existence and the unbeliever may scoff, but Christ still lives and guides the destinies of his people. That is an absolute truth; there is no gainsaying.<br><br>The watchmaker in Switzerland, with materials at hand, made the watch that was found in the sand in a California desert. The people who found the watch had never been to Switzerland, nor seen the watchmaker, nor seen the watch made. The watchmaker still existed, no matter the extent of their ignorance or experience. If the watch had a tongue, it might even lie and say, "There is no watchmaker." That would not alter the truth.<br><br>If men are really humble, they will realize that they<i>discover,</i>but do not<i>create,</i>truth.<br><br>The Gods organized the earth of materials at hand, over which they had control and power. This truth is absolute. A million educated folk might speculate and determine in their minds that the earth came into being by chance. The truth remains. The earth was made by the Gods as was the watch by the watchmaker. Opinions do not change that.<br><br>The Gods organized and gave life to man and placed him on the earth. This is absolute. It cannot be disproved. A million brilliant minds might conjecture otherwise, but it is still true. And having done all this for his Father's children, the Christ mapped out a plan of life for man--a positive and absolute program whereby man might achieve, accomplish, and overcome and perfect himself. Again, these vital truths are not matters of opinion. If they were, then your opinion would be just as good as mine, or better. But I give you these things, not as my opinion--I give them to you as divine truths which are absolute.<br><br>Someday you will see and feel and understand and perhaps even berate yourself for the long delay and waste of time. It is not a matter of<i>if.</i>It is a matter of<i>when.</i><br><br>Experience in one field does not automatically create expertise in another field. Expertise in religion comes from personal righteousness and from revelation. The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith: "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it" (D&amp;amp;C 93:30). A geologist who has discovered truths about the structure of the earth may be oblivious to the truths God has given us about the eternal nature of the family.<br><br>If I can only make clear this one thing, it will give us a basis on which to build. Man cannot discover God or his ways by mere mental processes. One must be governed by the laws which control the realm into which he is delving. To become a plumber, one must study the laws which govern plumbing. He must know stresses and strains; temperatures at which pipes will freeze; laws which govern steam, hot water, expansion, contraction, and so forth. One might know much about plumbing and be a complete failure in training children or getting along with men. One might be the best of bookkeepers and yet not know anything of electricity. One might know much about buying and selling groceries and be absolutely ignorant of bridge building.<br><br>One might be a great authority on the hydrogen bomb and yet know nothing of banking. One might be a noted theologian and yet be wholly untrained in watchmaking. One might be the author of the law of relativity and yet know nothing of the Creator who originated every law. I repeat, these are not matters of opinion. They are absolute truths. These truths are available to every soul.<br><br>Any intelligent man may learn what he wants to learn. He may acquire knowledge in any field, though it requires much thought and effort. It takes more than a decade to get a high school diploma; it takes an additional four years for most people to get a college degree; it takes nearly a quarter-century to become a great physician. Why, oh, why do people think they can fathom the most complex spiritual depths without the necessary experimental and laboratory work accompanied by compliance with the laws that govern it? Absurd it is, but you will frequently find popular personalities, who seem never to have lived a single law of God, discoursing in interviews on religion. How ridiculous for such persons to attempt to outline for the world a way of life!<br><br>And yet many a financier, politician, college professor, or owner of a gambling club thinks that because he has risen above all his fellowmen in his particular field he knows everything in every field. One cannot know God nor understand his works or plans unless he follows the laws which govern. The spiritual realm, which is just as absolute as is the physical, cannot be understood by the laws of the physical. You do not learn to make electric generators in a seminary. Neither do you learn certain truths about spiritual things in a physics laboratory. You must go to the spiritual laboratory, use the facilities available there, and comply with the governing rules. Then you may know of these truths just as surely, or more surely, than the scientist knows the metals, or the acids, or other elements. It matters little whether one is a plumber, or a banker, or a farmer, for these occupations are secondary; what is most important is what one knows and believes concerning his past and his future and what he does about it.<br><br>When we were spiritual beings, fully organized and able to think and study and understand with him, our Heavenly Father said to us, in effect: "Now, my beloved children, in your spirit state you have progressed about as far as you can. To continue your development, you need physical bodies. I intend to provide a plan whereby you may continue your growth. As you know, one can grow only by overcoming.<br><br>"Now," said the Lord, "we shall take of the elements at hand and organize them into an earth, place thereon vegetation and animal life, and permit you to go down upon it. This will be your proving ground. We shall give you a rich earth, lavishly furnished for your benefit and enjoyment, and we shall see if you will prove true and do the things that are asked of you. I will enter into a contract with you. If you will agree to exercise control over your desires and continue to grow toward perfection and godhood by the plan which I shall provide, I will give to you a physical body of flesh and bones and a rich and productive earth, with sun, water, forests, metals, soils, and all other things necessary to feed and clothe and house you and give to you every enjoyment that is proper and for your good. In addition to this, I will make it possible for you to eventually return to me as you improve your life, overcoming obstacles and approaching perfection."<br><br>To the above most generous offer, we as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father responded with gratitude. We took our turns and came to earth as bodies were prepared by our earthly parents. We are now on trial--on the proving ground. This, also, is an absolute truth. It cannot be disproved. It is an incontrovertible fact. If one can accept these unassailable truths, then he is ready to start his experimentation and his laboratory work.<br><br>A few more salient facts, which I shall not attempt at this moment to elaborate upon: Adam and Eve transgressed a law and were responsible for a change that came to all their posterity, that of mortality. Could it have been the different food which made the change? Somehow blood, the life-giving element in our bodies, replaced the finer substance which coursed through their bodies before. They and we became mortal, subject to illness, pains, and even the physical dissolution called death. But the spirit, which is supreme in the dual man, transcends the body. It does not decompose but proceeds to the spirit world for further experience, with the assurance that after sufficient preparation there a reunion will take place where the spirit will be housed eternally in a remodeled body of flesh and bones. This time the union will never be dissolved, since there will be no blood to disintegrate and cause trouble. A finer substance will give life to the body and will render it immortal.<br><br>This resurrection referred to is the work of Jesus Christ, the Savior, who, because he was both mortal (the son of Mary) and divine (the Son of God), was able to overcome the powers governing the flesh. He actually gave his life and literally took it up again as the "first fruits," to be followed by every soul that has ever lived. Being a god, he gave his life. No one could take it from him. He had developed, through his perfection in overcoming all things, the power to take up his life again. Death was his last enemy, and he overcame even that and established the resurrection. This is an absolute truth. All the theorists in the world cannot disprove it. It is a fact.<br><br>Before his crucifixion, the Savior recognized the absolute necessity for an organization of persons duly empowered to carry on his work, teach his plan to the world, and persuade people to follow the eternal program. He therefore organized his Church among his faithful followers, with apostles, prophets, and other officials to give his people guidance. He sent those officials into all the world to teach his truths--but to teach them without using force, for the basic law of this world is free agency. Certainly men and women may use their free agency to do as they please, but they cannot ever evade the penalties that might come by reason of any error they make.<br><br>The Lord set up his program of organization fully, gave the governing principles and doctrines, and delegated his full authority to his officers to teach and perform ordinances. He ignored all the multitudinous religious organizations then extant and all their manmade doctrines and philosophies and set up his own divine plan. This is true. If all the proponents of the "-isms" on all the continents disbelieve it, it is still true--an absolute truth.<br><br>Even before he went to Calvary, the Lord knew that his young and pitifully small organization could not long resist the wolves of antagonistic philosophies and the terrific persecutions which would come, but he left some stalwart apostles and others to guide and build the kingdom. The Savior knew beyond doubt that an apostasy would come. It did.<br><br>Persecution was intolerable. The apostles are said to have suffered martyrs' deaths. Innumerable others, both priesthood and laity, suffered unbelievable tortures. The Church was uprooted and almost destroyed by physical horrors; then finally, through pagan rulers who were not truly converted, Christianity was accepted and made popular. In order to do so and to get the nations to accept it, pagan superstitions and doctrines were superimposed upon the Christian doctrines and intermingled until the doctrines and ordinances established by the Christ were changed and diluted so that they had only a faint resemblance to the truth. With the authorized servants martyred and both authority and doctrines gone, the world went into a spiritual tailspin and plunged into the Dark Ages, wherein the true understanding of God and his plan was not upon the earth; when gross darkness enveloped the people; when there was little progress even in material things and an almost complete void spiritually.<br><br>This apostasy is a certainty. There is no room for doubt. God's church was lost for the moment, as it had been through many centuries in the past. The true plan of life was placed upon the earth in the beginning when it was given to Adam. After a few generations, the descendants of Adam went the way of the world and most of the earth's children lost the truths and the knowledge of God and of the gospel. One descendant of Adam, Enoch, again established good communications with God and again established truths upon the earth, but only comparatively few of the inhabitants listened and accepted; hence, there was another great apostasy from the truth.<br><br>The people of the world became so wicked that they were literally drowned and washed off the earth. Noah, a righteous prophet, reestablished communication with the Lord and carried on the work of the Lord, but only for a brief period, for weak mortal man permitted the flesh to control the spirit again, and another great apostasy took place and most of the people were without a knowledge and understanding of God.<br><br>Time passed, idolatry prevailed, wickedness increased--but finally the Lord sent a superior spirit to earth, born the son of Terah. Though all on earth were apostate, having turned to the worship of idols and to murder, adultery, drunkenness, bribery, and all manner of evil, this child--Abraham--grew up with sufficient power and goodness to cause the heavens to open again, and God revealed again to him all these truths I am writing about. Abraham spent a glorious life teaching righteousness to his own numerous posterity and to others. As in all other dispensations, the majority went foul, ignored the true way, and followed the way of the world.<br><br>Then the Savior was born in Judea, ushering in another dispensation. He reestablished his truths on the earth--the priesthood, the power, the organization, the knowledge to save and exalt men--but, as stated earlier, this lasted only a few generations and was gone again.<br><br>Now, with the doctrines perverted, the priesthood gone, the organization corrupted, and the knowledge lost, there must come another awakening. And, as the prophet Daniel prophesied millennia ago, there finally came a day when another restoration of truth should come, this time never to be lost. We have that promise now, that even though individuals may fall the Church and the gospel are here to stay, and all the powers of the earth and hell cannot effect total apostasy again. This much-needed restoration came through the Prophet Joseph Smith, who followed in the march of the prophets Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, and the Lord Jesus Christ. And this is the Church organized through revelation by the Savior: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was organized by revelation from Jesus Christ. It was given full and complete authority, full and complete plans and programs.<br><br>This restoration was preceded by a long period of preparation. The Pilgrims and other Europeans were inspired to find this American haven of refuge and thus people this land with honest and God-fearing citizens. Washington and his fellows were inspired to revolt from England and bring political liberty to this land, along with the more valuable treasure of religious liberty so that the soil might be prepared for the seed of the truth when it should again be sown.<br><br>So, in the early nineteenth century, the "marvelous work and a wonder" was reintroduced in to the world. The youthful Prophet, whose mind had not been contaminated with the sins of the world or prejudiced by false philosophies of men, was the instrument of the Restoration. As in all of the other dispensations, and especially the one preceding it when Jesus personally came to restore it, the little seed of truth had to fight a mountain of falsehood. Church organizations made by men, without claim to divinity or revelation, were everywhere in abundance. The corrupted doctrines of former centuries were all there. Religious confusion reigned and most of the world opposed the work bitterly and cried "false prophet" at the first mention of the restored truth. The tiny organization, begun in 1830 with six members, has had phenomenal growth to some four million in that short period. It is here to stay. This Church of Jesus Christ (nicknamed<i>Mormon</i>) is the "only true and living church" that is fully recognized with the authority to perform for him, and the only one with a total and comprehensive and true program which will carry men to powers unbelievable and to realms incredible.<br><br>This is an absolute truth. It cannot be disproved. It is as true and the near-spherical shape of the earth, and as gravity; as true as the shining of the sun--as positive as the truth that we live. Most of the world disbelieves it, ministers attempt to disprove it, intellectuals think to rationalize it out of existence; but when all the people of the world are dead, and ministers and priests are ashes, and the highly trained are mouldering in their graves, the truth will go forward--the Church will continue triumphant and the gospel will still be true.<br><br>The Lord has defined truth as being a "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24). God's existence is a reality. Immortality is a reality. These realities will not go away simply because we have different opinions about them. These realities will not be dissolved just because some have doubts about them.<br><br>Opinion? Of course, there is a difference of opinion but again, opinion cannot change laws or absolute truths. Opinions will never make the earth to be flat, the sun to dim its light, God to die, or the Savior to cease being the Son of God.<br><br>Now, it is a good question which has been asked by millions since Joseph Smith phrased it: How am I to know which of all, if any, of the organizations is authentic, divine, and recognized by the Lord?<br><br>He has given the key. You may<i>know</i>. You need not be in doubt. Follow the prescribed procedures, and you may have an absolute knowledge that these things are absolute truths. The necessary procedure is: study, think, pray, and do. Revelation is the key. God will make it known to you once you have capitulated and have become humble and receptive. Having dropped all pride of your mental stature, having acknowledged before God your confusion, having subjected your egotism, and having surrendered yourself to the teaching of the Holy Spirit, you are ready to begin to learn. With preconceived religious notions stubbornly held, one is not teachable. The Lord has promised repeatedly that he will give you a knowledge of spiritual things when you have placed yourself in a proper frame of mind. He has counseled us to seek, ask, and search diligently. These innumerable promises are epitomized by Moroni in the following: "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). What a promise! How extravagant! How wonderful!<br><br>May I repeat, the time will come when there will be surrender of every person who has ever lived on this earth, who is now living, or who ever will live on this earth; and it will be an unforced surrender, an unconditional surrender. When will it be for you? Today? In twenty years? Two hundred years? Two thousand or a million? When? Again, to you, John, I say, it is not<i>if</i>you will capitulate to the great truth; it is<i>when</i>, for I know that you cannot indefinitely resist the power and pressure of truth. Why not now? Much time has been lost. The years ahead can be far more glorious for you than any years in the past.<br><br>How foolish would be the enslaved Israelite who was born in slavery and had never known anything but slavery to say to himself, "This is life. There is nothing better than this. Here I get my belly full daily and a fair space in which to sleep." How short-sighted he would be to prefer such status when he is told that across the sea and across the desert a promised land awaits where he can be free and well-fed, be master of his own destinies, and have leisure, culture, growth, and all one's heart could rightfully desire. What does it matter? What is the difference between light and darkness--growing and shriveling--a giant and a pygmy--freedom and slavery--eternity and the one day--life and death?<br><br>Now, with great humility, I send this message to you, John, and to all others who may hear it, with a prayer in my heart that you will not cast it aside, but that you will think it through and ponder about it as you pray about it. There must be an open mind, a sincere heart, a desire, a reaching. The assurance will definitely come to you, but not unless you make an effort. I bear testimony to you that this is true. I know it. I send to you a solemn warning; and when you stand before the judgment bar in the not-too-distant future, you will know then that I spoke the truth with your eternal welfare in mind. Please remember that I have tried to bring this matter to your attention with such force that it would impress you. The true and living Church and its members and representatives stand ready to provide answers to any questions; and I promise you faithfully that if you will study and pray, keeping your mind open, you will receive the light, and it will be to you as the dawning of a new day after having gone through the night of darkness.<br><br>Again, I offer the assistance of the Church, but I will not push this matter upon you nor force it. You are mature, you have a good mind, you have a strong background, and the seeds of truth were sown in your life in your youth. All the powers of earth and heaven cannot bring this knowledge to you. It cannot be hoped for nor purchased. It must come by a careful, honest, and sincere investigation. The Church stands ready to furnish such assistance as you may require.<br><br>You cannot cast off this appeal and warning without grave responsibility. You will have to answer to your Creator if you ignore it, just as I would have to answer if I ignored it. I am doing my best to present it. I know that this is the only complete, divine, eternal program which is recognized and approved of God!<br><br>Joseph Smith went into a grove, spent a long time on his knees, and came out with knowledge to the divinity of Elohim and his Son, Jesus Christ--such a firm conviction that he went voluntarily to his martyrdom rather than deny it.<br><br>Paul, on his way to Damascus, saw a glorious personage and heard his voice; and yet, after even these unusual manifestations, Paul prayed so that he could know beyond the shadow of doubt of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and of his Father, and of his eternal program, the gospel. He finally knew it so positively that he gave the balance of his life teaching it. He was stoned nearly to death and raised again. He suffered hunger, thirst, persecutions. And then, knowing full well that his life would be taken, he went gloriously to his death, thus giving not only his energy, time, and earning capacity but his very life for the cause. Paul knew more about the healing and saving truths that were necessary for the welfare of human souls than all of the sages and the doctors of his time or this time. He knew that God lived, Jesus was the Christ, and the gospel was a way of eternal life, mortal and immortal, never ending; he knew that the rewards of eternities were worth the sacrifice of comforts of this life.<br><br>You may know, as did Joseph Smith, Paul, and Peter, and as do a great number of your contemporaries. This is not another church. This is<i>the</i>Church. This is not another gospel or philosophy. This is the church and gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Our Father lives; his Son lives. I am so sure of this that I am willing to bear witness of it with the last effort of my tongue and lips. I am willing to go into eternity and face my God with this testimony on my lips. Of these truths I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W.

<h1>a of Growth and Development - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young brothers and sisters, I consider it an honor to speak to you at this interesting and inspiring Twelve-Stake Fireside. I can truly say that it is always a real pleasure to visit the Brigham Young University campus and partake of the Spirit that is always here. You are choice young people. You are blessed with the blood of Israel; you are blessed with the gospel of Jesus Christ; you are blessed to live in this wonderful country; and you are blessed to be able to attend this great University. Each of us has the capacity to achieve something worthwhile and we should never forget that we are actually spirit children of our Father in heaven and that every person "is given a gift by the Spirit of God" (D&amp;amp;C 46:11).<br><br>Despite the fact that we are living in a troublesome period, we are living in the dispensation of the fulness of times, a most wonderful period in the history of the world--yes a new era of growth and development. Opportunities today, for young and old, exceed those of any other age. We should truly be grateful to live at this particular time when the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the people of the earth so abundantly.<br><br>One of the important and distinguishing features of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that its affairs are administered by the lay members of the Church rather than by a paid clergy. I have been told by some of my nonmember friends that the thing that has impressed them most about the Church is that it gives every person a chance to serve and develop his or her talents, regardless of age. How true this is! The Church, in reality, is a vehicle for the growth and development of God's children. The priesthood quorums, Relief Society, Mutual, Sunday School, Primary, and other church activities and programs all contribute to the development of members' talents and provide opportunities for them to be shared with others. As we develop the spirit of giving and sharing, we find great peace, happiness, joy, and contentment as well as growth and development. May I therefore encourage each one of you to accept with enthusiasm every opportunity presented to you to serve, regarding it not as a burden but as a great blessing. Organize your time by putting first things first, and perform each assignment well. By doing so, you will be magnified and your talents will be increased, as the Lord has said, "yea, even an hundred fold" (D&amp;amp;C 82:18).<br><br>President Kimball has asked us to lengthen our stride in building up the kingdom. Lengthening our stride certainly must include being more effective in our Church responsibilities.<br><br>Utah is known as the Beehive State. The early settlers, under the leadership of Brigham Young, named this area "Deseret," meaning "the honey bee." Therefore, the state motto is "Industry." However, the beehive represents more than industry. It also suggests swarming and making more colonies of bees. This means the gathering of more honey to feed more bees and thus extend more blessings. In the pioneer days of Brigham Young, the swarming of new converts was to the Rocky Mountain area. Although there was only one Brigham Young, all pioneers became a part of the pioneering effort--may I say the swarming program.<br><br>But what about this new era of growth and development? In an address given on July 24, 1977, President Kimball said that "pioneering is the American way." The beehive spirit of industry and swarming is just as applicable today as it was in the days of Brigham Young, but our opportunities today include worldwide swarming--the building of the Church in many parts of the world. Today the new members or colonies are requested to stay in their own lands and swarm there.<br><br>As the leaders of the Church in recent years have emphasized the advisability of building up strong units of the Church throughout the world, many interesting things are happening. The number of full-time missionaries has increased from 17,000 in 1975 to 25,000 today. The number of missions has increased in this same period from 114 to 156. And as a part of today's pioneering program, President Kimball has requested the stakes and missions in various countries of the world to furnish more of their own full-time missionaries. In 1974, outside the United States and Canada, there were approximately 1,200 of these local full-time missionaries, compared to approximately 2,500 today.<br><br>As thousands more of these missionaries are called in many countries throughout the world, they will need financial help. Our assisting them financially is another part of our present pioneering effort. We have the opportunity of making contributions, as quorums and/or individuals, to the Church Missionary Fund; in this way we, in effect, call our bank accounts on a mission. And as these local missionaries return from their missions, many of them will be the leaders of the Church in these scattered areas throughout the world. Yes, satisfying pioneering opportunities are available today as they were 130 years ago. Modern pioneering is a thrilling experience and each of us can be a part of it in one way or another.<br><br>One of the challenges before the Church today is to adapt our programs to worldwide conditions. We must recognize the specific problems in many developing countries and provide special assistance where feasible and appropriate. A few statistics showing some important trends in Church growth, as well as some estimates of future growth patterns, might be of interest to you. In 1976, there were 798 stakes in the Church, and reasonably conservative estimates of growth indicate that by 1990 only fifty-four percent of the membership of the Church will be living in the United States. Latin America and Asia are the areas outside the United States where the Church seems to be growing most rapidly. It is also interesting to note that the average number of convert baptisms per missionary is increasing.<br><br>God's church has always been a missionary church, as we are required by modern revelation to take the restored gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people (see D&amp;amp;C 133:37). We have also been told that<br><br><i>there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 123:12]<br><br>We invite those who are seeking truth and a better way of life, wherever they may live, to sincerely investigate our message. It will answer the questions: What is the purpose of life? Where did we come from? And what is there after death?<br><br>The question is often asked, "How can we, a relatively small group, take the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people?" Certainly not with the 25,000 full-time missionaries and thousands of stake missionaries we now have, regardless of how good they are. But our latter-day prophets have given us the "every member a missionary" plan and, in my opinion, we are now pioneering in this vital technique. I would like to talk to you about the "every member a missionary" program--an inspired, effective, and interesting plan.<br><br>First, missionary work includes three things: finding people to teach, teaching them the gospel principles, and fellowshipping them. All of us can participate in finding people to teach and in fellowshipping them, but the teaching is primarily the responsibility of the full-time and stake teaching missionaries. Today, missionaries spend much of their time in finding interested people to teach and a relatively small part of their time in teaching. With the "every member a missionary" plan, the members have an opportunity to do missionary work by finding and fellowshipping interested persons while the missionaries teach them. This greatly increases the effectiveness of the missionaries. They can teach many more people, particularly as they are taught in groups.<br><br>In working with missionaries throughout the world, I find that the great increase in convert baptisms, and especially baptisms of entire families, is to a considerable extent attributable to the fact that a greater number of members are finding and fellowshipping persons for the missionaries to teach. The members are loving it. This is certainly a way we can lengthen our stride. I have had the opportunity of meeting many of these wonderful members and hearing of their exciting and happy experiences. I am confident that there are thousands of members of the Church that have a sincere desire to do missionary work, but do not know how to do it. How, then, can a member, regardless of age or sex, become an effective missionary within the meaning of the prophet's admonition, "Every member a missionary"?<br><br>You ask, "What can I do?" Well, you can find such persons who would like to know more about the Church. "But how can I find such persons?" The following three ways are pretty much the basis of the "every member a missionary" program. First, live the gospel principles. Thousands join the Church each year as they are attracted to the Church by the life of a good member.<br><br>Second, it is easy to begin a gospel conversation by asking your friends and neighbors and people whom you meet as you go about your affairs what they know about the Church. Whether they know little or much, you can follow with another question: "Would you like to know more?" If they would like to know more, invite them into your home to be taught the gospel by the missionaries. If it is impossible to invite them into your home, give their names to the missionaries to follow up. Many of these referrals can give the missionaries the names of other interested persons, and this can go on indefinitely as it is pursued. Let me read you a letter I received from a sister in the Northwest:<br><br><i>Dear President Richards:</i><br><br><i>Ever since I joined the Church three and a half years ago, I have wished that all my friends and relatives had the same opportunity to investigate the gospel and I have decided it's time that I asked to have the missionaries sent to my relatives. Most of them seem interested and curious about our Church since my brother and I joined it, so I am hoping and praying that they will recognize the truth when they hear it. It certainly leads to the happiest way of life, and I know I could have avoided pitfalls if I had only found it sooner. It's wonderful to have the true gospel to guide your children through their live, and so dangerous to try and raise them without it.</i><br><br>Then she listed the names and addresses of twenty-five friends and relatives, saying that she would appreciate very much having the missionaries call on these twenty-five people and that she would be praying that they would be as happy to receive the gospel message as she had been. This certainly is the "every member a missionary" program in action.<br><br>Sister Richards and I ask the Golden Questions frequently. We find many people who say, "Yes, I would like to know more," and we arrange for the missionaries to teach them; some of them have been baptized, bringing great happiness into our lives. Like Alma of old,<br><br><i>I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.</i>[Alma 29:9]<br><br>In asking members throughout the world to ask the Golden Questions, at times I have sensed a feeling of skepticism and fear on their part; but frequently, afterwards, members have written me saying that although they were doubtful at first they tried asking the questions and were happily surprised to find many saying, "Yes, we would like to know more." The opportunity will present itself to you from day to day if you are thinking about it. So I suggest you try it with faith in your heart and a smile on your face. I promise you that you will be happily surprised.<br><br>One of the most powerful forces in the Church is and always has been its youth. They love their friends and are not afraid to ask them the Golden Questions. A young man from Charlottesville, Virginia, was baptized; he went home and said to his grandmother, "Grandma, you ought to be baptized."<br><br>"I have been baptized in the Baptist church," she said.<br><br>"Yes, but Grandma, you haven't been baptized into the true church."<br><br>She said, "Maybe I haven't--who told you this?" The Mormon elders, he told her. She said, "Send them to me." He did and his grandmother was taught the gospel and baptized.<br><br>While attending a stake conference in California, I was told that one of the wards had a project of gathering newspapers and that a young man, while collecting papers from the neighbors, had asked the Golden Questions. Two families said they would like to know more about the Church and were later taught by the missionaries, fellowshipped, and baptized.<br><br>In another stake conference that I attended in California, a great deal of interest and enthusiasm was shown in the "every member a missionary" program. After the morning session, a young woman came up to me, introduced herself, and presented her friend, saying, "She is mine." Both of their faces reflected great joy and happiness. Then she explained that she had asked her friend the Golden Questions and her friend had replied that she was interested and would like to know more about the Church. The woman had then arranged for the missionaries to come to her home and teach her friend the beautiful truths of the gospel as contained in the discussions. Her friend had prayed, studied, and attended church to further her understanding. She soon gained a testimony and was baptized. No wonder that this good sister felt so much joy as she put her arm around her friend and said, "She is mine."<br><br>In Salt Lake City, a stake missionary, while eating lunch at a counter, met a young tourist. He asked him what he knew about the Mormon church and whether he would like to know more; the young tourist said he would like to know more. During the next few days the stake missionaries gave him the discussions. At a later time, he was baptized as a result of this. And incidentally, the Utah Mission is one of the leading missions of the Church insofar as convert baptisms per missionary is concerned.<br><br>About a year ago, I was in Toronto, Canada, attending a stake conference and while there spoke to the missionaries and suggested that they ask the Golden Questions at every opportunity. Later, the mission president sent me a copy of a letter he had received from one of his lady missionaries. The sister wrote:<br><br><i>When we first arrived in Kirkland Lake, our first assignment, we went to the grocery store; and as the young woman was checking our groceries, I could see her straining to read my name tag. I told her what it was and felt impressed to ask her the Golden Questions. So I said, "What do you know about the Mormons?"</i><br><br><i>She said, "Not much really." In reply to the second part, "Would you like to know more about them?" she said "Yes, as a matter of fact, I would." To make a long story short, she, her husband, her husband's brother, and his wife were baptized four months later, the delay being due to her husband's being away for two months.</i><br><br><i>Six weeks later, another dear sister was baptized as a result of this one Golden Question. Two weeks after that the couple across the street were baptized. Two weeks, still later, the Guild brothers baptized their mother, stepfather, and little sister in Toronto. The mother of Wendy, the girl I met in the grocery store, is now attending all meetings and wants to be taught the discussions. There are also three small children who will now be brought up in the Church, making a total of thirteen now in the Church, and one soon to be baptized, I feel sure, as a result of asking the Golden Questions to this one person.</i><br><br>Yes, by asking the Golden Questions, you can truly lengthen your stride as President Kimball has asked us to do.<br><br>The third way of finding interested persons is by taking your friends and neighbors to church meetings and socials with you. I remember that in one branch the Relief Society needed an organist, so the president asked a nonmember friend to help them out. She replied that she would be glad to; and as she was being fellowshipped she became interested, was taught the gospel by the missionaries, and was baptized. In this same area, a young girl was walking home with a friend and began humming "Come, Come, Ye Saints." Her friend said, "My, that's a beautiful melody. What is it?" The girl told her about it and made a date to take her to a church service. After attending a few times, she arranged for the missionaries to teach her family. The family members have all been baptized and are happy doing their part in building the kingdom.<br><br>In a Las Vegas, Nevada, stake, I listened to a convert tell her story. She related how she and her family had moved to Las Vegas from Oklahoma. They moved two doors from a Mormon family, and shortly thereafter their young daughter was invited to go to Primary by the neighbor's daughter. She enjoyed relating her Primary lessons to her parents. About that time, the parents felt the need of religion in their home. The mother had been raised a Baptist so they attended the Baptist church, but they did not seem to enjoy it. The next Sunday, the parents were discussing which church they would attend. The young daughter suggested, "Why don't you go to my church?"--meaning where she had been attending Primary. The parents accepted the suggestion, went to the Mormon church, found what they were looking for, and later were baptized. This to me is a beautiful example of "every member a missionary" in action.<br><br>In the<i>Church News</i>of August 6, 1977, there was an article entitled, "Idaho Falls Young Adults Bring in Converts." Let me read you a few excerpts from this article.<br><br><i>Dan Kinsey had had the missionary discussions but still wasn't sure about joining the Church. Then he met the Young Adults of the Idaho Falls Idaho North stake and the decision was simple. He joined.</i><br><br><i>Clint Keeler, stake Young Adult chairman, says the program is successful because it is designed to reach the non-member as well as the member Young Adult.</i><br><br><i>These Young Adults not only invite their nonmember friends, but they also work closely with the full-time missionaries, keeping them informed of activities and helping them fellowship their Young Adult contacts.</i><br><br><i>There have also been some unique fund-raising projects, like a dog wash instead of a car wash and the auction of handmade crafts and services to send funds to a Korean orphanage.</i><br><br><i>An authentic Greek dinner, Saturday morning breakfast while watching cartoons, and eating spaghetti with hands tied behind the back have all been enjoyed by these Young Adults at their weekly gatherings.</i><br><br><i>The program not only has been beneficial to prospective members, but has drawn some reluctant Young Adult members into activity.</i><br><br>The incidents I have related are typical of the "every member a missionary" program in action, and such incidents are happening in the stakes and missions throughout the world every day.<br><br>Another fruitful missionary field is part-member families. Some of your friends who are members may have married nonmembers; you can help in fellowshipping these nonmembers. Have the missionaries teach them the missionary discussions and then, when they have studied, prayed, and attended Church and have received a testimony, you will have played a part in bringing them into the Church through the waters of baptism. A high percentage of prospective elders have married nonmembers, and by teaching and fellowshipping these nonmember wives with their husbands present many of the women can be baptized and their husbands prepared for the Melchizedek Priesthood. Where possible, these part-member families should be taught in compatible groups. By being taught in groups the strong can strengthen the weaker ones, and more convert baptisms result with less time and effort.<br><br>Many ask, "Are the converts staying in the Church and remaining active?" Yes, where fellowshipping is effective, generally a high percentage of the converts remain active. Fellowshipping, however, includes loving converts into the Church and giving them work assignments. It is not unusual to hear converts say, "It's a great feeling to be needed." I heard Brother Robert Giles, a convert in Las Vegas, Nevada, so testify. It is recommended that each new convert be given a position in the Church; and, in my opinion, many of these new converts would make excellent stake missionaries. These new members are like the saints of old when the apostle Paul wrote to the Ephesian saints, "Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Ephesians 2:19).<br><br>Let us "remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God." And as the Lord has said,<br><br><i>If it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!</i><br><br><i>And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10, 15–16]<br><br>But let us remember what President Brigham Young so ably stated on one occasion, that "no blessing . . . sealed upon us will do us any good, unless we live for it" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>11:117).<br><br>Yes, my brothers and sisters, the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon all flesh, and men's hearts are being softened. One branch president asked me, "How long will this missionary explosion go on in the Church?" The answer is found in the 65th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse two.<br><br><i>The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.</i><br><br>We are living in a new era of growth and development and today we are pioneering on a worldwide basis. The Church is growing at an accelerated rate, and isn't it wonderful that we can all participate in these modern pioneering experiences? Again, you ask, "How can we participate?" First, by making the "every member a missionary" program a part of our lives within the meaning of the prophet's admonition. Second, President Kimball has asked for many more thousands of stake and full-time missionaries at home and abroad. We need more young men, more lady missionaries, and more couples. Let us do what we can to accomplish this objective. Third, thousands of these new missionaries called from developing countries will need financial help. Let us make regular contributions to the missionary fund, either at the ward-stake level or by sending contributions to Church headquarters. You will find additional ways of pioneering as you become a part of the "every member a missionary" program. May we catch the vision of nearly four million member-missionaries bringing souls into the kingdom of God and feeling the joy and happiness that comes from this great work in this new era of growth and development.<br><br>And again, to all seekers of truth: a new life-style awaits those that accept the restored gospel and let it work in their lives. They will find the answer to their question: What is the purpose of life? We encourage seekers of truth to investigate Mormonism--The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, and I thrill when I testify to the truthfulness of that great vision--the first vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I appreciate the wonderful things that the Prophet Joseph Smith did; he was an instrument in the hands of the Lord in restoring the gospel, the priesthood, and the Church to the earth in this dispensation. I, like you, love and sustain our great prophet and leader, President Spencer W. Kimball; and I know and testify that he is indeed the prophet of the Lord and the head of the church of Jesus Christ on this earth today. Let us lengthen our stride and increase our effectiveness in our church work in order that the kingdom of God may go forth at an accelerated rate, so that the kingdom of heaven may come, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Franklin D. Richards was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 25 September 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> Crammed with Heaven”: Reminiscences - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I greet all of you wonderful students and your teachers here this morning and tell you how proud I am of all of you and of this great institution and of your desire to be here for what this institution can offer to you. I appreciate the music and I appreciate that lovely prayer by Brother Ricks; I need it badly. So I pray the Lord will bless me while I stand here this morning.<br><br>In trying to think what I might say to you that would be of most interest, I decided that I would not preach doctrine to you. (I could do that--if you do not believe it, read<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>and<i>Israel! Do You Know?</i>) I imagine that I might be the oldest person here this morning (there could be others, but I doubt that), so I figure that I have seen more things during my period of mortality than any of you have. You know that it is a habit of old people to reminisce--I thought that first I would tell you a few things out of ancient history; and then, with all these missionaries over here, I might end up with some missionary stories.<br><br>First, you have already been told by President Oaks that I am the oldest living General Authority. I want to tell you that I have known all of the General Authorities of this Church since the days of Wilford Woodruff, and I think I have heard all these Brethren preach. That is a good many General Authorities when you count all the members of the Twelve that there have been, and all the presidents of the Church. My father raised us in the country, out in Tooele, and there never passed a conference after we were old enough to sit still when he did not bring his boys--three of us--in to attend the general conferences. Of course, we did not have automobiles in those days, nor paved roads; but with the old white-top and our team we would drive in. My father wanted his boys to know all of the General Authorities of the Church, so he wanted us to attend all the conferences so we could hear them speak.<br><br>I was in the Salt Lake Tabernacle when Wilford Woodruff delivered what I think was the last talk he gave before he died, that in which he told how marvelously the Spirit of the Lord had guided and directed him through the years of his life. It has been over eighty years ago, but I can remember to this day some of the things that he spoke in that conference. I am going to mention a couple of them; you have heard them, but I heard<i>him</i>give them.<br><br>While he was traveling with his wife in the South, once in the middle of the night the Spirit said, "Get up and move your team and wagon." He got up out of his wagon and moved his team from where it was tied to an oak--then along came a twister and picked that oak up and threw it right where his wagon had been standing. That oak had stood a hundred years, and yet while he was in his wagon that night a twister came and picked it up. And I can hear Brother Woodruff saying, "If I hadn't listened to the Spirit of the Lord, it might have cost us our lives." Then he told, in that same conference, about bringing a group of converts from Great Britain. They landed down in New Orleans and he was negotiating with a captain there to take them up the river to St. Louis, where they had arranged to cross the plains to these valleys of the mountains. And, he said, while he was negotiating, something said, "Don't go on that boat, neither you nor your people." So he thanked the captain and they did not embark. That boat had no more than sailed up the river when it caught fire and burned, and not a soul on it was saved. And I can hear President Woodruff as he stood there, all these eighty years ago, saying, "If I hadn't listened to the promptings of the spirit of the Lord, we wouldn't have had Brother So-and-so [naming one of the good Brethren] and Brother So-and-so"--another of the good Brethren who was with him in that group he brought from Europe.<br><br>Well, there are things one never forgets. There are impressions in my youth that have remained with me from that time to the present. My grandmother was the wife of Dr. Willard Richards who was in Carthage Jail with the Prophet--you may have heard this story--and at that time the Prophet turned to Dr. Richards and said, "If we go into the cell, will you go in with us?" And Willard said, "Brother Joseph, you did not ask me to cross the river with you--you did not ask me to come to Carthage--you did not ask me to come to jail with you. . . . But I will tell you what I will do; if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead. . . ." But the Prophet said, "You cannot." (<i>History of the Church</i>6:616). I have a copy of a letter that the Prophet wrote in which he said that he had found a man who could be trusted in all things, and that man was Dr. Willard Richards.<br><br>When I came home from my first mission in 1908 my grandmother was still alive, and when I visited with her I said, "Grandma, tell me about the Prophet Joseph." And she told me what a wonderful man he was and how the people loved him and how he loved them; she told me how he used to take little children on his lap and sing to them and tell them stories; and then she told me about being in the meeting when Sidney Rigdon claimed that he ought to succeed the Prophet. She said, "When Brigham Young stood up he looked like the Prophet Joseph, he sounded like the Prophet Joseph, and we all knew who the Lord wanted to succeed the Prophet as the President of the Church." These are experiences of the past that have meant much to me in my life (even though I don't know what to say next).<br><br>Now I will skip to 1906 when my father was called to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. There were three men appointed in that same conference, in this order: George F. Richards (my father), Orson F. Whitney, and David O. McKay. I was at that time serving as the secretary of the Netherlands Mission, and just a few days before that conference was held, I received a letter from my father that read like this: "My son, I had a remarkable dream last night. I dreamed that the Savior came and took me in his arms, and as I found me in my Master's embrace, the love that filled my heart can't be compared with the love that a man feels for a woman. I feel the meaning of the words of the song, 'I Need Thee Every Hour.'"<br><br>Then, just two or three days after I received that letter, a cablegram came to our office, the mission headquarters. It was addressed to President Grant, who was then president of the European Mission, and he was up in Berlin. We used to open the telegrams to see if they were important enough to try to relay. As for this telegram, I can quote you the exact words. It read this way: "Cowley and Taylor deposed. Richards, Whitney, and McKay appointed." When I read that, I figured that the dream my father had just had, of which I had just received word in that letter, was to let him know that he was being called by revelation.<br><br>President Grant was due in Rotterdam the next morning so I went to the station to meet him. I handed him the telegram--I had sealed it up again–and he opened and read it, and he said, "Well, well. Cowley and Taylor deposed. Richards, Whitney, and McKay appointed." Then he said, "I wonder who this Richards could be." I could have told him but I waited for him to tell me. "There's your father, your uncle Charlie, your uncle Franklin"--and then he said, "I guess it's your daddy; Brother Lyman thinks he's the salt of the earth." Well, these are experiences that one does not usually forget. (Let's see what I want to tell you next.)<br><br>Out in the little country town where I was raised we used to have Sunday School conferences; I do not know whether we have them anymore. But I can remember a conference held there about eighty years ago when the visiting brethren from the Sunday School General Board were Brother Karl G. Maeser and brother George Goddard. I thought I would mention that because of the fact that Brother Karl G. Maeser was the man who organized this institution under the direction of President Brigham Young. I cannot remember to this day what Brother Maeser preached about in that conference, but I can remember old Brother George Goddard with his great singing voice and long beard, and I can remember the songs he taught us to sing in that conference. The first one--I do not think it is in the hymnbook anymore--went like this: "Take away the whiskey, the coffee, and the tea, cold water is the drink for me," and then it repeats and goes on. That made such an impression upon me as a boy that I can hardly drink anything but cold water. I was traveling on the train headed for Los Angeles a few years back, and I went into the diner for breakfast and the waiter said, "Are you ready for your coffee?"<br><br>"No, thank you."<br><br>"Would you like a glass of milk?"<br><br>"No, thank you."<br><br>"What do you want to drink?"<br><br>I said, "A glass of cold water, please."<br><br>He said, "You're the funniest man I ever did see."<br><br>The next song that Brother Goddard taught us to sing in that Sunday School conference (that was when I did not know that I could not sing, so I tried to sing with them) is still in the hymnbook. It goes like this: "Who's on the Lord's side? Who? Now is the time to show; We ask it fearlessly: Who's on the Lord's side? Who?" (<i>Hymns,</i>no. 175). And, brothers and sisters, right there as a boy I resolved, the Lord being my help, that I'd try to be on his side as long as I lived.<br><br>I was up in Wyoming some years ago talking in a conference of the young people, and between the morning and the afternoon meetings--we used to hold an afternoon meeting then--a little fellow about six or eight years old came up and, looking up into my face, asked, "Bishop, could I shake your hand?"<br><br>I said, "I can't think of anything I'd rather do than shake yours."<br><br>And while we were shaking on it, he looked up into my face, and he said, "Bishop, my bishop will never need to worry about losing me." I could have hugged the little fellow. Isn't it wonderful to think that this little boy, in his youth, had resolved that he would be on the Lord's side all the days of his life? Well, these are great experiences. (Let's see what else I want to tell you.)<br><br>Now I think I'll skip over some of my missionary experiences. This one might interest you. While I was laboring as a district president in Amsterdam on my first mission, my companion and I were invited to the home of one of the Saints. She wanted to invite her neighbor in and wanted us to come and teach her the gospel. When we arrived, the neighbor was there, but she had brought her minister along with her to make sure that we told her the right things. Well, the minister and I had a little difference of opinion on the subject of priesthood and right there he challenged me to a debate in his church. In those days we were not advised not to debate, and so I accepted the challenge--I was young and had plenty of fight in me.<br><br>When we arrived at his church a week from Saturday night, the church was full; all of his people were there, and all of our people. How our people had found out about it I do not know. I had not told them. I think he had spread the word around, thinking to show us up. But at any rate, he stood up and said, "Inasmuch as Mister Richards is a guest in our church we'll accord him the privilege of opening the debate, and we'll each talk for twenty minutes and continue as long as it's mutually agreeable." He asked, "Is that agreeable to you, Mister Richards?"<br><br>And I said, "Very much." I did not tell him that I would have given him the shirt off my back for the privilege of opening that debate, and he had just handed it to me on a silver platter. I did not know whether the Lord had anything to do with that or not, but I thought he did.<br><br>I stood up and said, "The last time I talked to my friend, we had a difference of opinion in regard to the principle of the priesthood. I've come tonight prepared to discuss that subject, but I do not propose to start with that subject." This is a device that has helped me in my work: I said, "If you were going to build a house, you wouldn't try to put the roof on it before you got the foundation in, would you? Because if the foundation were faulty the house would tumble anyway so what good would the house be? I propose to open this debate tonight by laying the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I choose for my text the sixth chapter of Hebrews, where Paul said,<br><br><i>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</i><br><br><i>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</i>[Hebrews 6:1–2]<br><br>I hurried over faith and repentance; I assumed that they believed that. I preached baptism by immersion for the remission of sins until everybody in the audience was giving me accord. Then it came to the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and they did not believe that. They thought the Holy Ghost just came, like the breezes that blow from the heavens.<br><br>I reminded them that when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God through the preaching of Philip they sent Peter and John. When these apostles arrived, they prayed for the people, then laid their hands upon them, and the people received the Holy Ghost. When Simon the sorcerer saw that the Holy Ghost was conveyed by the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, "Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost." And Peter said, "Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gifts of God may be purchased with money" (see Acts 8:14–20). Then I gave two or three other references on laying on of hands and I sat down.<br><br>The minister stood up. He never mentioned a word I had said. He started expounding on a few of the bad things that our enemies had said against us and then said, in the most courteous manner, "Now, if Mister Richards will enlighten us on these matters I'm sure this audience will be most appreciative."<br><br>I was on my feet just like that. (My companion later asked how I could think so fast; I responded, "What have you been praying for all week long?") I stood up and said, "In the days of the Savior his enemies tried to trick him with cunning and craftiness. I don't suppose there's anyone here today who'd like to see us resort to those old tactics. If I understand a debate, it's a presentation and answering of arguments. Has this man answered any of my arguments?" All shook their heads negatively. "All right, my friend," I said, "you may have your twenty minutes over again."<br><br>He would not do it. I knew he could not. His wife, who was in the audience, stood up and said, "What Mister Richards is asking is fair. You ought to answer him." And even then he would not do it.<br><br>I said to my companions, "Stand up. Give me my coat and hat." (It was winter.) "One more chance," I announced. "I am willing to remain here till ten o'clock tomorrow morning, when I have to be in my own church, provided this debate can go forward on the basis that you have set up. If not, I am going to leave and ask my companion to leave and ask our people to leave, and I shall leave it with you to settle with your people for what has happened here today." And still he would not do it. So we all walked out on him. I met him on the street time and time again after that and he would duck his head so that he would not have to speak to me. Well, that is one of my little experiences there. (Let's see what else I want here.)<br><br>Now I'll tell you one of a little more recent vintage. A year ago last June, I was asked to accompany the presidency to Denver to hold a solemn assembly, and after that we went down to Farmington, New Mexico, to hold a solemn assembly there. As we were headed back to Denver to return from there, our plane landed at Alamosa with something wrong. The captain announced that we would not take off until some repair parts were shipped in from Denver, and we could either stay in the plane or go into the airport. We chose to stay. The First Presidency sat right in the front of the plane, I sat next to them, and Brother Neal Maxwell sat on the other side with one of the Regional Representatives of the Twelve, Brother Patterson. Then the captain came out of his cockpit, and since he knew we were all Mormons he said something about it. Brother Tanner of the First Presidency spoke up and said, "You better not let LeGrand start on him" (I'm LeGrand, you see.) That opened the door. And so I started on him.<br><br>"Captain, I can tell you two reasons why you could not be anything but a Latter-day Saint if you would just use your thinker and if you are willing to believe in the words of the holy prophets and the Savior of the world." So I told him what those two things were. They are in the fore part of<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>that I wrote. The first was this: One of our broadcasters, Edmund C. Hill, was asked what message could be broadcast to the world that would be of greater importance than any other message, and after considering the matter he decided that to be able to say to the world that a man who had lived upon this earth had returned again with a message from God would be the greatest message that could be broadcast. I said, "The Latter-day Saints are the only ones that claim such a visit, not only of one man, but many of the holy prophets, and we built a monument back in New York to the honor of one of those men who returned again with a message from God. That was Moroni."<br><br>The other point was the statement of a Catholic prelate who visited in Salt Lake. Brother Orson F. Whitney told about his visit--he said he could speak a dozen different languages and knew all about science and religion. The prelate's comment was this:<br><br><i>You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don't even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. . . . If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that's all there is to it. The Protestants haven't a leg to stand on. For, if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they . . . went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago.</i>[quoted in LeGrand Richards,<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,</i>p. 3]<br><br>That is a good statement--anybody who stops to analyze it would find it as fine a definite statement of fact as can be spoken. That is why I quoted it to that captain.<br><br>The prelate went on to say, "If we have the continuation of the gospel from the days of the Savior, there was no need of such a man as Joseph Smith; but if we have not that continuation then such a man as Joseph Smith is necessary." I always add that the Catholic church and the Bible cannot both be right because the Bible definitely declare an apostasy and a restoration in the later days; that leaves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with the only right in the world to claim to be the true church of Jesus Christ. (I still have a few minutes. Why don't you kick me on the heel if I start going too long?)<br><br>Coming back to Dr. Hart: that talk, instead of lasting just a few minutes, lasted for two hours. He had studied for the ministry and then decided to become a pilot instead of a minister. He asked, "What if I don't join your Church in this life?"<br><br>"Oh," I said, "that's all right. We'll just let you sleep in the dirt for five hundred years, a half of a thousand, and we'll come and preach it to you in the spirit world." And when I parted with him I told him I would send him a copy of<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,</i>the missionary book, if he would promise to read it, and he said he would. So he gave me his name and address, and I said, "The next time I meet you, you'll be an elder in the Mormon church."<br><br>The little stewardess was sitting right next to us, and I said, "How do you feel about spiritual things?"<br><br>"Well," she said, "I was raised a Catholic but I don't feel satisfied with my church."<br><br>I asked, "Would you like me to send you one of these books?" She said she would and wrote down her name and address.<br><br>Then one of the passengers sitting in the back of the compartment came up and asked, "Could I get one of those books?"<br><br>And I said, "You surely could." So he gave me his name and address.<br><br>Later, when we landed in Denver, another man came up, saw me hobbling with my cane, and inquired, "Where did you get that cane?"<br><br>I said, "I know where I got it, but I can't tell you the address or the name of the company. If you will give me your name and your address I'll write you from Salt Lake and tell you." Then, when he began to leave, I said, "Well, you don't get off that easy. I'm a Mormon elder, and I want to tell you what we believe. If you will just read the book I'm going to send you, you will want to join the Church."<br><br>Well, to make the story short, I sent the names to the mission president. He sent the missionaries to them, but the pilot would not let them give any lessons; he said, "All I need is this<i>Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>and the Book of Mormon." So just before last June 1, he called me from over in Littleton, Colorado, where he lives, and told me he had set his baptismal date for the first day of June. Last week I received a letter from him, and in this letter--I am going to take time to read just one paragraph of it to show you what it means to call people out of darkness to the Lord's true light. Like Peter said of the Church of his day, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people." Why? "That you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9). This is the one paragraph:<br><br><i>The happiness I've experienced in my heart and soul since joining the Church is indescribable. I feel that meeting I had with you and President Kimball really set things into motion for me. Prior to that I had just been spinning my wheels and searching. Now I know that through the discovery of the restored truth of our Lord my life has meaning and direction. I want to work for him and do his will.</i><br><br>Then he went on to tell me that he had just baptized one of his daughters, that four of his family are attending our Church with him--his wife and two older daughters have not yet capitulated, but he said he would get them--and then, in the last paragraph, he asked if I would ordain him an elder next May. I suppose he had talked with the stake president, and the stake president had indicated that by May he would be ready to be an elder; and, you know, these pilots can probably fly anywhere for nothing. He said he would come to Salt Lake. So I wrote him back and told him that if he would bring a letter of recommendation from his stake president I would be glad to ordain him.<br><br>All many people need is to have someone lay things out for them so that they can understand them. I have another little story to illustrate what I mean. I toured the Colorado Mission with Brother Hinckley, a former stake president who lives here in Provo. We were holding a meeting over in Nebraska and the leader of the Reorganized church in that particular locality honored us with his presence in the meeting, and I went up to him afterward. He seemed very interested, and I said, "You have so much to be grateful for. You have the Prophet Joseph, and you have the Book of Mormon, but you only have about half of what the Prophet Joseph taught. Wouldn't you like to know all about it? You have half a pie; we have the whole pie. I have written a book. If you will agree to read it, I'll send it to you."<br><br>A few weeks after that I received a letter back from him in which he thanked me for the book. He said, "I read it, and last Saturday my brother and I were both baptized members of your Church. Now I have sent the book to one of my friends over in Independence, one of the leaders of the Reorganized church, and asked him if he would read it." If we will just take time to tell them what we have, we do not need to worry about their joining the Church. (Let's see what else I want to tell you.)<br><br>Just a few years ago we converted a Reverend Cooke from up in the northwest--the state of Washington. He wrote a letter to my brother, who was then president of the Northwestern States mission, in which he said, "I have always thought that I had as much authority as any man to administer the ordinances of the gospel--until I met the Mormon elders. Now I have come to feel that I must accept baptism at their hands." Then, after he was baptized, he came down to Salt Lake and to my office and said this: "When I joined the Church I did not feel I could say that I knew that Joseph Smith was a prophet, but I believed that he was. But when Brother Burroughs [and I know Brother Burroughs up there] laid his hands on my head and ordained me to the priesthood I felt something go through me like I never had felt before in all my life, and I knew that no man could do that for me. It must have come from the Lord." Then he continued, "When I think of how little I had to offer my people as a Methodist minister compared with what I now have in the fulness of the gospel as it has been restored I want to go back and tell my friends what I have found. Now they won't listen to me; I am an apostate from their church." But he had given up his ministry (and that is an honorable calling) to run the elevator in our state capitol building so that he could join the Church. Through the window in my office he pointed to the temple and said, "I can't wait until I can go there with my wife. I want to be sure I have her forever." That is what it is when people really love truth and are called out of darkness, as Peter said, unto the Lord's true light.<br><br>While I was president of a stake in California we converted a very prominent attorney, and in one of our stake conferences I asked him if he would like to tell the people what he found in Mormonism that appealed to him. He had a deep, rich voice that just penetrated a person; he stood up and said, "If you have hunted for something all your life until you have nearly decided that it does not exist, and then you just happen to stumble onto it, you do not need anybody to tell you what you have found, do you? That is what I did when I found Mormonism." And he added, "The most beautiful thing about it to me is that the more I learn about it the more wonderful it becomes." I have since had the privilege of setting his son apart to go on his mission. I feel such a close contact with that family that when that son wanted to marry down in the Los Angeles Temple I consented to go down and perform the marriage for him at his request. I do not usually do that away from Salt Lake.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the gospel is true. We now have one of our greatest leaders that I have known, and I have known them intimately from President Joseph F. Smith through Heber J. Grant, George Albert Smith, David O. McKay, and Joseph Fielding Smith to Harold B. Lee--and now we have Spencer W. Kimball. I was thrilled with Brother Grant Bangerter's talk at the conference where he indicated, "We thought we couldn't get along without Brother Lee. He was a great man and a great leader, but look what we've got today" (see<i>Ensign</i>, November 1977, pp. 26–27). God bless that noble man. It is a miracle that he is able to do what he is doing, considering the trials he has had through the years of his life.<br><br>Now, I see, it is time to close. I know this is God's eternal truth. My, how happy I am to be a member of his Church, to bear the name of Christ the Lord! I have just been reading the New Testament again; what miracles he performed, and yet all around us are miracles every day that just thrill me. As Elizabeth Barrett Browning said (and I've quoted her before):<br><br><i>Earth's crammed with heaven,</i><br><i>And every common bush afire with God;</i><br><i>But only he who sees takes off his shoes;</i><br><i>The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries.</i><br>[Aurora Leigh, bk. 7]<br><br>God help us to take off our shoes and be true to the faith, I pray, and leave you my blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 October 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ng Inferior - Paul H. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a glorious sight! I welled up with pride as President Oaks brought to our attention the accomplishments of these great performing groups of athletes at this University. I have just returned from a tour of the South, where it was my privilege to be on two other university campuses, and the contrast here is terrific. Congratulations.<br><br>As I listened to President Oaks this morning, I could not help but think of an experience that occurred in my life a few years ago at the University of Southern California. I was the institute director there, and because of my close association with the school I was asked by the First Presidency to be the Latter-day Saint representative at a PTA congress that was being sponsored on campus. A number of great educators from throughout the United States were invited to participate also.<br><br>On the appointed day I attended an informal luncheon that the administration was putting on for the participants. I noticed that I was to be seated next to a full navy commander who had been one of the leaders in developing the testing program for the United States Navy. There were the usual place cards, and as we took our seats the navy commander turned to me and inquired, "Mr. Dunn, you're the Latter-day Saint, aren't you?"<br><br>I checked to see what was showing and I asked, "Well, yes, but how did you know?"<br><br>He said, "As we sat down, I noticed you weren't going to partake of that liquid." I had turned my coffee cup over.<br><br>"Well, that's right," I said, "but I know a lot of people who aren't of my faith that don't partake of that particular liquid. Why would that tell you?"<br><br>"Oh," he explained, "it's the way you turned your cup over. You have that Mormon twist in your wrist."<br><br>I immediately started to defend our position--as we all do once in a while--and he said, "Look, I didn't inquire to get a defense of your position. I'd like to take this opportunity, sir, to salute you. May I do that?"<br><br>Well, a full navy commander wanting to salute a PFC? I was not about to stop him. I said, "Please, sir, go ahead."<br><br>He said, "I don't mean you personally. I'd like to take this opportunity to salute your church, the group you represent here this morning."<br><br>I was interested. "Why would you single us out?"<br><br>He replied, "Mr. Dunn, in my official position I have an opportunity to travel throughout the whole of the earth and I watch people very, very carefully and I like what I see about your organization. I am convinced, sir, that the time will come when this country, this world, will look to you people for spiritual direction."<br><br>"Thank you, sir." The thrill went up and down my spine and I was grateful to be one of you. And I thank God this morning for the kind of example these great performers and athletes and you Latter-day Saints represent to the earth. God bless you.<br><br>It is not often that I get to travel with my wife. I am delighted to have her here. She is very special, as partners are. I hope she knows that. I am often reminded, however, of the experience a fellow had one time with his wife. It seems one morning he was backing his car out of the garage and it stalled. He got out, raised the hood, tinkered around trying to find the problem, and discovered a loose connection. It would require the help of another party, so he called his wife out. He said, "Now, dear, you get behind the wheel and when I give you the signal, turn on the ignition." She agreed.<br><br>He got his head under the hood. She slid behind the wheel and in doing so she leaned on the horn. Well, he came out of there as though it were the morning of the first resurrection, cracked his head on the hood, walked around rubbing it, and said, "How in the world can you be so beautiful and yet so dumb?"<br><br>To which she responded, "I'm beautiful so you would marry me and dumb so I would marry you." I appreciate that.<br><br>Quite often in my experience I have a chance to talk with you young people formally and informally. Many hundreds come to my office to share experiences and concerns, to ask questions. I have noticed that if I could put most of the concerns young people have into two categories they would fall something like this: "Brother Dunn, how do you develop more faith and self-confidence?" and "How do you get the courage to do those things the Lord would have you do?" I would like to address myself briefly this morning to those two subjects.<br><br>I have noticed that daily we meet moments that steal our self-esteem. They are inevitable. Pick up any magazine; you see people who look healthier, skinnier, or better dressed than you are. Look around. There is always someone who seems smarter, another more self-assured, still another more talented. In fact, each day we are reminded that we lack certain talents, that we make mistakes, that we do not excel in all things. And amidst all this, it is easy to believe that we do not quite measure up in the great scheme of things, but are inferior in some secret way.<br><br>Underrating ourselves like this is not only painful but it is downright dangerous, for we limit the range of all possibility. We choke off our talents. And often we are dwelling on small faults of ours that, probably, others do not even notice.<br><br>"My nose is too big," a girl said to me the other day. "I'm much too fat." "I'm not very smart." "My clothes aren't right." How many of us let secret thoughts like these tear at our hearts? We are our own worst critics and believe others see us the same way.<br><br>I am reminded of the experience of a very pretty girl who would never go swimming; she would never put on a bathing suit. This was a great mystery to her friends until one day she confessed that she had been walking home from school in the second grade when an older boy came up behind her and said, "Look at those bowed legs. Have you ever seen such pins on a girl?" She never forgot the comment. And though everyone else thought her legs were straight and beautiful, she would never put on a bathing suit.<br><br>How easy it is to live as fear-haunted and defeated nobodies, magnifying our faults, fearing the eyes of others too closely put upon us. The truth of the matter is plain enough, according to Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of one of our presidents (whom, by the way, everybody remembers for her insight, not her protruding teeth). She said, "No one [listen to this, young people] can make you feel inferior without your consent (<i>Reader's Digest,</i>February 1963, p. 261). So why do we feel inferior? Why do we have to brood over seeming faults, real or imagined?<br><br>Maybe sometimes we need to step back and look at the forces that form our self-image, that powerful mental picture that determines just who we are. Do we judge ourselves too much on the physical? I think we sometimes overemphasize it. Do we judge ourselves on money, position, or glory? Remember, you great youth, favor and fortune are whimsical.<br><br>One college girl who spent all of her money on tuition did not have much left over for clothes, and she always felt bad because of the way she had to dress. But she had a positive mental attitude. She said, "I just go pull out magazine fashions from the 1940s and sit down and laugh. Everyone who thought they looked so chic then looks pretty funny."<br><br>Can you remember this very important formula in your life? I've shared it with you before: The greatest crisis given a little time is very humorous.<br><br>If you base your self-esteem, your feeling of self-worth, on anything outside the quality of your heart, your mind, or your soul, you have based it on a very shaky footing. So you and I are not perfect in form or physical figure? So you are not the richest, the wisest, the wittiest? So what? As Thomas Fuller once said, "What a day may bring a day may take away" (Richard L. Evans, <i>Richard Evan's Quote Book,</i>p. 56).<br><br>Do you remember the story of Sarah Bernhardt, the great actress? In later years she lived in an apartment high over Paris. An old admirer climbed all of the stairs one day and asked her breathlessly, "Sarah, why do you live so high up?"<br><br>"Dear friend," she replied, "it is the only way I can still make the hearts of men beat faster" (<i>Reader's Digest,</i>June 1961, p. 217). Many people were drawn to this actress even in her old age, not because of outward show but because of her inward spirit.<br><br>Who are we really? That is the question each one of us must ask almost daily as we succeed or we fail, as we live with big noses or thin hair. The answer to that is a glorious one and this audience ought to know it and understand. We are literally the offspring of heavenly parents. Can you remember that? I know we think it up here [indicating head] but we have a little difficulty relating it in here [indicating chest]. He created us with great personal care. He is the artist; we are his masterpiece. Our hearts, our souls, our minds have potential beyond our greatest imagination. We can become anything we want if we just remember who we are and if we do not choke off our powers by brooding over some small fault or by feeling inferior.<br><br>Dr. Leslie D. Weatherhead said on one occasion<br><br><i>If we have in our minds a picture of ourselves as fear-haunted and defeated nobodies, we must get rid of that picture and hold up our heads. God sees us as men and women in whom and through whom He can do a great work. He sees us not as pathetic victims of life, but masters of the art of living, not wanting sympathy, but imparting help to others and therefore thinking less and less of ourselves.</i>[Maxwell Maltz, Psychocybernetics, p. 45]<br><br>I personally thank God for great leaders, for parents, for teachers who have taught me these great truths, who have in a real sense imbued me with a sense of worth.<br><br>I may have shared this with some of you before. When I was a little boy growing up in Arkansas, we were the only Latter-day Saints in the city of Little Rock for many, many years. (It was ironic; I went back the other day as a General Authority to reorganize the stake and the building sits on a plot of ground where I used to play ball as a little boy.) And I have thought many times how grateful I am for parents and teachers, even those not of my faith, who imbued in me a sense of worth in those early formative years of my life. Here is an example: When I was about twelve years old, planning what I thought was to be a great athletic career, I opened up the sport page one day and there was an announcement. It said, "New York Yankees to play two exhibition ball games in Little Rock." Keep in mind, young people, that in those days we did not have the winter leagues as we now have and there was no television. For a little boy of age twelve in Little Rock to see a major league game was impossible. Travel was completely restricted. Funds were just not available.<br><br>During the weeks before the New York Yankees came to Little Rock, I secured the position of bat boy for the local team. Out of forty-three applicants, somehow I got the job. You can appreciate the excitement this meant for me because this would put me on the ball field at the same time the Yankees would be practicing and performing.<br><br>On the morning of the occasion, I remember that I went out to Travelers Field and waited for the Yankee bus to come. The bus was due at nine; I arrived at six. I stood there with my hat and my glove and my little heart pounding because on the Yankee team was my favorite player, Lou Gehrig. Anything Lou Gehrig did I followed. During that same year I read about his diet. Lou Gehrig ate six eggs for breakfast and so did I. Lou Gehrig ate Wheaties for breakfast--or so the ad said--and so did I.<br><br>As the bus arrived and one by one the players got off, I stood there with my heart pounding, waiting for that special moment. Finally Gehrig made his exit and I remember looking at him and thinking, "He's real! He moves!" and I followed him onto the field.<br><br>The manager assigned me to shag balls in the outfield and I about got bombarded with fly balls trying to watch Gehrig on the practice field and retrieve the baseballs. After he had taken his turn at the batting cage, he circled the field several times to get his legs in shape and then headed for the dugout. I thought, "Here's my chance to be alone with him." So I grabbed a fairly good-looking baseball off the field and ran as hard as I could to follow him.<br><br>When I got to the dugout, he had disappeared. I had a little courage and started down the stairs and up the corridor into the clubhouse. Then this gigantic trainer came out of nowhere. "Hey, kid, where are you going?"<br><br>He scared me. I just held up the baseball and said, "Ball."<br><br>He said, "You can't go in there. That's for players only."<br><br>"I'm the bat boy for the other team."<br><br>"I don't care who you are," and he mentioned some adjectives we do not use in church. I learned then that there are some people who do not understand youth.<br><br>I turned very dejectedly to walk out of the dugout, got to the top step, and a deep voice from in the dugout said, "Hey, trainer, that boy's with me." And I turned around and in the shadow was Lou Gehrig.<br><br>I remember looking at the trainer and saying with my chin out, "Yeah, we're together."<br><br>I walked down the stairs and Gehrig came over and put that big old lovable arm around me and said, "What can I do for you, son?"<br><br>I said, "Ball."<br><br>He took the baseball and looked at it and said, "You don't have any autographs."<br><br>"I want yours."<br><br>"Wouldn't you like the other Yankees to sign it?"<br><br>"Well, yes."<br><br>He said, "Look, why don't you go finish your practice and as soon as you get through out there and the players come in, I'll take you into the clubhouse and we'll get all the Yankees to sign it. All right?"<br><br>"All right."<br><br>The moment after the practice was over, I met my friend and he took me into the clubhouse. Seated at the first cubicle as we walked in the door was a hometown boy who had gone on to be a Hall of Famer and, I think, the greatest catcher the game ever produced, Bill Dickey. Lou Gehrig said, "Hey, Bill, this kid thinks you're kind of important. Would you sign his ball?" And Bill Dickey signed it. We made a tour around the whole clubhouse. Over in the corner, up from San Francisco that year, was the rookie of the Yankees, Joe DiMaggio. Gehrig said, "Hey, Joe, this kid thinks you're going places. Would you sign his ball?" And he signed it. Then Gehrig took it and he put, "To my friend, Paul Dunn." Well, that was the celestial kingdom. Then he put his arm around me and said, "Is there anything else I can do for you?"<br><br>I said, "I want to grow up and be like you and play ball."<br><br>And he patted me on the head and said, "Oh, I think you'll do better."<br><br>And I said, "But every time I go out to play I get so nervous and afraid I can't perform." You see, I was starting to feel inferior.<br><br>He asked, "You going to be out here tomorrow?"<br><br>I said, "I live here."<br><br>"Let me think about this and you and I get together tomorrow. Would you?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"That was the longest night I ever spent in my life. Would you understand, young people, that I took my baseball and glove to bed? My mother came in about eleven o'clock and said, "What are you doing with that dirty thing in bed?"<br><br>The next morning the Yankees were due at nine and I was there at six. We went through the same ritual. This time I was asked to shag balls behind the batting-practice pitcher so he would not have to bend over so far throwing baseballs in for practice hitting. Red Ruffin, another Hall of Famer, was on the mound and he had a vocabulary that was interesting for a twelve-year-old to hear. About the fifth batter into the batting cage was Gehrig and my heart beat a little faster as he stepped in. As he walked up, after knocking the dirt out of his cleats, he stood there and adjusted his cap. Then he looked out to his friend Ruffin and said, "Hey, Red, let that kid behind you pitch to me."<br><br>And I went, "Enhhh!"<br><br>Red did not want to. He said, "Oh, I want to get through, Lou, and take a shower."<br><br>And Gehrig just stood there. "I said let the boy pitch."<br><br>Ruffin turned around and said, "Here, kid."<br><br>You ladies may not know it, but a baseball only weighs about five and a half ounces–but it felt like a sixteen-pound shot put. I walked up onto the mound. I was sixty feet, six inches from my idol. He could see I was concerned. I was feeling very inferior. He took that magnificent bat and just held it there and then pushed it out. He said, "Just aim at the bat, son." And I threw the ball somewhere in the park. Then I got one reasonably close and he hit a little ground ball back to me. And then he hit another one. And then he hit a short pop fly over second. Then, about the fourth or fifth pitch, he let go. The right field wall of the Little Rock playing field was 395 feet away, but the ball just tailed out. Then he fit another one right behind it. And a third. I felt a little better because I was getting the ball close. I wound up--you know, how hard can a twelve-year-old throw?--and I just grooved that pitch. He took that mighty Gehrig swing and he missed. He stood up said, "Beautiful!"<br><br>I remember growing on the mound and thinking, "Look out, world; I'm coming." It took me several years before I realized he did that on purpose. Some people know how to teach youth.<br><br>He called me off the mound, put his arm around me and said, "You remember the question you asked me yesterday?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>He said, "I've watched you very closely this morning. You're going to be great and I'm counting on you. Let me just teach you one little lesson. Just remember, young man, every time you walk out on the ball field and you feel nervous and concerned and like you can't do it, know that so do we, and that's the Lord's way." Imagine this nonmember athlete talking to a boy this way! I think about this quite often as I turn on my television set and see some so-called athletes with a can of light beer in their hands. And we call that a hero?<br><br>Here was that wonderful man saying, "Whenever I walk out on a ball field I feel nervous and concerned but I am reminded there's a higher source than you and me and I'd better call on it. And remember this: in the game of life, my boy, there are eight other players on the ball field and you can't go alone. It's a team effort." I have never forgotten. Then he said as we walked away, "You'll find as you grow a little older that there will be people who will tell you you can't, and they'll even be in your profession. Whenever that occurs, you tell them I said you could."<br><br>On my eighteenth birthday, I signed a professional baseball contract and was sent to the Pioneer League. I won my first ball game seven to one, and that was a proud moment. I walked off the field and the coach on the opposing team said in a sneery voice, "Hey, kid, whoever said you could pitch?"<br><br>I looked right at him and said, "Gehrig."<br><br>And he said, "Oh."<br><br>Thank God for great leaders and teachers.<br><br>Now it takes a lot of courage. Courage is a hard thing for you and me to define. It comes in somewhat different forms. Sometimes it is a man or a woman facing a very difficult situation. It is doing, I think, the thing you and I have to do at the time we have to do it, and generally there is no glamour attached to it. Have you ever noticed?<br><br>Sometimes we think of great athletes or heroes on the battlefield, and that is certainly a form of courage. But we do not usually find ourselves in those particular positions. I am grateful that there are courageous men and women in all walks of life. I think it takes as much courage to be the right kind of woman in the home as it does to be a soldier on the battlefield. It is a hard thing to describe. It is not a quality; it is not a thing. It takes, I think, real effort to be courageous.<br><br>I have been on a battlefield, on an athletic field, in the business world, and in the education world; and one of the greatest displays of courage comes with you and me standing up for what is right. It is fairly easy to be a Mormon here in the Marriott Center. You notice the temptation is not too great right now, is it? It comes when you and I get out there in the world. And yet, in every profession in which I have found myself, I have been proud to be a Latter-day Saint. It has been an asset and never a liability. Permit two examples.<br><br>During my first year in professional baseball I was married in the temple, and that presents a little problem in dressing rooms with uncouth athletes. But I found that holding to righteousness and not parading it before men brought great love, respect, and honor. For the sake of the person involved, because he still lives, I will simply describe this first great catcher in my professional baseball career as an old pro from the Washington Senators and about as uncouth as they come. He was built like a small King Kong. When he would dress up and get behind that plate, he was something else; but his other activities included women, gambling, and pornographic material. And he thought that was being manly.<br><br>Two months after I joined the club we were on a road trip. It was two in the morning and I was asleep in my hotel room. A knock came at the door. I got up to answer it and there was this big old burly catcher standing there in his pajamas.<br><br>"Can I come in?"<br><br>"Come on in." I closed the door.<br><br>"Don't tell anybody I'm here."<br><br>"I'm not going to tell anybody. What can I do for you?"<br><br>"Paul," he said, "I've watched you for two months and I kind of like what I see. I would like to learn how to be more like that. Would you help me? I'd like to learn to find God. Can you help?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>So I got this big old filthy catcher on his knees and we prayed together. And he got up doing this [wipes eyes on sleeve]. "Thank you. Don't tell the others."<br><br>In the next two months, six other players came in to talk. They did not particularly want to parade it, but they did honor it.<br><br>We won the championship after a very interesting playoff game. I drew the assignment to pitch. In the top of the eighth inning the score was nothing to nothing. The first batter against me singled sharply to right field and took second on a fielder's choice. Have you got the picture? One out, winning run on second. The batter I was now facing hit .326 for the season. I worked him to a two-two count. He fouled several pitches and then I got the ball too close to the center--a horrible mistake.<br><br>He singled sharply to left center and the ball went out there like a bullet, hit the ground on one bounce, and went to the center fielder. Normally that would score a runner from second very easily, but the ball carried such velocity I am sure the runner did not understand it. We had a great center fielder; he took the ball on one hop, threw a perfect strike to the plate, and caught the runner by a good six inches. The umpire hollered, "You're out!" This man got up--and I had never heard such foul language in my life. I was back behind the catcher by this time, the normal position for the pitcher on a throw to the plate.<br><br>The umpire bellowed, "You're out of the game! Out!" And he ejected him, which he should have. As I was walking back to the mound, the umpire--<i>not</i>a Mormon--about ready to replace his mask, turned to me and said, "Paul, forgive him; he doesn't understand." How grateful I am to be a Latter-day Saint.<br><br>Let me conclude with a little parable. Have you ever heard the parable of the eagle? It's a classic. It seems a certain man went through the forest seeking any bird of interest he might find. He caught a young eagle, brought it home and put it among his fowls and ducks and turkeys and gave it chicken's food to eat even though it was an eagle, the king of the birds.<br><br>Five years later a naturalist came to see him and after passing through his garden said, "That bird is an eagle, not a chicken."<br><br>"Yes," said the owner, "But I have trained it to be a chicken. It is no longer an eagle. It is a chicken, even though it measures fifteen feet from tip to tip of its wings."<br><br>"No," said the naturalist. "It is an eagle still; it has the heart of an eagle and I will make it soar high up to the heavens."<br><br>"No," said the owner, "it is a chicken, and it will never fly."<br><br>They agreed to test it. The naturalist picked up the eagle. "Thou dost belong to the sky and not to this earth; stretch forth thy wings and fly." The eagle turned this way and that and, then, looking down, saw the chickens eating their food and down he jumped.<br><br>The owner said, "I told you it was a chicken."<br><br>"No," said the naturalist, "it is an eagle. Give it another chance tomorrow."<br><br>So the next day he took it to the top of the house and said, "Eagle, thou art an eagle; stretch forth thy wings and fly." But again the eagle, seeing the chickens feeding, jumped down and fed with them.<br><br>Then the owner said, "I told you it was a chicken."<br><br>"No," asserted the naturalist, "it is an eagle and it still has the heart of an eagle. Only give it one more chance, and I will make it fly tomorrow."<br><br>The next morning he rose early and took the eagle outside the city, away from the houses, to the foot of a high mountain. The sun was just rising, gilding the top of the mountain with gold, and every crag was glistening in the joy of that beautiful morning.<br><br>He picked up the eagle and said to it, "Eagle, thou art an eagle. Thou dost belong to the sky and not to this earth. Stretch forth thy wings and fly." The eagle looked around and trembled as if new life were coming to it. But it did not fly. The naturalist then made it look straight at the sun. Suddenly it stretched out its wings and, with the screech of an eagle, it flew.<br><br>For all of you, my beloved young brothers and sisters, who are keeping your eyes cast down with the chickens, for those of you who are grubbing and pecking like a chicken because you doubt your ability to succeed in your fondest dreams, will you remember these words today, "O eagle, thou art an eagle. Stretch forth thy wings and fly."<br><br>What we need is to be filled with a divine discontent--a reaching, a stretching, an aching to be what we can be, to belong to the sky. We need to recognize that the deepest urge of our being is to use our powers to develop our gifts. All of us have an innate need to shine in use; a desire to increase the bounds of ourselves, to learn more, to do more, to express more; a desire to grow, improve, accomplish, expand. It is an energy that originates from our deepest being. When you feel like quitting--and who doesn't, on occasion?--dust off your dreams and remember the Scottish prayer: "O God, help me to have a high opinion of myself."<br><br>You, my beloved young brothers and sisters, were born to succeed, to soar, to be like unto God. May you know that I know that, for I have an abiding faith in God and in his Son Jesus Christ. This is his church and the Lord, through revelation, is asking us to come back home to be like him. God bless you to do it and to soar high in the process, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<h1>l Marriage - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I stand before you tonight in the spirit of this musical number, "I Need Thee Every Hour," and hope and pray and desire that I may be given utterance by the power of the Spirit so that I may say those things that will please the Lord, that will be the things he would say if he personally were addressing this great congregation at this hour. When I consulted with Brother Lorin Wheelwright, he told me that it would be most appropriate if I spoke on a Thanksgiving theme, since it would fit in well with the music. I decided to do that, and prepared my mind and an outline, and gathered some quotations, but since arriving here tonight I have had nothing but a stupor of thought, nothing but uncertainty in my mind as to that subject. Rather, I think, if I may be guided by the power of the Spirit and say what will please the Lord, I shall talk to you--somewhat informally, perhaps--about the obligation that rests upon Latter-day Saints to create for themselves eternal family units patterned after the family of God, our Heavenly Father.<br><br>So that we may all be united in our thinking and be in a position to build on the same foundation, having in mind the same eternal truths, I shall initially read three or four brief passages from the revelations. I hope and pray that I may be given utterance by the Spirit and that your hearts may be opened by the power of the same Spirit so that we will be mutually edified. I pray that we will be one in feeling and in attitude, where these great doctrinal principles are concerned, and will have riveted in our souls the determination to do all the things that must be done in this mortal probation to inherit the fulness of the glory of our Father's kingdom.<br><br>I take for one text these words from Section 42, the revelation entitled "The Law of the Church": "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else" (D&amp;amp;C 42:22). And in the spirit of those words, I take from the Old Testament book of Ruth these expressions which though not originally uttered with reference to marriage, contain a principle that is wholly applicable.<br><br><i>And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</i><br><br><i>Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also</i>[and now I will change it slightly]<i>if</i>[even]<i>death part thee and me.</i>[Ruth 1:16–17]<br><br>Now a passage from Section 49 in the Doctrine and Covenants summarizing the basic administrative announcement relative to marriage for our dispensation:<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you,</i>[saith the Lord<i>,</i>]<i>that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;</i><br><br><i>And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 49:15–17]<br><br>When we as Latter-day Saints talk about marriage we are talking about a holy celestial order. We are talking about a system out of which can grow the greatest love, joy, peace, happiness, and serenity known to humankind. We are talking about creating a family unit that has the potential of being everlasting and eternal, a family unit where a man and a wife can go on in that relationship to all eternity, and where mother and daughter and father and son are bound by eternal ties that will never be severed. We are talking about creating a unit more important than the Church, more important than any organization that exists on earth or in heaven, a unit out of which exaltation and eternal life grow; and when we talk about eternal life, we are talking about the kind of life that God our Heavenly Father lives.<br><br>In this final glorious dispensation we have received the most basic truth of all eternity, and that truth concerns the nature and kind of being that God is. It is eternal life to know the Father and the Son (see John 17:3). There is no possible way to go degree by degree, step by step to the high exaltation we seek unless and until we come to a knowledge of the nature and kind of being that God is. Thus, when we talk about eternal life we are talking about the kind of life that God our Father lives; and when we speak of him we are speaking of a holy, perfected, exalted, ennobled man--an individual, a personage, a being with "a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D&amp;amp;C 130:22). We are talking about someone who is a literal parent, who is the Father of the spirits of all men. You and I were born as members of his family. We have seen his face; we have heard his voice; we have received his counsel, personally as well as through representatives and agents; we knew him in the preexistence. Now a curtain has been dropped and we do not have the remembrance that we had then, but we are seeking to do the things that will enable us to be like him.<br><br>After he had begotten us as his spirit children, he gave us our agency, which is the power and ability to choose; he also gave us laws and allowed us to obey or disobey, in consequence of which we can and did develop talents, abilities, aptitudes, and characteristics of diverse sorts. He ordained and established a plan of salvation. It was named the gospel of God, meaning God our Heavenly Father, and it consisted of all of the laws, powers, and rights, all of the experiences, all of the gifts and graces needed to take us, his spirit sons and daughters, from our then-spirit state of low intelligence to the high, exalted state where we would be like him.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith tells us that God himself, finding that he was in the midst of spirits and glory, ordained laws whereby they might advance and progress and become like him. Those laws included the creation of this earth; they included the receipt of a mortal body where we could be tried and tested in a probationary state and receive experiences impossible to gain in any other way; they included the opportunity to choose between right and wrong, to do good or to do evil, the opportunity to grow and advance in the things of the spirit; and they included the opportunity to enter into a marriage relationship that has the potential of being eternal. We started out on this course in the premortal life. Now we are down here taking the final examination for all the life that we lived back then, which also is the entrance examination for the realms and kingdoms that are ahead.<br><br>The name of the kind of life that God our Father lives is eternal life, and eternal life consists of two things: the continuation of the family unit in eternity; and an inheritance of what the scriptures denominate the fulness of the father or the fulness of the glory of the Father (see D&amp;amp;C 76:56), meaning the might, power, dominion, and exaltation that he himself possesses. In our finite circumstances we have no ability or power to comprehend the might and omnipotence of the Father. We can look at the stars in the heavens, we can view the Milky Way, we can see all the worlds and orbs that have been created in their spheres, we can examine all the life on this planet with which we are familiar, and by doing this we can begin to get a concept of the glorious, infinite, unlimited intelligence by which all these things are--and all these things taken together and more dramatize the fulness of the glory of the Father.<br><br>We are seeking eternal life--that is to say, we have been offered the privilege to go forward in advancement, as the children of God, until we become like our eternal Parent; and if we so attain it is required, it is requisite, it is mandatory for us to build on the foundation of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. It is required of us that we keep the commandments and sow the seeds of righteousness in order to reap the harvest of glory and honor. If we do all the things that the gospel requires of us we can make that kind of advancement. The gospel, which is the plan of salvation, is now named the gospel of Jesus Christ to honor him who worked out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice and put into operation all the terms and conditions of the Father's plan.<br><br>God our Father is the Creator of all things, and we glorify his holy name and sing praises to him because he created us and, in the ultimate sense, the universe, the earth, and all things on all the orbs in all the sidereal heavens. God our Father is the ultimate and perfect Creator. Jesus Christ, his Son, is the Redeemer. He came to ransom us from the temporal and spiritual death brought into the world by the fall of Adam. The ransom from temporal death gives each of us immortality: "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). And every living soul will rise in the resurrection with immortality and, having so arisen, will be judged according to his works and will be assigned a place in the kingdoms which are prepared. Some will be raised in immortality and then unto eternal life, and eternal life is the name of the kind of life that God lives.<br><br>We cannot shout praises to the name of the Lord Jehovah, who is the Lord Jesus, to the extent that we should in order to honor him properly for all that he has done for us and for the possibilities that lie ahead because he took upon himself our sins on conditions of repentance. The work of God the Father was creation, and the work of Christ the Son was redemption. We are men, and our work--building on the foundation that God our Father laid and that Christ his Son has established--is to do the part assigned to us in order to inherit the glory and honor and dignity of which I speak. In general terms, that means that we are to accept and believe the law. We are to believe in Christ and live his law, be upright and clean, have our sins washed away in the waters of baptism, become new creatures by the power of the Holy Ghost, and walk in paths of truth and righteousness.<br><br>As long as we speak in this vein, all that we say is said in generalities; it is a foundation for a specific and particular thing toward which we point: eternal marriage. Everything that we do in the Church is connected and associated with and tied into the eternal order of matrimony that God has ordained. Everything that we do from the time that we become accountable through all our experiences, and all the counsel and direction we receive up to the time of marriage, is designed and intended to prepare us to enter into a probationary marriage arrangement, one that does in fact become eternal if we abide in the covenant made in connection with that order of matrimony. Then everything that we do for the remainder of our lives, whatsoever it may be, ties back into the celestial order of matrimony into which we have entered, and is designed and intended to encourage us to keep the covenant made in holy places. That is the general concept, briefly stated, under which we are operating.<br><br>Let me now read from the revelation on marriage the general concept governing marriage and everything else. I read from the Doctrine and Covenants, section 132, verse 5: "All who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world." That is the basic, governing, overriding principle that rules all of the acts of men in all ages. No one ever gets anything for nothing. We have received as a free gift the fact of resurrection, but in a sense even that is not free in that we lived meritoriously and uprightly in the pre-existence and earned the right to undergo this mortal probation and the resurrection that follows it. In the broadest and most eternal perspective that there is, no one ever gets anything for nothing; and so we live the law and we get the blessing. And having said that, then the Lord says: "As pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory, and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God" (D&amp;amp;C 132:6).<br><br>"The new and everlasting covenant" is the fulness of the gospel, and the gospel is the covenant of salvation that the Lord makes with men. It is new because it has been revealed anew in our day; it is everlasting because it has always been had by faithful people, not only on this earth but on all the earths inhabited by the children of our Father. This next verse, number seven, is a one-sentence summary of the whole law of the whole gospel. Of necessity, it is written in legal language because it outlines the terms and conditions that are involved; and of course it is the Lord speaking:<br><br><i>And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these</i>[this recites the conditions of the law that govern in the whole field of revealed religion, but we will make specific application of it to our central responsibility, which is marriage]:<i>All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.</i><br><br>Now, what is involved? We have power, as mortals, to make between ourselves any arrangements that we choose to make and that are legal in the society where we live, and they will bind us as long as we agree to be bound, even until death takes us. But we do not have power, as mortals, to bind ourselves after death. Neither you nor I can enter a contract to buy or sell or go to come or paint or perform or do any act in the sphere that is ahead. God has given us our agency here and now as pertaining to mortality.<br><br>We are mortal; this is a temporal sphere, a time-bound sphere. And if we are going to do anything here and now that bridges the gulf of death, anything that endures in the spirit world, anything that remains with us in the resurrection, we have to do it by a power that is beyond the power of man--it has to be the power of God. Man is mortal and his acts are limited to mortality; God is eternal and his acts have no end.<br><br>The Lord conferred upon Peter the keys of the kingdom of God so that he had power to bind on earth and seal everlastingly in the heavens, and then he spread that out to James and John and then to all of the Twelve anciently so that they all had the same power, and then in our day he has restored again what was had anciently. He has called apostles and prophets and given them the keys of the kingdom of God, and they have power once again to bind on earth and have it sealed everlastingly in the heavens. He sent Elijah to bring the sealing power; he sent Elias to confer upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the gospel of Abraham and to give the promise that in them and in their seed all generations after should be blessed.<br><br>Elijah came and Elias came, acting in the power and authority of the Almighty, and gave once again their keys, powers, prerogatives, and rights to mortal men on earth--praise God for this glorious thing! Once again on earth there are people who can bind on earth and have it sealed everlastingly in the heavens. We have the power to perform a marriage, and we can do it so that the man and the woman become husband and wife here and now and--if they keep the covenant there and then made--they will remain husband and wife in the spirit world and will come up in glory and dominion with kingdoms and exaltation in the resurrection, being husband and wife and having eternal life. And it operates thus because in this church, and in this church only, the Lord Almighty has given the sealing power. That is our potential; that is within our possible realm of achievement.<br><br>In this one-sentence summary, as I express it, of the whole law of the gospel, we read three requisites. If, for instance, a person is going to have a baptism that lasts eternally he must first find the right baptism; second, find a legal administrator to perform the ordinance for him; and third, have that ordinance sealed by the power of the Holy Spirit, in which even the baptism will admit the repentant person to a celestial heaven in the realms ahead. This matter of being sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise applies to every ordinance and every covenant and all things that there are in the Church. Do not talk about marriage and the Holy Spirit of promise unless and until you understand first the concept and the principle and its universal application.<br><br>One of our revelations speaks of "the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true" (D&amp;amp;C 76:53), meaning that every person who walks uprightly, does the best that he can, overcomes the world, rises above carnality, and walks in paths of righteousness will have his acts and his deeds sealed and approved by the Holy Spirit. He will be, as Paul would have expressed it, "justified by the Spirit" (see 1 Corinthians 6:11). Therefore, if a man is going to be married and wants a marriage that lasts for a week, or three weeks, or three months, or as long as Hollywood prescribes, or even "until death us do part," he can be married by the power of man within the parameters and the limits that are set; he has that prerogative by the agency that the Lord has given him. But if he wants a wife to be his in the realms ahead, he had better find someone who has power to bind on earth and seal in heaven.<br><br>In order to get a proper marriage one must do this: first, search for and seek out celestial marriage--find the right ordinance; second, look for a legal administrator, someone who holds the sealing power--and that power is exercised only in the temples that the Lord has had built by the tithing and sacrifice of his people in our day; and third, so live in righteousness, uprightness, integrity, virtue, and morality that he is entitled to have the Holy Spirit of God ratify and seal and justify and approve, and in that even his marriage is sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise and is binding in time and in eternity.<br><br>So we Latter-day Saints struggle and labor and work to be worthy to get a recommend to go to the temple, for the spirit will not dwell in an unclean tabernacle. We struggle and labor to get our tabernacles clean, to be pure and refined and cultured, to have the Spirit as our companion; and when we get in that state our bishop and our stake president give us a "recommend" to go to the temple. We go there and make solemn and sober covenants, and having so done we then labor and struggle and work will all our power to continue in the light of the Spirit so that the agreement we have made will not be broken. If we do that, we have the assurance of eternal life. We do not need to tremble and fear; we do not need to have anxiety or worry if we are laboring and working and struggling to the best of our abilities. Though we do not become perfect, though we do not overcome all things, if our hearts are right and we are charting a course to eternal life in the manner I indicate, our marriages will continue in the realms that are ahead. We shall get into the paradise of God and we shall be husband and wife. We shall come up in the resurrection and we shall be husband and wife.<br><br>Anyone who comes up in the resurrection in the marriage state has the absolute guarantee of eternal life, but he will not then be a possessor and inheritor of all things--there is a great deal of progress and advancement to be made after the grave and after the resurrection. But he will be in the course where he will go on in the schooling and preparing processes until eventually he knows all things and becomes like God our Heavenly Father, meaning that he becomes an inheritor of eternal life.<br><br>In a manner of speaking we have, here and now, probationary families even though we have been married in the temple, because our marriage in the temple is conditional. It is conditioned upon our subsequent compliance with the laws, the terms, the conditions of the covenant that we then make. And so when I get married in the temple, I am put in a position where I can strive and labor and learn to love my wife with the perfection that must exist if I am going to have a fulness of the glory that attends this covenant in eternity, and it puts her in a position to learn to love me in the same way. It puts both of us in a position to bring up our children in light and truth and to school and prepare them to be members of an eternal family unit, and it puts us as children of our parents in a position where we honor our parents and do what is necessary to have these eternal ties go from one generation to the next and the next. Eventually there will be a great patriarchal chain of exalted beings from Adam to the last man, with any links left out being individuals who are not qualified and worthy to inherit, possess, and receive along the indicated line.<br><br>I am talking now to people who have opportunity to live the law. Anyone who has the opportunity is required to do so; it is mandatory. I am perfectly well aware that there are people who did not have the opportunity but who would have lived the law had the opportunity been afforded; and those individuals will be judged in the providence and mercy of a gracious God according to the intents and desires of their hearts. That is the principle of salvation and exaltation for the dead.<br><br>I have talked only in general terms; I have deliberately not been specific. I have designed to set forth true principles, as the Prophet indicated in his statement, "I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves" (quoted by John Taylor, "The Organization of the Church,"<i>Millennial Star,</i>November 1851, p. 3). I have desired and designed to set forth the general concept that is involved with the hope that, having the concept before us, each of us will then determine for ourselves the courses that we have to pursue as individuals to obtain the indicated rewards.<br><br>I think that the noblest concept that can enter the heart of man is the fact that the family unit continues in eternity. I do not think that one can conceive of a more glorious concept than that--building, of course, on the foundation of the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. Celestial marriage is the thing that opens the door to eternal life in our Father's kingdom. If we can pass the probationary experiences that prevail and exist in the family unit, then the Lord will say to us at some future day, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: . . . enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:21).<br><br>The things we are talking about here are true. That is the glory and the wonder and the beauty of everything connected with this system of revealed religion that we have--it is true. There is no more glorious fact connected with our whole system of revealed religion than the simple fact that it is true; and because it is true the doctrines that we teach are true; and because these doctrines are true they will give us peace and joy and happiness in this life. They will enable us to cast off the drudgery, sludge, evil, and iniquities of the world; they will empower us to put on Christ and the glory and beauty of pure religion and to become new creatures of the Holy Ghost. It is a wondrous thing beyond belief to belong to a system that is true, that is founded on the rock foundation of eternal truth.<br><br>I hope, as I bear testimony to you of the truth and divinity of this work, that my words simply echo the thoughts that are in your hearts. I know just as well as I know anything in this world that God has spoken in our day, that Jesus is the Lord, that he has worked out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice, that the Lord has set up his kingdom for the last time among men, that Spencer W. Kimball at this moment is the prophet and revelator and mouthpiece of the Almighty on earth, and that this Church, weak and struggling and humble as it is now, is going to advance and grow and progress until the knowledge of God covers the earth as the waters cover the sea. Our destiny is to fill the earth because we are founded on the rock foundation of eternal truth. There is nothing in all this world like the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I bear witness of it and hope that, as you say amen, you will thus make my witness your witness and that you will then be under covenant to do the things that must be done to gain peace and joy in this life and to be an inheritor of eternal life in the world to come. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1> Hell is Moved - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, President Oaks. One of the joys of my life has been the association in recent years with President Oaks. He is, in my opinion, the outstanding university president in America today. He could preside over other universities and render a great service, but I am glad he is here. I am grateful for this beautiful music that has been so well sung, for those anthems of praise, and for the prayer offered in each of our behalfs.<br><br>Because President Oaks has been courteous to me many times, I have had this signal honor before; but, as he pointed out, for the first time I feel as though I belong and am one of you. And as a father and an adopted alumnus of this University, may I take this opportunity to thank the faculty of Brigham Young University who have taught and are now teaching so well my four children and two children acquired through marriage. It is a great blessing to have a faculty of such fine men and women and to feel as a father that one's children are being so well taught. With us today also is our first grandchild, Peter, a grandson seven months old, who is checking the campus out. Hopefully he will come here too, someday, unless today's devotional speaker proves too depressing.<br><br>The theme of my address comes from a prophecy in President George Q. Cannon's speech given in the Tabernacle in May of 1866. President Cannon spoke of the generations that had passed before the restoration of the gospel during which the adversary was indifferent and unconcerned with regard to the fractious religious movements among mankind which were not based upon the fulness of truth. However, President Cannon observed that the movement of the Holy Priesthood of God and the Church were restored, "then all hell is moved." He catalogued the forms of resistance that can be expected when "all hell is moved."<br><br>President Cannon, who knew that the adversary regards this telestial turf as his own, said that Satan will vigorously resist all rezoning efforts because this is his world. President Cannon further observed that the Saints--meaning you and I--must not make the mistake of assuming the existence of any truce between the forces of Satan and God. To believe so, said President Cannon, is "a very great delusion, and a very common one."<br><br>President Cannon then warned that the forms of resistance to righteousness will strike us "with wonder and astonishment." This, he said, would occur because "the war" which was waged in heaven has been transferred to the earth," and that this conflict, he said, "will [come to] occupy the thoughts and minds of all the inhabitants of the earth" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>11:227–29). Brothers and sisters, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will be at the epicenter of all that.<br><br>On the sixth of April, 1845, the Twelve Apostles issued a proclamation which included these words:<br><br><i>As this work progresses in its onward course, and becomes more and more an object of political and religious interest and excitement, no king, ruler, or subject, no community or individual, will stand neutral. All will at length be influenced by one spirit or the other; and will take sides either for or against the kingdom of God.</i>(<i>Messages of the First Presidency,</i>p. 257)<br><br>Such audacity! Except for apostles. Such presumptuousness! Except for prophets. That prophecy is underway, and it is about that that I wish to speak today.<br><br>I stress that I come neither as an alarmist nor as a pessimist, but as one who seeks in his gentle way to remind us of this reality lest we be struck "with wonder and astonishment" and become dismayed and dislocated by difficulties that emerge when "all hell is moved," because the restored kingdom is really rolling now. We may never become accustomed to untrue and unjust criticism of us but we ought not to be immobilized by it. Neither should we be surprised at the proximity of such protagonists and the falsity and the fury of their pronouncements. President Joseph F. Smith said, "there are those--and they abound largely in our midst--who will shut their eyes to every virtue and to every good thing connected with this latter-day work, and will proud out floods of falsehood and misrepresentation against the people of God." President Smith, who endured so much of that proximate persecution, did what we must also do. He said of such detractors, "I forgive them for this. I leave them in the hands of the just Judge" (<i>Gospel Doctrine,</i>p. 337).<br><br>President Brigham Young observed that it would be at the very time when the Church was reaching out to all the nations of the world, when it was prospering and growing, that there would be in proportion to the spread of the gospel a rise in the power of Satan. We are in that very period of time now, too. The obscurity of the Church has given way to visibility. You who have entered here to learn and who go forth to serve mankind--wafted as you will be from place to place on this planet--are also builders of the kingdom. You must be especially aware of the confluence of events that I am describing. You must still go forth, for you have been sent to this planet at precisely this time because you could cope with the challenges being described.<br><br>In the beginning of the Restoration, Joseph Smith quickly became an object of scorn and ridicule. The reaction to him, except by Satan's scale, was all out of proportion. Joseph reflected upon this when he observed:<br><br><i>How very strange it was that an obscure boy . . . should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling.</i><br><br>But as the Prophet observed, "strange or not, so it was " (Joseph Smith 2:23). As with that individual, so with God's institution. When the Saints are spotlighted, it will not always be for us to take curtsies and bows; sometimes the spotlights will be searchlights.<br><br>Note, brothers and sisters, that it is the validity which draws the fire of the adversary. Combine validity and visibility, as in our time, and there is even more reaction. The adversary would scarcely pay any attention to a still numerically obscure Church unless he recognized what is underway for just what it is. Jesus declared who he was, and many disbelieved him, but the unclean spirit in Capernaum recognized him and said: "I know thee who thou art" (Mark 1:24). Lucifer and his legions are alert; they know Christ's church is what it is. The adversary is aware.<br><br>It should not surprise us, therefore, that as the Church becomes larger and more visible we will sail our rougher waters, and that there will be more "struggling seamen" anxious to be saved and to come on board. Indeed, there are reasons to believe--as the contrasts between the kingdom and the ways of the world become sharper, the choices more obvious, and the issues more irrepressible--that this condition will, in fact, help those who otherwise might delay making a choice or who might make a wrong choice if the issues remained obscured.<br><br>It should not puzzle us, if we have studied scriptural history carefully--including what happened to the Savior--that defectors often cause more difficulty than disinterested disbelievers. It should not surprise us either, as Peter observed of those drawn away by false accusers, that it will be they and their followers "by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of" (2 Peter 2:2).<br><br>There are those who chronically misunderstand the Church because they are busy trying to explain the Church from the outside. They are so busy believing what they want to believe about the Church that they will not take the time to learn what they need to learn about the Church. They prefer any explanation to the real explanation. Some prefer to believe the worst rather than to know the truth. Still others are afraid to part the smokescreen of allegations for fear of what they will see. Yet one cannot see the Louvre by remaining in its lobby. One cannot understand the Church by remaining outside. A non-believing but fair critic of the Church, a friend of mine, once said that the Book of Mormon was the only book some critics felt they did not need to read before reviewing it.<br><br>Some dismiss the Church out of hand for not being trendy in its theology and for being authoritarian. To such I say, better a true theocracy with a little democracy than a democracy without any theology. Yes, the kingdom of God is a kingdom; there is no "one man, one vote" rule between its King and its citizens.<br><br>Some insist upon studying the Church only through the eyes of its defectors--like interviewing Judas to understand Jesus. Defectors always tell us more about themselves than about that from which they have departed.<br><br>Some others patiently feed their pet peeve about the Church without realizing that such a pet will not only bite the hands of him who feeds it, but it will swallow his whole soul. Of course we are a very imperfect people! Remember, however, that while it is possible to have an imperfect people possessed of perfect doctrines (indeed, such is necessary to change their imperfections), you will never, never see the reverse: a perfect people with imperfect doctrines. The more people there are who bear false witness concerning a true movement, the greater the need for us to be true witnesses of the Savior and his way of life. We can be noble even when we are being treated ignobly. We not only can be, but we must be.<br><br>It was Peter who warned us about the central cause of so much of this criticism. He said that the days would come when people would deny the Lord who "bought them" (2 Peter 2:1). That scripture of course, is a direct reference to the atonement of Jesus Christ when he ransomed and purchased us, making the resurrection a reality for all. To deny the reality and the validity of his atonement and his resurrection, and therefore the resurrection of mankind, is to deny the very Lord. But such is the case with so much of the existential Christianity. Diluted Christianity is not Christianity, it is a feeble attempt to have Christianity without Christ, for it denies the central service of Jesus' life--the Atonement. Those who call themselves Christians but deny the divinity of Jesus cannot seem to tolerate those of us who accept and proclaim the divinity of Christ. No one, brothers and sisters, would pay us much heed if we were merely nonsmoking, nondrinking humanists. Without acknowledging the reality of the Resurrection and the Atonement, believing in the ministry of Jesus would mean slumping into the very Saduceeism which Jesus himself denounced.<br><br>Isn't it interesting that the Bible, marvelous and wonderful as it is, has not by itself been able to develop and sustain in so many individuals a deep, clear-cut, lasting, and unvarying commitment to the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ? Paul, who was witness to the resurrected Jesus, warned of such a crippled Christianity when he said : "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable" (1 Corinthians 15:19). If Jesus had not rescued us from death, there would be ultimate misery. If his ministry is viewed as merely mortal, it is robbed of its real relevance. In the midst of such doctrinal disarray stands the church of Jesus Christ, proclaiming the divinity of Jesus of Nazareth. No wonder there is such a sharp reaction from the forces of him who sought the Saviorship for himself.<br><br>Jude warned of insidious disbelievers. He said,<br><br><i>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>[Jude 4]<br><br>Clearly, the Book of Mormon was needed as an added witness in these, the decades of deep doubt. Clearly, the theophany at Palmyra puts to rout all the chatter about the historicity of Jesus; it ended all the theological fuzziness about the nature of the Godhead.<br><br>The Lord said of the scriptures and the words of his prophets something that is so fundamental about the ecology of belief. He said, "He that will not believe my words will not believe me--that I am" (Ether 4:12). Thus the Book of Mormon came like a theological thunderbolt on the stage of history--to be a second witness for the divinity of Jesus Christ "to the<i>convincing</i>of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ" (Title page, Book of Mormon; italics added). Note the word "convincing." The Bible often initiates and helps to sustain faith in Jesus, but the Book of Mormon is the<i>convincer</i>and the<i>clarifier</i>. Isn't it ironical in this regard that there are some who still wonder if members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are Christians? Was General Douglas MacArthur a West-Pointer? Was Winston Churchill an Englishman?<br><br>We are Christ's kingdom builders. Those who build the heavenly kingdom have always made nervous the people who are busy building worldly kingdoms. The inspired translation of the Bible gives us a rendition of Matthew, chapter 6, verse 33, with fourteen additional words that give us a great clue to our role as kingdom-builders. What we read in the King James Version is a helpful and motivating, but still puzzling, verse which says, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." I shall now read to you that verse (Matthew 6:33; italics added) as it appears in the inspired translation of Joseph Smith: "Wherefore, seek not the things of this world; but<i>seek ye first</i>to build up<i>the kingdom of God, and</i>to establish<i>this righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."</i>This is but one example of how plain and precious things are missing from the King James translation, marvelous though it is, an inspired book which has survived so much and yet with such strength and beauty.<br><br>Christians who worship a resurrected Jesus Christ (a Jesus who not only lived but lives) and who believe in the sermon at Capernaum and the sermon on the Mount are kingdom-builders. When such individuals, clothed in the purple of the holy priesthood, preach Christ crucified<i>and</i>Christ resurrected, and when such people become increasingly effective in kingdom-building, indeed "all hell is moved."<br><br>It would be so much safer to float with the ebbing theological tides as do so many today who simply regard Jesus as a Galilean Gandhi or as a Socrates who strode in Samaria. But we know Jesus to be divine, the literal Son of the Father. We know that he established his church, and that it is not simply a church built upon doctrinal debris from other dispensations or fragments of the faith from another age. It is a church built upon the fulness of his gospel; it bears his name and is his kingdom in these latter days, a kingdom to which the good men and women of all nations, cultures, and races will be drawn. Knowing this, we are like Joseph Smith--we speak the truth because we can do no other.<br><br>How can we expect to be a part of such momentous developments as these and yet expect to pass unnoticed so far as the people of the world are concerned? Surely we will not pass unnoticed in our righteous endeavors so far as the adversary is concerned. In 1820 he noticed an obscure teenage lad going into an obscure grove to pray--of all the prayers offered that day, why bother that boy? But it was sufficiently clear to Satan what was about to transpire. Is it any wonder that those who resist the building of the latter-day kingdom will, from time to time (as described in Ether, chapter 8, or the 38th section of the Doctrine and Covenants), act in "combinations" against the kingdom? Everything in the arsenal of the adversary will eventually be used.<br><br>Now, having been briefly descriptive, let me for these closing moments be prescriptive. Let us not be dismayed if the critics of the kingdom exploit our personal errors and work on our individual weaknesses and pounce upon our failures. Let us not forget that the meridian-day saints also knew what it was like when "all hell is moved."<br><br>Let us minimize our personal errors which enemies could exploit. Let us conquer the weaknesses which critics could work upon. Let us be harmless, so that we go not forth on ego excursions that damage others, for we are people-builders as well as kingdom-builders. Let our citizenship be spirited but always appropriate and befitting who we are. Let us approach power and authority as the Lord prescribed in the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Let us be articulate, for while our defense of the kingdom may not stir all hearers, the absence of thoughtful response may cause fledglings among the faithful to falter. What we assert may not be accepted, but unasserted convictions soon become deserted convictions.<br><br>The reactions to us will vary: there will be the almost Agrippas, the puzzled Pilates, the timid Van Burens, and the stout Colonel Kanes, and, of course, there will be some scorn and some rage. But deep within the rage and the scorn, if one listens closely, are the sounds of profound pain, hushed hope, and of doubt beginning to doubt itself. Sometimes the chastening that comes to us individually is at least partially deserved. We would not really want a loving Father to stop teaching us and correcting us. Other times the chastening will be underserved; but, said the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord will "have a tried people," and "He would purge them as gold" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, p. 135).<br><br>Let your education be emancipating in all the correct ways, but also in another very subtle way, a way clearly related to your role in the tempestuous times before you. I refer to the need to understand the principle of obedience, which has fallen on hard times; obedience is low on the world's scale of values. There are causes for this, of course. Some have done terribly wrong things in obedience to unjust leaders. Some have engaged in senseless subordination to bad causes, becoming mere satellites in mindless orbits. Satan always pretzelizes principles in order to increase human misery.<br><br>But obedience is so essential for the gospel journey; it must be rescued from the careless conclusions reached by sloppy intellects. The tests of obedience are always "to whom?" and "to what?" Obedience is not blind faith but following the glimpses we get when seeing with the eye of faith. Obedience is not shrinking from adventure and agency; it is an opening up. Obedience is not being glad to have someone else relieve us of our responsibility. Obedience to correct principles is leaping free of constraints such as fear and ignorance. Obedience will push us into adventures and experiences that free us both from prejudice toward certain people and from prejudice toward certain principles.<br><br>Obedience springs from intellectual integrity in that it causes us to be honest and to own up to the validity of precious experiences. Studied closely, the episode involving Adam and his sacrifice will suggest to us that the quality of Adam's previous experiences with the Lord (and probably with angels) was so reliable that when he was asked why he sacrificed, he could reply, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me" (Moses 5:6). For Adam to have excluded his previous experiences from his decision to be obedient would have been dishonest.<br><br>Obedience on our part can bring us face to face with new challenges which we need but do not want, challenges from which we may even be running away. Obedience helps us to pioneer beyond the past. Logic may look and tell us that the mountains ahead of us are stern Sierras, but obedience will cause us to press forward anyway over what finally prove to be simply rolling hills.<br><br>Therefore, practice emancipating obedience! Do not let your moods maul your faith. Do not allow the absence of social life and dates to color your attitude toward your rendezvous with the resurrection. Do not let a bad day cause you to think that life is bad. Do not let low self-esteem discount your high blessings. In short, do not homogenize your hopes by mixing and treating them as if all hopes and aspirations are equal. They are not. The hope for a resurrection is guaranteed unconditionally by the atonement of the Savior. The hope for a good grade on an exam is quite obviously a hope of a different order; it is of much less significance and it is by no means guaranteed.<br><br>Our transitory disappointments are real, but the missing letter from home is not really comparable to the delivered message from heaven, the good news of the gospel. Today's unmet hunger for a few more friends must not be allowed to obscure the marvelous reality of the forever friendship of Jesus for each of us. Do not let uncertainty about how others seem to feel about you this week get in the way of how God has always felt about you.<br><br>Our intertwining insecurities, the hunger for peer reassurance, and the tendency to be carried on the tides of today's troubles and disappointments will diminish as we mature. As our understanding of the gospel deepens, it becomes ever more clear that proximate problems need not, and must not, undercut ultimate realities. Thus, as we confront problems which we might shiveringly sidestep, if we could, let us realize, as one poet did, that "sometimes the only way to go is through." We go on that journey with justified hopes to help our hunger and with realities to reassure us. And, in the midst of our transitory troubles, we have the knowledge that he is near at hand, and within us there is even the sense that in the dim past we agreed to all this and that now we must perform on that pledge.<br><br>I salute you as kingdom-builders and as a generation of destiny. A whole nation can be leavened by a righteous rising generation--or, as we lamentably read of another group of young adults; "thus . . . the Lamanites . . . began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation" (3 Nephi 1:30). You bright spirits could not have chosen a better time to be born, with more neighbors waiting and needing to be shown the gospel. I know you have been properly placed because God did it.<br><br>How can we remain silent when we know that there will come a time, as the scriptures have foretold, when there will be a great sign in heaven and that all flesh shall see Christ together (See D&amp;amp;C 88:93, D&amp;amp;C 101:23)? No wonder we rejoice! No wonder we reach out! No wonder we stand all amazed whenever the light of the everlasting gospel lights up a soul, denoting the dawn of a new discipleship. Hopefully we will never cease to thrill, as did Ammon, when "the light of everlasting life was lit up" in the soul of Kind Lamoni (Alma 19:6). Meanwhile, it is important that we be as righteous as we can be, so that no one is deflected from discipleship because of us and our errors.<br><br>As the veil of unbelief thickens around the globe, nothing can rend "the dark veil of unbelief" (Alma 19:6) that is not sharp, piercing, bright, and true. Dull disciples will not light the way nor draw people to the kingdom. The philosophies of the world cannot do it, for so far as having some saving and consequential core to them, such philosophies are like peeling an onion. Perhaps that is why we cry when we peel onions. The truths we seek to live and to share are sweet, reassuring, and redeeming. But they are also tough truths; they keep us up against things that really matter. And central to all of these truths is the declaration of the Savior himself in which he said, "Behold, . . . I am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world" (Ether 4:12). These are not the words of some Buddha born in Bethlehem; these are the words of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>We say (without tying it to any sense of personal vindication) what Paul said: that the time will come "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . . and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" (Philippians 2:10–11).<br><br>We know, as a Book of Mormon prophet said, that<br><br><i>At the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</i>[Mosiah 27:31]<br><br>Yea, even those "who live without God in the world" will also one day kneel in confession of Christ, acknowledging not only the reality of God in the world but also his justice and his love.<br><br>The gift of immortality to all mankind through the reality of the Resurrection is so powerful a promise that our rejoicing in these great and generous gifts should drown out any sorrow, assuage any grief, conquer any mood, dissolve any despair, and tame any tragedy. Those who now see life as pointless will one day point with adoration to the performance of the Man of Galilee in those crowded moments of time known as Gethsemane and Calvary. Those who presently say life is meaningless will yet applaud the Atonement which saves us from meaninglessness. Christ's victory over death ended the human predicaments, and from these too we may be rescued by following the teachings of him who rescued us from general extinction.<br><br>Our "brightness of hope," therefore, means that at funerals our tears are genuine, but not because of termination--rather because of interruption. Though just as wet, our tears are not of despair but are of appreciation and anticipation. Yes, for disciples, the closing of a grave is but the closing of a door which later will be flung open with rejoicing.<br><br>We say, humbly but firmly that it is the garden tomb--not life--that is empty.<br><br>That fiery sphere we call the sun, which guides our solar system, will one day burn out, but it provides us with a useful analogy. We may cover our eyes or turn from its light, but its light is still there. We may see it through glass darkly, but it glows on just as brightly. For a few hours we call night it seems to be gone, but it is still shiningly there and will reappear on the morrow. Storms may darken the sky at noonday, but the sun is still there and will soon break through.<br><br>So it is with the Son of God, about whom this choir has sung so well today. We may turn from him, but he is still there. We may feel that he is hidden from us because of the cloud cover of our concerns, but he is still close to us. We--not he--let something come between us, but no lasting eclipse need ensue. Our provincialism cannot withstand his universalism. Our disregard of him is no match for his love of us. Yes, Jesus of Nazareth lived! He lives now! He guides his Church!<br><br>True, all hell may be moved, but as it moves, the devil's kingdom will be irrevocably shaken, so that many can be shaken loose from his grasp. It is the kingdom of heaven that is coming--triumphant, true, and everlasting! God grant that we may each be faithful to all the assignments given to us during our premortal preparation for these dramatic days, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Neal A. Maxwell was a President of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 8 November 1977.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Given a Law Unto All Things - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I listen with great interest to your president's instructions on what to do at a ball game. President, I see that you follow that counsel, but it should be expanded just a little. I noticed on one call last night that you said, "Oh! Oh! Oh, no!"<br><br>I wanted to add my tribute to these great athletes, the cross-country and the football teams. I had the experience this year of returning to my alma mater and watching a football game at Logan for the first time, I guess, since I graduated. I grew up in a most remarkable family: my father graduated from the University of Utah, my mother started her college career at Brigham Young College, and all their children went to Utah State. That means every time there has been an athletic contest involving Utah teams it has always been a period of unusual excitement among our family. I want you to know, however, that I have really been converted--I sat on the BYU side in Logan and didn't cheer once for the Aggies. Stake presidents that have been with me when a football game is going on during a stake conference session on Saturday afternoon have always wondered why all the notes come to me during the meeting. I always have someone out in a car listening to the game to pass me the score every time it changes.<br><br>The fall season of 1977 has had the General Authorities encouraging the membership of the Church to become more involved in missionary service. As part of our Saturday evening session of stake conferences, we have shown the film,<i>Go Ye into All the World.</i>The film has presented President Kimball instructing us in our missionary responsibilities; and his vision, as he explains the growth of the kingdom, has touched me deeply. In this film he states, "The Lord will place in our hands inventions which will almost be impossible for us to comprehend," and, "Who can say what other miracles the Lord has prepared for us?"<br><br>Each time I hear these statements, I am thrilled with the vision of our Prophet. In a reflective mood and thinking of his prophetic statements, I was reading the Doctrine and Covenants the other night. In the 88th section these words stood out:<br><br><i>He comprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him, even God forever and ever.</i><br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons;</i><br><br><i>And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:41–43]<br><br>I marvel, as I am privileged to study God's dealings with mankind, at how remarkably he has paved the way and provided the means for his children to learn of his ways. I would like to walk you through just a brief period of history today with the objective of showing you how the Lord has prepared the way for you, the most advanced generation in all times, to assist him in the final stages of his kingdom-building process.<br><br>The scriptures have recorded the story of God's dealings with mankind for centuries. The Old Testament deals with the history of the Hebrew nation as it records the preparations of the world for the Messiah. Starting with low, scattered notes, it expands as time passes with enlarging crescendo into clear, loud, trumpeting tones as the King approaches. Meanwhile, God in his providence is making ready the nations: Greece is spreading a common language throughout much of the earth; Rome is making one empire out of the whole world and the Roman roads make much of it accessible; the dispersion of the Jews among nations paves the way for the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Savior came to a world with limited opportunity for travel and communications. Cities were located on waterways, the seas and rivers which afforded the best means of travel. Transportation by water had developed from the log to the raft to the canoe, and then on to the sailboat, which offered the best means of moving great distances. Land travel was difficult with only a few roads, oft-times dangerous; most land travel was by foot, sometimes with the aid of domestic animals such as the dog, the horse, the donkey, the ox, and the camel.<br><br>Equally as difficult as travel problems in keeping the gospel pure and undefiled was the problem of communications, although picture writing had changed to alphabet forms and clay, rock, and metal tablets had given way to papyrus and parchment. Can you imagine how difficult it was to operate a Church in those days without our modern means of transportation and communications? My heart cries out to those early apostles as they sought to build the kingdom, realizing the problems they were facing. Just take the example of Paul as he left Ephesus, as recorded in the book of Acts. It states:<br><br><i>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</i><br><br>[Then he instructed the people thus:]<i>Take heed therefore unto ourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</i><br><br><i>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</i><br><br><i>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.</i><br><br><i>And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</i><br><br><i>And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,</i><br><br><i>Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship</i>[Acts 20: 16, 28–30, 36–38]<br><br>I can imagine what it was to leave those people, realizing that just one or two times would be the only opportunity Paul would ever have to visit their countries and their cities and their branches of the Church.<br><br>During the period of time between the preaching of the gospel following the Savior's mission and the restoration of the gospel, little progress was made in travel and communications. City sites were still on waterways, travel by water was still the best means to go great distances; domestic animals were still the chief means of travel overland. But dramatically, just before the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was just as if a bright light was turned on to illuminate the minds of mankind. After almost 1800 years of sluggish development, suddenly the fields of transportation and communications moved forward with a new exciting pace. In the field of communications, a machine was perfected in 1803 for making paper; by 1814, a cylinder press was developed. In the field of transportation, 1787 saw the first steamboat come into being. In 1804 the first steam railroad locomotive was constructed.<br><br>The Lord was preparing for the establishment of the gospel again on the earth for the last time, and starting preparation for the return of his Son. This time the Restoration was to be permanent. A support system would be developed that would keep everything in place. A means of transportation and communications would be established just before the growth of the Church to keep it nourished as the word of the Lord was revealed to his prophet and his children. The history of growth of transportation and communications is exciting to me as I study its development, for it parallels the growth of the Church. Review with me this remarkable history and see if it does not give you an added witness of God's dealings with his children as he prepares to spread the gospel to all parts of the earth.<br><br>On December 23, 1805, a son was born to Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith in a small, insignificant place called Sharon in Windsor County, Vermont. As the Lord prepared for his prophet to be an instrument in his hands in effecting the restoration of the gospel, the growth of printing and transportation proceeded. In 1822 beginnings were made in photography, and 1828 marked the publication of the first American dictionary. As technology was carefully placed to support the introduction and restoration of the gospel, so a prophet was being carefully prepared and groomed for the role he was to play. A portion of his story reads as follows:<br><br><i>Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion. It commenced with the Methodists, but soon became general among all the sects in that region of country. Indeed, the whole district of country seemed affected by it. . . .</i>[It]<i>created no small stir and division amongst the people, some crying, "Lo, here!" and others, "Lo, there!" Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some for the Presbyterian, and some for the Baptists.</i><br><br>[The clergy contended]<i>in order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to call it, let them join what sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off, some to one party and some to another . . . the seemingly good feelings . . . one for another, if they ever had any were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions.</i><br><br><i>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any . . . be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?</i>[Joseph Smith 2:5–7, 10]<br><br>Then he recounts his reading of the first chapter and the fifth verse of the book of James.<br><br>Joseph's inquisitive mind led him to retire to the Sacred Grove and the story we all know so well unfolds--the visitation of the Father and the Son to him in that spring of 1820. Here was explained to him his role in the restoration of the gospel. Though tested and tried during the next few years, he remained strong enough to be worthy of being entrusted with that sacred and holy calling.<br><br>Following the call came the delivery of the plates and the translation of the Book of Mormon. Now all was in readiness for the organization of the Church. On the designated date of April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and members of the Smith and Whitmer families met in the home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., in Fayette, Seneca County, New York. After appropriate songs and prayers the revelations concerning the organization of the Church were read to those assembled. These revelations set forth the order of the priesthood and the duties of the officers of the Church. Around this pattern the entire Church organization today has been built.<br><br>According to previous commandments the Prophet Joseph Smith called on the brethren present to know if they would accept him and Oliver Cowdery as their teachers in all things of the kingdom. This was approved by unanimous vote, after which the order of the Church was followed, where Joseph ordained Oliver an elder and Oliver ordained Joseph to that same office. The sacrament was administered and those who had previously been baptized were confirmed members of the Church, and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. Some enjoyed the gift of the prophecy and all rejoiced exceedingly.<br><br>Immediately following the organization of the Church, missionary efforts pressed forward. Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jr., were called to take the gospel to the Lamanites. A great desire was expressed by two recent converts to accompany them. So Ziba Peterson and Parley P. Pratt were also commissioned to make this first distant missionary journey. The first extended mission was one that was destined to influence the Church for many years as it proceeded after conference held in September of 1830. The mission of these four men caused them to travel on foot for more than 1,500 miles to the West. Parley P. Pratt had previously lived in the vicinity of Kirtland, Ohio, where he had been commissioned a minister for the Campbellite faith. One of his first acts on this missionary journey was to return to Kirtland. There he sought out Sidney Rigdon, his former pastor, and preached the gospel to him. He received it, and his congregation was also receptive to the message which they brought. By the time they left they had a thriving branch of twenty members, who were, in succeeding weeks, able to bring into the Church practically all of that religious group.<br><br>The beginnings were underway. The stone was beginning to roll forth. But with the grown came opposition. The Prophet moved the center of his operations from Ohio to Missouri, and was then driven to Illinois. By 1840 twelve stakes had been organized: one in Ohio, one in Iowa, two in Missouri, and eight in Illinois. The time had then come to expand the work over the great waters. The year 1839 saw members of the newly called Quorum of the Twelve Apostles preparing for missionary assignments. The expansion created a need for better travel and communications. The Lord was already preparing the way with new and advanced technology. Morse was developing the first telegraph system in 1837. The first crossing of the Atlantic by a steam-powered ship occurred in 1838. The railroad had started to grow in the United States and by 1840 there were 2,818 miles of track.<br><br>Then opposition struck at the very heart of this new Church: The Prophet was illegally imprisoned. On the 27th day of June of 1844, a mob stormed the jail and his life was taken. After the death of the Prophet, persecution became so intense that again it was necessary for the Saints to leave their homes and journey into a barren frontier. Under the leadership of Brigham Young, members of the Church moved forward across the Mississippi and on towards the West in the epic pioneer trek. Of the almost 70,000 who attempted the journey, about 9 percent were laid to rest along the way--a tremendous loss for a young, struggling church.<br><br>Again the Lord's hand was evident. The transcontinental railroad was completed near Promontory, Utah, in 1869. Now the Church had 100,000 members. The organization of stakes had to start all over again as they settled in the West. At the completion of the railroad, eight new stakes had been organized in Utah, and one in California. By the turn of the century in 1900, the Church membership had grown to 270,000 in forty-three stakes: twenty-eight located in Utah, thirteen in other parts of the continental United States, and two outside the continental United States in the colonies in Mexico and Canada.<br><br>The demands for better communication and transportation continued to grow; to be able to visit and travel to the growing number of members in the scattered stakes was necessary. Technology continued to keep pace. In 1885 the first transoceanic cable was laid. In 1876 a message from Bell to Watson introduced the telephone. In 1895 Marconi sent the first message by radio over the great distance of about one mile. The year 1889 saw the development of the first photographic film, 1894 the first motion picture projector. In the late 1890s, the first automobile came on the scene. Technology and Church growth continued to parallel each other. As the Church approached its 100th birthday in 1930, membership was now over one-half million in about one hundred stakes: sixty-one located in Utah, thirty-five in the balance of the continental United Sates, and four located outside the continental United States.<br><br>Innovations continued to supply needed requirements to nourish its growth. Between 1915 and 1920 long-distance telephone service was instituted among major cities. The first commercial radio station came on the air in 1920. Transportation continued to become easier and faster; the automobile, the railroad and the steamship expanded their service. This period also marked the beginning of air travel; 1903 saw the Wright brothers make their first successful attempt. The first commercial airline service started at the beginning of the twenties. By 1928 in the United States we had routes covering 14,155 air miles of passenger service.<br><br>While it required one hundred years to organize the first one hundred stakes, during the next twenty years the Church added the exceeded 1,000,000. This was the period of rapid Church expansion in the western United States. Forty-eight of those new stakes were still formed in Utah, but now more than half of the number, or 51, were formed in the rest of the continental United States, and one additional was added outside the continental United States. Only one-half the amount of time was needed to establish the next one hundred stakes. By 1960 the number had reached three hundred, and the membership had grown to 1,700,000. The new Utah stakes accounted for thirty-four of this third hundred organized, with another sixty-one in other parts of the continental United States, and now five outside the continental United States. This period marked the first organization of stakes overseas in New Zealand, Australia, and England.<br><br>The leadership and financial base had been established in the United States for the growth and expansion of the Church throughout the world. The Lord continued to prepare for this expansion with new technology to support its growth: television, airline routes--and Pan American established the first jet overseas travel to coincide exactly with the organization of the first overseas stake. The computer came into existence, and technology pressed forward so that the worldwide expansion could be accomplished. It was now possible to go to and from far-off places and communicate with a worldwide organization.<br><br>The 1960s saw the growth of the Church worldwide. During this decade the number of stakes doubled the number organized in the previous ten years. Two hundred stakes were organized during the sixties; the membership was now almost three million. Of the new stakes organized only twenty percent were from the state of Utah, sixty-two percent from the balance of the continental United States, and eighteen percent from outside the United States.<br><br>Now let us look for a minute into the future and see what will occur in the Church growth as we add up the results for the decade of the 1970s. By the time the Church reaches its 150th birthday on April 6, 1980, my personal projections would have the Church membership over 4,500,000: The number of stakes organized will be about 1,225. Only ten percent of those stakes organized during the seventies will come from the state of Utah; forty-five percent will be from the continental United States, and an equal number, or forty-five percent, will now come from outside the continental United States, Of the total number of stakes we will have at the end of the seventies, thirty-one percent will be outside the continental United States, forty-three percent in the continental United States excluding Utah, while Utah will account for twenty-six percent. What a dramatic change has occurred since the sixties! What a miracle is occurring in this period in communications and transportations! Within minutes we can contact any part of the world. Within hours the most distant stakes can be visited. As this remarkable growth continues in the decade of the eighties, a whole new set of challenges will be offered to the Church. If just one-half of our percentage growth continues, the membership will almost double during the next decade. The number of stakes outside the continental United States will equal more than half the total number of stakes.<br><br>I am privileged to stand before a group today whose members the Lord has selected to be the best trained of all the children he has ever sent to the earth. He is making the largest investment in you that he has ever made in the history of the world to produce his future leadership base. Our review of history this morning has demonstrated his hand in the establishment of the organization of the Church today. Most of the support structure in building his kingdom has come from resources outside the Church. Now, with this tremendous investment he is making in you, I wonder if that will not shift and he will expect more to come from this great institutional center. I wonder if the Lord will not expect you to carry a greater load in supplying the technology to sustain the growth of his kingdom in the years to come.<br><br>Could I suggest just a few problems that we will be facing in the next decade? First, the problem of language differences. As the Church expands worldwide, the mix between English-speaking and other languages continues to change. How inefficient it will be if we do not discover better ways to communicate! Second, the problem of training new leadership will be almost overwhelming. Most of the leaders in quorums, wards, stakes, and other places in the Church will be first-generation Mormons. The problem of training them and having them be effective in leadership will be enormous. Third, new and less expensive means of communication must be developed for the distant stakes, missions, regions, and areas, and we must find these to continue our growth. I am sure your fertile minds can think of many more.<br><br>I am encouraged with what I see in beginnings around this school. New discoveries are being made and worked on in energy sources. In this city new discoveries are being made to use the computer to increase our learning capacity and our learning capability. This University is wrestling with the problem of language differences, with some exciting results. These are beginnings, but I know the Lord is expecting more. What will your contribution be to make the return on the investment he is making in you, so that the Church can continue to expand as it grows worldwide? May God grant you the vision to see the potential there is within you, that you may become part of a team that will build and sustain the growth of his kingdom here on earth.<br><br>I know his hand is guiding and directing us here. God still stands at the helm; Jesus is the Christ; and Spencer W. Kimball is an instrument in his hands today to bring about this remarkable growth of his kingdom on earth. May God bless us that we may embark with great enthusiasm in accomplishing that which he would require of us in building his kingdom, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> Tanner: An Example to Follow - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I want you students to know that when a few of the favored were being applauded earlier and I received no applause you made me feel like a social reject. You can correct that if you like. [laughter and applause]<br><br>I told someone tonight that when President Tanner called yesterday and asked if I would fill in for him--please note, not take his place but fill in for him--I thought that I could best relate my feelings by telling you that I know how Marc Wilson, a BYU second-string quarterback, felt when they asked him to go in for All-American candidate Gifford Nielson. Marc, I just hope I can do nearly as well as you did as a substitute.<br><br>I am very sorry that President Tanner is unable to be with us tonight. He has a very bad cold. I hope he will be the beneficiary of your faith and prayers.<br><br>I am very pleased to be with you to demonstrate to President Tanner and others that I would do anything for him--even this! Tonight gives me an opportunity to talk about a subject that is very close to me. As the contents of my remarks unfold, you will quickly realize that if President Tanner knew what I am going to speak about he would not have allowed me to fill in for him.<br><br>While attending a mission presidents' seminar in South America about three weeks ago, I had the opportunity of associating with mission presidents and their wives and some of the missionaries. The usual question they asked was, "How is President Kimball?" and when I assured them he was well and vigorous as usual they said, "Give him our love when you return." Following these comments one of the mission presidents said in an open forum where people, principles, policies, and purposes were discussed, "Tell us about President N. Eldon Tanner." On that occasion in South America I was impressed to say--and I probably say it with more conviction tonight than I did three weeks ago, "President N. Eldon Tanner will go down in history as one of the greatest counselors ever to serve in the First Presidency of the Church."<br><br>For more than fourteen years President Tanner has served with four different presidents of the Church: David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Spencer W. Kimball. He will be eighty in May, and his performance today is solid and significant. As we think about the Christmas season, perhaps my gift to all of you would be the example of the life of President N. Eldon Tanner. Tonight I would like to share with you some of his traits and strengths, hoping that we can apply these principles in our daily lives for our total self-improvement.<br><br>First of all I would like to speak about the trait and strength of humility as I have found it in the life of President Tanner. As the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and other General Authorities have met in the upper room of the temple on a once-a-month basis, President Kimball has never failed to call upon President Tanner to bear his testimony at the conclusion of these meetings. How often I have heard him say, "What am I doing here? I have so little to offer; I feel like I'm the least among you." In a spirit of true humility he asks, "What am I doing here? What do I have to offer?" and he will follow it by saying, "Nevertheless, I pray every night and morning for God to help me to do my part." I have heard him say, "All I want to do in God's kingdom is do what he wants me to do." In modestly accepting compliments I have heard him say, "Now why would anyone want to say that about me?"<br><br>President N. Eldon Tanner closely follows the 112th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse ten: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers." We would serve ourselves and other well if we could humbly say, "I don't know why I've been called," or, if you please, "I don't know why I haven't been called, but I'm going to do the best I can." Brothers and sisters, students, leaders, do not let yourselves be concerned about your limitations or lack of talent; resolve positively with more vigor and determination tonight than ever before, "I may not be much; I may not have much going for me, but in his strength I can do all things." As I think of the life of this great man, I see that humility is not a weakness; humility is a strength. I have often heard President Tanner say, "God cannot answer our prayers unless we are humble."<br><br>President N. Eldon Tanner is known by his associates in and out of the Church as Mr. Integrity, a man of character, a man of quality, an advocate of self-discipline. Frequently in conference he has admonished, "Be honest. Don't be a hypocrite. Be what you should be." He is a man of few words and much performance. I have never heard him make a cheap or shabby remark. I have never seen him when he was not a gentleman, when he was not the personification of integrity.<br><br>My first contact with President N. Eldon Tanner was in Canada more than twenty years ago. We had called a thirty-minute meeting for 7:00 p.m., prior to the other meetings, just to meet with the stake presidents. I remember well that night when seven o'clock arrived--two of us were there. I was there and a man I had never met before, a President Tanner. I will never forget the remark and the lesson that I learned as I looked at my watch, saw that it was seven o'clock and asked this man I had never met before, "President Tanner, what do you suggest we do?"<br><br>He looked at me and replied, "You're here; I'm here; it's seven o'clock. Let's start."<br><br>Another great character strength of President Tanner is that he is a friend to member and nonmember alike, a friend in the fullest sense of the word. He is a lifter, a builder, a leader. He is comfortable in any type of setting. I have never seen him when he did not fit and when he did not make other people, no matter what the circumstances, feel welcome and happy to be in his company. President Tanner is willing to take you and me from where we are and help us go forward from that point.<br><br>We learn another great lesson shared by his secretary, LeRue Sneff. She has said that on occasion President Tanner has said to her, "In my office in the Church Office Building, I like to maintain such an atmosphere that those who come to call will go out feeling better than they did when they came in." You and I should resolve to lift our associates under all circumstances. In this day and age we too need to resist the temptation or the practice of cutting people down, even if we think they deserve it. I have never heard President Tanner cut anyone down. But I have often heard him say, when someone has fallen or disappointed, "Let's see what we can do to help him."<br><br>Speaking of friends, wherever, whenever, however, I will not soon forget an experience that took place about this time last year. My phone rang. President Tanner was on the line and he said, "I have a letter here this morning from one of the inmates at the Utah State Prison. He wants to talk to me about something. Do you think you could arrange with the warden for me to talk with this inmate on the phone? I don't think I'm going to have time to go and see him. Do you think you could arrange that?"<br><br>I said, "President Tanner, I think I can." I have a few connections in the Utah State Prison. I have spent a lot of time there--as a visitor. And by talking with Warden Smith I arranged for this man to come out of maximum security and have the use of a telephone to talk to a President Tanner who had time for him. I do not know what they talked about; I just made the appointment. I shared this instance with you to let you know that this is the kind of a man N. Eldon Tanner is--a friend regardless of where we are or what we have done.<br><br>We had a recent experience with a missionary in a missionary conference, and I think it can tie in well to the attitude and strength of President Tanner. We had approximately seventy-five missionaries for this meeting. We took the time to give opportunity for testimony bearing. I remember only one testimony very well. One young man stood up among his peers, grabbed hold of the front of the pew--I thought he was going to pull it out, he was so nervous--cleared his throat, and said, "I almost didn't come on a mission. One night I said to my dad, 'I don't know about this Joseph Smith business. I'm not even sure about this Spencer W. Kimball. I'm not even sure I want to go.'" We all turned around and looked at him, wondering what was going to happen next. He said, "When I said that to my father, my father got up from where he was seated. He turned on the light. He walked over and turned off the television. He smashed out his cigarette. He put down his can of beer, and he said, "Son, you know I don't do much about this church. You know I'm inactive, but I want you to know that I know Joseph Smith's a prophet of God, and I know that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet.'"<br><br>The elder said, "I love my dad. His comments made me want to go on a mission more than ever because I knew my dad would never be able to go and I had double duty to do. I've got to do a mission for myself and one for my dad." How easy it would have been for him to say, "What chance do I have?" with a father who was completely inactive! I think of President N. Eldon Tanner when I think of that kind of a situation, of how many boys and girls he has helped to straighten their priorities and thinking so that family conditions and environment do not diver their ways.<br><br>I would like to say a word or two about this great man as he relates to vision and vigor. A tireless, dedicated leader, he is about his Father's business early and late. I say without reservation that I have never met a man with greater judgment or superior wisdom.<br><br>In an honor banquet in Salt Lake City last Thursday evening to recognize the lives and performances of J. Willard and Alice Marriott, for whom this building we meet in tonight is named, President Tanner, in paying one of the tributes to these great members and friends of the Church, said,<br><br><i>It is not because of the money the Marriotts have made or the great number of hotels they have built that we respect them and admire them; it is because of the kind of lives they live. They have adopted the code, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you," and have lived it continually. The Church has benefited greatly by them and their aid in the building of temples, chapels, buildings, and other things and assisting worldwide in the great missionary effort.</i><br><br>Could we as students, as we pursue proper priorities with vision and vigor, recall President N. Eldon Tanner's comment that I have heard him make when there have been mighty decisions and responsibilities to perform: "All we have to do is what is right. "Thank the Lord that he believes in doing that which is right, rather than that which is only expedient.<br><br>President Tanner is a great husband, a wonderful father, and a worthy son. His loyal and supportive wife is his sweetheart and companion. All you have to do is be around President and Sister Tanner to see that they enjoy being with each other. She is his greatest advocate. Recently I heard one of their daughters say, "All through Daddy's life he has found time for us and has always made us feel important." President Tanner often gives thanks to a father and a mother who taught him to work and have lofty goals. He said, "My Father taught me the virtue of dependability." May I share with you a teaching experience that President Tanner had with one of his daughters and her girlfriend. President Tanner said,<br><br><i>Let me relate a little story that I have told all over the Church. My daughter and her girl friend were at our house, and they were going to a party; then two young men came and called for them. I sat and talked to them about different things, and just before they were ready to leave, I said, "Now have a good time, kids." But just as they were going out of the door, I stepped over to my daughter and said, "Now, behave yourself."</i><br><br><i>And she said, "Well, Dad, make up your mind."</i><br><br><i>Then I said to those young people so they could all hear me, "Have a good time, kids, the best time you will ever have in your lives, but the kind of time that tomorrow, next week, a month from now or a year from now, ten years from now, you can look back on tonight and say, 'I had a good time' and have nothing to regret or to be sorry about." And I think they went out and had a good time.</i>[N. Eldon Tanner,<i>Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God,</i>p. 3]<br><br>I wish we could learn that great lesson. How will you and I feel about today's conduct tomorrow? Give God the joy of loving you at your best.<br><br>President Tanner has been selfless in service. In responding to the tribute paid him by President Tanner and others, Brother J. Willard Marriott said, "President Tanner, you are a prime example of what a true Latter-day Saint can do for his Church. When you came to Salt Lake City from Canada as a General Authority you built a new home; before the paint was dry you were called to serve a mission in Europe. Your service to the Church has always been outstanding."<br><br>President Tanner has always taken the time to serve in the community, the home, and the Church, whether it has been convenient or not. He was elected to the Alberta, Canada, provincial government and was named Speaker of the House. He then served in the provincial cabinet as head of the Department of Lands and Mines, one of the most important positions in Canadian government. In Church and community businesses, his skill and wisdom continue to benefit millions. He is truly a man among men.<br><br>As I now read some well-known lines to you, would you please note how well they meet the philosophy and creed of President Tanner. Also note how all of us, beginning today, can apply the truths and the challenges shared. Whenever I hear these words spoken or sung, I think of President N. Eldon Tanner.<br><br><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i><br><i>Have I helped any one in need?</i><br><i>Have I cheered up the sad, and made someone feel glad?</i><br><i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i><br><br><i>Has any one's burden been lighter today,</i><br><i>Because I was willing to share?</i><br><i>Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?</i><br><i>When they needed my help was I there? . . .</i><br><br><i>There are chances for work all around just now,</i><br><i>Opportunities right in our way;</i><br><i>Do not let them pass by, saying, "Sometime I'll try,"</i><br><i>But go and do something today.</i><br><br><i>'Tis noble of man to work and to give,</i><br><i>Love' labor has merit alone;</i><br><i>Only he who does something is worthy to live,</i><br><i>The world has not use for the drone.</i><br><br><i>Then wake up, and do something more</i><br><i>Than dream of your mansions above:</i><br><i>Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,</i><br><i>A blessing of duty and love.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>no. 58]<br><br>President Tanner is a Christian gentleman; a courteous, kind, and capable prophet of God; a special witness of the Savior Jesus Christ; a man who rightly sits on the right-hand side of the prophet Spencer W. Kimball; a man whose declaration "I know President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God" carries profound significance, because who among earthly men knows the prophet better? I thank my Heavenly Father for the life and the example of President N. Eldon Tanner. I pray that all of us will try to incorporate in our lives the wonderful traits he exemplifies for us in his life. I would like you, brothers and sisters, to know that I love this great man with all my heart. I sustain and support him. I promise you success and happiness in life, each of you, if you will follow his example<br><br>I leave you my testimony that these are the things that are important in life; these are the gifts at Christmastime that are eternal. If I know President Tanner, the next few weeks will be spent visiting those who are not expecting him; maybe people like those who study under different conditions and with different challenges than you, even those at American Fork--those who have challenges mentally and physically. I have an idea that there are going to be people in that Utah State Prison who will hear from him. I am sure that he would encourage us at this Christmastime to make it a point to be friendly with an unfriendly neighbor, and I can hear him say, "The only unfriendly neighbors we have are those that we do not know very well." I think we will find him going to the hospital, writing letters to missionaries who do not have parents, calling on those who are widows and those who have tragedy come. These are the measures of greatness that we find in this wonderful man.<br><br>Again, let me thank you for the opportunity of being with you. I leave you my witness at this time of year that Jesus is the Christ and that God lives, and he knows you, and he wants to hear from you. These things I declare humbly and in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>he Creator - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is truly a great pleasure, my brothers and sisters, to be with you here today, to feel the power of your influence and your presence, and to hear this most beautiful music. It is in the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of testimony, that I come to you here today. I wish to bear testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave us Christmas.<br><br>Nearly all of you are Latter-day Saints and you know the meaning of testimony. Most of you have borne your testimonies from time to time, and I have borne mine in many parts of the world. We are a people of testimony, just as we are a people of covenants. As Latter-day Saints we have a responsibility to bear a particular kind of testimony--all of us. And what is that testimony?<br><br>First of all, that God lives, that he is truly our Eternal Father and we are his literal spirit offspring. Second, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the Savior of the World, and that he has a modern ministry as well as an ancient one, and that you and I--all of us--are involved in that modern ministry. Third, that Joseph Smith was raised up in these last days and especially chosen as an instrument through whom the Lord would introduce his modern ministry to the world. And fourth, that following Joseph Smith there has been an unbroken line of prophets who have carried on his work and will continue to do so. These are the mighty facts of which we may bear testimony.<br><br>But we are also a people of covenants. The Jews are spoken of as the covenant race, and in a sense they are, inasmuch as they were descended from Abraham. But we, the Latter-day Saints, are doubly so, not only because we also are descendants of the Tribes of Israel, but because we personally have made many covenants with God.<br><br>What are the covenants that we ourselves have made? The first, of course, was in baptism, wherein we took upon ourselves the name of Christ and there pledge that we would serve him and keep his commandments. Then we accepted the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and therein we bore testimony once again to the existence of God and our belief in him, and we pledged always to remember the Savior and to keep his commandments which he has given unto us. The brethren enter into a covenant with God as they receive the holy priesthood, for under that ordination they agree--we all agree--that we will live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. And then we have other ordinances, and each one of them has a covenant attached.<br><br>Altogether, in every sense, we are the covenant people of God, pledged to serve him and to help establish his kingdom here on the earth. But what do we do with these covenants? Are we prone to set them aside in our busy lives and forget them? Or do we actually take them seriously, and put God first in our lives? Each day we must choose whom we will serve, whether we will preserve our allegiance to God or whether we will drift away.<br><br>I often ask myself why so many people go the worldly way. Why do so few, relatively speaking, join the ranks of Christ? As I have studied the records of people who have become inactive in the Church, I have become convinced that, for the most part, they are inactive because they know little or nothing about the Lord Jesus Christ or his gospel. Therefore, they have never learned to love him, nor to appreciate his pattern of success in life, not to comprehend in any measure his great power.<br><br>Who is Jesus Christ that we should be concerned about him? Is he related in any way to our life here on earth? Why are we alive anyway? What is the reason for our existence? What is its purpose? How does Christ fit into it all? These questions come down to the basic concepts over which both scientists and religionists have struggled for years. But we Latter-day Saints need not struggle over them, for we have received the answers by revelation. It is this that separates us from the world. Revelation makes us different and gives us special status.<br><br>We need not be disturbed by the hypothetical teachings of men, brilliant and scholarly though they may be. Although they search diligently, these men admit that they have no final answers to the basic questions of life. They seek earnestly, gathering a few data here and there, making their deductions, revising them from time to time, and hoping that in the end they may arrive at the truth. But we who have revelation already know the facts about our existence, and they all relate to God.<br><br>What does revelation say? It tells us that Almighty God was the Creator, and that he has revealed the truth about the origin of life and all else in creation. He himself says, "And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten" (Moses 1:33). Then it was through Christ that the Creation came to be. No true believer will reject these words, for they are revelation.<br><br>Note that the Almighty here declares that he had a purpose in creation: "And I also created them for mine own purpose." How often have the scientists debated the question of whether or not there is any evidence of purpose in creation! Some doubt, but many agree that there is. Having seen obvious purpose in creation, and to some extent seeing its significance, they ask: Could the uniformity we note in all nature, the mathematical precision which characterizes the movements of stars and planets, and the distinct evidence of planning as seen throughout the universe be the result of an accident? Could all this possibly exist without some great purpose?<br><br>These scholars have said that inasmuch as there is manifest purpose in creation, there must be, of necessity, what they call a<i>Purposer;</i>and since there is not purpose without personality, then, they say further that the complexity of nature proclaims the existence of an infinite mathematical mind, and this mind they call God (see Alfred G. Fisk,<i>The Search for Life's Meaning,</i>pp. 89–98).<br><br>Others, as you know, refuse to believe, and see nothing in the cosmos but the result of accident or coincidence. But as the great Albert Einstein said: ". . . The harmony of natural law . . . reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection" (Albert Einstein,<i>The World As I See It,</i>pp. 267–68). Dr. Oscar Leo Brauer, physicist at San Jose State, said:<br><br><i>Science can establish that a creative act at some time must have taken place, implying the existence of . . . a Divine Power. Science can also establish that none but a Divine Intelligence could have been the Author of the tremendous, involved and intricate system of laws in the universe.</i>[John Clover Monsma, ed.,<i>The Evidence of God in an Expanding Universe,</i>p. 84]<br><br>There was a creation. There was a divine Creator, and that Creator was Jesus Christ. God's purpose in creation, of course, was to make a suitable dwelling place for us, his children, where we might begin our development toward becoming like him; for we can become like him, and are so commanded. As God spoke to Moses he declared that it was through his Son, Jesus Christ, that creation came about. And the Bible, of course, agrees with that.<br><br>The King James translation says that "all things were made by him [that is, by Jesus Christ]; and without him was not any thing made that was made" (John 1:3). The more modern American Translation by Smith and Goodspeed reads like this for the first part of the gospel of John: "In the beginning the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was<i>Divine</i>" (John 1:1, italics added). The New World Translation has it read: "In (the) beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word<i>was a god</i>" (John 1:1; italics added).<br><br>To continue with the Smith and Goodspeed translation, we have:<br><br><i>In the beginning the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was divine.</i><br><br><i>It was he that was with God in the beginning.</i><br><br><i>Everything came into existence through him, and apart from him nothing came to be.</i><br><br><i>It was by him that life came into existence . . .</i>[John 1:1–4]<br><br>Note again what it says about the Savior as the Creator: "Everything came into existence through him, and apart from him nothing came to be." These are amazing declarations. So the scriptures teach that everything came into existence through Jesus Christ and it came about with full<i>advance</i>planning and purpose. The purpose was that this was a first step in our becoming like God.<br><br>Now note what the scripture says about the origin of life, which so many believe was but a spontaneous chemical reaction from inanimate objects. It is important to keep this scripture in mind, for under no circumstance did life ever spring from nonlife--not ever from any inanimate substance. Zero plus zero equals zero; no life plus no life equals no life.<br><br>The origin of life was planned in advance and with a clear purpose by Almighty God himself. Note again the words of the scriptures: "It was by him that life came into existence." Ponder those words. What I read is from a modern translation of the sacred scriptures, put in present-day understandable English, teaching clearly that it was by Jesus Christ that life came into existence. So you see that the creation of life was a premeditated act of God.<br><br>May I make this crystal clear: Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, created all things under the direction of his Father, including life, and he did so according to a preconceived plan. He was the Creator of heaven and earth. This is the position we Latter-day Saints must take with respect to Jesus Christ. If we truly believe in him, we must believe his doctrine, and this is the doctrine of Christ. Are we willing to believe it? Are we willing to be Christians within the framework of this definition? I testify to you humbly as a servant of Christ--but also as one of his special witnesses--that these things are true.<br><br>How do we further identify Jesus? The scripture says that "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). Jesus was born in Bethlehem on that first Christmas, and the heavens rejoiced at his birth. Isaiah had predicted his coming by saying:<br><br><i>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</i>[Isaiah 9:6]<br><br>Note this identification given us by Isaiah: Jesus, though now a mortal child, was still the mighty God. He had achieved divinity in his preexistence, and it was not taken from him in his mortal birth.<br><br>And what did Matthew call him? "Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us" (Matthew 1:23). Significant, isn't it? And what did Luke call him? "The Son of the Highest, . . . the Son of God" (Luke 1:32, 35). And how did the angels speak of him? As "a Savior, . . . Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11).<br><br>As Savior, he gives us the gospel, through which we may be saved by his blood shed on the cross. As Redeemer he gives us immortality through the Resurrection. He overcame death and the grave. Only a God could do that, and he was "the mighty God," as Isaiah so clearly said.<br><br>No power known to science can bring about the resurrection of the dead. And yet the Resurrection to us is a demonstrated fact. The fact of immortality in and of itself is vital proof that God lives, that he is the Creator, and that all life originated with him.<br><br>Our knowledge of immortality is indisputable. Our indisputable knowledge of immortality gives us equally indisputable proof of the divine genesis of all things mortal. It testifies that there was no accident involved in the origin of life.<br><br>No inanimate substance can produce life, as we have seen. Try as the scientists have to prove it otherwise, all of their experiments have established that inanimate substances remain inanimate and cannot produce mortal life even in microscopic form. Then neither can inanimate substances bring forth immortal life. Inanimate substances are as powerless to produce immortal life as they are to produce mortal life. If they could make mortal life, they would have to be given credit for making immortal life also, for life is life, whether mortal or immortal, and both are well known to us. Every portion of life comes from God, whether it be preexistent life, mortal life, the life of the departed spirit, of resurrected life. All life comes from God.<br><br>This is something our men of learning are prone to forget or to reject as they reject religion altogether. Immortality, however, is something that they must deal with. They cannot ignore it, nor can they disprove it. It is here and it is real. But immortality is proof positive of the correct status of creation and establishes that it is of divine origin.<br><br>How do we know there is immortality? For us, as I say, it is a demonstrated fact, for men have come back from the dead to us to prove it. Our whole religion is based on the principle of men coming back from the grave and ministering to us here on earth. Some may ask, were these visitations from the other world but mystic illusions? Were they the product of someone's overactive imagination? Or were they truly in genuine physical reality?<br><br>When Moroni came to the Prophet Joseph Smith, did he not hold the gold plates of the Book of Mormon in his flesh-and-bone hands? Could a spirit or an apparition of any kind hold a set of gold plates that were afterward handled by mortal men? Those plates were heavy. It took physical hands to hold them and to turn over the pages. But Moroni did just that. He was a physical, literal being of flesh and bones come back from the dead. He came here proving the fact of everlasting life. Moroni was a real physical being who came to the earth in 1823 and annually for four more years thereafter, although he had lived in mortality and passed away some fourteen hundred years previously. Then did he not come back from the dead?<br><br>Consider the Book of Mormon. That book as now published is itself physical proof of immortality because it was only through an immortal visitation that we obtained it. But it is a physical product which anyone may hold in his hands and read. The plates from which it was translated were equally real; the three witnesses and the eight witnesses to the Book of Mormon give testimony of that. Did not eight honest men say that<br><br><i>as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands. . . . And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken.</i>[Book of Mormon, "The Testimony of Eight Witnesses"]<br><br>But these plates came from Moroni, and Moroni was immortal and came from the other world. Then the existence of the Book of Mormon becomes physical evidence of the fact of immortality.<br><br>When John the Baptist came to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, what happened? He placed his flesh-and-bone, resurrected hands on the heads of those two young men as he ordained them to the Aaronic Priesthood. They felt the pressure and the weight of those hands upon their heads, as they themselves declared, the resurrected hands of flesh and bone--the hands of John the Baptist come back from the dead. Could those young men feel the hands of an apparition? Could anyone? But they did feel the resurrected hands of John the Baptist. Does not this further establish the fact of immortality?<br><br>Peter, James, and John came back from the other world and delivered the keys of the holy apostleship. It was another contact between the visible and the invisible worlds. They were therefore physical witnesses of immortality. But more than that: they came as special witnesses, as the ancient apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore their appearance bore a personal testimony on their part to the existence of the Lord himself and the Lord's physical reality. Their coming to Joseph Smith was evidence also of the truthfulness of the teachings of the Savior, and of his work. And of what work? Why, the Creation, of course--the creation of all things. For Christ was the Creator.<br><br>Inasmuch as the coming of these original apostles bore testimony of Christ as the Creator, it also bore testimony of the teaching that life originated with the Savior and not with some combination of amino acids and other inanimate things. One of them--John--recorded it as a part of his Gospel. Do you see, then, how our evidence of immortality establishes our position with respect to the origin of life and the creation of the universe?<br><br>Elijah and Moses came back, physically, giving further testimony of the truth of all these teachings. May we mention Moses in particular: he came to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland temple and bestowed upon them the keys of the gathering of Israel, but his presence in that temple bore testimony also of the truthfulness of the work that Moses accomplished while he was living in mortality. Part of that work was the writing of the scriptures which gave the account of the Creation, identifying Almighty God as the origin of all life and the giver of all other good things. Moses received this knowledge, so that he could write about it, by divine revelation. God gave it to him; and therefore it was true.<br><br>Moses was the author of Genesis; he was also the author of the Book of Moses as revealed to Joseph Smith, and this was a modern revelation of Moses' work. Combined with the Book of Genesis it declares the truth of these writings unmistakably. Moses' appearance to Joseph Smith placed the seal of approval on all his writings, the seal of Almighty God who gave Moses the information so he could write it. And he gave the same information by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith. God sent Moses to Joseph Smith; would he have sent Moses as a special messenger if Moses were a fraud and his writings all myths? Is God inconsistent? Is he devious or deceitful?<br><br>Jesus Christ himself came to the Kirtland Temple, just as he had appeared previously with his Father in the grove near Palmyra, New York. His appearance, combined with the visitations of his servants, proves the truthfulness of the work of Christ, the truthfulness of the account of Jesus as written by Moses, and the fact that we are the children of God and not the offspring of lower forms of life.<br><br>It all declares, as if from the housetops, that we have divinity within us, with the full capability of sometime becoming like Almighty God himself, who is our Father. Do you not see that the appearance of angelic messengers to Joseph Smith solves many of the questions that have troubled our minds with regard to our identity and our origin? These messengers truly and literally came to the Prophet Joseph Smith. To this I bear you my solemn testimony.<br><br>Just as surely as our great scientists sent men to the moon and brought them back safely, just as surely as they sent a landing craft to the planet Mars that is still there performing miraculous experiments at a distance of some fifty million miles--just that surely did Moroni come from outer space and bring to Joseph Smith the plates of the Book of Mormon. Our scientific space experiments are dealing with outer space, are they not? So did Moroni's work. He did come to us from outer space and returned there after performing his work.<br><br>And just as surely as men went to the moon, John the Baptist, Peter, James, John, Moses, and Elijah all came from behind the veil, adequately proving the fact of immortality with all of its significant implications.<br><br>And just that surely did Jesus come to the grove near Palmyra, New York, with his Father, in the year 1820, again proving by a physical visitation the existence and reality of both God and Christ. And did not their coming to the Prophet Joseph Smith further establish the fact of the Creation? For there before him stood the two Almighty Beings who had accomplished the Creation and told him by revelation that they had accomplished it.<br><br>So when we testify of Christ, what do we mean? We testify of him as the divine Son of God. We testify of him as the Savior who died on Calvary. We testify of him as the Redeemer who broke the bands of death, giving to each of us a literal, physical resurrection. But is that all? What of his position as Creator? Do we not also testify of him in this important role?<br><br>Look into the sky on any clear night and study the stars. Can you count them? Read your books on astronomy. Are you not amazed at the multiplicity and the intricacy of the galaxies that reach farther into the heavens than the strongest telescopes can trace? In our own Milky Way galaxy, we are told, there are four hundred billion suns or stars as bright as our sun, and they all have their own satellites as our sun has its planets and moons.<br><br>Realize that our galaxy is but a part of a larger system made up of nineteen such galaxies as our Milky Way; and realize, too, that the astronomers tell us that the heavens themselves are so great that even this larger system, made up of nineteen organizations like our Milky Way, is just tucked away in one corner of the heavens.<br><br>And realize how vast, then, creation is, and know that it was all made by Jesus Christ, who died on the cross, who was raised in resurrection on the third day, who came to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1820, who reestablished his Church on the earth in 1830, and who now in 1977 asks you and me to believe in him and accept him.<br><br>That is the way in which we Latter-day Saints must regard Jesus Christ--not alone as the Babe of Bethlehem, not alone as the great Sacrificial Lamb who wrought out the Atonement on the cross, but also as Creator of heaven and earth. Think of the debt we owe to him. At this Christmas time will we truly remember him and worship him? Will we determine more than ever to be loyal to him and his Church, and to his teachings?<br><br>I testify to you--as one of his humble servants, but as one of his chosen Twelve, as one of his special witnesses--that he lives and that we too can live gloriously if we will but serve him and keep his commandments. Like Job of old, I, too,<br><br><i>know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth;</i><br><br><i>And though after my skin worms</i>[or any other form of dissolution or decay]<i>destroy this body, yet in my flesh</i>[my resurrected flesh]<i>shall I see God:</i><br><br><i>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.</i>[Job 19:25–27]<br><br>And this may be your testimony likewise.<br><br>This is the testimony all Latter-day Saints should bear. This is the truth we all should live. At this Christmastime, are you willing to give to your own self the greatest gift, the gift of complete faith in and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ, that you may live with him eternally? That you may is my humble prayer for you in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Mark E.
