<h1>rust the Lord During Our Raging Tempests - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">I would like to let my staff, my students, and my athletes know that I am just as surprised as you are to see me up here, but please don't let it shake your testimony or your confidence in BYU.</p><br>When I was about four years old, I fell out of my bed. My father heard me crying and came into my room to check on me. As he helped me get back into my bed, he asked, with all of the compassion of a loving father, why I had fallen outofbed.<br><p class="p1">He always loved to tell me how I had looked up at him and said, with the eye roll of a rational four-year-old, "Obviously I wasn't in far enough!"</p><br><p class="p1">As a result, that statement became the question that my father would ask me every time I encountered a struggle, trial, or difficult problem. To this day I continue to ask myself, "Am I in far enough?"</p><br><p class="p1">I don't want to burst your bubble by telling you that this life will include tests, trials, and tribulations and that some of the trials you will face in life will be excruciating. What you do need to know is that, according to my friends, I am not the luckiest person in the world and I have had my share of challenges. We will all experience affliction, so I hope that sharing how I learned to get all the way in will help you along your path in college and in life.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Riding Out the Raging Tempests</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">I remember being a student at this ­university. Icame from a great home and was raised by incredible parents who shared their ­testimonies through word and deed. I felt confident as I entered BYU that I had a solid footing in the Church. However, it was during my college life that I started to experience small struggles that began to test my testimony and my commitment to our Savior.</p><br><p class="p1">It started with having to make my own ­decisions to go to church, say my prayers, and read my scriptures. And then came the self-doubt, the struggle of suddenly being average, the loneliness, and the experience of my first C grade being thrown at me. Next came the curveball of dating and breaking up combined with a "small" amount of pressure to get married, all while I was ­living with roommates who did not do the dishes and also while no one was liking my Instagram posts--well, at least back then I didn't have to worry about Instagram or Facebook.</p><br><p class="p1">It was at a particularly low moment in college that I came across the hymn "Master, the Tempest Is Raging" (<i>Hymns, </i>2002, no. 105). The second verse described perfectly how I was feeling at that moment:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Master, with anguish of spirit<br></i><i>I bow in my grief today.<br></i><i>The depths of my sad heart are troubled.<br></i><i>Oh, waken and save, I pray!</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Torrents of sin and of anguish<br></i><i>Sweep o'er my sinking soul,<br></i><i>And I perish! I perish! dear Master.<br></i><i>Oh, hasten and take control!</i></p><br><p class="p1">However, it is the question in the first verse--"Carest thou not that we perish?"--that continues to come to the surface when I am struggling.</p><br><p class="p1">I am sure that many of you who are here today feel troubled and distressed; maybe you are in a moment similar to what I was in and you feel that your ship is going to capsize or sink. To those whose hearts are breaking or who feel that no one is listening; to those who are stressed, worried, or afraid; to those who bear the burdens of sin; and to anyone whose heart is pleading, "Master, carest thou not that I perish?" the answer is yes. Your Savior does care and He does love you. The Savior will always love you, no matter what.</p><br><p class="p1">It is the follow-up question in that first verse--"How canst thou lie asleep?"--that took me many years to understand. Then why does He sleep when the tempest rages all around me? Why does He not still this storm, or why would He let me suffer?</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> During these moments it is easy to think the Savior is oblivious to our trials, when in fact the reverse is true; it is we who need to be awakened. It is we who need to turn and find Him. It is we who need to continue to follow His teachings. And it is we who need to ask, "Am I all the way in?"</span></p><br><p class="p1">I found that when life became challenging, my first reaction was to turn away from my Savior. I would abandon the foundational habits of prayer, scripture study, and hope. That reaction was a choice; it was a choice that I made. The Savior didn't abandon me; instead, I turned from the Savior because I wasn't all the way in.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Growing like an Athlete</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Often my students and athletes will sit in my office and discuss their problems or struggles. They will ask, "Why me? I am trying to be good! Iam keeping the commandments. Why is the Lord allowing this to happen?"</p><br><p class="p1">No one is exempt from struggles, especially not you who are striving to do what is right. But these trials are not just to test us; they are vitally important to the process of changing who we are.At times it may seem that our trials are focused on areas of our lives with which we seem the least able to cope. Since personal growth is an intended outcome of these challenges, it should come as no surprise that our trials will be very personal.</p><br><p class="p1">Now I may be going out on a limb here, but if you are anything like me, then you want to have growth without any challenges and to develop strength without any struggle. Unfortunately, that is not how the process of growth occurs. As much as we desire it, growth cannot come by taking the easy way.</p><br><p class="p1">In working with athletes, I recognize that an athlete who resists rigorous training will never become a world-class athlete. Anyone who wants to improve, win, or be the best must endure the daily torture of conditioning and practice. This is not easy, and I am familiar with all of the excuses that are used because someone is tired, sore, or lacking desire--mostly because I have used all of them. The question then becomes "Are you all the way in?"</p><br><p class="p1">We must be careful that we don't resent the very things that help us grow and change. And we need to be grateful that we have the Savior as a coach who knows us so well and who will push us so that we come to understand that we are stronger than we think we are.</p><br><p class="p1">As an athletic trainer, I spend a lot of time with athletes who are injured and struggling with the challenge to heal and return to their pre­injury level. This process is not easy, especially for the natural man--who has zero patience for the process of growth--or for a generation that is used to getting things instantly. The process to rebuild tissue and muscle strength takes time and can be painful.</p><br><p class="p1">The most common question that I get during these moments is, "Will I be the same after this is over?"</p><br><p class="p1">And my response is always, "No, you won't be the same. If you will be all the way in and follow my treatment and rehab plan, you will be stronger. You will learn more about your abilities. You will be awesome."</p><br><p class="p1">My athlete has to trust that I have been there before and that I know they can and will be successful. This challenge is the same for all of us when facing a trial and going through the pain and agony of change and growth. We must continue to turn to our Savior and trust Him as He works to smooth off our rough edges.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Understanding the Savior's Yoke</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">The Book of Mormon often talks about how the Nephites were taught the scriptures. They believed the story of Moses and that God parted the Red Sea to handle the mighty pharaoh and Egypt's great army.</p><br><p class="p1">In 1 Nephi we read about the three attempts that it took Nephi and his brothers to get the plates from Laban. The boys had tried two times and failed, so naturally Laman and Lemuel asked the question</p><br><p class="p1"><i>How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?</i> [1 Nephi 3:31]</p><br><p class="p1">Are you ever like Laman and Lemuel, who didn't have a problem believing that God could part the Red Sea for Moses and the Israelites but who couldn't believe that God was powerful enough to help them get the plates from the mighty Laban? Or are you ever like me, believing that God helped Moses, Nephi, and Joseph Smith but doubting that He would help me through my own difficult struggles? To be all the way in, you have to believe that His help is available to you now. Even when you feel that you are alone in the boat, you are never truly alone. Please know you are never truly alone! He will calm the sea for you just as He has done for those who have gone before us. Don't listen to the voice of Satan that will tell you that Christ sleeps because He doesn't care if you perish! In fact, the opposite is true. In Matthew it says:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. </i>[Matthew 11:28–30]</p><br><p class="p1">This scripture has an invitation and a promise. The invitation is to take up Christ's yoke. The yoke was a device of great assistance to those who tilled the fields. It allowed the strength of one animal to be linked and coupled with another animal. The result was that two animals sharing the load reduced the heavy labor of the plow or wagon. A burden that was overwhelming or perhaps impossible for one to bear could easily and comfortably be borne by two bound together with a common yoke.</p><br><p class="p1">The promise is that once we are yoked with Christ, our burden will be lighter because He will help us carry it.</p><br><p class="p1">Now His yoke requires a great effort. We need to eliminate the idea that taking His yoke means that life will be easy and enjoyable, but let us not forget that our Savior was a carpenter. He has carved and rounded the yoke so that it fits perfectly over your shoulders. He has made sure to smooth off the rough edges so that it won't dig into your back. He has tailored His yoke perfectly for you to comfortably carry the load, thereby fulfilling the promise that His yoke is easy and His burden is light.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A modern-day yoke that most of you carried with you this morning is a backpack. As you place a load of books into the backpack, adjust the straps, and wear the backpack on both shoulders, your ability to carry that load of books increases compared to your ability to carry those books in your hands. The weight is not eliminated; instead the energy required to sustain the effort is reduced.</span></p><br><p class="p1">As a heavy-laden college student, imagine the power and peace of standing side by side with the Savior. As you choose to be all the way in and take His yoke, He will be yoked to your side, always standing with you to provide the support, balance, and strength you need to meet your challenges and succeed.</p><br><p class="p1">I have learned the importance of the Savior's yoke through my battles with cancer. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the plan to go through chemotherapy and radiation, and I still wish I had hired President Worthen to read through the small print on my contract for mortality. Nevertheless, cancer has brought me to my knees on many occasions. I learned quickly that Satan would wait until my strength was gone to cause me to doubt if God was really there for me. I had moments when I would question my testimony and wonder if I was worth saving or question if I had accomplished anything worthwhile in my life.</p><br><p class="p1">It was during one of these low moments that I was reading the Savior's invitation in Luke: "And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me" (Luke 9:23).</p><br><p class="p1"><b> </b>This scripture didn't tell me to follow Him as long as I didn't have cancer, and it didn't tell me to follow Him only if I was married or had righteous children, and it didn't tell me to follow Him only when I was having a good day. I learned that no matter what my circumstances were, I needed to deny myself and follow Christ daily. In other words, no matter what my struggle was, peace came as I continued to be all the way in the gospel.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Overcoming the 80:20 Rule</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">My staff, students, and athletes will freely admit that I have a major addiction: I love sugar. Now, while chocolate, Oreos, and ice cream are delicious, they are not usually considered to be the world's most nutritious foods. With my apologies to all of the faculty and students in nutrition and dietetics, I want to share how I resolved this dilemma by living my 80:20 theory of nutrition. My theory is that if I eat good, nutritious food 80percent of the time, then I can eat what I want the other 20 percent of the time.</p><br><p class="p1">I found this approach to be quite successful, and I have looked for other areas in my life where I can apply this theory. I have found that if I exercise 80 percent of the time, then I can skip 20 percent of my workouts. If I make my bed 80percent of the time, then 20 percent of the time it really isn't necessary. And when I was a student in college, I found that if I got eight hours of sleep 80 percent of the time, I could survive on two hours of sleep 20 percent of the time when studying the night before a test or when a paper was due. I also realized that I used the reverse of this theory when I was in college. When I did the dishes only 20 percent of the time, then my roommates could dothem 80 percent of the time!</p><br><p class="p1">Now this approach may have brought some success to my habits of eating and exercise, and it certainly helped my roommates learn how to wash dishes, but as often as I have tried, I could not get the 80:20 theory to work with gospel principles. Ihave not been able to find a way to keep my temple recommend by paying my tithing 80 percent of the time or by keeping the Word of Wisdom 80 percent of the time or by keeping 80percent of the commandments. Living the 80:20 theory is not conducive to being all the way in and following the Savior.</p><br><p class="p1">Living the gospel 100 percent of the time means doing the little things that keep us connected with the Savior every day. Develop the habits of the small, simple requests of His gospel by committing to daily read your scriptures; say your morning, evening, and testing center prayers; and find time to put down your phone and serve others.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Revving the Engine</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">It surprises most people when they find out that I have a motorcycle. Now please do not confuse it with the common scooter found on campus. I am the proud owner of what I affectionately call a "Honda Davidson"--because it is cheaper than a Harley Davidson. Riding my motorcycle is one of my favorite activities to reduce stress. I love these fall days when I can enjoy a relaxing ride on my way home or through the canyon and feel the wind blowing around me.</p><br><p class="p1">I will admit that I enjoy the times when I am stopped at a red light or when I have just started my motorcycle and am in neutral revving the engine--and I do so loudly. I love the sound of the engine and feeling its vibration. I love feeling the power that I am sitting on and feeling ready to let go. But therein lies the difference: at some point, to enjoy the ride, I have to put the motorcycle in gear and use the power.</p><br><p class="p1">How many of us spend our time in the gospel sitting in neutral and revving the engine? To be all the way in, we have to use our faith and our abilities to get out of neutral and use the power to serve as the Savior would and to become more like the Savior.</p><br><p class="p1">We are all hearers of the word, which is just like sitting on my motorcycle, holding the clutch so that the engine is in neutral, and then revving the engine. Christ wants us to be doers of the word, which requires us to put our engines into gear and go to work.</p><br><p class="p1">I pray that you don't leave here today just ­having heard my words but that you choose to move all the way in. Take action. Do not wait for people to visit you; go and lift others. Be active in your wards and apartments. Accept and fulfill callings. Do not wait for life to serve you; find ways toserve and lift someone every day.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Becoming a Conqueror</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Last year, as I was battling cancer for the fourth time and going through treatment, the women's soccer team came up with the "Carolyn Can" campaign, believing that if anyone could beat cancer, it was me. Coach Jennifer Rockwood purchased shirts for everyone to wear.</p><br><p class="p1">Words cannot express how inspiring this act was for me. Every day was a struggle for me to get out of bed and choose to fight. I would dread going to radiation. But often it was in those moments of discouragement that I would receive a text reminding me that "Carolyn can" or that I would see the girls wearing their shirts and their yellow wristbands. Their hope, faith, and energy, which was so contagious, would provide the strength I needed to continue to fight.</p><br><p class="p1">Not every day was this simple. There were many days when I didn't have a bounce in my step or when it was hard to smile or laugh, and I found on those days that my victory was simply just to endure the day. But because the women's soccer team lifted and served me, I found the energy to make it through each day and to stay yoked with my Savior, who carried enough of my load so I could continue to press forward.</p><br><p class="p1">One of my favorite scriptures is found in Romans, when Paul asked the question "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"<i> </i>(Romans 8:35).</p><br><p class="p1">This scripture has been a lifeline for me through difficult times. In the margin of my own scriptures, I have added, "Will cancer, being single, shortcomings, sin, or tragedy separate me from the love of Christ?"</p><br><p class="p1">Will there be a struggle in your life that will separate you from the love of Christ? If so, then please hear Paul's next words, when he declared, "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us" (Romans 8:37).</p><br><p class="p1">You are stronger than you think. Heavenly Father knows and loves each of you. If you will make sure that you are all the way in by trusting in the Lord, taking His yoke upon you, and following Him, then He will make you a conqueror.</p><br><p class="p1">I know that Christ lives, and I bear testimony that He is not sleeping while the tempest rages and that He cares very much if you perish. Be all the way in and I bear witness that He will always be by your side. I say these things humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Carolyn Billings, BYU director of sports medicine, delivered this devotional address on October 17, 2017.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Off the Natural Man and Becoming Saints - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, it is nice to be with you. You are an amazing sight. Being here today reminds me of an experience I had a few years ago. Sister Cook and I were asked to speak in another university setting, and when my mother-in-law heard about it, she said, "Oh, aren't you scared?"</p><br><p class="p1">Actually, I was a little scared, but feeling somewhat curious, I asked her, "Why should I be scared?"</p><br><p class="p1">She said, "Because students are so intelligent!"</p><br><p class="p1">That was a nice compliment for the students, but it didn't say much for what my mother-in-law thought of me and my intelligence!</p><br><p class="p1">Today I realize that I am speaking to a group of very intelligent and educated people, but I am not scared, because the topic I would like to address is applicable to each of us in a very personal way. It is how we can put off the natural man or the natural woman and become Saints through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. This is something I have been working on for many years--battling with the natural man. But I am determined to never relax, retreat, or retire from the fight.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Putting Off the Natural Man or Woman</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">The natural man or woman is the mortal part of us that allows the physical, the temporal, or our own desires to overrule our inherent spiritual goodness and our desires to become like our Heavenly Parents (see SpencerW. Kimball, "Ocean Currents and Family Influences," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1974). Of course the fight will not be won immediately. It is a daily battle for each of us, and we are dependent upon God and Jesus Christ to help us change our nature.</p><br><p class="p1">We are taught in the Book of Mormon:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i> [Mosiah 3:19]</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Spinner</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">I actually had a horse who helped me appreciate the amazing process of change. When our children were young, my wife and I looked for a gentle, well-broke children's horse. Our neighbor had such a horse, but he would sell us kind and gentle Bob only if we also bought his other horse, Stubby. The names alone describe the horses. Eventually we decided to purchase both horses in order to acquire Bob.</p><br><p class="p1">Sure enough, Bob was wonderful, and Stubby ended up being, as expected, a stubborn, strong-willed, obnoxious animal who consistently acted up and caused trouble with the other horses. Because of our limited number of horses, I usually ended up riding Stubby during our family rides. He was defiant. When I tried to turn right, Stubby fought to go left. If I wanted to gallop, he would buck or crow-hop.</p><br><p class="p1">I decided to do all I could to help bring about achange in Stubby's disposition. I gave him consequences for bad behavior and rewarded him for good behavior. I rode him side by side our well-behaved horses. I rode him frequently and groomed him often. Over time, after many rides--and somewhat to my surprise--Stubby began to soften. He submitted more readily to the saddle and bridle, and he was less determined to have his own way. He began allowing me to guide and control him without resistance. At times he even seemed to enjoy our time together.</p><br><p class="p1">As Stubby's disposition improved, he surprisingly became my horse of choice. He was energetic and had good stamina. He was not at all hesitant or fearful in challenging situations, and in a group of other horses, he led out without needing to be urged on. Over a period of ten to fifteen years, Stubby developed into an exceptional lead horse. I was very grateful that I hadn't given up on him during those earlier challenging years. In fact, Stubby made such a turnaround that we changed his name to Spinner.</p><br><p class="p1">When I walked to the pasture, Spinner was quick to come to me. He recognized me and seemed eager to please. He responded to the ­gentlest commands. I could ride him easily without a saddle or even a bit in his mouth. We spent many pleasurable hours together. He was very gentle and became a favorite horse of our grandchildren. He took care of our granddaughters, and he tolerated our grandsons. We would say, in horse lingo, that he was well broke. Spinner gave up his wild nature and aligned his will with his owner's--or his master's--will.</p><br><p class="p1">Spinner underwent a major change or transformation, but it took time, patience, and a lot of work. Through this process of change, Spinner's life improved immensely, and so did mine! It broke my heart when he passed away this past spring. We buried him in a place of honor, marked with a hitching post and his halter.</p><br><p class="p1">In a similar though much more meaningful way, we are invited to change, to submit ourselves to God, who is our Master. In the New Testament weread:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</i> [James 4:7–8]</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Submitting to God</b></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> President Ezra Taft Benson (1899–1994) described some of the blessings that come to us as we draw nigh to God and align our will with His. He said:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace.</i> ["First Presidency Message: Jesus Christ--Gifts and Expectations," <i>Ensign,</i> December1988]</p><br><p class="p1">Blessings do come as we submit our will to Heavenly Father, and the more fully we submit ourwill to Him, the richer the blessings will be. They may not be the blessings we expect, but theywill always be the blessings we need.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It is possible to submit our will to God anywhere, anytime. One setting that is particularly conducive is while serving a full-time mission, when there are fewer worldly distractions. We are able to consecrate all of our time and attention to His work and to focus on what He would have us do instead of on what we may otherwise choose todo.</span></p><br><p class="p1">I recently read a letter from a missionary, Sister Wilde, who had been serving in the Houston Texas East Mission for less than six months when Hurricane Harvey hit. In addition to their usual missionary work, she and her companion and other missionaries worked for days tearing out damaged walls, floors, and sopping-wet carpets--sometimes working from 9:00 in the morning until 7:30 at night.</p><br><p class="p1">Though her work is very challenging, Sister Wilde described her experience as "one of the most incredible things I have ever done in my life." She said, "What a blessing it is to be a part of God's work. ... I cannot begin to express the way that my mission has changed me. ... The Lord can do amazing things with us when we give ourselves over to Him" (Brooklyn Wilde, email to family and friends, 4September 2017).</p><br><p class="p1">I have experienced similar feelings in my life. I know that the joy Sister Wilde experienced is real--and available to each of us--as we submit our will and align ourselves with God.</p><br><p class="p1">In order to experience this joy, we must learn to follow the enticings of the Spirit--the things of God--rather than the enticings of the ­adversary--the things of the natural man. Because of the Father's gift to us of agency, we choose daily which enticings to follow. In Matthew we read:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</i> [Matthew 6:24]</p><br><p class="p1">As my Grandma Jenny, who was a true cowgirl, used to say, "You can't ride two horses at the same time" (Jenny Afton Skeen Cook [1906–91]).</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Enticements of the Adversary</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">The adversary entices us to be lazy, complacent, discouraged, indifferent, and doubting. Other of his enticements include giving in to appetites of the flesh, such as pornography, breaking the Word of Wisdom, not living the law of chastity, or engaging in other immoral practices. If we are wise, we ignore and shun those enticements. We exercise self-control and develop the capacity to avoid them. If we are injured by them, or if we become ensnared by them, we escape through repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Though some things may take time to overcome, nothing is impossible--­including repudiation of sin, repentance, forgiveness, and healing.</p><br><p class="p1">Another enticement of the adversary that can keep us from submitting fully to the will of our Father in Heaven is pride. President Ezra Taft Benson described pride as "the great stumbling block" ("Beware of Pride," <i>Ensign,</i> May 1989).</p><br><p class="p1">One sign of pride is pushing back or turning away from God or from others who invite us to do God's will. Invitations may come from parents, friends, teachers, Church leaders, the scriptures, and sometimes the Spirit. They may be invitations to stop doing things we shouldn't be doing, or they may be invitations to do something that God would have us do.</p><br><p class="p1">A resistant and prideful condition is described well in the Book of Mormon:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.</i> [Helaman 12:6]</p><br><p class="p1">In other words, pride says, "Don't tell me what to do. Don't try to control my life."</p><br><p class="p1">When we rebel or turn our backs toward God, we are actually turning our backs on true joy and happiness. Elder NealA. Maxwell (1926–2004) said, "Only by aligning our wills with God's is full happiness to be found" ("Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1995). Elder Maxwell also taught that we may mistakenly think that by letting our will be swallowed up in the will of God we lose our individuality. But the Savior is asking us only to lose our old self in order to find our new self. It is not a question of losing our identity but of finding our "true identity" ("Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father"). Using a cowboy's words, I would say that God asks us to give up a penny in order to receive a dollar, and a dollar has some obvious advantages over a penny!</p><br><p class="p1">Pride, that sinister, grievous, subtle, disrupting, insidious, menacing, and rotten attribute of the natural man, constantly pulls us to focus on ourselves, our looks, our talents, our desires, our goals, our passions--on me, me, me. We look inward rather than outward toward others or up to God. Pride focuses on what <i>I</i> want instead of on what others want or on what God wants.</p><br><p class="p1">The antidote for pride is humility. It is humbling ourselves and putting God's will above our own, seeking what He wants instead of what we want and aligning our will with His. One challenging aspect of replacing pride with humility is recognizing pride for what it is. As President Benson described, we often sin in ignorance (see "Beware of Pride").</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I find that when I lose the Spirit or feel distant from God or from others, pride is often at the root of the problem. I have found it helpful to ask myself, "Is it my pride that is causing this conflict?" When there is tension in a relationship, I ask, "Is it pride?" When I am not getting along with my leader, "Is it pride?" When I am not getting along with those whom I am called to lead, "Is it pride?" When I shrink from correction, "Is it pride?" I find that inevitably when I ask myself the question "Is it pride?" the Spirit whispers, "Yes, it is!"</span></p><br><p class="p1">I am grateful for the Lord's mercy and kindness in helping us overcome our weaknesses. It is not easy to ask the question "Is it pride?" or to accept the answer. But recognizing pride seems to be the first step toward overcoming it. We can then identify what we need to work on, humble ourselves, plead for forgiveness, let our pride go, and align our will with God's.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Enticements of the Holy Spirit</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Yes, the enticings of the adversary are real, but the enticings of the Holy Spirit are also very real--and powerful! As we are obedient and yield to the enticings of the Spirit to pray, study the scriptures, and serve others, we begin to see who we really are--from God's perspective and not just from our own. We feel God's pure love for us and recognize our infinite worth. We can feel comforted, valued, and lifted. And often the enticings of the Spirit and our feelings of God's love will prompt us to repent and change and become better.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Seeing Ourselves Through God's Eyes</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">I had an experience as a young man in which I felt a distinct "enticement" to change. This experience helped me understand the difference between who I thought I was and who I really am in God's eyes.</p><br><p class="p1">During a temple recommend interview prior to my mission, the bishop asked, "Are you honest in your dealings with your fellowman?"</p><br><p class="p1">I paused for a moment, evaluated my honesty from my point of view, and thoughtfully responded, "Yes."</p><br><p class="p1">I went to the temple and then to Germany to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others. As I studied the scriptures, taught the gospel, and served God, the influence of the Holy Ghost increased in my life. My thoughts and attitudes began to change. I had an increased understanding of God's expectations of me. As <i>Preach My Gospel</i> describes, I began "forming a fresh view of God, [myself], and the world" (<i>PMG,</i> 2004, 62).</p><br><p class="p1">One evening my companion and I were teaching a lesson on honesty, and an experience came to my mind that had occurred before my mission. As a sixteen-year-old, I had fixed up an old '46 Chevy truck to drive to school and work, but it was an ongoing challenge to keep it running.</p><br><p class="p1">One day, when a friend and I were driving along a country road, we noticed a truck similar to mine discarded in a field next to some old equipment. The old truck was partially dismantled and rusting away, but it had a part that was missing on my truck. Since the truck in the field appeared to be abandoned, I rationalized that surely no one would miss the part. My friend encouraged me, and we removed the part from the abandoned truck and put it on my truck. I justified my action by reasoning that the owner didn't really need the part and I did.</p><br><p class="p1">In the mission field, I was teaching investigators that stealing is taking something that does not belong to you. My experience of taking that once-insignificant rusty truck part was brought forcefully back to my memory. Suddenly I was pained by my having taken the part. I knew it was wrong. The Spirit helped me understand that from God's point of view, I had not been honest. I began repenting and asking God for forgiveness. I realized that to be a true disciple of Jesus Christ, to teach gospel principles, and to testify with power, I must be living those principles. From a cowboy's perspective, I knew I had to have both feet in the stirrups.</p><br><p class="p1">This incident was on my mind for the remaining eighteen months of my mission. When I returned home, it was a great relief to find the owner of that old truck, reimburse him for what Ihad taken, and complete my repentance. At last Ifelt clean, and I was filled with joy and peace.</p><br><p class="p1">I learned a valuable lesson from that experience. There is only one way to assess our ­honesty, or any other aspect of our conduct, and that is from God's point of view--not our view, our friends' view, or the views of people in our ­community, including the online community.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Understanding Our True Worth</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Heavenly Father will help us identify areas in which we need to repent and improve. He can also help us recognize and comprehend our true worth. Rather than gauging our value by comparing ourselves to others or by our perception of how other people view us, we can look to Him. This may take focused effort, particularly in the media-rich environment in which we live.</p><br><p class="p1">There is public scrutiny with each photo that is posted, each comment that is made, and every "like" that is given. Each of us is affected by the posts and comments of others, whether they are positive or negative. "The great and spacious building [which] was the pride of the world" seems to no longer be confined to a building (1Nephi 11:36). The pride of the world today has no walls. It has infiltrated cyberspace.</p><br><p class="p1">I suggest that it is more important than ever to look to God and let Him communicate to us our worth and the value of our contributions, rather than looking to others. We can let Him influence our decisions--what we wear, where we go, whom we go with, and what we do. His "likes" will be accurate, consistent, and much more merciful than the "likes" we may or may not receive from the rest of the world. In His eyes and in truth, we are of infinite worth. In fact, God sacrificed His perfect, holy, and Only Begotten Son in order that our souls might be saved and that we might return to Him. Let God be the audience that we look to please, not those in the great and shapeless black hole of cyberspace. Let us pray to Him and check for His inspiring messages. Let us look to Him, our Creator and our Eternal Father, in all things.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>The Gospel of Jesus Christ</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">The path of repenting and changing is a path that each of us can follow, no matter our situation. It is a joyful path, full of blessings. It is a path that we walk with the Savior, and as we do, we come to better understand His great power, mercy, and love. We better comprehend who He is and therefore who we are and who we have the potential to become. The path of repentance is the path that leads to becoming a Saint.</p><br><p class="p1">The first step along the path is to exercise faith in God and pray to Him with real intent, sharing our heartfelt feelings. We may feel a desire to repent of our sins, to be cleansed and healed. We may also be filled with resolve and strength to change and progress. The Spirit will guide us, and Jesus Christ will help us along the path.</p><br><p class="p1">It took approximately fifteen years for Spinner's nature to change significantly. Because horses live an average of only twenty-five to thirty years, it actually took him about fifty human years to change. I hope it doesn't take me that long to transform some of the things I am working on. How about you?</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> Heavenly Father doesn't expect immediate perfection. He accepts our efforts, but He would not have us delay. He would have us come unto Him <i>now</i> and work to become "as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father" (Mosiah 3:19). He wants us to be His.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> Discipleship can at times be challenging, but if we have faith and cultivate the Spirit, we can cowboy up and learn to put off the natural man or woman without becoming irritated, frustrated, or discouraged. It can be a joyful process. I love the scripture in the Book of Mormon that describes this pattern of living and progressing:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>They did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</i> [Helaman 3:35]</p><br><p class="p1">My message today is an invitation--an invitation for each of us to see ourselves as God sees us, to yield our hearts to Him, to align our will with His, and to change. We can ask ourselves: "Am Istuck as a Stubby, or am I becoming a Spinner? Am I following my own course, my own agenda, and striving to please myself, or do I desire to please God? Am I attempting to satisfy the appetites of the natural man or woman, or am I striving to please my Master?"</p><br><p class="p1">Heavenly Father can help us answer these questions. He can also help us in our quest to improve and become more like the Savior.</p><br><p class="p1">I know that as we submit and yield our hearts to God, He will bless us. Jesus Christ sets the perfect example for us. His only desire is to fulfill God's plan. God's will is His will. God's work is His work. They are one. Even when faced with making the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus submitted His will to His Father's, saying, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). I bear testimony that through Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we can do all things--including putting off the natural man and becoming Saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Carl B.

<h1>is, Narnia, and Medieval Cosmology - Michael Ward - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
BYU Speeches will not be publishing this forum address. A summary of the address is given below:<br><br>Dr. Michael Ward, senior research fellow at the University of Oxford and C.S. Lewis scholar, shared his theory that Lewis used the medieval cosmos' seven heavens to symbolize Christ throughout<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>.<br><br>On the surface,<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>can seem to be a "hodgepodge" of characters, Ward said.C. S. Lewis's friend J.R.R. Tolkien was confused by all the characters in Narnia. He wondered what was unifying all of them. (Why is Father Christmas, Father Time, the White Witch, English kids and centaurs all in the same story?) Tolkien didn't read all of the books and he wasn&#39;t fond of the stories that he did read.Since Tolkien is so well-known, his opinion of the Chronicles of Narnia became well-known too. Tolkien's attitude prevailed: Narnia is casual.<br><br>According to Ward,Tolkien's assumptions were neither consistent with Lewis's other literary works nor his character. Lewis loved complexity and intricacy. Ward cites Lewis's complicated poetry, love for medieval scholarship and Lewis's Christian faith and belief that the universe is fantastically complex as a reason to look deeper at the Narnia series.<br><br>"The whole Narnia series is about Christ," said Ward. "The first, secondand seventh book is a major comparison of the life of Christ. In these novels, Christ is depicted as Creator, Redeemer and Judge."<br><br>But in the other four books, Christ's figure of Aslan is not as obvious. In some of these novels, Aslan is given characteristics that Christ did not have. One example is Aslan is mentioned as being "swift of foot."<br><br>These details in Lewis' series led scholars to determine that there must be a deeper level of design and creative intent, a level deeper than Biblical references.<br><br>Ward has spent much of his scholarship seeking this deeper level. He tried comparing the books to great works of Shakespeare, but that didn't work.<br><br>"It was when I wasn't looking for it that I stumbled upon it," said Ward.<br><br>Ward described four aspects of Lewis's life that help to credit a deeper theme that Ward discovered in<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>.<br><ol><br> 	<li>Lewis was secretive. He even kept his marriage secret for nearly a year. Ward said that it shouldn'tsurprise us that there could be a secret in Narnia.</li><br> 	<li>Lewis was a Christian who wrote that "Christ is the all-pervasive principle of cohesion, whereby the universe holds together."God could be overlooked when He is everywhere and in everything. "How would Lewis depict an omnipresent but overlookable element?" asked Ward.</li><br> 	<li>Lewis was a great writer, who appreciated and wrote at length about the underlying themes in stories. The atmosphere, overall feeling or grand theme of a story is important. Lewis called this "the hidden element in story." Readers of these stories don't care about the plot so much, but they care about feeling like they're in the story, said Ward.</li><br> 	<li>Lewis was aware of transferred classicism: the literary practice of representing the Christian God through pagan elements. Lewis said that God will often appear in literature, but dressed up as Zeus or masked as other pagan characters.</li><br></ol><br>In a few of his books, Lewis encourages people to look at the sky with a medieval perspective: The earth is in the center of everything withsevenplanets/heavens/spheres surrounding the earth; the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (during Lewis's lifetime Neptune, Uranus and Pluto were not discovered, so the sun and moon are included). These seven heavens also influenced the days of the week. Many people forgot this medieval literature cosmos, Ward said.<br><br>"The characters of the planets seem to me to have a permanent value of spiritual symbols," said Ward, quoting Lewis. This is why he was fascinated with it, Ward said of Lewis.<br><br>"[In<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>]I believe he used these seven spiritual symbols again," said Ward.<br><br>For example,<em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>is built out of the symbolism of Jupiter, also known as Jove. Ward discovered this while reading "The Planets," a poem by Lewis.<br><br>"Of wrath ended<br><br>And woes mended, of winter passed<br><br>And guilt forgiven, and good fortune<br><br>Jove is master…"<br><br>Ward realized these lines were basically a summary of<em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>.<br><br>Jupiter's motifs are kings (the grandest kings of all), jovialnessand Christ. Aslan is constantly described as the King, and the kids become kings and queens. Aslan ends the winter, and he brings hope and happiness.<br><br>Additionally, Ward learned from another of Lewis's publications,<em>Arthurian Torso</em>that the planet Jupiter's red spot symbolizes the wound in Christ's body on Calvary.<br><br>Therefore, Jupiter symbolizes Christ and his forgiving power.<br><br>Ward explained the planetary symbols in the series:<br><br><em>The Magician's Nephew</em>is Venus. This book is about the creation of Narnia, and Venus is associated with creation.<br><br><em>Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia</em>is influenced by Mars, especially with the war.<br><br><em>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em>'s motif is the sun.<br><br><em>The Silver Chair</em>is connected to the moon.<br><br><em>The Horse and His Boy</em>includes Mercury imagery. (Aslan is "swift of foot" in this story, and the mythological Mercury is a speedy messenger.)<br><br><em>The Last Battle</em>relates to Saturn. Saturn is connected with death and destructionand Father Time. In this book, Father Time brings about the end of the world.<br><br>Ward asserted three reasons why Lewis would have done it:<br><ol><br> 	<li>For fun.</li><br> 	<li>For the hidden element of a story. These spiritual symbols give each novel a theme and an atmosphere.</li><br> 	<li>The whole Narnia series is about Christ, more than the obvious Biblical allusions that Aslan is symbolic of Christ. "Christ is present in the story in two modes at once," Ward said.</li><br></ol><br>"On the surface, yes, Narnia looks a like a bit of a 'hodgepodge,'" Ward said, adding that "the real world looks a bit random and confusing too."<br><br>"He wanted to allow people to dismiss it," Ward said. "Lewis knows what he's up to in all these seemingly random details. Likewise, God, in the real world, is working his purposes out."<br><br>(Taken from <a href="http://news.byu.edu/news/byu-forum-deeper-theme-chronicles-narnia">http://news.byu.edu/news/byu-forum-deeper-theme-chronicles-narnia</a>.)
<h1>ur Life Through Service to Others - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Good morning, my young brothers and sisters. You are an inspiring sight. I have the opportunity to visit your campus often with my various Church assignments, but seeing you here today brings back a flood of wonderful memories from a time in my life when I sat where you are now sitting. The year was 1968, and I was a freshman here at Brigham Young University. I remember well the excitement and, of course, the anxiety that many of you who are entering as freshmen are feeling right now, not knowing exactly what lies ahead. To those of you who are returning for your sophomore, junior, or senior years, I likewise know the excitement and anxiety you are feeling because you are beginning to have a better sense of what lies ahead.</p><br><p class="p1">After beginning my studies here in 1968, Ihad the privilege of serving a full-time mission between 1970 and 1972. After my mission, I returned to finish my studies and graduated in the summer of 1974. I married my beautiful wife, Nancy, the day after I graduated. We have four children, all of whom have graduated from Brigham Young University. Our family has great memories of BYU, and it is wonderful to be back on campus with you today.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, I feel I was led to focus my message this morning on the gospel principle that has been the source of the most joy and fulfillment in my life throughout the forty-three years since my graduation from this very special institution. Therefore, with this thought in mind, I have entitled my message<b> </b>"Shape Your Life Through Service to Others."</p><br><p class="p1">Like many of you, when I arrived on campus as a freshman, I was greeted by the large sign on the western edge of campus that reads, "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." Not only is this one of the first sights most people see when they arrive on campus, but I think it is also one of the last sights they see, as it has become the backdrop for many a picture as students celebrate their graduation day with loved ones.</p><br><p class="p1">ErnestL. Wilkinson, a past president of Brigham Young University, adopted the slogan for the university in 1966. For more than fifty years now the slogan has greeted students and ­faculty, ­parents and visitors, and ambassadors and ­dignitaries from across the globe.</p><br><p class="p1">While speaking here in 2003, President GordonB. Hinckley urged every student to make"Enter to learn; go forth to serve" his or her personal motto. President Hinckley said at that time:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Mediocrity will never do. You are capable of something better. .</i><i>.</i><i>. Walk the high road of charity, respect, and love for others and particularly those who are less fortunate.</i><sup>1</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Please remember, my young friends, that being the best at something doesn't make you a good person. You can be number one in your academic field, you can be an accomplished musician or artist, or you can be an all-American athlete, but none of these accomplishments make you a good person. What you actually do to bless others with your knowledge and talents is what makes you a good person.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Do the Works of Righteousness</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">For those of you who have a smartphone, please take it out of your pocket, backpack, or purse and hold it. Now let me tell you a little about these computers you hold in your hands.</p><br><p class="p1">In terms of raw processing power, the computer in your hand has capabilities far greater than the supercomputers that took up thousands of square feet in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when I attended BYU. In fact, a smartphone is millions of times more powerful than the computers used to send the Apollo missions to the moon.<sup>2</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Through your smartphone you have the ability to easily access more content in more ways than your parents ever dreamed would be possible. You can send images with Snapchat, scroll through Instagram, and shop for your mother's birthday present without missing a beat.</p><br><p class="p1">At any moment, you have access to more than</p><br><p class="p1">•<br>40 million Wikipedia articles in 293 languages.<sup>3</sup></p><br><p class="p1">• 1 million eBooks on the Kindle.<sup>4</sup></p><br><p class="p1">•<br>30 million songs on iTunes, Spotify, or Amazon.<sup>5</sup></p><br><p class="p1">•<br>5,500 movies and television shows on Netflix.<sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">You have instant access to vast amounts of information that are growing at incredible rates. In just a single minute,</p><br><p class="p1">•<br>500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube.</p><br><p class="p1">• 448,800 tweets are posted to Twitter.</p><br><p class="p1">• 65,972 Instagram photos are posted.</p><br><p class="p1">• 3.3 million posts are made to Facebook.</p><br><p class="p1">Remember, all of that occurs each minute.<sup>7</sup></p><br><p class="p1">This flood of information can become almost all-consuming. On any given day the average user spends 148 minutes streaming music,<sup>8</sup> 40 minutes on YouTube, 35 minutes on Facebook, 25 minutes on Snapchat, and 15 minutes on Instagram.<sup>9</sup> The average user spends 4 hours and 23 minutes online every day. Therefore, during an average lifetime, years will be spent on social media.</p><br><p class="p1">With those alarming statistics in mind, I ask, How are you spending your time?</p><br><p class="p1">I love how Doctrine and Covenants 59:23 helps us understand exactly what the best use of our time is: "He who <i>doeth the works of righteousness</i> shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (emphasis added). In this revelation the Lord tells us that the best use of our time now and throughout our lives is doing "the works of righteousness." What are the works of righteousness? Let me show some examples of how the Lord Jesus Christ and His prophets have answered that question.</p><br><p class="p1">Remember when the lawyer asked Jesus the question "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"<sup>10</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Jesus answered him by saying:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> This is the first and great commandment.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><sup>11</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Remember when King Benjamin shared these inspiring words with his people?</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i><sup>12</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Remember in the priesthood session of our last general conference, in April 2017, when President ThomasS. Monson admonished us and taught us this same principle in this way:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Let us examine our lives and determine to follow the Savior's example by being kind, loving, and charitable. And as we do so, we will be in a better position to call down the powers of heaven for ourselves, for our families, and for our fellow travelers in this sometimes difficult journey back to our heavenly home.</i><sup>13</sup></p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Focus on What Is Truly Important--<br>Serving Others</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Today, with all the information available to you in an instant on the internet, it is easy to get distracted. How do you determine what is the most important information you need to know and understand? The most important information any of us could hope for is the answer to the question "What is my purpose in life?" I have never met anyone who wouldn't appreciate knowing the answer to that question. The answer is found within the great plan of salvation, which has been taught by the Savior and His holy prophets throughout history.</p><br><p class="p1">If we are fortunate enough to have a knowledge and a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives, we had better take full advantage of that knowledge and testimony and act accordingly. Acting according to our knowledge and testimony of the plan of salvation would obviously be the best and most appropriate use of your time, not only as a university student but throughout your life.</p><br><p class="p1">Of course we all recognize that as we journey through life our worldly priorities change. Your worldly priorities are currently focused on getting a formal education, but that will change when you get married, have children, develop careers, and grow older. However, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, our most important eternal priorities remain unchanged throughout our lives.</p><br><p class="p1">There might be a tendency in your youth to put a little too much focus on yourself, which is easy to do as you plan and work toward your future. You are probably pondering questions such as "What should I major in?" "Should I go on to graduate school?" or "Where will I work?" These questions all relate to important aspects of your lives, but they are all secondary to the most important questions that relate to your spiritual lives, such as "What can I do to be more Christlike today?" and "Is there someone I can help today?"</p><br><p class="p1">This principle was taught in a recent broadcast of <i>Music and the Spoken Word, </i>as follows:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>It's easy in this self-focused world to become .</i><i>.</i><i>. self‑focused. Our needs, our wants, our desires and ambitions can be so consuming that they crowd out other people. It's amazing .</i><i>.</i><i>. how often we drown in things that can be so superficial.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Of course, few would fault a person for seeking to improve his or her life and living with purpose and goals. But when our pursuit of personal growth and happiness causes us to ignore others, it becomes selfishness, and that leads to stagnation, not growth; despair, not happiness; and, ultimately, loneliness. </i>[Elder Neal A. Maxwell] <i>put it this way: "Why worry about selfishness? .</i><i>.</i><i>. Because selfishness is really self-­destruction in slow motion."</i><sup>14</sup></p><br><p class="p1">President GordonB. Hinckley taught us how to stay focused on the teachings of the Savior: "The antidote of selfishness is service, a reaching out to those about us--those in the home and those beyond the walls of the home."<sup>15</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Will you take a moment right now to envision yourselves in the stage of life similar to that of your grandparents or, for some of you, your great-grandparents? You have lived a long life, and it is becoming more apparent that you are getting closer to the time when you will move on to the next life. What will you be taking with you on that journey? The answer is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ. You can take with you only what you have become. "For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors."<sup>16</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><b> </b>The following experience from the book of Luke should help us understand how important itis to follow the Savior's example in providing loving service to our fellowmen rather than getting caught up in the busyness of the day. This experience is recorded in Luke 18:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> And it came to pass, that as </i>[Jesus] <i>was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</i><sup>17</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I would like to take a moment on the next verse, which reads, "And they which went before rebuked [the blind man], that he should hold his peace."<sup>18</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, how do you interpret the phrase we just read: "And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace"? Why would anyone in Jesus's traveling party rebuke the blind man? Perhaps they loved Jesus and were trying to protect Him, or perhaps they were in a hurry to get to Jericho, or maybe they did not understand Jesus's mission and purpose.</p><br><p class="p1">Let me read this verse again and then continue the story to the end:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.</i><sup>19</sup></p><br><p class="p1">So what do we learn from Jesus as He taught His disciples that day? He taught that we should focus on what is truly important, and what is truly important is blessing the lives of others. Are we sometimes blinded by the activities of each day so that we forget to live as true disciples of Christ and serve our fellowmen as He taught?</p><br><p class="p1">President Monson is surely one who would never rebuke the blind man or isolate anyone in need from a source of help and support. President Monson addressed this great principle of living a life of service, compassion, and charity. He said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness--be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers. We are the Lord's hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us.</i><sup>20</sup></p><br><p class="p1">He also said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>How many times has your heart been touched as you have witnessed the need of another? How often have you</i><span class="s2"><b><i>intended</i></b></span><i>to be the one to help? And yet how often has day-to-day living interfered and you've left it for others to help..</i>..</p><br><p class="p1"><i> We become so caught up in the busyness of our lives. Were we to step back, however, and take a good look at what we're doing, we may find that we have immersed ourselves in the "thick of thin things."</i><sup>21</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Also:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>May the words of a familiar hymn penetrate our very souls and find lodgment in our hearts:</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Have I done any good in the world today?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Have I helped anyone in need?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>If not, I have failed indeed.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Has anyone's burden been lighter today</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Because I was willing to share?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>When they needed my help was I there?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> That service to which all of us have been called is the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> As He enlists us to His cause, He invites us to draw close to Him..</i>..</p><br><p class="p1"><i> If we truly listen, we may hear that voice from far away say to us, as it spoke to another, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant"</i> [Matthew 25:21].<sup>22</sup></p><br><p class="p1">President DieterF. Uchtdorf emphasized the importance of serving others by teaching us that there is no higher priority than having charity and serving people in need. He said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>We could cover the earth with members of the Church, put a meetinghouse on every corner, dot the land with temples, fill the earth with copies of the Book of Mormon, send missionaries to every country, and say millions of prayers. But if we neglect to grasp the core of the gospel message and fail to help those who suffer or turn away those who mourn, and if we do not remember to be charitable, we "are as [waste], which the refiners do cast out</i>" [Alma 34:29; see also Matthew 25:31–46]<i>. .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> ... Having charity and caring for one another is not simply a good idea. It is not simply one more item in a seemingly infinite list of things we ought to consider doing. It is at the core of the gospel--an indispensable, essential, foundational element.</i><sup>23</sup></p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Take Time to JustServe</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">I would now like to take a minute to speak of the practical application of this doctrine. All who understand the doctrine of Christ understand the importance of applying the principles of charity and service in our personal lives, but it is not always easy to find appropriate service opportunities that we can fit into our schedules amidst our other responsibilities. Understanding this challenge, the First Presidency of the Church has recently authorized an exciting new initiative that will help solve that challenge. Let me read to you a statement from the First Presidency introducing this new community service initiative, called JustServe:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Dear Fellow Members,</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> In response to the question from the lawyer who asked, "And who is my neighbour?" (Luke 10:29), Jesus taught the parable of the good Samaritan, which illustrates for each of us that our neighbor is anyone in need, even the stranger (see Luke 10:25–37). In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin instructed his people, "Ye .</i><i>.</i><i>. will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need" "that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 4:16; 2:17).</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> From the earliest days in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have been encouraged to engage in service beyond the walls of our homes and chapels. As God's children we desire to be true disciples of Jesus Christ. We are grateful for His abundant blessings. Each of us would like to reach out in Christlike service to share those blessings with others, but we may not know how to start or where to go. JustServe.org is designed as a resource to help us as individuals, families, and groups find opportunities near our homes to help those in need and improve the quality of life in our communities.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> As we reach out with fellow Latter-day Saints and others who are not of our faith in an effort to help people in need, we create a spirit of love and cooperation that transcends differences and connects us as children of God. May the Lord bless you in this effort to give selfless service as your time and circumstances permit.</i><sup>24</sup></p><br><p class="p1">So, as described by the First Presidency and defined in the JustServe<i> Community Service Guidebook:</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>JustServe is a community service initiative to help Church members follow the Savior's admonition to "love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 22:39) by providing a platform where members and missionaries can find voluntary opportunities to relieve suffering, care for the poor and needy, and enhance the quality of life in the community. This is </i><span class="s2"><b><i>not</i></b></span><i> intended to be a burden on the time and resources of members, nor is it a "duty" about which one should feel anxious or guilty. It is truly voluntary for those who seek a way to give such service. Because this is a volunteer effort there are no quotas or record-keeping requirements for members.</i><sup>25</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> After the devotional this morning, if you have not already done so, please download the JustServe app. It is so easy to use. After downloading the app, all you need to do is type in "Provo, Utah," or your zip code to see what projects in your area have been posted on the site. The last time I entered Provo, more than 280 projects within twenty-five miles came up to choose from. I am sure you will be able to find one that interests you. There are projects to help clean up the community, projects to help support our veterans, projects to help support the elderly, projects to help in food banks and food kitchens, projects to help ­refugees--and the list goes on and on. I invite you to make your next date a JustServe date. How can you go wrong on a date that focuses on serving others who need a helping hand? That sounds a lot better to me than watching another movie.</span></p><br><p class="p1">You won't be alone in using JustServe.org or the JustServe app. Already, more than 300,000 volunteers have signed up and more than 45,000 projects have been posted since its inception in the United States and Canada.<b> </b>Let me give you a quick look at four brief testimonials from your peers who shared their thoughts regarding the impact of their community service efforts.</p><br><p class="p1">The first is Ada Frandsen from Los Angeles, California:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> I am on my phone a lot, but when I do put it down to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>go do "walk and water" or things like this where I'm not on it the entire day and I'm out there helping the kids, itmakes me feel so good.</i></p><br><p class="p1">The second is Henry Christensen from Dallas, Texas:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>It's a different kind of fun that you just have to ­experience firsthand. But I've found it's a lot more fun than videogames.</i></p><br><p class="p1">The third is Emma West from Minneapolis, Minnesota:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And a lot of people were open to it, and it was a really cool experience. And every time someone was like, "Yeah, sure, we'll do that," we kind of fist-pumped together and gave each other high fives.</i></p><br><p class="p1">And the fourth is Emma Anderson, also from Los Angeles, California:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And if you don't want to be sad or angry at your situation, the way to fix that isn't staying in that place. It's by getting out and helping someone else because it helps you not be selfish and not think about your own problems. It's almost like a distraction, but it's one that will heal you.</i></p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Live a Charitable, Christlike Life</b></span></p><br><p class="p1"><b> </b>Now I will leave the practical aspects of applying the principle of service and move back to the doctrine as I conclude. These next three statements from past and present leaders should help us understand the role that service to our fellowmen could take in our personal lives.</p><br><p class="p1">First, a statement from President MarionG. Romney:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>We lose our life by serving and lifting others. By so doing we experience the only true and lasting happiness. Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.</i><sup>26</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Second, a statement from President Hinckley:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> May the real meaning of the gospel distill into our hearts that we may realize that our lives, given us by God our Father, are to be used in the service of others.</i><sup>27</sup></p><br><p class="p1">And third, a statement from President Monson:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Unless we lose ourselves in service to others, there is little purpose to our own lives.</i><sup>28</sup></p><br><p class="p1">When I read these statements from our leaders that support the scriptures we have reviewed this morning, I feel we are learning what "pure religion" really means.<sup>29</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I am far from perfect in applying this doctrine in my own life, but I have found a powerful way to help deepen my understanding of this saving principle and my commitment to living it. Let me go to Moroni 7 and review verses 47 and 48. Verse 47 is one we might know by heart:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i></p><br><p class="p1">When we speak of shaping our lives through service to others, we are really speaking of living a charitable, Christlike life. The Bible Dictionary defines charity as "the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love, not merely affection."<sup>30</sup> For me, charity, or the pure love of Christ, is a condition of the heart. Charity motivates people to do the right thing for the right reason. Charity particularly motivates a person to do something that is difficult or maybe even impossible for others to do for themselves.</p><br><p class="p1">Now let us look at verse 48:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, </i><span class="s2"><b><i>pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love</i></b></span><b><i>,</i></b><i> which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. </i>[emphasis added]</p><br><p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, it is my prayer today that we might all "pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart"; that we may be filled with the love we call charity, the pure love of Christ; and that that pure love will manifest itself in Christlike service to others. I bear my testimony and my witness of the importance of understanding, internalizing, and living the doctrine of charity in our personal lives. Let us all shape our lives through service to others. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><i>Richard J.

<h1>ar Not:&quot; Four Keys to Conquer Fear - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">It is a joy to join with Peggy in welcoming you to another school year. You are a wonderful sight, and this campus takes on new energy as you arrive here. We are grateful for that.</p><br><p class="p1">My message today focuses on one of the most oft-repeated and yet most oft-overlooked and ignored and maybe violated commandments. By my count this commandment is repeated seventy-six times in the scriptures.<sup>1</sup> The commandment was the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christ's birth to the shepherds outside Bethlehem.<sup>2</sup> It was also the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christ's Resurrection to the women at the empty tomb.<sup>3</sup> The commandment was conveyed by the angels who informed Mary and Joseph about their roles in the Savior's mortal ministry,<sup>4</sup> and it was part of the message of the angel who appeared to Zacharias to reveal the upcoming birth of John the Baptist.<sup>5</sup> The commandment is repeated in at least two of our LDS hymns.<sup>6</sup> It is a commandment that is found so frequently in the scriptures that we may not recognize its profound importance, especially for the times in which we live and the stage of life in which you students find yourselves. The commandment is a simple two-word injunction: "fear not."</p><br><p class="p1">Some may question whether the directive to "fear not" is actually a commandment. True, it is not preceded by the familiar "thou shalt not," and it was not written on stone tablets. But it is clearly an imperative repeated often enough by divinely authorized sources, including many times by the Savior Himself,<sup>7</sup> that it certainly seems like a commandment. More important, like all commandments, adherence to this two-word injunction will make our mortal journey both more productive and more joyful.</p><br><p class="p1">This is not a new topic. It has been preached over this pulpit<sup>8</sup> as well as over the pulpit in the LDS Conference Center.<sup>9</sup> But I believe it is one that is of particular relevance as we begin a new school year with all of its challenges in a world that seems increasingly full of fears. I firmly believe that if we increase our compliance with this important commandment, the coming year and the endless years that succeed it will be better.</p><br><p class="p1">With that belief in mind, let me first explore the meaning of this sometimes misunderstood commandment and then describe four things we can do to increase our ability to comply with its principles.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What Is Fear?</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">To understand the commandment to fear not, we first have to understand what we mean by fear. What exactly are we supposed to avoid? According to one source, "fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that ... ultimately [leads to] a change in behavior."<sup>10</sup> As this broad definition suggests, not all fear is bad. Were it not for this emotion, we would not flee from or avoid things that would actually harm us. The feeling that might arise when we hear the signature tail warning of a rattlesnake is one we should not ignore. It keeps us safe.</p><br><p class="p1">Similarly, the scriptures indicate that we are to "fear the Lord."<sup>11</sup> Surely we should not avoid this kind of fear. As Elder DavidA. Bednar once explained, this "righteous fear" is much different from the fear we are commanded to avoid. Righteous fear is instead "a deep feeling of reverence, respect, and awe for the Lord Jesus Christ," a feeling that induces "obedience to His commandments ... and anticipation of the Final Judgment and justice at His hand."<sup>12</sup> This kind of "godly fear dispels mortal fears"<sup>13</sup> and thus aids in our compliance with the commandment to fear not.</p><br><p class="p1">So if fear of real danger and fear of God are not covered by this commandment, just what is it that we are commanded to avoid? The fear that the scriptural injunction directs us to suppress falls into the category of what some psychologists call "irrational fear" or "fear of the unknown,"<sup>14</sup> a fear of future events that will not likely occur. Using the letters of the term itself, some refer to this as "False Evidence Appearing Real"--FEAR.<sup>15</sup> It is this false-evidence-appearing-real type of fear that Satan seeks to induce in us and that the Lord commands us to avoid. It is a kind of fear that is debilitating, sometimes paralyzing, and almost always soul- and energy-sapping.</p><br><p class="p1">For some, this kind of fear takes the form of thoughts that you are not good enough to succeed here at BYU; for others, it takes the form of thoughts that you do not belong here because you are different from those around you. For some, it is a fear that you will never find an eternal companion; for others, it is a fear that the future appears so ominous and dangerous that marriage and a family seem too risky. And, for far too many, this fear comes in the form of the false belief that you are not acceptable to God, that you are so flawed because of past mistakes or current inadequacies that you are beyond the reach of the refining and redeeming power of Jesus Christ.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When any of these false thoughts appears to be real to you, when such satanic lies cause you to lose hope in the future and maybe even in the present, please remember that God has repeatedly commanded us to "fear not." That commandment falls clearly within the ambit of Nephi's well-known and eternally true observation that "the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."<sup>16</sup></span></p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Four Things We Can Do</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">With that in mind, let me suggest four things we can do in such trying times to comply with the commandment to fear not.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b><i>First</i></b></span><b><i>,</i></b> recognize and remember that this kind of "fear comes not of God, but ... from [Satan,] the adversary of truth and righteousness."<sup>17</sup> Indeed, as President GordonB. Hinckley taught, "Fear is the antithesis [the complete opposite] of faith."<sup>18</sup> This is evident from the scriptures themselves. The scriptures define faith as "the <i>substance</i> of things hoped for, the <i>evidence</i> of things not seen,"<sup>19</sup> "which are true."<sup>20</sup> Faith is a real manifestation of what is really true. The polar opposite of that would seem to be the lack of substance or evidence of things that are false--or false evidence appearing real: fear.</p><br><p class="p1">We need to recognize that the feeling of despair and hopelessness that characterizes irrational fear is a tool of the adversary. Indeed, it is one of his primary tools. I am convinced that just as we have articles of faith, Satan and his minions must have articles of fear to aid them in their work. They might read something like this: "We believe that the first principles of despair and damnation are doubt God, doubt yourself, doubt others, and, most of all, be afraid--be very afraid of the future."<sup>21</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I am certain the adversary fully understands that fear and faith cannot coexist. If we fail to understand that truth, we are at a comparative disadvantage. On the other hand, if we remember that simple fact in the moments when we are gripped by irrational fear, we not only will be able to recognize the true source of what President Hinckley called the "gnawing, destructive element"<sup>22</sup> of fear but also will understand the cure for those debilitating feelings. As President RussellM. Nelson has reminded us, "Faith is the antidote for fear."<sup>23</sup> If we want to decrease the amount of fear in our lives, we need to increase the amount of faith in our lives.</p><br><p class="p1">But it is not faith in the abstract that is the antidote to such fear. It is, as the fourth article of faith makes clear, "faith in the Lord Jesus Christ." If we want to decrease the amount of irrational fear in our lives, we need to increase our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. So when fear threatens to overwhelm us, we should focus less on those fears and more on increasing our faith in Him who admonishes us to "look unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not."<sup>24</sup></p><br><p class="p1">And how do we do that? By getting to know the Savior better. The more we know Christ, the more we will trust and love Him and the more faith we will have in Him. In that regard, I urge each of you as the new school year begins to spend time on a daily basis getting to know Him through daily scripture study and prayer. These simple acts of daily scripture study and prayer--especially with the intent to know the Savior better--will do more than almost anything else to strengthen your faith in Him, which, in turn, will decrease the amount of irrational fear in your life, no matter the particular cause of that fear. So set aside time on a daily basis--in the morning or in the evening--to strengthen your faith in Christ through daily scripture study and prayer.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b><i>Second</i></b></span><b><i>,</i></b> we can increase the amount of faith and decrease the amount of fear in our lives by serving others more. As the <i>Lectures on Faith</i> indicate, faith is a "principle of action."<sup>25</sup> It grows and operates in our lives only when we are willing to exercise our agency in an active way. If we want to increase our faith in a way that dispels our fears, we need to act. And often the best way to act is to serve others. Irrational fear causes us to focus on ourselves--on our own inadequacies and on our own inability to control things. When we focus on others and what we can do to help them, fear fades. This is just one way in which, as the scriptures teach us, "perfect love casteth out all fear."<sup>26</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I learned this in a powerful way while serving as a missionary in Mexico. In the early part of my mission, I was hesitant to speak, both because I am by nature an introvert and because my Spanish was not very good. I greatly feared that Iwould be embarrassed. I was focused on myself.</p><br><p class="p1">One day as I walked down the street, I suddenly had a feeling overcome me that I can only credit to the Holy Ghost: it was a clear feeling that all of the people I saw bustling about me that day were literally my brothers and sisters and that all of them were sons and daughters of my Heavenly Parents, who were also their Heavenly Parents. Without any conscious effort on my part, I felt overwhelming love for each person I saw. At that moment I felt a great desire to speak to them. I was anxious to share with them words that would help them see their divine destiny, even if the words were not in perfect Spanish. I suddenly found that I cared more about them and their well-being than about my potential embarrassment. My fear of being embarrassed disappeared and was replaced by an almost consuming love for those people. As I shifted my focus from me and my inadequacies to others and their needs, my fear was cast out by the love that I felt.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Similarly, when you find yourself overcome by fear, I urge you to look for others who need your help. Focus on what you can do for them--on what they need. If you do this, I promise your fears will decrease because your love for God and His children will increase. And, as President DieterF. Uchtdorf recently reminded us, perfect love is also a "divinely appointed antidote to fear."<sup>27</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b><i>Third</i></b></span><b><i>,</i></b> we can increase the amount of faith in our lives if we understand that, as Elder NeilL. Andersen once observed, "Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision."<sup>28</sup> "Faith is a choice."<sup>29</sup> There will be repeated times during this semester and during the rest of your lives when you will have a choice whether to be governed by faith or by fear. I urge you to be quick to recognize when that is the choice you face, because it is not always immediately apparent. If you are more aware of the fact that you are making a choice between faith and fear, you will more often make the right choice. If you do not pause to recognize that fact, fear may overcome you without you even realizing it.</p><br><p class="p1">Let me illustrate with an example. A number of years ago I had an assignment on campus that involved athletics. In that role I was invited to attend a banquet for the women student athletes at which Sister SheriL. Dew was the speaker. Any of you who have heard Sister Dew speak would understand how excited I was to be invited. She is a gifted speaker and a wonderful gospel scholar. I very much looked forward to hearing from her. Unfortunately, at the last minute a conflict arose, and, much to my disappointment, I was not able to attend.</p><br><p class="p1">As you can imagine, then, I was especially excited when I was invited to the exact same event the next year and learned that one of the speakers was again to be Sheri Dew. This time I was able to attend.</p><br><p class="p1">I was particularly thrilled when Sister Dew started off her remarks by saying that she was going to begin by telling the same story she had told the year before--allowing me to catch up. I was pleasantly surprised, thinking maybe she was doing this just for my sake. However, she quickly made clear that while she was going to tell the same story she had told the previous year, this year she was telling it to make an entirely different point from the one she had made the year before.</p><br><p class="p1">Sister Dew explained that she had begun her remarks the prior year by telling the women student athletes how thrilled she was to be invited to speak because she had long wanted to be a part of BYU athletics. She said something to this effect:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>You will remember that I told you that when I arrived at BYU, I felt like I was the most ill-prepared, socially awkward freshman who had ever set foot on this campus. I told you then that I was from a very small town in Kansas--a town much smaller than the student population of BYU--and I felt completely overwhelmed, wondering if I would ever fit in. But there was one thing I thought might provide an entry into the BYU community, and that was basketball. I had played basketball in high school in Kansas, and, quite frankly, Ithought I was pretty good. So I decided I would try out for the women's basketball team. I learned all I could about the team: who the coach was, who had left the team, who was returning, and when the tryouts were tobe held.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Sister Dew then said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>You will recall that I told you last year how I summoned up all my courage and went to the appointed gym in the Richards Building where tryouts were to be held. Wanting to make sure I maximized my chances, I had arrived early. You will also remember how I told you that I opened the door to the gym with some confidence, and then I watched the girls who were playing there. I thought to myself, "Wow, they are really good." You will remember how I told you that I closed the door and then spent the next three hours walking up and down the hallways of the Richards Building trying to muster up enough courage to go back for the tryouts but that I finally gave up and returned to my dorm room without making the effort to try out.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>I told you that story last year so that you would understand that I truly meant it when I told you that I was thrilled more than you knew that I had been asked to speak to the women student athletes at BYU and to be made an honorary member of that group. I wanted you to know that it really was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>But I am telling you this same story this year for a much different purpose because of what happened immediately after I spoke last year. After I had spoken last year, Sister Elaine Michaelis came up to me.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Now many of you here will know Sister Michaelis. She is one of the legendary figures in BYU athletics. She worked in the Athletics Department for more than forty years, serving as women's athletics director for much of that time. She was such an impactful and ­successful ­women's volleyball coach that the volleyball court in the Smith Fieldhouse is named for her. During her coaching career at BYU, Elaine Michaelis at one time or another coached every single women's sport.</p><br><p class="p1">Now, with that background, let me share what Sister Dew went on to say:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Sister Michaelis had spoken after me last year, and she then engaged me in a conversation while we were still on the podium.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Sister Michaelis asked me, "Sheri, is that story true?"</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>"Of course it's true," I replied.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Sister Michaelis then responded, "Do you know who the coach of the women's basketball team was the year you were a freshman?"</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>"Yes, I do," I said. "It was you. I knew everything about the team that year."</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Then Sister Michaelis said, "I should tell you something, Sheri. In all my many years of coaching and of all the teams that I coached, there was only one year and one team that did not have a full roster. It was the women's basketball team that year. We were one player short."</i></p><br><p class="p1">Sister Dew then said, pretending to stab ­herself in the heart:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>It would not have hurt any more to be stabbed in the heart than to have heard those words. There was a place for me on that team. God had prepared a way for me to fit in and had given me inspiration as to what I should do, and I let my fears keep me from that blessing.</i><sup>30</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Sister Dew's life turned out okay--we don't need to worry about her--and the women's basketball team survived without her as well. But that is just evidence that God truly can make "all things [including our own mistakes] work together for [our] good"<sup>31</sup> if we will love and trust Him. But He will also bless us in the interim--in the short run and in the long run--if our choices are directed by our faith in Him rather than by our fears about ourselves. Be alert to the times during which you must choose between fear and faith. Those times confront us more often than we usually recognize.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b><i>Fourth</i></b></span><b><i>,</i></b> even if we recognize that faith is a choice and that we are facing that choice, we may doubt our ability to make that choice--­especially in pressure situations. Too many of us too often worry whether we are capable of choosing faith when it really counts. If that is a concern, I urge you to recognize that you already exercised incredible faith in Christ at a most critical juncture in your eternal journey.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> You are all familiar with the scene. We were gathered together in a Grand Council in which our Father in Heaven described His plan for us to become like Him. Critical to that plan was the role of a Savior--someone who would live His life and give His life in a perfect way, thereby allowing Him to perform an atoning sacrifice that would enable us to gain the experience we needed to have in this fallen world without being condemned by the inevitable mistakes we would make.<sup>32</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1">But there was also another plan presented, one put forth by Lucifer. A war was waged between the adherents of these two plans. As recorded in the book of Revelation, we were on the winning side. It was not a physical war but rather a war of words, a war of concepts--a war in which faith was our main weapon. Listen to how we prevailed, as described in Revelation 12:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and </i><span class="s2"><b><i>by the word of their testimony.</i></b></span><sup>33</sup></p><br><p class="p1">It was the strength of our testimonies in Christ that allowed us to overcome Satan. It was our faith in Jesus Christ. Think about it. At that time the blood of the Lamb had not yet been shed and the Atonement had not yet been performed. All we had was the promise of our Heavenly Father and Christ that Jesus would perform His role perfectly. It all rose or fell on that. And we had the choice of whether we would believe in that promise in those circumstances. All we had was our faith in Him. But in that critical time, we all chose to be governed by faith and not by fear.</p><br><p class="p1">If we sometimes doubt whether we really believe and whether we can act on that belief when it most counts, we can be emboldened by the reassuring fact that we believed before--and we believed with such certainty that the forces of darkness were compelled to flee from our presence. In your moments of doubt, despair, and fear, when you wonder if you can choose faith, remember that you already made that choice once when faced with that same decision in the pre-earth life.</p><br><p class="p1">As Elder RobertD. Hales once noted:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The blessings we enjoy now are because we made the choice to follow the Savior before this life. To everyone hearing ... these words, whoever you are and whatever your past may be, remember this: it is not too late to make that same choice again and follow Him.</i><sup>34</sup></p><br><p class="p1">My dear brothers and sisters: fear not. Whatever the circumstances you find yourself in, know with assurance that you can succeed. You are more capable, more talented, and more faith-filled than you realize. More important, you are more loved by God than you realize.</p><br><p class="p1">God lives. He is our Heavenly Father. He has placed you on earth at this time and in this place because He knows you can succeed and that you can help others succeed in this particular setting. May the heavens open to give you glimpses of that truth and that destiny is my prayer as we begin this new semester. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this devotional address on September12, 2017.</i></p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Notes</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">1.

<h1>he Algebras of Life - Peggy Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Welcome to fall semester 2017. I hope you have a wonderful experience this year at BYU. I remember my first semester here as a student. I was thrilled at the thought that I was finally going to further my education, but, at the same time, I have to admit I was somewhat anxious. The prospect of being a student at BYU was daunting. I was a nontraditional student returning to school when our youngest child was in kindergarten. I remember looking at the syllabus of each class and wondering if I could do everything that was required.</p><br><p class="p1">I had chosen English as a major and was looking forward to attending all of the classes. I hoped I could keep up. I say I was looking forward to attending all of the classes, and that is mostly true, but there was one exception: intermediate algebra.</p><br><p class="p1">Algebra and I have a dubious history. Algebra was a required course in junior high and in high school, and I learned quickly that algebra was not one of my strong points. I did manage, however, to pass those precollege algebra classes--mainly by doing extra-credit assignments given to me by sympathetic algebra teachers. So, knowing what I knew about my history with algebra and knowing that I would have to take the intermediate algebra class in order to graduate from BYU, I did the only thing I could think of: I procrastinated.</p><br><p class="p1">The problem with procrastination is that whatever you choose to procrastinate never seems to go away. Instead it looms large. The time finally came when I could procrastinate no longer. It was the last semester of my senior year--the proverbial eleventh hour. I finally registered for the algebra class, attended the first day of class, and immediately knew I was in over my head.</p><br><p class="p1">My friend Mary, who is a mathematical whiz, could sense my panic. She suggested that I drop the class and register for the independent study algebra course. She said she would tutor me. I was so grateful to her.</p><br><p class="p1">That was the beginning of what my family calls "the year that Mom took algebra." It consumed a lot of my time. Passing my algebra class became a family project. Not only did I have the help of my friend Mary, who tutored me, but I also had Kevin's help and the help of my two sons. They spent hours helping me with my homework. They truly endured this experience with me.</p><br><p class="p1">When I wasn't working on my homework, it seemed like I was expressing my discontent to anyone who would listen. In other words, I complained a lot. I remember complaining to my mother about the fact that I was an English major and that I didn't understand why I even had to take algebra.</p><br><p class="p1">In a very reassuring, motherly way, she said, "Peggy, you never know when you are going to need algebra."</p><br><p class="p1">I am sure she thought it was good counsel, but Iwas forty-three years old and had somehow managed to get by without algebra up to that point in my life. I suppose one never knows when the ability to solve a quadratic equation will come in handy. But to this day I am still waiting for that moment to arrive.</p><br><p class="p1">The day I had anxiously anticipated finally arrived. It was time to take the final exam. In order to pass the class, I needed to pass the final. I felt I was prepared. I sat down, took the test, and, guess what? I failed. I failed the test by one point--one miserable point! As you can imagine, Iwas not very happy.</p><br><p class="p1">The only thing I could think of doing besides crying at that time was to go directly to the counseling office at BYU. The counselor I met with was very patient while I explained my great frustration that I had failed by one point. I told the counselor that I didn't want to take the test again and that I felt like I shouldn't have to--especially since the grade I received wouldn't even affect my GPA. I believed I had a valid argument. The counselor suggested wisely that I wait a week and retake the test. If I didn't pass, then we could possibly discuss other alternatives.</p><br><p class="p1">The last thing I wanted to do at that point was to retake the test. I just wanted the counselor to tell me that I was right. I left the counseling office determined that I was not going to take the exam again.</p><br><p class="p1">Of course everyone who had suffered through this experience with me naturally wanted to know how I had done on the exam. I am sure that they didn't want to go through this experience with me again either. They were very sympathetic when I told them that I had failed and that I wasn't going to retake it. I felt that they would support me in my decision. That is what I thought, anyway.</p><br><p class="p1">However, when I told my friend Christy what had happened and about my resolve not to take the test again, instead of saying something like "Idon't blame you," she said something that stopped me in my tracks.</p><br><p class="p1">Her response was, "You know that's not what you're going to do. You need to retake that test."</p><br><p class="p1">That was the last thing I wanted to hear. But at that exasperating moment I knew she was right. So, much to my chagrin, I spent the next week studying. Apprehensively, I took the exam again, and, guess what? I passed! I not only passed but I passed with points to spare! And there was much rejoicing in the Worthen household!</p><br><p class="p1">Now when I think about my ordeal with algebra, I am grateful I had the experience--even though it was, at times, very unpleasant and difficult. It was definitely a time of growth for me. Although I didn't think the algebra course was an important part of my English degree, it was an important part of my education. It was a personal victory for me. I was ready to quit after I had failed, and I felt justified in doing so. But after a friendly nudge, I decided to give it one more try. And although I did not master algebra, I was able to achieve success on the second try.</p><br><p class="p1">As I now look back on the experience, I know I would have regretted quitting, and I know that the regret I would have felt if I had quit would have been worse than any discomfort or frustration I may have experienced while trying to learn algebra.</p><br><p class="p1">President GordonB. Hinckley, who knew the importance of both an education and of not quitting, gave this counsel:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I hope you will look upon the educational opportunity that you have as a great blessing. I know it is a grind. I know it is difficult. I know you get discouraged at times. I know you wonder why you are doing it at times. But keep on, keep hammering away, and keep learning. You will never regret it as long as you live but will count it as a great blessing.</i><sup>1</sup></p><br><p class="p1">President Hinckley also stated:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>You have a mandate from the Lord to educate your minds and your hearts and your hands. The Lord has said, "Teach ye diligently ... of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--that ye may be prepared in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 88:78–80).</i><sup>2</sup></p><br><p class="p1">You as students of BYU are here to learn and to obtain an education. You have all heeded the mandate that President Hinckley spoke of. You are all obeying the commandment given in the Doctrine and Covenants that tells us we must "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).</p><br><p class="p1">There will be times when you may become discouraged while striving to obtain your education. When those times come, please remember that what you are doing is praiseworthy. You are seeking to improve yourselves as well as the kingdom of God. In an address given at the LDS Business College, StevenC. Harper provided this helpful insight about seeking learning:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Seeking is a long, patient, persistent process that includes internalizing the best books, including the scriptures, where we learn not only the most important facts but the most valid meanings and values to give to the facts. Seeking is hard work. It is not for the weak-willed or faint of heart, nor for the intellectually or spiritually lazy. But it will sustain faith in a world intent on destroying it.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>... Seekers are wanted. .</i><i>.</i><i>. We are all commanded tobe seekers.</i><sup>3</sup></p><br><p class="p1">My hope for you this year is that you will be diligent seekers and that you will not give up, even when facing algebra-like challenges. I promise that as you do so, your lives will be happier now and in the future. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Peggy S.

<h1>spirations - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">As I begin today, I want to recognize and thank my predecessor, Brent Webb, for his remarkable service during his time as academic vice president. As a dean, I worked closely with Brent. I knew he was brilliant: he never seemed to forget a thing I wrote to him. And I knew he always acted with integrity: I <span class="s1">never had to worry that what he told me would </span><span class="s2">be inaccurate or that others were getting a </span>­special deal unavailable to the Law School.</p><br><p class="p1">Until the last couple of months, however, Idon't think I had the full picture of the load he carried. I keep finding myself asking, "How did Brent do it?"</p><br><p class="p1">Part of the answer to that question will probably just remain a mystery to me. Mostly I chalk it up to his incredible bandwidth and his willingness to dedicate his gifts to the university. And sharing those gifts was a real sacrifice. Brent stepped out of the classroom that he loved and put on the backburner an extraordinary research trajectory that had seen him author or coauthor some 200 publications and direct millions of dollars in research activity. Brent is here today, happily sitting with his engineering colleagues. Please join with me in thanking him for his sacrifices to build this university that we all love.</p><br><p class="p1">If Brent's work as academic vice president was not enough to give me some feelings of inadequacy, those feelings are added to by the leadership of his predecessor, John Tanner. As you know, John was a Milton and Renaissance scholar and a Renaissance man. Most of us in this room will remember his <i>Notes from an Amateur</i><sup>1</sup> and his remarkable annual university conference addresses.<sup>2</sup> John embodied the very best of the humane arts and letters project of this university--its inquisitiveness and its joyful search for truth and beauty.</p><br><p class="p1">If Brent embodied our broader desire to push the frontiers of knowledge in science and engineering and if John exemplified the power of the humanities to understand and shape the way we think about the world, I am not sure exactly what I exemplify. Surely proof that there is always regression to the mean. Perhaps also a testimony to the old lawyer joke that lawyers, like sharks, travel in packs--even in university administrations.</p><br><p class="p1">Truthfully, it is a high honor to serve as the academic vice president and to labor alongside you to build this great university. I have long loved BYU. My first experiences here were as a child in the late 1960s and early 1970s--I will spare you the pictures of my long hair and the splendid lime-green leisure suit I sported at the time. When my parents married, my mom had not yet completed her degree. So each summer for several years, my mom, my brother, and I drove to Provo from California so that my mother could work on her English degree. We lived in the old Heritage Halls, and my brother and I spent our summers playing in the canals that used to wind through the complex.</p><br><p class="p1">As far as I could tell, my mom didn't really need a degree. She was the sort of person who took charge of every meeting and council room into which she walked. But she wanted a degree. She wanted to learn from some of the best minds in the Church. She wasn't satisfied with what she knew. She wanted more. So we spent our summers at BYU, and I came very early to see BYU as the place to come if you wanted to make more of yourself and to see that education and the pursuit of light and truth were the path to that goal. I did not really understand much about the project or mission of this university, but I was convinced it was an ennobling one. And I still am.</p><br><p class="p1">I remember how my mother's love of literature was fueled by Richard Ellsworth, Allie Howe, and others in the English Department. My mother's love of studying the gospel came partly from Robert Matthews and Ellis Rasmussen. Then, in the early 1980s, my own love for literature was spurred by Steven Walker, who stirred my passion for J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, and by Catherine Corman--now Catherine Corman Parry--who brought Chaucer to life. It was my turn to see the Book of Mormon in a new light because of Terry Warner, our emeritus colleague in the Philosophy Department.</p><br><p class="p1">During that same time, my wife, Mary, learned to love chemical engineering from John Oscarson and Ken Solen. Aturning point in Mary's education was Paul Hedman's pulling her aside a couple of days after a presentation and telling her that he had looked at her grades and that she could do better. (Remember the pre-FERPA world? And, for Mary's sake, I should add that her grades weren't that bad.) He ended up asking her to work as his research assistant, and later he encouraged her to pursue a master's degree in chemical engineering, which has been a great blessing in our lives.</p><br><p class="p1">This university and its faculty, past and present, have had a profound and multigenerational impact on me and on my family. I can think of no higher praise than to be counted with you as a member of this faculty. The enduring influence you have in the lives of students, in the lives of their children, and then in the lives of their grandchildren--and on and on as your impact ripples through time--is profound. I don't need any more evidence than my own life to know that what we are about here is just what President SpencerW. Kimball described in his address to faculty at our annual faculty workshop nearly fifty years ago: "education for eternity."<sup>3</sup></p><br><p class="p1">As I have pondered my first address to the faculty and found myself in various discussions with colleagues, I have felt some urge to declare for one side in the familiar tensions we can feel in our university stewardship, some of which President Kevin J Worthen mentioned in his address this morning.<sup>4</sup> We know the list: teaching and scholarship, faith and intellect, breadth and depth, experiential learning and theory, and diversity and unity. Our Mission<i> </i>and<i> </i>Aims embrace each of these paired aspirations.<sup>5</sup> And the weight and sometimes stressful burden of doing them all falls most heavily on the faculty. Personally, there are times when I have yearned for a clear road map to tell me exactly which one was most important in which context. As the academic vice president with responsibility for the rank-and-status process, I also feel this quite keenly. But for reasons I will explain, I believe the tension we feel is an important and necessary part of what President GordonB. Hinckley once described as the great "experiment" of this university.<sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">It would surely be an easier project--not just in terms of time management but also intellectually and spiritually--if we were not faced with hard questions and choices. But I believe we would be poorer for it. Ultimately, I am convinced that part of what we must learn by our experience, and part of our effort to build a great and faithful university, depends on deep and sometimes frustrating engagement with our paired aspirations. That engagement requires us to discern when seemingly competing aspirations are actually harmonious, but it also requires us to recognize that there is no free lunch, and sometimes we face challenging "good, better, and best" choices between our paired aspirations.<sup>7</sup></p><br><p class="p1">As we know from Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed ..., upon which all blessings are predicated--</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Thus, paired aspirations sometimes require us to choose which blessing we most want to obtain as a faculty and as a university.</p><br><p class="p1">From my vantage, embracing the challenge of pursuing aspirations in apparent tension is consistent with the restored gospel's expansive perspective, which, over and over, rejects either-or choices in favor of both-and possibilities. It is not faith <i>or</i> works but faith <i>and</i> works.<sup>8</sup> It is not a choice between body <i>or</i> spirit but a recognition that both body <i>and</i> spirit constitute the soul of man.<sup>9</sup> It is not either priesthood authority <i>or</i> a priesthood of all believers but both a priesthood line of communication <i>and</i> a personal line of communication with the Lord.<sup>10</sup> The examples could multiply, but the point is that we are meant to learn and grow by wrestling with paired principles in some apparent tension.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Teaching and Research</b></h2><br><p class="p1">Let me now share some thoughts about the paired aspiration at the heart of our university project: the aspiration to be both teachers <i>and</i> scholars. Our mission statement establishes that "the mission of Brigham Young University ... <span class="s3"><i>is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.</i></span><i>"</i><sup>11</sup> To achieve that mission, the statement sets forth "four major educational goals": first, teaching "the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ"; second, providing a broad general education that teaches students to "think clearly [and] communicate effectively"; and third, providing deeper instruction in the students' field of choice. The fourth goal is the charge to pursue "scholarly research and creative endeavor among both faculty and students."<sup>12</sup> That teaching <i>and</i> research both show up in our mission statement is no accident.</p><br><p class="p1">This paired aspiration has always been part of our history. You know the history and promises. The remarkable 1879 promise of the apostle John Taylor was that we would "see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters."<sup>13</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Karl G. Maeser urged that "the spirit of the Latter-day Work" should infuse not only "teaching the alphabet or the multiplication tables" but also "unfolding the advanced truths of science and art."<sup>14</sup></p><br><p class="p1">President Kimball charged in his 1967 "Education for Eternity" address that the "faculty has a double heritage" that they must pass along: the secular "knowledge that history has washed to [the] feet" of mankind with the new knowledge brought by scholarly research and the vital and "revealed truths sent [to us] from heaven."<sup>15</sup> Reinforcing this charge, in his 1975 second-century address, President Kimball urged "rolling back the frontiers of knowledge" and said, "There is and must be an excitement and an expectation about the very nature and future of knowledge that underwrites the uniqueness of BYU."<sup>16</sup> Our obligation, he said, was to be "bilingual"--to "speak with authority and excellence to your professional colleagues in the language of scholarship, and [to] also be literate in the language ofspiritual things."<sup>17</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Note again the embrace of paired duties. We have "a double heritage" and should be "bilingual." In addition to our dual duty as faithful scholars, President Kimball emphasized our dual duty as teacher-scholars: "While the discovery of new knowledge must increase, there must always be a heavy and primary emphasis on transmitting knowledge--on the quality of teaching at BYU."<sup>18</sup></p><br><p class="p1">At the inauguration of President--now Elder--DallinH. Oaks, President HaroldB. Lee likewise said that BYU</p><br><p class="p1"><i>has been established to the end that all pure knowledge must be gained by our people, handed down to our posterity, and given to all men.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> We charge you to give constant stimulation to these budding scientists and scholars in all fields and to the urge to push back further and further into the realms of the unknown.</i><sup>19</sup></p><br><p class="p1">There it is again--a charge to teach <i>and</i> to explore. I am in awe of how this charge to develop "budding scientists and scholars in all fields" is being fulfilled. We have recently been ranked number five in the country among all universities for having our students go on to receive a PhD.</p><br><p class="p1">These examples of an institutional charge to pursue teaching and research and creative works were made prior to the adoption of our mission statement in 1981, but thereafter the same counsel continued. At the inauguration of President CecilO. Samuelson, President GordonB. Hinckley praised the "spirit of fellowship on this campus between teacher and student" and emphasized that we also "must continue to strengthen our scholarship in every discipline that is followed here."<sup>20</sup></p><br><p class="p1">At the installation of President Worthen, President HenryB. Eyring stated, "The vision at the founding [of this university] was that all here will seek truth not for themselves alone but will also distribute what they have learned to bless others."<sup>21</sup> President Worthen reiterated this dual mission even this morning.<sup>22</sup> I may have belabored the point too long, but I hope it is clear that our dual obligation as teachers and scholars is longstanding.</p><br><p class="p1">Given that both teaching and research aspirations allow for infinite magnification, we might be tempted to decide that one such infinite project is enough. But there isn't really peace in that route. How, then--it is fair to ask--are we to navigate between these paired aspirations? As I remarked earlier, I have sometimes yearned for a checklist, but things of such importance rarely work that way. We are left--and I am convinced we are meant to be left--to learn by our experience.</p><br><p class="p1">One navigational star that should resolve some of the tension we sometimes feel is that teaching and research are often mutually reinforcing. This is the core insight behind our mentoring focus. When faculty work closely with undergraduate students in a lab, in a studio, or on a research project, the research itself is a form of teaching.</p><br><p class="p1">It should also reduce tension between the dual teacher-scholar aspiration to recognize that if we want our students to become lifelong learners, we too must be engaged in lifelong learning, and research is a key manifestation of our learning passion. Our teaching is also benefited by our engaging in the discipline of performing experiments or writing papers. Most of us have had the experience in which an idea or argument just won't write because our ideas can't survive the discipline of the clear exposition demanded by the written word. I have always appreciated the story of the individual who, when asked what she thought about a particular topic, responded, "Idon't know. I haven't written about it yet."</p><br><p class="p1">As another tension reducer, President Kimball observed:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>You can, in fact, often be more effective in the service you render students if students see you as individuals who have blended successfully things secular and things spiritual in a way that has brought to you earned respect in both realms.</i><sup>23</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I remember as a student being in awe of the intelligence and credentials of the faculty--and I am still in awe of you--and I remember taking confidence from their thoughtful and faith-filled testimonies of the restored gospel.</p><br><p class="p1">As a final tension reducer, I trust that, if we are faithful, some of the research insights that might otherwise be lost because of time dedicated to teaching can be made up by the blessings of the Spirit. As we learn in Doctrine and Covenants 88:67, "That body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things." But, in my experience, this is not typically the Lord's way. As I noted before, there is a law irrevocably decreed,<sup>24</sup> and attaining light and knowledge most often is a function of obedience to the laws of learning and requires significant time, work, and study in addition to faith.</p><br><p class="p1">If these various truths reduce the tension between teaching and research, do they eliminate it? As suggested by my reference to Doctrine and Covenants 130 and the principle that blessings are associated with obedience to related laws,<sup>25</sup> I don't believe so. In the end, honesty--and at least as much insight as I can muster from my own experience--compels me to recognize that we must make hard choices between teaching and research. We can't have it all.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> If we must choose, how is it that we are to do so? Surely it cannot be that we opt for one to the exclusion of the other. I have long appreciated, for example, that at BYU quality teaching really does matter in the rank-and-status process. A long list of publications or ­performances on a vita or a raft of research grants do not obviate the need for quality teaching. </span></p><br><p class="p1">If choosing only one path is not viable, what principles might help us balance between teaching and research? One principle that President Worthen has invited us to consider is our motive. Is it pride and the praise of the world that drive us, or is it a desire to serve our students and serve the Lord?<sup>26</sup> As President Worthen said in his 2014 annual university conference address:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>We are and will remain a student-centric university, one that focuses on the development of our ­students above all else. With every major decision we make, we need to ask ourselves how this endeavor can enhance the educational experience ofour students.</i><sup>27</sup></p><br><p class="p1">This inquiry about what enhances the experience of our students may appear to suggest a narrow ambit for scholarship, but that is not necessarily so. Consider the close mentoring experience of a student in a lab or studio and think about the doors to graduate school and employment that open as a result of such collaborative work. Contemplate the habits of mind and heart that students are able to observe in a close mentored-research setting. Even for those disciplines in which working alongside students is more challenging, pursuing research teaches lifelong learning by example, energizes the mind of the faculty member, and builds the university's capacity to launch its students into opportunities that will allow them to serve and lead in their families, their communities, and the Church. Again, motive and our heart matter. If students are at the periphery of our university contribution--or in the rearview mirror--we ought to realign our focus.</p><br><p class="p1">To borrow from a metaphor President Worthen used in his inaugural address when he challenged all of us to "go to the mountains,"<sup>28</sup> the faculty are both climbers and climbing instructors. As scholars and creators, we hope to summit new and challenging peaks. As teachers, we are charged with teaching our students climbing skills and also filling them with a desire to climb. Teaching climbing is easier if we also love to climb and if we have seen the magnificent vistas afforded by a summit. But our mission is not to spend all our time climbing. Our core mission is to teach climbing skills and, where possible, to make guided forays in which we lead students to the summit with us. Sometimes, of course, this will slow us down. But because of the strength of our students, having them along for the hike can also spur us and energize us, and our mentoring successes suggest that students often can carry quite a bit of the load.</p><br><p class="p1">From the evaluative side in the rank-and-status process, we must recognize that the quantity of what we produce--the number of peaks we will climb--will sometimes be less than what might be produced if teaching loads were lower or citizenship obligations less. This should not trouble us because it is inherent in our institutional choice. Although we as faculty might climb fewer peaks, we will be responsible for more summits, achieved by our extraordinary students.</p><br><p class="p1">If we recognize that the quantity of what we produce may be less, and even if we trust that motives matter, we will surely still feel some lingering tension about the paired obligation of teaching and research. But I am persuaded that we are meant to confront precisely that tension. It is part of our mission and part of the grand experiment identified by President Hinckley.<sup>29</sup></p><br><p class="p1">The nature of paired aspirations is that they invite conversation and discussion about an appropriate balance. I hope that will be the case, because we learn when we counsel together. As we counsel together as faculty members, I also hope that the very recognition of the tension will engender some of the humility President Worthen discussed this morning.<sup>30</sup> Part of that humility may be recognizing that our preferred balance may be just that--our preference--and that we need to recalibrate with reference to the other part of our dual duty. It takes real humility to be personally introspective about our motives and about why we may have shied away from either aspiration. But being less defensive, less sure, and more open to letting the Spirit guide our allocation of effort will lead to greater peace in navigating the paired aspiration of teaching and research--or any other duties in apparent tension.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Faith and Intellect</b></h2><br><p class="p1">A second paired aspiration that guides our efforts is the relationship between faith and intellect, or faith and reason. As a matter of doctrine, these two aspirations share a common goal of pursuing truth. As Joseph Smith once said, "One of the grand fundamental principles of 'Mormonism' is to receive truth, let it come from whence it may."<sup>31</sup> Latter-day scripture is clear that, to the Lord, "all things ... are spiritual" and nothing is entirely temporal.<sup>32</sup> We also know that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<sup>33</sup></p><br><p class="p1">At the university's 2015 commencement exercises, Dr.RobertP. George credited Pope John PaulII with a beautiful metaphor: "Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth."<sup>34</sup> This is precisely why we are commanded to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith."<sup>35</sup></p><br><p class="p1">We need not feel embarrassed, as urged in some academic quarters, that our pursuit of truth includes faith, nor is there any lack of faith in pursuing truth by diligent study at a university. I love the story President HenryB. Eyring once told about a conversation he had with President Kimball regarding the future of higher education in the Church.</p><br><p class="p1">President Eyring reported that he had suggested to President Kimball that, once the Savior returned, universities may no longer be necessary.</p><br><p class="p1">After what President Eyring described as "a lengthy silence," President Kimball said that</p><br><p class="p1"><i>over the centuries universities</i> [have] <i>proved to be the most effective institutions we</i> [have] <i>developed to find, conserve, and transmit knowledge across numerous fields of inquiry, so why not expect that they would serve as well in the Millennium.</i><sup>36</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Faith and reason must be paired for us to achieve what President Kimball described as the expectation that not only would BYU "become a leader among the great universities of the world" but "become a unique university in all of the world!"<sup>37</sup></p><br><p class="p1">President Hinckley echoed this idea when he said at President Samuelson's inauguration:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Here we are doing what is not done in any other major university of which I am aware. We are demonstrating that faith in the Almighty can accompany and enrich scholarship in the secular.</i><sup>38</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Because we are human and the world beckons, we can begin to think it is possible to fly with one wing, but it isn't. Truth must be pursued by study <i>and</i> by faith. Excluding the latter cuts us off from the pursuit of truth. As Psalm 36:9 says, "For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light." Most important, excluding faith would cut us off from the one truth to which all other knowledge is ­secondary--Christ's promise in John 8:12: "Iam the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</p><br><p class="p1">If study and faith are both part of the search for truth, the tension tends to come, as it so often does, in practice--in myriad individual and institutional decisions. Here again, retreating to our comfort zone and eschewing the challenge to learn by both study and faith is not the answer.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> What are some principled guides? Once more the real answers are internal--our motives and our heart--and are difficult to reduce to a checklist. If there must be a default, it is faith, partly because faith will compel us back to the value of study and ­reason. In this regard, President DavidO. McKay once said that by making religious faith paramount, this university "declares with Ruskin that 'anything which makes religion itssecond object, makes religion <i>no</i> object. ... He who offers God a second place, offers Him no place.</span><span class="s4">'</span><span class="s2">"<sup>39</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> The temptation for many of us who have spent so much time and energy succeeding in Athens is that we sometimes want to rebuild Jerusalem in Athens's image. But our ­ultimate aspiration is, metaphorically, to build a New Jerusalem, to, as President Kimball said, "become a unique university in all of the world."<sup>40</sup> Our goal is not to build the same old Athens in a new location. Building a great and unique university is no easy project. Although in many cases the principles of truth that build up Athens will be the same as those that build up Jerusalem, in other cases our pursuit of truth will require that we go our own way and endure the skepticism that what we are building doesn't match modern Athenian fashion. This doesn't mean that we proudly ignore advances in building codes that would strengthen our own structures, nor does it mean that we are haughty and prideful in our difference. But what we must remember is that we build for a higher purpose, which requires that we build by both study and faith.</span></p><br><p class="p3"><b>Experiential Learning and Theory</b></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> At this point in my remarks, most of you are probably convinced that I have forgotten the theme of this university conference from Doctrine and Covenants<i> </i>105:10--"That my people may be taught more perfectly, and have experience"--which seems to promise something on experiential learning. So let me turn to that subject for a couple of minutes and to the dual aspiration of teaching by experiential learning and teaching by theory and principle.</span></p><br><p class="p1">In his January 2015 address to the university community, President Worthen identified "three main ways we can learn: one, by study; two, by faith; and, three, by experience."<sup>41</sup> As you will recall, he taught the students:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Your mortal experience will be a more productive part of your quest for perfection if you intentionally stretch yourself with new challenges, especially those that involve a real risk of failure.</i><sup>42</sup></p><br><p class="p1">It is a subject for another day, but his advice is just as critical for faculty. Building this university requires taking on new challenges with some risk of failure and mistakes. We too will learn through our experience.</p><br><p class="p1">If improving our efforts to provide our students experiential-learning opportunities is important, those efforts are bounded and supported by the dual aspiration of education by study and by faith, which in turn focuses on guiding principles and theory. We, of course, are already doing much by way of experiential learning. Our lab disciplines provide many students with wonderful, outside-of-class experiential-learning opportunities; our clinical-work disciplines likewise include learning by doing; experiential learning is the core pedagogy in the fine arts; and wonderful experiential-learning experiments are going on across campus. Although this may expand the definition beyond typical usage, anyone who has experienced a work of art in an art history class or the text of a poem in a literature class might also lay claim to an experiential-learning experience. My point today is not to set boundaries around the definition, although I suppose that will soon enough be my resource-allocation duty.</p><br><p class="p1">Instead of boundary setting, my focus, as before, is on the challenging and necessary work we must do to discern the appropriate relationship between teaching practice and teaching theory and to then make the good, better, and best choices between them. In that weighing, teaching theory and guiding principles continues to be critical. As the Aims document suggests, "The essential academic learning skills are the abilities to think soundly, to communicate effectively, and to reason proficiently in quantitative terms."<sup>43</sup> The Aims' use of the "skills" nomenclature makes clear that the goal is to enable students to apply their learning to the myriad circumstances that will arise in their lives.<sup>44</sup></p><br><p class="p1">It is principles that have staying power. To take a recent example, it was fun to experience the eclipse. But how much more valuable is it to understand why the eclipse happened and, even better, to understand the mathematical and physical principles upon which one can predict not just this eclipse but any eclipse in the future? Teaching theory and principles is thus foundational to application. At the same time, it was seeing the eclipse that prompted me to read more about how an eclipse worked. Thus the desire to understand theory and principle can be fueled by experience.</p><br><p class="p1">Our commitment to teach students core academic skills goes to the heart of our teaching mission. In a world in which evanescent celebrity on social media seems increasingly important, we must remain moored to our aspiration of education for eternity. It is not nearly enough to teach students about the hot political issues of the day or the skills they need for their first job. Our task is to teach them the principles by which they will understand and evaluate all future political debate and the skills that will allow them to succeed as employment opportunities change and evolve. Learning true principles is a skill that will last a lifetime--indeed, far longer thanthat.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Our goal in the scholarly realm is no ­different. It is certainly the case that much of what we do moves knowledge forward only incrementally and that our work will be surpassed in time by subsequent discovery. But our goal should be enduring influence. Our eye should not be to follow the latest fad or to win a current debate but to discern and share ­principles in our writing, our art, and our experiments that will resonate even fifty years hence.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Although I admit to a personal lean toward theory and principle, I am convinced that experiential learning must be part of what we teach our students. And my broader point is that we should not feel like anything is amiss if we must collectively wrestle with the dual aspirations of teaching students both by theory and applied learning. We are meant to struggle with this question--not surprisingly--by study, by faith, and by experience.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Unity and Diversity</b></h2><br><p class="p1">I turn now to a final aspirational pairing about which I won't speak at length today--unity <i>and</i> diversity. For us it is not unity <i>or</i> diversity but both unity <i>and </i>diversity. We will and should become more diverse. I mentioned previously the importance of counseling together, and diverse perspectives and experiences will be a boon to our effort to discern how best to accomplish our Mission and Aims. We won't always agree, but we can disagree charitably. By charitable disagreement I mean more than basic civility. Instead of mere civility, which is a baseline obligation, I hope we will listen--really listen--to each other and work to understand one another's views and statements in a charitable light. What an oasis of learning we would be if pursuing light and truth were the goal and if inevitable disagreements were handled with true charity.</p><br><p class="p1">The best description of our hope to be both diverse and unified is in our Aims document:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The students, faculty, and staff in this community possess a remarkable diversity of gifts, but they all think of themselves as brothers and sisters seeking together to master the academic disciplines while remaining mastered by the higher claims of discipleship to the Savior.</i><sup>45</sup></p><br><p class="p1">As the Aims document suggests, diversity is inherent in the project of a multifaceted university and is consistent with the idea of the pursuit of light and truth. But in the end we must also be "mastered by the higher claims of discipleship to the Savior." I know we are not perfect in that regard. I surely am not. I suppose we all have plenty of growing to do, both individually and collectively, before we are fully mastered in our discipleship. But if that is true, it is also true that we sometimes forget that what we have is extraordinary.</p><br><p class="p1">A couple of years ago I attended this faculty session of university conference with my friend and law school colleague Paul Stancil. Paul is an Evangelical Christian who joined us from the college of law at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. At the end of the session, the faculty members sang together a traditional hymn of Zion. I can't remember which one.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> At the end of the singing, I looked over to Paul, and he had tears in his eyes. He said something like, "Do you realize what an extraordinary place this is--how amazing it is to be a part of a university where the whole faculty willjoyfully stand and sing together in faith?"</span></p><br><p class="p1">The truth is that I probably didn't get it. Paul's reaction, which I share with his permission, was a powerful reminder of what a unique university we are building together.</p><br><p class="p1">One of the great blessings of serving as the academic vice president is that I am exposed to the remarkable and diverse work of colleagues across campus. It makes me feel humbled and proud to be part of this university. Of course, the truth is that the blessings of being part of this faculty community are not limited to someone in the academic vice president position. It can be tempting to stay in our own academic silo, particularly when disciplinary imperatives seem to push us toward narrower specialization, but let me encourage all of us to venture out and partake of the remarkable feast of opportunities that surrounds us.</p><br><p class="p1">Attend a colleague's presentation and revel in his or her mastery of a complex area of knowledge. Even if you don't see an ­interdisciplinary angle to support your own work, take joy in gaining a bit more knowledge and in understanding the collective project in which we are engaged. Come to a recital, performance, or production and see what our gifted fine arts faculty and students are accomplishing. Browse or read a few of the impressive books produced every year by our colleagues in book disciplines. And please, when you can, take the time to come to your colleagues' devotionals. You may not know them; you may never meet them in person (although I hope you will). But learning from them will make you feel that you are a greater part of this community.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I express my gratitude to you for all you do to build our students and to build a great and faithful university. As I said when I began by talking about my childhood summer treks to BYU with my mother, the profoundly important project in which we are engaged is multi­generational in its influence. There is more to do and many higher mountains ahead, but I feel blessed to work alongside you in this effort. </span></p><br><p class="p1">As I end, I share one of my favorite ­passages in the Old Testament, from the book of Numbers, as my prayer for all of us as we ­navigate the dual aspirations that define our hope for this university:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> The Lord bless thee, and keep thee:</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</i><sup>46</sup></p><br><p class="p1">In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>James R.

<h1>nique Kind of Education - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">It is a pleasure to welcome all of you to our annual university conference and a pleasure to see you here. The past year has gone by very quickly--at least for me. That is a good sign. We often hear that time flies when you are having fun. As it turns out, studies confirm that that is true. One study noted that people experience time differently depending on what they are doing and how they feel about that particular activity. "Time consistently sped up when subjects were busy, happy, concentrating, or socializing ... and slowed down ... when subjects were bored, tired, or sad."<sup>1</sup> By that measure, this past year has been a very good one.</p><br><p class="p1">In that same vein, I feel compelled as I begin my remarks to note that another time-­perception study "found that a speech seems to go by more quickly to the person who gives it than to a person who listens to it."<sup>2</sup> Consider yourself forewarned. If I am still happy at the end, it doesn't mean that you need to be.</p><br><p class="p1">By other more objective measures, this past year has been a success on many fronts. We have seen that in the presentation before. We have also seen the completion of several construction projects, including the Marriott Center Annex, another residence hall, a new central building at the Heritage Halls complex, and the multiyear Campus Drive redesign project. We saw more than 12,000 of our students participate in Y-Serve projects during the year. The men's volleyball team played in the national championship game for the second year in a row, the women's volleyball team made it to the sweet sixteen for the fifth year in a row, and, reflecting the overall strength of all the athletic teams, the BYU Athletics program finished just outside the top 10 percent in the Learfield Directors' Cup, which measures the overall performance of the nearly three hundred Division I NCAA schools.</p><br><p class="p1">We also made important strides on key academic initiatives. The BYU Online program is on pace. Its goal is to expand the number of online offerings available to our matriculated students so that by 2020, each BYU student will be able to take at least fifteen hours of credit online before graduation. This fall semester BYU Online will be offering 109 sections of fifty-four courses, with a current enrollment of more than 5,500 students.</p><br><p class="p1">We made similar progress on our Inspiring Learning Initiative. We announced this initiative last fall. Its purpose is to help our students have experiences that motivate them to learn in ways that lead to revelation, thus promoting learning that is inspiring, in both senses of that word. Additional funds from two different sources were provided this year to allow more students to have that kind of experience. More than $1 million were made available to the colleges and departments for inspiring learning projects as a result of a reallocation of funds from the university's operating budget. In addition, generous donors have contributed $6million for this initiative so far this year, with $1.2 million being made available for immediate student use and the rest going toward our goal of creating a $120 million endowment by the end of 2021.</p><br><p class="p1">Let me share with you a small slice of theimpact that these inspiring learning experiences have had on some of our students. [Avideo was shown.]</p><br><p class="p1">This video represents just a fraction of the thousands of students who have had the opportunity to participate in the kinds of experiences that are part of our Inspiring Learning Initiative. Most departments have equally powerful stories of their own.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><b>"In the Lord's Way"</b></h2><br><p class="p1">It has been a great year. But there is work still to be done. As our university conference theme for 2017 suggests, we gather together with our outstanding students at this university so that we "may be taught more perfectly, and have experience."<sup>3</sup> Today I hope to provide some insights--at a general level--on how we might accomplish that goal.</p><br><p class="p1">This past April, Elder DallinH. Oaks, who is not only a former president of the university but currently the chair of the Executive Committee of the BYU Board of Trustees, addressed the leadership of the university. He began his remarks by repeating what he had said to a similar group of leaders in August 2014, shortly after I became president. I have learned to pay particular attention when prophets, seers, and revelators repeat a message. I have thought much about the following statement that Elder Oaks made on both occasions:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>[I] firmly believe that it is the destiny of Brigham Young University to become what those prophetic statements predicted it would become. But inherent in being the University of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the reality that this great goal will not be attained in exactly the same way that other universities have achieved their greatness. With your help, it will become the great university of the Lord--not in the world's way but in the Lord's way.</i><sup>4</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Three things are apparent in this statement:</p><br><p class="p1">1. BYU has a prophetically proclaimed ­destiny to become a great university.</p><br><p class="p1">2. We have a critical part to play in realizing that destiny.</p><br><p class="p1">3. We will achieve that goal in a way that is different from that by which other universities have achieved their greatness.</p><br><p class="p1">Elder Oaks's statement is remarkably similar to two statements made by President SpencerW. Kimball--one during his landmark second-century address, given while Elder Oaks was president, and the other during the inauguration of BYU president Jeffrey R. Holland. Speaking at the centennial celebration of the founding of this institution in October 1975, President Kimball stated:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>As previous First Presidencies have said, and we say again to you, we expect (we do not simply hope) that Brigham Young University will "become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Become a unique university in all of the world!"</i><sup>5</sup></p><br><p class="p1">At President Holland's inauguration five years later, President Kimball repeated the same quote almost verbatim, with nearly the only difference being that instead of saying we should "become" a unique university, President Kimball stated that we should "remain" a unique university.<sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Note again the three critical elements:</p><br><p class="p1">1. BYU has a prophetically declared destiny to become a great university.</p><br><p class="p1">2. Those prophets expect--not merely hope--that we will do our part to fulfill that destiny.</p><br><p class="p1">3. Achieving that destiny requires that we do things differently from other universities--that we be unique.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><b>Ways in Which We Are Unique</b></h2><br><p class="p1"><i>Unique</i> is an interesting word. It means literally "one of its kind"<sup>7</sup>--"unico," we say in Spanish. Something that is unique is not just distinctive from some others; it is truly different from them all.</p><br><p class="p1">President Kimball used the terms <i>unique</i> or <i>uniqueness</i> eight times in his second-century address. Given that repetition, as well as the renewed emphasis given the concept by Elder Oaks, I have spent considerable time thinking about how we are and how we should be unique. The latter is more important than the former. There is little point in being different for difference's sake; that will not help us achieve our prophetically declared destiny. We must be unique in the way the Lord wants us to be unique, in ways that are consistent with our board-approved--which means prophetically approved--mission.</p><br><p class="p1">There are at least two key ways in which we are already distinctive from most other universities. And when you put these two features together, I believe they make us truly unique in ways that are consistent with our prophetically approved mission.</p><br><p class="p1">First, unlike most major private universities that started off as faith-based institutions, BYU has remained closely aligned with and is closely directed by its sponsoring church. As Elder Oaks observed last April:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>For many years, religiously affiliated colleges and universities have been steadily disappearing, some by formal disaffiliation and some by institutional drift. Today, they are a tiny minority without clear definitions to distinguish them from private secular and even public institutions.</i><sup>8</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Many of you will be familiar with this phenomenon, which has been well chronicled.<sup>9</sup> The trend toward secularization is so strong that one scholar has opined that any religious university <span class="s1">"</span>'will find it extremely difficult' to maintain this [religious] affiliation if it also seeks to attain or preserve a national reputation."<sup>10</sup> In other words, many observers today believe that religious universities like ours have a choice: we can either become secular or second-rate. There is no middle ground.</p><br><p class="p1">We resolutely believe that this is a false dichotomy. Though now clearly a minority position, that firm belief that there is a positive connection between faith and learning is shared by a number of institutions, including our sister institutions of higher education in the Church Educational System: BYU–Idaho, BYU–Hawaii, and LDS Business College. Like BYU, each of these schools is fully committed to the proposition that faith enhances rather than detracts from the acquisition and development of truth and knowledge. That commitment is built into every fiber of the institutional structure of all the CES schools, including BYU. And that commitment increasingly distinguishes us all from other universities, even some that maintain a formal religious affiliation.</p><br><p class="p1">The second way in which we are distinct from some other universities, however, also differentiates us to a degree from the other CES institutions. While all the CES institutions of higher education share the deep common commitment to the reality of the connection between faith and education, we are the only one of the CES schools that requires, as a fundamental part of our mission, that faculty members excel not only in the classroom but also in the research arena. Thus, while we are first and foremost committed to our students--and to teaching them in the Lord's way--we also ask faculty members to reinforce and enhance that primary teaching mission with world-class research.</p><br><p class="p1">Just as there are skeptics about the ability of a university to be both first-class and faithful, there are also some who question whether a university can maintain both a primary teaching focus and a significant research focus. A recent <i>Deseret News</i> editorial noted the difference between world-class research institutions like Harvard and Stanford on the one hand and excellent universities like BYU–Idaho--whose sole focus is on teaching--on the other. The editorial recognized the need for both types of universities in modern society. However, it also noted that schools that focus primarily on research run the risk of losing sight of the well-being and education of their students. The authors then opined:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The solution may be for research institutions to take on more research and teaching schools to become better at teaching. For institutions in the messy middle--schools that fall between top-tier research schools and strictly vocational colleges--leaders would do well to pause ... and simply ask if increased scholarly production is really worth the price to students.</i><sup>11</sup></p><br><p class="p1">That observation contains echoes of the earlier noted skepticism about the compatibility of faith and greatness as a university. Just as some would assert that universities will have to choose to be either secular or second-rate, some will assert that schools will have to choose to be excellent at either research or teaching but not both. They will contend that schools in "the messy middle," in these two regards, are doomed to fail.</p><br><p class="p1">I believe that on these two issues--the compatibility of faith and learning and the compatibility of teaching and research--we at BYU are in the messy middle. We are clearly in the thinly populated middle position on these two matters because we reject both the dichotomy between faith and education as well as that between teaching and research. And our position is certainly messy in some ways as we find ourselves straddling two divides that most believe are slipping further and further apart. But being in this precarious position should be reason for hope and not despair, for being in the messy middle on these two issues makes us unique in ways that may allow us to achieve our prophetically declared destiny. As Brené Brown observed in a different context, "The middle is messy, but it's also where the magic happens."<sup>12</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I believe that when viewed in the light of gospel truths, these two seemingly irreconcilable dichotomies become mutually reinforcing convergences that produce a truly unique kind of education that is part of our prophetically declared destiny.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><b>A Link Between Research and StudentLearning</b></h2><br><p class="p1">Properly understood, belief in gospel truths and adherence to gospel principles can enhance the kind of learning that marks a great university. In a speech entitled "Education for Eternity," given in September 1967, President Kimball noted that one of the things that makes universities great is the ability to produce great artists, writers, and scientists who, in turn, have a profound impact on the world. He then observed how the learning process that produces such luminaries can be enhanced at a university that understands, teaches, and practices the precepts of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Take a da Vinci or a Michelangelo or a Shakespeare and give him a total knowledge of the plan of salvation of God and personal revelation and ... then take a look at the statues he will carve and the murals he will paint and the masterpieces he will produce.<sup>13</sup></i></p><br><p class="p1">Because of our close connection and clear alignment with the Church, we are uniquely positioned to help budding authors, artists, and scientists understand how the plan of salvation can shed illuminating light on every subject they study. And because of our collective commitment to live in accordance with gospel principles, our students and faculty are uniquely positioned to experience the kind of revelatory learning that only the Holy Ghost can provide.</p><br><p class="p1">Thus faith-based teaching can produce a kind of learning that makes universities great in the truest sense, thereby providing evidence that, contrary to the assertions of some, faith enhances rather than detracts from true learning.</p><br><p class="p1">Similarly, I believe that first-class research can enhance rather than detract from student learning and development. Elder Oaks identified the key to this belief in his remarks at the April 2017 leadership retreat. He first noted President Kimball's assertion that BYU could produce "brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, sculpture, painting, science, and in all the scholarly graces."<sup>14</sup></p><br><p class="p1">In the 2017 leadership conference, Elder Oaks then quoted JohnS. Tanner's insightful observation about President Kimball's remarkable statement:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>As I reread</i> [this] <i>now-familiar charge to become a "refining host" for "brilliant stars," it struck me that President Kimball was thinking primarily about the accomplishments of BYU students, not faculty. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>This fact can serve as a salutary reminder for us about the fundamental purpose of scholarship at BYU. It is not, and must never be, to satisfy our own vainglory nor to advance our own careers. Nor even is it solely to advance truth and knowledge, though this is a worthy purpose and one specifically endorsed by BYU's institutional objectives. The primary purpose for the Church's large investment in faculty scholarship and creative work at BYU is to enable us to be a refining host for our students.</i><sup>15</sup></p><br><p class="p1">This inspired linkage between research and student learning does away with the seemingly irreconcilable dichotomy between the two. Research is to be an endeavor "among both faculty and students,"<sup>16</sup> as our mission statement plainly declares. The primary aim for research is student development--a distinctive, if not unique, primary aim for universities that value faculty research so highly.</p><br><p class="p1">This type of refining learning and development can best occur when the research is cutting-edge, at the frontiers of knowledge. There is a difference between being in a lab conducting routine experiments with predictable results designed to help students see in action principles they have learned in the ­classroom--something which many of us experienced in high school--and being part of a team that is seeking a hitherto unknown solution to a pressing problem with real-life implications, such as the discovery of a cure for Alzheimer's disease or the development of a lightweight but impenetrable bulletproof shield. Both of these are inspiring learning experiences in which our students have been involved, as the video showed. As enlightening and instructive as it is to be in a chemistry lab recreating experiments that have already been done, it pales in comparison to the intellectually stimulating, sweat-inducing, spiritually stretching experience of being involved in making a truly new discovery--a discovery that may require and produce revelation about both the matter being studied and the individuals performing the study.</p><br><p class="p1">Thus, as our mission statement makes clear, this is a place "where a commitment to excellence is expected"<sup>17</sup>--including with respect to faculty research. And it is also a place where "the full realization of human potential [of our students] is pursued."<sup>18</sup> First-class research whose focus is on student development achieves both of these aims.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><b>The Challenges</b></h2><br><p class="p1">This uniquely student-focused approach to world-class research is at the heart of our current emphasis on inspiring learning. Faculty-mentored student research on cutting-edge topics is one of the primary focuses of that initiative--an initiative whose aim is clearly and exclusively on student learning. It produces a unique kind of student learning that in some instances can happen only at a place like BYU, where the most important end result is not the discovery of new knowledge or faculty development but student revelation through research.</p><br><p class="p1">I believe this unique combination of faith-based teaching and student-centered research is a key ingredient to the kind of holistic learning and character development that President Kimball called "education for eternity"--the kind of student learning and character development that is at the heart of our prophetically declared destiny.</p><br><p class="p1">However, this lofty view of our potential should not obscure the reality that such an endeavor is not easy. We are in the messy middle on these two key issues. And that position is sometimes precarious and almost always difficult and soul stretching. Elder Oaks identified some ever-present challenges that this unique combination of faith-based teaching and student-centered research brings with it. Let me discuss three of them, and let me commend to you a reading of Elder Oaks's entire talk for an understanding of others he identified.</p><br><br><h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>First Challenge</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">Combining faithfulness with learning--and research with teaching--requires a lot of extra effort. Our commitment to faith-based teaching requires, as President Kimball observed, "that every professor and teacher in this institution ... keep his [or her] subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel and have all his [or her] subject matter perfumed lightly with the spirit of the gospel."<sup>19</sup></p><br><p class="p1">That is not an easy task. It requires a ­thorough understanding of not only our disciplines but also the scriptures. It requires that we be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Ghost, because revelation to our students in the classroom often requires revelation to a faculty member in class preparation. And revelation does not come cheap. As President Kimball observed, "Perspiration must precede inspiration."<sup>20</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Similarly, it is not always easy to keep the focus of research on student learning. Faculty members must be passionate enough about both discovery and their discipline to produce the energy needed to sustain their research through its inevitably difficult stages when no answers seem to be available. But at the same time, they must not become so overzealous to make a new discovery that students become mere instruments in the process rather than the desired end. Again, maintaining this balance requires extra effort.</p><br><p class="p1">Furthermore, as Elder Oaks noted, there is in these matters a challenge for the administration. We need to properly recognize and incentivize both faith-based teaching and student-centered research--something that is quite difficult. It is easy to count the number of publications that research produces; it is much more difficult but more important to evaluate how much impact the research endeavor has on the students. Thus, achieving our goal in the unique way we desire will require ongoing and constant extra effort on every level.</p><br><br><h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>Second Challenge</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">A second ever-present challenge to maintaining both our faithfulness in teaching and our student-oriented focus in research is the reality that neither of these things is likely to bring us much of the praise of the world. And for most of us, including me, the allure of that praise is ever present and ever powerful. Moreover, when we mark ourselves as unique, we can easily become arrogant. We must constantly guard against the pitfall of pride.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s3"> In his classic April 1989 general conference address, President Ezra Taft Benson reminded us that "pride is a damning sin in the true sense of that word. It limits or stops progression."<sup>21</sup> That is true of individuals and it is true of institutions, including this university. Pride can become a--in fact, <i>the--</i>great stumbling block.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Pride is not always easy to discern, as it is an internal attitude that does not always manifest itself externally. As President Benson observed, "Our motives for the things we do are where the sin [of pride] is manifest."<sup>22</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Therefore, one key to our success will be having the right motivation. If we are motivated solely by pride, we will fail. So then what should motivate us? President Benson noted that the essence "of pride is enmity--enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen."<sup>23</sup> If the essence of pride is enmity--or hatred toward our fellowmen--the antidote to pride would seem to be the opposite of enmity, which is charity, or perfect love for our fellow beings.</p><br><p class="p1">Thus we will fully achieve our goal only if we are motivated more by charity than by pride and more by a desire to help our students than by a desire to compare favorably with our peers. The difficulty is that, as noted, motivation cannot easily be measured--at least not by other human beings. Only we--and God--know what truly motivates us. Moreover, the temptation to gratify our vain ambition is so constant that we will likely never reach the point at which we can say that we are sufficiently humble and charitable and that we need not worry about those issues anymore. Self-inspection that is sincere enough to produce personal revelation from God is required. And it is required daily.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s3"> It is not unlike the observation of ThomasL. Shaffer, who, in an excellent book-length analysis of whether it is possible to be a Christian and a lawyer, concluded that the complexities of law and life are so great and the temptation to deviate from Christian values while practicing law are so constant that the answer to that question must always remain contingent. Said he:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>I often think that the only way to be both a Christian and lawyer is to ask, every day, "Is it possible to be both a Christian and a lawyer?" and to be open, every day, to the thought that it is </i><span class="s4"><b><i>not</i></b></span><i> possible.</i><sup>24</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Similarly, perhaps the only way we can remain sufficiently humble and charitable is to ask ourselves, every day, the question "Am I sufficiently humble and charitable?" And we need to be open, every day, to the thought that we may not be.</p><br><br><h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>Third Challenge</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">Elder Oaks noted, "To accomplish its mission, BYU must have all parts of its community united in pursuing it."<sup>25</sup> Prophets have set forth an ambitious agenda for this university and for those involved in it. It is not an easy agenda, and it will require all of us to change and to work together--not just in one department or in one college and not just among the faculty. We will need everyone on this campus to be committed to the task, because we <i>are</i> in the messy middle, and all of us from time to time will need reminders that it is in the messy middle that magic--no, miracles--happen.</p><br><p class="p1">As noted, none of this will be easy, but it will be enlivening, exhilarating, and, yes, ethereal. At times we will need to forge new paths. That is what uniqueness is all about. But the impact will be larger than we may think. Let me illustrate with one final example.</p><br><p class="p1">Six years ago a group of engineering students engaged in a capstone project involving the creation of a water-well drill to help people in Tanzania obtain an ongoing source of clean water. The lack of clean water is a major cause of disease and poverty in many countries, including several in Africa.</p><br><p class="p1">The project began when John Renouard, a BYU alum who had majored in finance, traveled to Africa with his family. John was profoundly moved by the plight of those who did not have access to clean water. He formed an organization called WHOlives--with the word <i>WHO</i> standing for water, health, and ­opportunity. Through a series of events I will describe after showing another video, John connected with the BYU College of Engineering and Technology. Then a group of students, working with their faculty mentor, set out to address the problem. All they knew was that they needed to have a drill that was human powered, could be easily transported from village to village without large trucks, and could drill down hundreds of feet through different kinds of material. They were undergraduates doing research with profound real-life consequences under the tutelage of a faculty mentor. Let me share their story. [Avideo was shown.]</p><br><p class="p1">The last sentence of our mission statement says:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission ... will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's influence in a world we wish toimprove.</i><sup>26</sup></p><br><p class="p1">What we have just seen is exhibit A. Hundreds of thousands of people in twenty-three countries have access to clean water because of the efforts of these undergraduate students. But, of equal importance--maybe of more importance--the lives of the students, and others, were also profoundly changed.</p><br><p class="p1">One of the students, Kenneth Langley, went on to receive his master's degree in fluid dynamics and is currently working on his PhD at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. He indicated that when he began studying engineering, he just wanted to work on airplanes, but being involved in this humanitarian project changed his career focus. It also changed his outlook:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Had I not gone to Tanzania as part of my capstone project, I would never have had the courage to make the step to go to Saudi Arabia, where I am now. Going on that trip also gave me a desire to learn more about the world and to get to know more people in different parts of the world.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Another student, Nathan Toone, who is now working as an engineer for Boeing in St.Louis, explained another profound way in which students were affected:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> It was a spiritual experience. There was a lot of inspiration and there were prayers answered that allowed us to even get the drill to Tanzania. And once there, there were other little miracles in that we would meet the right person or we would just have happened to find this drilling expert who showed us where we could find water and happened to make this connection over here with a farmer who had a field that we could drill in. All these little things appeared to be coincidences, but we knew that they weren't. We knew that there was something bigger going on that was helping our success.</i></p><br><p class="p1">That this was a work of inspiration had been clear at the outset to John Renouard, the BYU alum whose desire to bless the people of Africa was the genesis of the program. As I have mentioned, John started his organization WHOlives shortly after traveling to Africa with his family and seeing the need for clear water. But he didn't know exactly what he needed to do at that point. He went online and saw a brick-making machine that, it turned out, had been developed in an engineering capstone project at BYU. With that in mind, John called the capstone office, was informed that the responsible person was out of town, and then left his number. John described what happened a few weeks later:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>In the middle of the night, I had a dream. It was strong enough that it got me out of bed to my kitchen table to write down what I had seen. Intuitively, I knew that it was a drill, but I am not a well driller. I was a finance major, and I lived in Southern California. My water came from a tap. But I knew that this was something that I needed to jot down. That was the first miracle. The next one happened the next day when I got a call from the BYU capstone program asking me if I had a program or a project that they could work on.</i></p><br><p class="p1">John then met with faculty from the engineering program to explain the need that he had observed in Africa. But he did not give them his specific drill ideas. As he put it:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>One of the great concepts of capstone projects is that you don't go to the students and tell them, "Go build this," and then give them the schematics and everything. You tell them, "This is what we want to do. Now go and do it."</i></p><br><p class="p1">After several months of work by the students, John received a text. As John explained:</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s3"><i> The text said, "We sent you a CAD drawing. Can you open it?" And I did. When I opened it, I saw that drill, and I recognized it from my dream. It was like, "There it is! How did they do that?" It was amazing.</i></span></p><br><p class="p1">Inspiring learning--this is the kind of learning that can "assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life"<sup>27</sup> by helping them see the hand of the Lord operating in their lives. It is a unique kind of education that faith-based teaching and student-centered research can produce.</p><br><p class="p1">I bear my witness that this university has a prophetically declared destiny. It is part of the rolling forth of the kingdom of God on earth. May each of us have the courage, vision, and faith needed to do those things that the Lord expects of us in moving this work along is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this university conference address on August 28, 2017.</i></p><br><p class="p2"><b>Notes</b></p><br><p class="p1">1.

<h1>lk in the Meekness of My Spirit&quot; - David A. Bednar - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Susan and I are delighted to meet with you as a new semester begins at Brigham Young University.</p><br><p class="p1">I want to begin my message today by describing two important times of transition in my life that occurred on campuses sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><br><p class="p1">The first transition started in 1970 at BYU. Iattended San Leandro High School in the East Ba<span class="s1">y</span> Area of California from 1967 to 1970. Itwas a turbulent time, with anti–Vietnam War protests, political assassinations, and social upheaval. The Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley were two major epicenters of dramatic drug, music, sexual, and cultural revolutions. Only a few Latter-day Saints attended my high school, and my ward had a very small group of youth.</p><br><p class="p1">I moved into Helaman Halls in August 1970 and quickly became acquainted with many remarkable LDS young men and young women. That fall semester was a life-changing time for me because of spiritually impactful sacrament meetings and service in my student ward, stimulating academic classes and supportive teachers, and a strong brotherhood that developed with my dorm friends as we played intramural sports, talked late into the night, and perpetrated typical freshman pranks and practical jokes.</p><br><p class="p1">My experience at BYU was "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building" (I hope) and a preparation for "(4) lifelong learning and service."<sup>1</sup> And, most important of all, I met Susan Robinson on this campus after I had returned home from my mission in 1973. She has been the love of my life for almost forty-three years.</p><br><p class="p1">The second transition started in 1997. Susan and I moved to Rexburg, Idaho, following an academic career spanning twenty years at three different universities. As I prepared for the fall semester in my new position as the president of then Ricks College, I remember my reaction when my secretary informed me about an annual temple day for staff and ­faculty at which I was to speak.</p><br><p class="p1">I looked at her and asked quizzically, "Can we do that?"</p><br><p class="p1">She responded quizzically, "You do know this is a Church school, don't you?"</p><br><p class="p1">Attending a temple session with staff and faculty colleagues was a wonderful new and energizing experience. The overt linking of spiritual enlightenment and intellectual inquiry was thrilling and, of course, had not been a part of my work at the public universities where I was a graduate student and faculty member.</p><br><p class="p1">During my years of service in Rexburg, Iexperienced in powerful ways the spirit of the charge given to KarlG. Maeser by Brigham Young when this university in Provo was founded:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.</i><sup>2</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Attending the weekly devotionals, praying and using the scriptures in class, and witnessing the deep devotion of faithful and competent staff and faculty members helped me to see with new eyes and to hear with new ears.</p><br><p class="p1">My experience at Ricks College, now BYU–Idaho, was "spiritually strengthening, intellectually enlarging, and character building" (I hope) and a preparation for "lifelong learning and service."<sup>3</sup></p><br><p class="p1">In these key times of transition in my life, I was blessed to study, learn, work, and grow at institutions of higher education sponsored by the Lord's restored Church. The Spirit of the Lord was invited and appreciated on these campuses and enabled learning environments that were spiritually stimulating, supportive, and vibrant. The contrast with the other settings where I had studied and worked could not have been more stark.</p><br><p class="p1">I provide this personal background as context for my message this morning. My purpose is to affirm and then to build upon President KevinJ Worthen's emphasis upon "inspiring learning."<sup>4</sup> I earnestly pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as I share with you my thoughts and the feelings of my heart about Brigham Young University.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Inspiring and Experiential Learning</b></h2><br><p class="p1">In his university conference message one year ago, President Worthen reiterated the overarching purposes of Brigham Young University. He said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I hope that what occupies a good portion of our hearts and minds is the role we are to play in assisting our students "in their quest for perfection and eternal life." The mission statement makes it clear that our primary role in that process is to help our students learn. We are to provide them "a period of intensive learning." ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>... The mission statement indicates that, above all else, our students should learn "the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ." In addition, they should experience learning that is "broad"--learning that enables them to"think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual integrity."</i><sup>5</sup></p><br><p class="p1">He also described the importance of ­inspiring learning:</p><br><p class="p1">Inspiring <i>is both a noun and an adjective. The noun can be defined as the act of inspiring or motivating. In this sense, the term "inspiring learning" describes actions that inspire or motivate students to learn. As an adjective,</i> inspiring<i> is a modifier. Inthis context, it describes a kind of learning: ­learning that inspires--or, more precisely, in our setting, learning that leads to inspiration or revelation.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>When I use the term "inspiring learning," I have in mind both meanings of the word</i> inspiring. <i>I hope we inspire our students to learn. And I hope that learning leads to inspiration. When both things happen, inspiring learning occurs, and we can then know we are on the right track to achieve the core goals set forth in our mission statement.</i><sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">President Worthen then added:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Let me suggest that one way we can enhance the quality of inspiring learning at BYU is to expand both the quantity and quality of the kind of learning that occurs outside the formal classroom--the kind of instruction that many call "experiential learning." Just like classroom learning, experiential learning can produce the kind of inspiring learning that our mission statement challenges us to provide.</i><sup>7</sup></p><br><p class="p1">He also stated:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Students cannot learn all they need to learn by memorizing or even discussing principles in a classroom, as exhilarating as that may be. Experience connects theory with application and deepens our understanding of the principles and truths we learn.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>And, in my view, experiential learning can be inspiring learning in both senses of that term. It can both inspire students to deeper learning and be the type of learning that leads to inspiration.</i><sup>8</sup></p><br><p class="p1">The blessings of the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost and the spiritual gift of revelation are central to President Worthen's inspired emphasis on inspiring and experiential learning. Worthiness to receive revelation and the faith to act upon the revelation we receive are key in these learning processes. And each of us should be drawing closer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p><br><p class="p1">In our personal lives and in the performance of our university duties, you and I have the responsibility to do nothing that would constrain these heavenly powers from blessing those whom we serve. I am confident the Lord will magnify us individually and institutionally as we strive sincerely to respond to President Worthen's direction.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>The Example of the Prophet Joseph Smith</b></h2><br><p class="p1">As I studied President Worthen's teachings, my mind was drawn to several experiences in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. All of Joseph's learning was inspiring and experiential.</p><br><p class="p1">Four years were required for Joseph to learn and comply with the conditions specified by Moroni for obtaining the golden plates and commencing the work of translation. Each annual visit to the Hill Cumorah was a remarkable learning experience with Joseph's heavenly tutor.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> In a matter of weeks in 1828, Joseph and Emma lost their first child and faced the possibility that Emma also might die. At about the same time, Joseph discovered that the manuscript pages given to Martin Harris had been lost. These experiences provide the background for the revelatory rebuke and reassurance we know today as section 3 in the Doctrine and Covenants. This revelation is filled with important lessons for the young Prophet and for us.</span></p><br><p class="p1">These difficult but essential experiences early in Joseph's ministry were necessary for him to learn the principles and patterns through and by which his prophetic work would be accomplished. And the lessons continued throughout his entire life.</p><br><p class="p1">In 1839, as Joseph pleaded in prayer from Liberty Jail for the welfare of the suffering Saints, the Lord instructed, "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give theeexperience, and shall be for thy good."<sup>9</sup> I believe this scripture describes the ultimate value of experiential learning.</p><br><p class="p1">The revelations teach us that "the glory of God is intelligence."<sup>10</sup> We typically may think the word <i>intelligence</i> in this scripture denotes innate cognitive ability or a particular gift for academic work. In this verse, however, one of the meanings of <i>intelligence</i> is the application of knowledge for righteous purposes. As President DavidO. McKay taught:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>True education--the education</i> [or learning] <i>for which the Church stands--is the application of knowledge to the development of a noble and Godlike character.</i><sup>11</sup></p><br><p class="p1">We are blessed in mortality with endless opportunities to apply what we learn and know for righteousness--or to increase in intelligence. And learning from experience is one of the primary vehicles provided in the Father's plan of happiness to accomplish this eternally important outcome. Consequently, we should not equate intelligence exclusively with formal education, academic degrees, or professional success. Some of the most educated people I have ever known had little or no intelligence. And some of the most intelligent people I have ever known had little or no formal education.</p><br><p class="p1">The Prophet Joseph Smith is a prime example of an uneducated person who learned from experience and was filled with the light and truth of intelligence.<sup>12</sup></p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Learn, Listen, and Walk in Meekness</b></h2><br><p class="p1">I hope now to build upon President Worthen's teachings about inspiring and experiential learning by examining the content and the sequence of important concepts in two related scriptures.</p><br><br><h3 class="p3"><span class="s3"><b><i>First Verse</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1"><i>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><sup>13</sup></p><br><p class="p1">This verse contains two instructions from the Savior: (1) take His yoke upon us and (2) learn of Him. He next described Himself as "meek and lowly in heart." And He promised that as we follow His teachings, we shall find rest unto our souls. <i>The sequence of concepts in this scripture is yoke, learn, meek, and rest.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Importantly, the Lord in this sequence first introduced the example of a yoke. A yoke is a wooden beam normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals that enables them to pull together on a load. A yoke places animals side by side so that they can move together to accomplish a task.</p><br><p class="p1">Consider the Lord's uniquely individual invitation to "take my yoke upon you." We are yoked to and with the LordJesus Christ as we worthily enter into and faithfully honor sacred covenants. The Savior beckons us to rely upon and pull together with Him, even though our best efforts are not equal to and cannot be compared with His. As we trust in and pull our load with Him, the Savior's Atonement makes possible the greatest experiential learning lessons of our lives because His yoke truly "is easy, and [His] burden is light."<sup>14</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Please remember that the revealer of the sublime sentence "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good"<sup>15</sup> was He who experientially had "descended below all things"<sup>16</sup> and had "trodden the winepress alone."<sup>17</sup> The Savior's meekness and perfect walk before all mankind, "even in those times of severe persecutions and abuse which were heaped upon Him by a wicked and adulterous generation,"<sup>18</sup> qualify Him as the perfect teacher from whom we are to learn the lessons of eternity.</p><br><br><h3 class="p3"><span class="s3"><b><i>Second Verse</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1"><i>Learnof me, and listen to my words;walkin themeeknessof my Spirit, and you shall havepeacein me.</i><sup>19</sup></p><br><p class="p1">This verse contains three instructions from the Savior: (1) learn of Him, (2) listen to His words, and (3) walk in the meekness of His Spirit. And He promised that as we follow His counsel, we shall have peace in Him. <i>Thesequence of concepts in this scripture is learn, ­listen, walk in meekness, and peace.</i></p><br><p class="p1">The sequence of learning and meekness in these two scriptures is important and instructive. Interestingly, meekness is the attribute mentioned in both verses immediately before the promised blessings. And the phrase "walk in the meekness of my Spirit" after the admonition to learn and listen is especially germane to inspiring and experiential learning.</p><br><p class="p1">We can only learn of Him as we ever strive to become more like Him and walk in the meekness of His Spirit. Ireiterate again that the Holy Ghost and the spiritual gift of revelation are essential for inspiring and experiential learning. And walking in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit is one of the principal means for seeking these supernal blessings.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Examples of Meekness</b></h2><br><p class="p1">Meekness is not weak, timid, or passive. Meekness is the quality of being God-fearing, righteous, teachable, patient in suffering, and willing to follow gospel teachings.<sup>20</sup> A meek person is not easily provoked or irritated, pretentious, arrogant, or overbearing. Whereas humility generally denotes acknowledging dependence upon God and receptivity to counsel and correction, a distinguishing characteristic of meekness is a particular willingness to learn both from the Holy Ghost and from other people who may seem less experienced or capable, may not hold prominent positions, or otherwise may not appear to have much to contribute.</p><br><p class="p1">Two examples illustrate this unique element of meekness. The first episode involved President HenryB. Eyring. The second episode involved Elder DallinH. Oaks.</p><br><br><h3 class="p3"><span class="s3"><b><i>First Episode</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">I worked extensively with President Eyring during the transformation of Ricks College from a two-year junior college to the university known today as BYU–Idaho. At the time, he was a member of the Twelve and the commissioner of Church education.</p><br><p class="p1">Elder Eyring visited the Rexburg campus to assess the progress of the transition. I shared with him a status report on student enrollment projections, physical facilities renovations, construction projects, hiring of new employees, and many other topics. And we devoted considerable time to reviewing the financial resources and timeline necessary for the success of the transition.</p><br><p class="p1">During our time together, it became apparent that Elder Eyring and I had differing interpretations of the total resource package that had been approved by the Church Board of Education for the transition. We worked together to come to a common understanding but were not successful. I then indicated my willingness to do whatever the Brethren directed. But I also explained that fewer resources would necessitate the transition plan and timeline to be scaled back accordingly. We ended our workday together without achieving a final resolution.</p><br><p class="p1">Elder Eyring spent the night in our home. When he came to the kitchen for breakfast the next morning, his first statement was, "President, I was rebuked by the Holy Ghost last night." He then indicated that the transition should continue going forward as outlined the previous day and that he had no ongoing concerns about the resources.</p><br><p class="p1">He then said to me something I have never forgotten: "President, if you have not been rebuked lately by the Holy Ghost as you are praying, then you need to improve your prayers."</p><br><p class="p1">Given his extensive experience in institutions of higher education, his position as a member of the Twelve, and his authority as the commissioner of Church education, he simply could have decided "this is the way it will be." But he did not do that. Elder Eyring learned of and from the Savior, he listened to His words that came by the power of the Holy Ghost, and he then walked in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit. I learned valuable lessons about meekness through this experience with Elder Eyring. Such meekness is essential for inspiring and experiential learning.</p><br><br><h3 class="p3"><span class="s3"><b><i>Second Episode</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">Elder Dallin H. Oaks has served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for thirty-three years. He is both faithful and fearless.</p><br><p class="p1">In one of our quorum meetings, Elder Oaks expressed a strong opinion about a course of action that he believed should be pursued. The reasons he articulated were convincing, and his knowledge about the issue was extensive. His arguments in favor of the action were compelling.</p><br><p class="p1">As we counseled together, a less senior member of the Twelve expressed agreement with the basic course of action but registered a reservation about the proposed timing. Now, Elder Oaks is incapable of even having such a thought, but he could have countered the concern with a response such as "I believe I know more about this matter than you do." But he did not. With no hint of defensiveness or indignation, Elder Oaks asked his quorum member, "Would you please help me understand your reservation about the timing?"</p><br><p class="p1">After listening intently to his apostolic associate, Elder Oaks pondered for a moment and then said, "The point made by Elder <span class="s1">______</span> is valid. I had not considered the timing implications of this action in the way he has, and I am persuaded that the proposal should be reworked based on what we have learned in this discussion."</p><br><p class="p1">Elder Oaks learned of and from the Savior, he listened to His words that came through the voice of a fellow quorum member, and he then walked in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit. I learned valuable lessons about meekness through this experience with Elder Oaks. Such meekness is essential for inspiring and experiential learning.</p><br><p class="p1">I believe knowing something more about Elder Oaks may help you to hear with new ears the counsel he has given on this campus over the past several years. Elder Oaks presently serves on the Church Board of Education and as the chair of the Church Educational System Executive Committee. He is a disciple-scholar and is uniquely qualified and positioned to help this university accomplish its sacred purposes. And Elder Oaks has raised an authoritative and sustaining voice to Elder Worthen's emphasis upon the fundamental mission of Brigham Young University.</p><br><p class="p1">Recently, Elder Oaks has addressed ­challenging and hard issues in several BYU leadership conferences with the deans, associate deans, and department chairs. I now reiterate five of those issues:</p><br><p class="p1">1. Acknowledging the reality that the mission of Brigham Young University will not be attained in exactly the same way that other universities have achieved their greatness. It will become the great university of the Lord--not in the world's way but in the Lord's way. President Worthen spoke pointedly and persuasively on this issue in his message to you this morning.</p><br><p class="p1">2. Aligning all aspects of the work performed at BYU even more closely with the purposes of our Heavenly Father.</p><br><p class="p1">3. Resisting external pressures that would prevent or impede the attainment of our Church and institutional goals.</p><br><p class="p1">4. Encouraging BYU faculty and other employees to offer public, unassigned support of Church policies that are challenged on secular grounds.</p><br><p class="p1">5. Inviting serious consideration of and adjustment to the patterns of what and how we measure student learning and faculty research and publication.</p><br><p class="p1">Elder Oaks can speak to these challenges in such a direct and clear way precisely because he left his professional and scholarly "nets"<sup>21</sup> in response to the Lord's call to serve as a special witness of His name in all the world. He has learned of and from the Savior, he listens to His voice, and he walks in the meekness of His Spirit. I admonish you to review and heed his counsel and instruction.</p><br><p class="p3"><b>"Therefore, What?"</b></p><br><p class="p1">During discussions in the Quorum of the Twelve, President BoydK. Packer often would ask, "Therefore, what?"</p><br><p class="p1">I understood his question to mean, "So what spiritually significant difference will this idea, proposal, or course of action make in the lives of Church members? Will it actually bless those whom we serve?"</p><br><p class="p1">President Packer was inviting us to consider the value and long-term implications of the matter about which we were counseling. I have found the question "Therefore, what?" to be most helpful in focusing my thinking about an issue and in identifying the things that matter most.</p><br><p class="p1">So, you may be asking, "Brother Bednar, what is the 'therefore, what?' of your message to us?" My answer to this question has two parts.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> First, Brigham Young University will only fulfill its divine mission as all employees on this campus learn of Christ, listen to His words, and walk in the meekness of His Spirit. The Lord's invitation to walk in meekness is important for every person who interacts with or supports students in any way at BYU. Meekness is central to and essential for inspiring and experiential learning. And it is the unique combination of meekness and academic excellence that will set Brigham Young University apart from all other institutions of higher education.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Walking in meekness will help us to press forward through the messy middle.</p><br><p class="p1">Second, each of us should seek continually for heavenly help to avoid and overcome the selfish, negatively competitive, and adulation-seeking pride that is so common in our contemporary world. Personal pride is the greatest obstacle to walking in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit and twists accomplishment into arrogance, scholarship into intellectual priestcraft, and counsel and correction into causes for offense. The instruction from the Lord to Emma Smith in 1830 applies equally to all of us today: "Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride."<sup>22</sup></p><br><p class="p1">The ultimate answers to the question of "therefore, what?" are individual in nature and will come to our minds and hearts by the power of the Holy Ghost. They likely will be different for each of us. I now pose four questions to help us seek for those individual answers.</p><br><p class="p1">1. Is the mission of BYU changing me or am I trying to change the mission of BYU?</p><br><p class="p1">2. How does walking in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit facilitate inspiring and experiential learning?</p><br><p class="p1">3. What steps should I take to walk more fully in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit?</p><br><p class="p1">4. What can I do to help students walk more fully in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit?</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><b>Blessing and Testimony</b></h2><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> I love you. I appreciate who you are and what you do. And I love Brigham Young University. Ithank and commend you for your faithfulness, for your service to the students who come to learn on this campus, for teaching your respective disciplines with professionalism, and for all you do to declare the simple truths of the Lord's restored gospel and to support His latter-day Church.</span></p><br><p class="p1">I invoke upon you this blessing--that with the help of the Holy Ghost you may develop a strong desire to learn about meekness, that you incrementally and increasingly may become more meek, and that you modestly and confidently will walk in the meekness of the Lord's Spirit. As you do so, you will find rest unto your souls and you will have peace in Him. And you will be instrumental in helping the students on this campus to be strengthened spiritually, to be enlarged intellectually, to build character, and to be prepared for lifelong learning and service.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> I witness that Jesus Christ is the Living Son of the Living God. I know that He lives. I know that He is risen and that He knows and loves us as individuals. Oh, how I yearn to walk with you in the meekness of His Spirit. For this blessing I pray, and of these things I testify, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>David A.

<h1>ercent Responsible - Lynn G. Robbins - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be with you in this opening session of the 2017 BYU Campus Education Week. This year's theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 50:24, with special emphasis on these words: "And he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light."</p><br><p class="p1">I am going to take a different approach to this theme than might be expected by exposing and illustrating some very cunning and effective ways that the "wicked one" prevents people from progressing and receiving more light (D&amp;amp;C 93:39).</p><br><p class="p1">Many gospel principles come in pairs, meaning one is incomplete without the other. I want to refer to three of these doctrinal pairs today:</p><br><br><ul><br> 	<li class="p1">Agency and responsibility</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Mercy and justice</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Faith and works</li><br></ul><br><p class="p1">When Satan is successful in dividing doctrinal pairs, he begins to wreak havoc upon mankind. It is one of his most cunning strategies to keep people from growing in the light.</p><br><p class="p1">You already know that faith without works really isn't faith (see James 2:17). My primary focus will be on the other two doctrinal pairs: first, to illustrate how avoiding responsibility affects agency; and second, how "denying justice," as it is referred to in the Book of Mormon (see Alma 42:30), affects mercy.</p><br><p class="p1">The Book of Mormon teaches us that we are agents to "act ... and not to be acted upon" (2Nephi 2:26)--or to be "free to act for [our]selves" (2 Nephi 10:23). This freedom of choice was not a gift of partial agency but of complete and total 100 percent agency. It was absolute in the sense that the One Perfect Parent never forces His children. He shows us the way and may even command us, but, "nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).</p><br><p class="p1">Assuming responsibility and being accountable for our choices are agency's complementary principles (see D&amp;amp;C 101:78). <i>Responsibility</i> is to recognize ourselves as being the cause for the effects or results of our choices--good or bad. On the negative side, it is to always <i>own up</i> to the consequences of poor choices.</p><br><p class="p1">Except for those held innocent, such as little children and the intellectually disabled, gospel doctrine teaches us that each person is responsible for the use of their agency and "will be punished for their own sins" (Articles of Faith 1:2).<sup>1</sup> It isn't just a heavenly principle but a law of nature--we reap what we sow.</p><br><p class="p1">Logically then, complete and total agency comes with complete and total responsibility:</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <i>And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth </i></span><span class="s2"><b><i>unto himself;</i></b></span><span class="s1"><i> and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it </i></span><span class="s2"><b><i>unto himself;</i></b></span><span class="s1"><i> for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</i> [Helaman 14:30; emphasis added]</span></p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Korihor Principle--Separating Agency fromResponsibility</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">One of Satan's most crafty strategies to gain control of our agency isn't a frontal attack on our agency but a sneaky backdoor assault on responsibility. Without responsibility, every good gift from God could be misused for evil purposes. For example, freedom of speech without responsibility can be used to create and protect pornography. The rights of a woman can be twisted to justify an unnecessary abortion. When the world separates choice from accountability, it leads to anarchy and a war of wills or survival of the fittest. We could call agency without responsibility the Korihor principle, as we read in the book of Alma "that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did <i>was no crime</i>" (Alma 30:17; emphasis added). With negative consequences removed, you now have agency unbridled, as if there were no day of reckoning.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Nehor Principle--Denying Justice</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">If Satan is not successful in fully separating agency from responsibility, one of his backup schemes is to dull or minimize feelings of ­responsibility--what we could call the Nehor principle, also found in the book of Alma: "That all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble ...; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life" (Alma 1:4).</p><br><p class="p1">What an attractive offer for those who seek happiness in wickedness! The Nehor principle depends entirely on mercy and denies justice--a separation of the second doctrinal pair aforementioned. Denying justice is a twin of avoiding responsibility. They are essentially the same thing. A common strategy of each Book of Mormon anti-Christ was to separate agency from responsibility. "Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing alittle sin" (2Nephi 28:8).</p><br><p class="p1">Faith without works, mercy without justice, and agency without responsibility are all different verses of the same seductive and damning song. With each, the natural man rejects accountability in an attempt to sedate his conscience. It is similar to the early sixteenth-century practice of paying for indulgences, but much easier--this way it is free!<sup>2</sup> No wonder the broad path is filled with so many. The path parades a guilt-free journey to ­salvation but is, in reality, a cleverly disguised detour to destruction (see 3 Nephi 14:13).</p><br><p class="p1">Agency without responsibility is one of the foremost anti-Christ doctrines--very cunning in its nature and very destructive in its results.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Anti-Responsibility List</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">To illustrate, I want to share a list of things that Satan tempts people to either say or do to avoid being responsible. This list isn't all-inclusive, but Ibelieve it covers his most common tactics.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>1. Blaming others:</b></span> Saul disobediently took of the spoils of war from the Amalekites; then, when confronted by Samuel, he blamed the people (see 1Samuel 15:21).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>2. Rationalizing or justifying:</b></span> Saul then rationalized or justified his disobedience, stating that the saved livestock was for "sacrifice unto the Lord" (1<b></b>Samuel 15:21; see also verse 22).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>3. Making excuses:</b></span> Excuses come in a thousand varieties, such as this one from Laman and Lemuel: "How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?" (1Nephi 3:31).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>4. Minimalizing or trivializing sin:</b></span> This is exactly what Nehor advocated (see Alma 1:3–4).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>5. Hiding:</b> </span>This is a common avoidance technique. It is a tactic Satan used with Adam and Eve after they partook of the forbidden fruit (see Moses 4:14).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>6. Covering up:</b></span> Closely associated with hiding is covering up, which David attempted to do to conceal his affair with Bathsheba (see 2Samuel 12:9, 12).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>7. Fleeing from responsibility:</b></span> This is something Jonah tried to do (see Jonah 1:3).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>8. Abandoning responsibility:</b></span> Similar to fleeing is abandoning responsibility. One example is when Corianton forsook his ministry in pursuit of the harlot Isabel (see Alma 39:3).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>9. Denying or lying:</b></span> "And Saul said ...: I have performed the commandment of the Lord. And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears ...?" (1Samuel 15:13–14).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>10. Rebelling:</b></span> Samuel then rebuked Saul "for rebellion." "Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king" (1Samuel 15:23).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>11. Complaining and murmuring:</b></span> One who rebels also complains and murmurs: "And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and ... said ..., Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt!" (Numbers 14:2).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>12. Finding fault and getting angry:</b></span> These two are closely associated, as described by Nephi: "And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel" (1Nephi 3:28).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>13. Making demands and entitlements:</b></span> "We will not that our younger brother shall be a ruler over us. And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness" (1Nephi 18:10–11).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>14. Doubting, losing hope, giving up, and quitting:</b></span> "Our brother is a fool. ... For they did not believe that I could build a ship" (1Nephi 17:17–18).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>15. Indulging in self-pity and a victim ­mentality:</b></span> "Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy" (1Nephi 17:21).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>16. Being indecisive or being in a spiritual ­stupor:</b></span> The irony with indecision is that if you don't make a decision in time, time will make a decision for you.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>17. Procrastinating:</b></span> A twin of indecision is ­procrastination. "But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late" (Helaman 13:38).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>18. Allowing fear to rule:</b></span> This one is also related to hiding: "And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth. ... His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant" (Matthew 25:25–26).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>19. Enabling:</b></span> An example of enabling or ­helping others to avoid responsibility is the instance when Eli failed to discipline his sons for their grievous sins and was rebuked by the Lord: "Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and ... honourest thy sons above me ...? (1Samuel 2:29; see also verses 22–36).</p><br><p class="p1">When you consider this list with Laman and Lemuel in mind, you will see that they were guilty of nearly everything on the list. It is this list that destroyed Laman and Lemuel. It is an extremely dangerous list.</p><br><p class="p1">When reading 1 Nephi and 2 Nephi, we can only try to imagine how difficult it was for the members of Lehi's family to leave their home, obtain the brass plates, camp out for eight years inthe wilderness, and build a large ocean-going vessel. The responsibility that faced the ­family was indeed formidable. Yet, as difficult as a responsibility may be, "difficulty is the excuse history never accepts,"<sup>3</sup> as is so graphically illustrated in the case of Laman and Lemuel.</p><br><p class="p1">Difficult situations are the test of one's faith, to see if we will go forward with either a believing heart (see D&amp;amp;C 64:34) or a doubting heart (see D&amp;amp;C 58:29), if at all. A difficult situation reveals a person's character and either strengthens it, as with Nephi, or weakens and corrupts it, as with Laman and Lemuel, who epitomize what it means to be irresponsible (see Alma 62:41).</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Excuses Do Not Equal Results</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">It is important to recognize that excuses never equal results. In the case of Laman and Lemuel, all the excuses in the world could never obtain the brass plates. The reason Nephi obtained the plates and Laman and Lemuel didn't is because Nephi never went to the anti-responsibility list. He was a champion, and champions do not turn to the list. As Elder DavidB. Haight of the Quorum of the Twelve stated, "A determined man finds a way; the other man finds an excuse."<sup>4</sup></p><br><p class="p1">If the anti-responsibility list is so dangerous, why do so many people frequently turn to it? Because the natural man is irresponsible by nature, he goes to the list as a defense mechanism to avoid shame and embarrassment, stress and anxiety, and the pain and negative consequences of mistakes and sin. Rather than repent to eliminate guilt, he sedates it with excuses. It gives him a false sense that his environment or someone else is to blame, and therefore he has no need to repent.</p><br><p class="p1">The anti-responsibility list could also be called the anti-faith list because it halts progress dead in its tracks. When Satan tempts a person to avoid responsibility, that person subtly surrenders their agency because the person is no longer in control or "acting." Instead they become an object who is being acted upon, and Satan cleverly begins to control their life.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Difference Between Making an Excuse and Giving a Reason</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">It is important to note that everyone occasionally fails in their attempts at success, just as Nephi did with his brothers in their first two trips to Jerusalem when they were trying to obtain the plates. But those who are valiant accept responsibility for their mistakes and sins. They repent, get back on their feet, and continue moving forward in faith. They may give an explanation or a reason for their lack of success but not an excuse.</p><br><p class="p1">At first glance it may appear that Adam was blaming Eve when he said, "The woman thou gavest me." However, when Adam subsequently added "and I did eat," we are given to understand that he accepted responsibility for his actions and was giving an explanation, not blaming Eve. Eve in turn also said, "And I did eat" (Moses 4:18–19; see also verses 17–20; 5:10–11).</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Power and Reward of Being Responsible</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Turning to the anti-responsibility list is an act of self-betrayal. It is to give up on oneself and sometimes on others. As I share the following stories, I hope you will observe how going to the anti-responsibility list is counterproductive, <i>even if you are right.</i></p><br><br><h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b><i>Story 1: 100 Percent Responsibility in the Distribution Center</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">In 1983 a few partners and I started a new ­company that taught time-management seminars and created and sold day planners.</p><br><p class="p1">For corporate seminars, we sent our consultants to the client's headquarters, where they taught at the corporate training facilities. Prior to the seminar, two employees in our distribution center would prepare and ship several boxes of training materials, such as the day planners, binders, and forms. Also included was a participant's seminar guidebook of around a hundred pages with quotes, fill-in-the blanks, graphs, and illustrations.</p><br><p class="p1">The two distribution center employees would normally send the seminar shipment ten days before the seminar. At the time that the following incident occurred, we were teaching around 250 seminars each month. With so many seminar shipments, these two employees would often commit errors, such as not shipping sufficient quantities or omitting certain materials or not shipping on time. This became an irritating and often embarrassing frustration for the consultants.</p><br><p class="p1">When these problems occurred, the seminar division would file a complaint with me, as the distribution center was one of my responsibilities. When I spoke with these two employees about errors and system improvements, they never wanted to accept responsibility for the errors. They would blame others, saying things like, "It's not our fault. The seminar division filled out the Seminar Supplies Request form incorrectly, and we sent the shipment exactly according to their specifications. It's their fault. You can't blame us!" Or they might say, "We shipped it on time, but the freight company delivered it late. You can't blame us!" Another excuse was, "The binder subsidiary packaged the individual seminar kits with errors, and we shipped the kits as they were given to us. It's their fault." It seemed these two employees were never responsible for the errors, and so the errors continued.</p><br><p class="p1">Then something critical happened. The director of training for a large multinational corporation attended one of our seminars and was so thrilled with it that she invited us to teach a pilot seminar to its fifty or so top executives. On the day of the seminar, our consultant arrived and opened the boxes of materials and discovered that the seminar guidebooks were missing. Without the seminar guidebooks, how would the participants follow along and take notes? Their training director was panic-stricken. Our consultant did the best he could by making sure each participant was given a pad of paper on which to take notes throughout the day, and the seminar turned out reasonably well, even without the guidebooks.</p><br><p class="p1">Extremely embarrassed and angry, their training director called our seminar division and said, "You will never teach here again! How could you have made such an embarrassing and inexcusable error with our pilot seminar?"</p><br><p class="p1">An upset senior vice president of our seminar division called me and said, "This is the last straw. We are about to lose a million-dollar account because of the distribution center's errors. We simply can't tolerate any more errors!"</p><br><p class="p1">As one of the owners of the company, I couldn't tolerate such errors either. At the same time, I did not want to see these two breadwinners fired. After pondering possible solutions, I decided to implement an incentive system to motivate these two men to be more careful. For each seminar shipped correctly, they would receive one additional dollar, or a possibility of an extra $250 each month--hopefully enough to focus their attention on quality. However, if they made one error, a one-dollar penalty wasn't much of a loss. I therefore decided to also include two $100 bonuses for no errors. With the first error they not only lost one dollar but also the first $100 bonus. If they made a second error, they lost the second $100 bonus.</p><br><p class="p1">I also told these employees, "If there is an error, you will lose your bonus, regardless of where that error originates. You are 100 percent responsible for that shipment."</p><br><p class="p1">"Well, that's not fair," they responded. "What happens if the seminar division fills out the Seminar Supplies Request form incorrectly and, not knowing, we send the shipment with 'their' errors?"</p><br><p class="p1">I said, "You will lose your bonus. You are 100 percent responsible for that shipment's success."</p><br><p class="p1">"That's not fair! What happens if we send the shipment on time but the freight company delivers it late?"</p><br><p class="p1">"You will lose your bonus. You are 100 percent responsible."</p><br><p class="p1">"That's not fair! What happens if the binder division commits errors in prepackaging the individual seminar kits? You can't blame us for their mistakes!"</p><br><p class="p1">"You will lose your bonus," I once again responded. "You are 100 percent responsible for that shipment's success. Do you understand?"</p><br><p class="p1">"That isn't fair!!"</p><br><p class="p1">"Well, it may not seem fair, but that's life. You will lose your bonus."</p><br><p class="p1">What I did was eliminate the anti-­<span class="s1">responsibility list as an option for them. They nowunderstood that they could no longer blame others, make excuses, or justify errors--even when they were right and it was someone else's fault!</span></p><br><p class="p1">What happened next was fascinating to observe. When they would receive an order from the seminar division, they would call the seminar division to review the form item by item. They took responsibility for correcting any errors committed by the seminar division. They began to read the freight company's documents to make sure the correct delivery date was entered. They began to mark the cardboard shipping boxes "one of seven," "two of seven," etc., with each box's contents written on the outside of the box. They began sending shipments three or four days ­earlier than they had in their previous routine. A few days before the seminar they would call the client company to verify receipt of the shipment and the contents. If they had somehow omitted any materials, they had three or four extra days now to send missing items by express shipment. Errors finally stopped happening, and the employees began to earn their bonuses month after month. It was a life-changing experience for them to learn firsthand the power, control, and reward of being 100 percent responsible.</p><br><p class="p1">What these two employees learned is that when they blamed someone else, they were surrendering control of the shipment's success to ­others--such as the seminar division or the freight company. They learned that excuses keep you from taking control of your life. They learned that it is self-defeating to blame others, make excuses, or justify mistakes--even when you are right! The moment you do any of these self-defeating things, you lose control over the positive outcomes you are seeking in life.</p><br><br><h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b><i>Story 2: "Putting My Marriage Before My Pride"</i></b></span></h3><br><p class="p1">Let me quote from the experience of a young wife:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Like any couple, my husband and I have had disagreements during our marriage. But one incident stands out in my mind. I no longer recall the reason for our disagreement, but we ended up not speaking at all, and I remember feeling that it was all my husband's fault. I felt I had done absolutely nothing for which I needed to apologize.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>As the day went by, I waited for my husband to say he was sorry. Surely he could see how wrong he was. It must be obvious how much he had hurt my feelings. I felt I had to stand up for myself; it was the principle that mattered.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>As the day was drawing to a close, I started to realize that I was waiting in vain, so I went to the Lord in prayer. I prayed that my husband would realize what he had done and how it was hurting our marriage. I prayed that he would be inspired to apologize so we could end our disagreement.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>As I was praying, I felt a strong impression that I should go to my husband and apologize. I was a bit shocked by this impression and immediately pointed out in my prayer that I had done nothing wrong and therefore should not have to say I was sorry. A thought came strongly to my mind: "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be married?"</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>As I considered this question, I realized that I could hold onto my pride and not give in until he apologized, but how long would that take? Days? I was miserable while we weren't speaking to each other. I understood that while this incident itself wouldn't be the end of our marriage, if I were always unyielding, that might cause serious damage over the years. I decided it was more important to have a happy, loving marriage than to keep my pride intact over something that would later seem trivial.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>I went to my husband and apologized for upsetting him. He also apologized, and soon we were happy and united again in love.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Since that time there have been occasions when I have needed to ask myself that question again: "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be married?" How grateful I am for the great lesson I learned the first time I faced that question. It has always helped me realign my perspective and put my husband and my marriage before my own pride.</i><sup>5</sup></p><br><p class="p1">In the story, this sister learned that even if she may have been right and it was her husband's fault, blaming him was counterproductive, causing her to lose control over positive outcomes. She also discovered that there is power and control in the expression "I'm sorry" when it is used with love unfeigned and empathy--not merely toexcuse ourselves.</p><br><p class="p1">In a marriage, a 50 percent attitude on both parts may seem logical, but only a 100 percent attitude on both parts closes the door to the anti-responsibility list. A final lesson that this sister learned is that you cannot control the agency of another person--only your own.</p><br><p class="p1">A loving mother once gave the following wise counsel to her daughter, who was unhappy with a struggling marriage. She had the daughter draw a vertical line down the middle of a sheet of paper and write down on the left side all the things her husband did that bothered her. Then, on the right side, she had her write down her response to each offense. The mother then had her cut the paper in half, separating the two lists.</p><br><p class="p1">"Now throw the paper with your husband's faults in the garbage. If you want to be happy and improve your marriage, stop focusing on your husband's faults and focus instead on your own behavior. Examine the way you are responding to the things that bother you and see if you can respond in a different, more positive way."</p><br><p class="p1">This mother understood the power and wisdom of 100 percent responsibility.</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Greatest Example of All</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Of course the Savior was the most responsible person in the history of the world. His is the greatest example. Even in His moments of excruciating pain and anguish, He showed no self-pity, one of the dysfunctional items on the list. He was always thinking outward with His ever-selfless care and concern for others--restoring a soldier's ear in Gethsemane and, later, on the cross, praying for those who had despitefully used Him--in fulfillment of His own commandment to do so: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).</p><br><p class="p1">The more we are like Jesus Christ, the less likely we are to judge unrighteously, to give up on someone, or to quit a worthy cause. Even though we may sometimes give up on ourselves, the Savior never gives up on us, because He is perfect in His long-suffering: "Notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled with compassion towards them" (D&amp;amp;C 101:9).</p><br><p class="p1">Jesus Christ did not come to find fault, criticize, or blame. He came to build up, edify, and save (see Luke 9:56). However, His compassion does not nullify His expectation that we be fully responsible and never try to minimize or justify sin. "For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance" (D&amp;amp;C 1:31; see also Alma 45:16). If the Lord cannot look upon sin with even the least degree of allowance, what law of the gospel demands complete and full responsibility for sin?</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That would be the law of justice. "What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God" (Alma 42:25; see also verse 24). Not in the "least degree" and "not one whit" are other ways of saying that God holds His children 100 percent responsible for the use of their agency. The danger of the anti-responsibility list consists in the fact that it blinds its victims to the need for repentance. Laman and Lemuel, for example, didn't see a need to repent because it was all Nephi's fault. "If it's not my fault, why should I repent?" The one blinded can't even take the first step in the repentance process, which is to recognize the need for repentance.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Alma understood very well how excuses keep us from repenting, as we discover in this verse where he counseled his wayward son, Corianton:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>O my son, I desire that ye should </i><span class="s2"><b><i>deny the justice</i></b></span><i> of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by </i><span class="s2"><b><i>denying the justice</i></b></span><i> of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.</i> [Alma 42:25, 30]</p><br><p class="p1">As we learn from this verse, those who use excuses are "denying justice"--the Nehor ­principle--and believe that the law of justice doesn't apply to them. Alma was pleading with his son not to go to the list. "Do not endeavor to <i>excuse</i> yourself in the least point." He was teaching his son to be 100 percent responsible.</p><br><p class="p1">To deny God's justice--or to say we are not accountable for sin--is to also deny His justification in the forgiveness of that sin: "The Lord surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem them <i>in</i> their sins, but to redeem them <i>from</i> their sins" (Helaman 5:10; emphasis added).</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Two Ways to Deny the Lord's Justice</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Satan successfully divides the complimentary principles of mercy and justice when a person succumbs to the temptation to deny the Lord's justice. Denying the Lord's justice comes in at least two forms. The first, which I have already mentioned, is to deny the law of justice in regard to one's own sins, something both Korihor and Nehor advocated. A second and equally damaging denial is not trusting in the Lord's justice or in His wisdom in dealing with the injustices others have perpetrated against us.</p><br><p class="p1">In the movie based on the masterfully written classic <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> by Alexandre Dumas, Edmond Dantès, the protagonist, is an honest and loving man who turns bitter and vengeful after three covetous men bear false witness against him and frame him in a treasonous plot. When a corrupt public prosecutor becomes complicit, Dantès is arrested on the very day he is to be married to his beautiful fiancée, Mercédès. At age nineteen he is given a life sentence in the infamous island prison of Chateau d'If for a crime he did not commit.</p><br><p class="p1">After many tortuous years in solitary confinement, he finally meets another prisoner, the elderly Abbé Faria, who in his search for freedom has miscalculated and tunneled his way to Edmond's cell rather than to an outside wall and freedom. With a tunnel now connecting their cells and nothing but time on their hands, Faria begins to teach Dantès history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Faria also bequeaths to Dantès a treasure of vast wealth hidden on the uninhabited island of Monte Cristo and tells him how to find it, should he ever escape.</p><br><p class="p1">Knowing that vengeance could consume and destroy Dantès, Abbé Faria teaches him a final lesson before he dies. The lesson is to not deny the Lord's justice.</p><br><p class="p1">Abbé Faria says, "Do not commit the crime for which you now serve the sentence. God said, 'Vengeance is mine.<span class="s3">'</span>"</p><br><p class="p1">Dantès responds, "I don't believe in God."</p><br><p class="p1">Abbé Faria then says, "It doesn't matter. He believes in you."<sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Dantès remains unconvinced. Upon the death of Faria, Dantès devises a clever plan by hiding himself in the death shroud of Faria and is finally able to escape his fourteen years of torment from Chateau d'If. After securing the treasure, he becomes extremely wealthy and assumes a new identity as the Count of Monte Cristo.</p><br><p class="p1">For the evil men who conspired against him, he devises an elaborate plan of revenge with a painful and prolonged punishment--a just recompense for the fourteen years he barely survived in the dungeon to which they had unjustly sent him.</p><br><p class="p1">With precision Dantès sets in motion his plan, and his enemies suffer the punishment he has carefully devised for each one of them.</p><br><p class="p1">When we read the book or watch the movie version of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i> there is something in us that wants to see justice served against those cruel and conspiring men who inflicted so much pain on an innocent man. There is a sense of fairness and a desire in each of us that good must prevail over evil, that things lost must be restored, and that broken hearts must be mended. Until these things happen, there is an injustice gap that is hard for us to reconcile in our minds and even more so in our hearts--leaving us troubled and finding it difficult to move on.</p><br><p class="p1">People try to reconcile this injustice gap in many ways: through seeking revenge, justifying their anger and bitterness, or seeking legal redress and imposed consequences. We ultimately discover that the Lord's way is the only way for true and complete reconciliation.</p><br><p class="p1">The error of Dantès was not necessarily seeking redress and justice according to the law of the land and bringing devious facts to light with appropriate penalties for the guilty but in letting his desire for justice turn to hatred, anger, self-pity, self-justification, and other disabling behaviors on the anti-responsibility list. He essentially descended to his enemies' level of ungodliness, and he used deception, lies, and fraud to entrap them--all outside the lawful process--just as they had done to him and just as Abbé Faria had prophesied.</p><br><p class="p1">By relying on the law of Moses--an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth--rather than on the law of the gospel, including forgiving and praying for one's enemies, Dantès imposed a life sentence of misery and bitterness upon himself. In denying the Lord's justice for others, he unwittingly denied the Lord's mercy for himself and chose to serve the sentence that Christ had already served in his behalf. It robbed him of a life of happiness that could have been his but for the want of revenge.</p><br><p class="p1">Having faith in Jesus Christ is to trust that because of His atoning sacrifice, He will correct all injustices, restore all things lost, and mend all things broken, including hearts. He will make all things right, not leaving any detail unattended. Therefore, "ye ought to say in your hearts--let God judge between me and thee, and reward thee according to thy deeds" (D&amp;amp;C 64:11).</p><br><p class="p1">Like Edmond Dantès, many victims have been so cruelly injured, such as in abuse cases, with no apparent justice forthcoming, that they felt like the Lord was requiring the impossible by asking them to forgive.</p><br><p class="p1">As hard as forgiving may be in such situations, not forgiving is even harder over the long run because it puts a person on the disabling anti-responsibility list. Not forgiving is a synonym with blaming, anger, self-justifying, and self‑pity--all things that are on the list. When Satan taps into any of these negative emotions, he begins exercising control over a person's life.</p><br><p class="p1">One of the most difficult times to forgive is in the case of spouse abuse, with its accompanying anguish, pain of betrayal, and cruelty. There is an interesting and common pattern with abuse cases: the abuser nearly always blames the victim, just as Laman and Lemuel blamed Nephi for their abuse of him. The Lord warned Nephi to separate his family from his brothers and their wicked intentions so he could protect himself and his family (see 2 Nephi 5:1–7). Let's assume that a woman who has been cruelly abused receives similar revelation, and she separates from her extremely abusive husband.</p><br><p class="p1">Even though the abused woman is now free from the abusive environment, she is finding it hard to forgive her husband for the sustained and escalating cruelty. It seems unfair to ask her to forgive his brutality when he seems to be unrepentant. It doesn't seem fair for her, the innocent one, to be suffering while he, the guilty one, appears to get off scot-free. Is there peace to be found without justice?</p><br><p class="p1">Like Edmond Dantès, until the abused wife learns to forgive, she is also denying or not trusting in the justice of God and His ability to judge wisely.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Justice is an eternal law that requires a penalty each time a law of God is broken (Alma 42:13–24). The sinner must pay the penalty if he does not repent (Mosiah 2:38–39; D&amp;amp;C 19:17). If he does repent, the Savior pays the penalty through the Atonement, invoking mercy (Alma 34:16).</i><sup>7</sup></p><br><p class="p1">If the former husband does not repent, he will pay the penalty--"how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not" (D&amp;amp;C 19:15). The wife will know if he truly repents because his restitution will include humbly and sincerely asking for her forgiveness and his striving to make amends.</p><br><p class="p1">Even though the wife may understand the law of justice, what she is feeling is the need for justice now. Elder NealA. Maxwell wisely taught that "faith in God includes faith in His purposes as well as in His timing. We cannot fully accept Him while rejecting His schedule."<sup>8</sup> Elder Maxwell also said, "The gospel guarantees ultimate, not proximate, justice."<sup>9</sup> "Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift judgment in the season thereof, for them all" (D&amp;amp;C 121:24).</p><br><p class="p1">The law of justice and trusting in the Lord's timing allows the wife not to worry about justice anymore and places judgment in God's hands: "Behold what the scripture says--man shall not smite, neither shall he judge; for judgment is mine, saith the Lord, and vengeance is mine also, and I will repay" (Mormon 8:20).</p><br><p class="p1">Elder JeffreyR. Holland shared this helpful insight:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Please don't ask if it is fair. .</i><i>.</i><i>. When it comes to our own sins, we don't ask for justice. What we plead for is mercy--and that is what we must be willing to give.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Can we see the tragic irony of not granting to others what we need so badly ourselves?</i><sup>10</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Those who have experienced permanent damage, prolonged suffering, or loss from an offense face a far more difficult challenge in forgiving and turning justice over to the Lord. Hopefully they can find comfort in something the Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "What can [these misfortunes] do? Nothing. All your losses will be made up to you in the resurrection, provided you continue faithful."<sup>11</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1">Until the abused woman can turn justice over to the Lord, she will likely continue to experience feelings of anger--which are a form of negative devotion toward her abuser--and this traps her in a recurring nightmare. President George Albert Smith referred to this as "cherish[ing] an improper influence."<sup>12</sup> With her husband having hurt her so deeply, why would the wife allow him to continue victimizing her by haunting her thoughts? Hasn't she suffered enough? Not forgiving her abuser allows him to mentally torment her over and over and over. Forgiving him doesn't set him free; it sets her free.</p><br><p class="p1">Part of understanding forgiveness is to understand what it is not:</p><br><br><ul><br> 	<li class="p1">Forgiving her abusive husband does not excuse or condone his cruelty.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Forgiving does not mean forgetting his brutality; you cannot unremember or erase a memory that is so traumatic.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Forgiving does not mean that justice is being denied, because mercy cannot rob justice.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Forgiving does not erase the injury he has caused, but it can begin to heal the wounds and ease the pain.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Forgiving does not mean trusting him again and giving him yet another chance to abuse her and the children. While to forgive is a commandment, trust has to be earned and evidenced by good behavior over time, which he clearly has not demonstrated.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Forgiving does not mean forgiveness of his sins. Only the Lord can do that, based upon sincere repentance.</li><br></ul><br><p class="p1">These are things that forgiveness does not mean. What forgiveness does mean is to forgive the husband's foolishness--even his stupidity--in succumbing to the impulses of the natural man and at the same time still hope that he will yet yield "to the enticings of the Holy Spirit" (Mosiah 3:19). Forgiveness does not mean giving him another chance to abuse, but it does mean giving him another chance at the plan of salvation.</p><br><p class="p1">It is also helpful if the wife understands "that we are punished <i>by</i> our sins and not <i>for</i> them."<sup>13</sup> She then recognizes that her abuser has inflicted far more eternal damage upon himself than temporal damage upon her. And even in the present, his true happiness and joy diminish in inverse proportion to his increased wickedness, because "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10). He is to be pitied for the sorrowful and precarious situation he is in.</p><br><p class="p1">Knowing that he is sinking in spiritual quicksand might begin to change her desire for ­justice--which is already occurring--to a hope that he will repent before it is too late. With this understanding she might even begin to pray for the one who has despitefully abused her.</p><br><p class="p1">This Christlike change in her heart helps her to forgive and brings about the healing she so desperately wants and deserves. The Savior knows exactly how to heal her because He precisely knows her pain, having lived it vicariously.</p><br><p class="p1">In this scenario of the abused wife, we have two parties--the abusive husband and the ­victim-wife, both of whom need divine help. Alma teaches us that the Savior suffered for both: for the sins of the man and for the anguish, heartache, and pain of the woman (see Alma 7:11–12; Luke 4:18).</p><br><p class="p1">To access the Savior's grace and the healing power of His Atonement, the Savior requires something from both of them.</p><br><p class="p1">The husband's key to access the Lord's grace is <i>repentance.</i> If the husband doesn't repent, he cannot be forgiven by the Lord (see D&amp;amp;C 19:15–17).</p><br><p class="p1">The wife's key to access the Lord's grace and then allow Him to heal her is <i>forgiveness.</i> Until the wife is able to forgive, she is choosing to suffer the anguish and pain that He has already suffered on her behalf. By not forgiving, she unwittingly denies His mercy and healing. In a sense, she fulfills this scripture:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I, God, have suffered these things ... that they might not suffer. ..</i>.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>But if they would not repent</i> [or forgive,] <i>they must suffer even as I.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 19:16–17]</p><br><br><h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">In summary, being 100 percent responsible is accepting yourself as the person in control of your life. If others are at fault and need to change before further progress is made, then you are at their mercy and they are in control over the positive outcomes or desired results in your life. Agency and responsibility are inseparably connected. You cannot avoid responsibility without also diminishing agency. Mercy and justice are also inseparable. You cannot deny the Lord's justice without also impeding His mercy. Oh, how Satan loves to divide complementary principles and laugh at the resulting devastation!</p><br><p class="p1">I invite each one of you to eliminate the anti-responsibility or anti-faith list from your life, even when you are right! It is an anti-happy and an anti-success list even when you are right. It is not a list for the valiant sons and daughters of God who are seeking to become more like Him. It is one of Satan's foremost tools in controlling and destroying lives. The day a person eliminates the list from their life is the day they regain control over positive outcomes from that point on, and they begin moving forward in the light at an accelerated pace (see D&amp;amp;C 50:24).</p><br><p class="p1">I bear my certain witness of the name of Jesus Christ and of the power and happiness that the fulness of His gospel affords us. He is the Life and the Light of the World. These principles that I shared today are His. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Lynn G. Robbins, a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, delivered this devotional address on August 22, 2017, during BYU Campus Education Week.</i></span></p><br><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Notes</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">1.

<h1>a Balanced Life - Donald L. Hallstrom - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">I feel privileged to be in Provo for the August 2017 commencement exercises of Brigham Young University. My dear wife, Diane, deeply wished that she could be here, but a long-planned family obligation prevented that. Diane and I met on this campus forty-six years ago. I had just returned from my mission to England and was resuming my studies here. Just a few weeks into the fall semester, I was asked by my mission president--who was still in England--to speak at his home ward in Bountiful. I had so recently returned from my mission that perhaps I was uncomfortable without a companion, so I called a young woman in my student ward whom I had seen but never met and asked her to accompany me. That first date turned into a courtship and then an engagement, and last month Diane and I celebrated our forty-fifth wedding anniversary. The year after our marriage we both received degrees from this institution--Diane while almost nine months pregnant. Coming back to where it all began is a profound privilege.</p><br><p class="p1">As a member of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees for more than five years, I have regularly been engaged in discussions and decisions about this university. Continually I have been inspired by how deeply the Lord and His prophets care about the youth of the Church and how willing they are to provide enormous sacred resources to assist in temporal and spiritual education. You are blessed to have this university, and it is blessed to have you!</p><br><p class="p1">I have great respect for President KevinJ Worthen. Since his appointment three years ago, we have been in board and executive committee meetings twice each month. He has a brilliant mind, he is modest in his leadership style, and he is completely loyal to the Lord and to the leaders of the Lord's Church. We are extremely fortunate to have an individual of President Worthen's quality leading this university. His complete desire is to do it the Lord's way!</p><br><p class="p1">Since Diane and I matriculated on this ­campus four and a half decades ago, it has become more ethnically and culturally diverse, reflecting what has occurred in the Church during this period. We have been to most of the countries and states that you call home. Yes, there are cultural and socioeconomic differences in the places you come from, and that variety is part of the strength of this university; however, do not forget--in the way that matters most--we are all the same. We are all children of the same eternal Father. That understanding is what makes BYU truly special, as it provides the spiritual foundation that gives academic efforts perspective and importance.</p><br><p class="p1">To you graduates, I say, "Congratulations!" and "Well done!" However, I emphasize there is a reason this event is called commencement and not conclusion. Yes, it may conclude your formal education, at least on this campus, but it is the beginning of a new season of life. You may find that exciting, and you may find it a little overwhelming, but, in any case, it is going to happen. You are moving on to new ventures, and hopefully they will exemplify progression in your life's goals.</p><br><p class="p1">Today, fully understanding that this graduation event is not about me and that you will likely remember little, if any, of my ­message, I want to be relatively brief, I want to be practical, and I want to be clear. Considering your future, I will speak about priorities and seeking balance in your life. You will leave this institution, and some of you will go on to further formal education. Some will begin your professions. Some of you will do both, simultaneously. Many of you leave married--several of you with children. You have held Church responsibilities, some quite demanding, and you will continue to do so. Life, if ­anything, will become even more complex, more demanding, and--if lived well--even more rewarding.</p><br><p class="p1">Before my thirtieth year I was called to be the bishop of an 850-member ward in Honolulu, Hawaii. Two weeks prior, I had cofounded a company that had just hired and was responsible for many new employees. At the time, Diane and I had three active children, ages one to seven. The daunting responsibilities to properly care for my young family and the Saints entrusted to my stewardship, all in the midst of creating a viable business, seemed impossible. Would I know how to allocate my time when any one of these three important and complex aspects of life could become all-consuming? Was it possible to achieve a balance?</p><br><p class="p1">In those days I often recalled a childhood memory. When I was a boy, <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> was one of the most popular programs on television. As a variety show, it featured performers with widely divergent talents. One performer was a man who appeared regularly. Many poles, perhaps a dozen or more, were set up on stage with stacks of dinner plates beside them. This agile individual would spin a plate on top of one of the poles, then move to the next pole and spin a second plate, and then a third and a fourth. As he proceeded down the line of poles, the rotation of the plates on the first and second poles would begin to slow, and the dishes were in danger of falling off and crashing to the floor. Seeing this, the man would quickly run back to those poles and, with a gentle spin, increase the motion that allowed the plates to keep spinning. The excitement of the act was to witness the ability of the performer to expand the number of rotating plates while not letting any fall. Invariably, a point would be reached at which he was not able to keep up. There was a limit to his ability to increase the number and properly care for the plates already in motion. The sight of dishes sliding from their precarious perches and the cacophony as they hit the hard floor vividly proved the point that even the most skilled performer has his limits.</p><br><p class="p1">Of much greater consequence, each of us must decide how many "poles" we are able to manage in our life and what they represent. Some individuals are spinning a single plate with all their effort, ignoring all the other poles. Others are attempting to spin so many simultaneously that the crashing of plates is often heard.</p><br><p class="p1">Leading a balanced life is difficult for many. There is not an exact pattern for everyone, and even our own blueprint may change during different phases of our life. However, seeking balance--giving adequate time and effort to each of those things that really matter--is vital to our success in mortal probation. There are certain fundamental responsibilities we cannot neglect without serious consequence.</p><br><p class="p1">What are the essential "poles" of our lives? Isuggest four:</p><br><p class="p1">1. Our love for our Heavenly Father and Jesus the Christ</p><br><p class="p1">2. Our care for our family</p><br><p class="p1">3. Our service to the Lord</p><br><p class="p1">4. Our life's temporal work</p><br><p class="p3"><b>1. Our Love for Our Heavenly Father and Jesusthe Christ</b></p><br><p class="p1">The scriptures speak powerfully of this sacred duty. A Pharisee, who was a lawyer, asked, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind" (Matthew 22:36–37). Describing it as part of "the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father" (2 Nephi 31:21), Nephi taught, "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ ... and a love of God" (2 Nephi 31:20).</p><br><p class="p1">Our love of the Father and the Son is foundational to everything else. The Savior, representing the Father, is the source of peace (see John 14:27). Love for the Savior is the supreme motivation to keep "in the right way" (Moroni 6:4). Every other aspect of our life is enhanced when we truly love our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, as we will love ourselves and others more completely. Answers to our most challenging problems are found only when we love and have faith in Them.</p><br><p class="p3"><b>2. Our Care for Our Family</b></p><br><p class="p1">In "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," we read: "Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. ... Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness [and to] observe the commandments of God" (<i>Ensign,</i> November 1995).</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> President DavidO. McKay often liked to quote, "No other success can compensate for failure in the home" (James Edward McCulloch, <i>Home: The Savior of Civilization</i> [Washington, DC: Southern Co-operative League, 1924], 42; see <i>CR,</i> April 1935, 116). Other prophetic counsel by President HaroldB. Lee has taught, "The most important of the Lord's work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes" ("Be Loyal to the Royal Within You," BYU devotional address, 11September 1973). Our desires and actions toward our family should be as exemplified by Lehi when he partook of the sweet fruit of the tree of life and immediately was "desirous that [his] family should partake of it also" (1 Nephi 8:12).</span></p><br><p class="p1">For many, properly caring for our family is the <i>first</i> area of compromise when other demands arise, as the results of neglect are not always immediately apparent. Nurturing the husband/wife relationship and building a spiritual home requires men and women of vision and commitment.</p><br><p class="p3"><b>3. Our Service to the Lord</b></p><br><p class="p1">A natural extension of our love for the Savior is our desire to serve Him. "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me" (D&amp;amp;C 42:29). The way we serve Him is by serving one another. "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). Elder DallinH. Oaks said, "Service is an imperative for true followers of Jesus Christ" (<i>Pure in Heart</i> [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988], 37).</p><br><p class="p1">Our time spent in Church and community service may vary during different periods of our life depending on specific callings we receive and on our family circumstances. However, our desire and our availability to serve should never waver.</p><br><p class="p3"><b>4. Our Life's Temporal Work</b></p><br><p class="p1">Although temporal work is temporary, it is still important as a support to the other, more long-lasting aspects of life and provides valuable service to others. Again, the family proclamation gives clear direction:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated tohelp one another as equal partners.</i></p><br><p class="p1">We commend you for obtaining a quality education. Many of you will continue this pursuit. This monumental effort will allow choices in your life's work, and dedication to an honorable profession, properly balanced, will enhance your spiritual life.</p><br><p class="p1">These four "poles" must not be neglected. Each needs constant care to fulfill its proper role in making us "whole" (Mark 2:17).</p><br><p class="p1">President GordonB. Hinckley taught:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I think ... all of us in this Church ... have a fourfold responsibility. One, they have a responsibility to their families, to see that their families have a measure of their time. ... None of us can evade that. ... That is basic and it is fundamental.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>If we are employed, we have a responsibility to our employer. We are not at liberty to short-change him. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>We have a responsibility to the Lord, of course, todo that which is expected of us as a servant in Hishouse.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>And ... we have a responsibility to ourselves to take some time to do a little meditating, to do a little exercise. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>... How do you balance them? I don't think that is difficult. I served in many capacities in this Church. I am the father of five children, who were young and growing up when I was serving in those various capacities. ... We enjoyed life. ... We just did what the Church expected us to do. There is safety in that program; it's inspired.</i> [<i>TGBH,</i> 33]</p><br><p class="p1">As sincere followers of Christ, we must constantly evaluate what is most important. Are we so intensively focused on one pole that the plates atop the others are in danger of falling because of our neglect? Or are we spinning too many plates on too many poles and needing to simplify our life to keep all that truly matters in proper motion?</p><br><p class="p1">How do we know if our life is out of balance? Well, most of us just know. We simply need to admit it and exercise the discipline to change, substituting higher values and better habits for those we have been living. We need to follow the counsel of President SpencerW. Kimball to "do it now" before any further damage is caused by our lack of attention to other indispensable parts of life ("Always a Convert Church: Some Lessons to Learn and Apply This Year," <i>Ensign,</i> September 1975).</p><br><p class="p1">For others, recognition of imbalance may not be so clear. While serving as a stake president, I observed as a member of our stake grew in prominence in the business community. He had a growing family and held positions of responsibility in the Church. All appeared to be in order. Then it became evident that he was paying too high a price for his temporal success. The first indication was his request to be released from all Church callings because of their time conflict with his work-related obligations. Even more alarming, through a series of behavioral problems with his ­children, priesthood leaders became acutely aware that basic family duties were being neglected. Communication with his wife and children had deteriorated, as they seldom saw him. When they did, he was usually preoccupied by professional demands or simply too tired for family activities or even meaningful conversation. Only through a tragic and agonizing series of events was this man brought to a realization of the consequences of his actions on his own spiritual health and that of his family.</p><br><p class="p1">The answer I found as a young bishop, and which has served me in the ensuing years, was simply that we must thoroughly understand the guiding doctrine and then do our best each day. We organize, prioritize, and live worthy of the spiritual guidance required when ­making difficult decisions. Often we seek counsel from those closest to us. From time to time we may be out of balance for a brief period as the immediate needs of one portion of our life take <i>temporary</i> precedence. When this occurs, we knowingly work through the issue and seek to stabilize ourselves as soon as possible, before the short-term need becomes a long-term trait.</p><br><p class="p1">If we are out of balance, we can change. Wecan delay and be compelled by the tragedy of a failing family or the sorrow of losing our own spirituality. Or we can be attentive and continually nudged by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. Seeking balance among the essential responsibilities of life is preparatory to salvation.</p><br><p class="p1">We must "see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength" (Mosiah 4:27). However, to encourage our constant effort, we are counseled, "It is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order" (Mosiah 4:27). It is my witness that it can be done, and the prize is "eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).</p><br><p class="p1">Most of you already understand the ­principles I teach today. That is shown by how you are living. For others, perhaps some adjustment might be considered. For all of us, continual focus is required because we live in aworld that can confuse us, and societal priorities of material wealth, pleasure, or prestige can overwhelm the simple but profound personal characteristics that each of us mustseek.</p><br><p class="p1">My dear young friends, we need you--the Lord needs you. And you are needed forever--faith-filled, converted, and covenant keeping. Bless you now, bless you in the critical next season of your life, and bless you forever! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Donald L.

<p class="p1">What a beautiful sight! It is a privilege to stand before an audience as full of promise and potential as this one. As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.</p><br><p class="p1">Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline "Remember when; remember why." We all have a BYU story. Recently Iasked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.</p><br><p class="p1">One of you said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Another graduate answered:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.</i></p><br><p class="p1">I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.</p><br><p class="p1">But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.</p><br><p class="p1">Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Another graduate shared the following:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>One of my professors asked our class to tour the Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor's degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.</p><br><p class="p1">The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Carrie O'Dell is a recent graduate of BYU. Like you, she worked hard and sacrificed to make the most of her BYU education. Because of a family hardship, she needed a little financial help. She got that help in the form of a replenishment grant that was funded by BYU alumni who live close to her home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She is now back in Tulsa, serving as a leader in a BYU Alumni chapter there. It is the same chapter that helped her when she was a student. Carrie is excited to be involved and is doing what she can to bless the students from Tulsa with the opportunity for a BYU education.</span></p><br><p class="p1">You will soon start to receive <i>BYU Magazine</i> in the mail. I hope you will read it. I hope you will join the BYU Alumni chapter where you live. Go to alumni.byu.edu to find your chapter, to learn about other inspiring alumni, and to share your own story.</p><br><p class="p1">Congratulations, graduates. Welcome to the family. Your fellow alumni are rooting for you. We love you and want all the best for you. As you go out into the world, remember <i>your</i> BYU story and stay connected for good.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Amy Fennegan, president of the BYU Alumni Association, gave this commencement address onAugust 17, 2017.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Doth Not Stink: Advocacy and Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Since I first learned how, I have loved to talk. Marilyn and Denise, my two older sisters, used to set the kitchen timer for five minutes, challenging me to go that long without saying a word. I never once made it the whole five minutes. Talking in the kitchen to your siblings, however, is very different from talking in this concert hall to a large and diverse audience. Accordingly, Iam both excited and humbled by this opportunity to speak to you. But I want this experience to be much more than just my talking to you. Iwant this experience to be one in which the Spirit teaches and edifies, and I appreciate the music andthe prayer that have helped set the tone for this to take place.</p><br><p class="p1">In addition to loving to talk--and in part because I love to talk--I love being a lawyer. As a junior in high school, I decided I wanted to be a lawyer for two reasons: First, I wanted to be different by going into a challenging profession in which not many women were employed--this was in the mid-seventies, when less than 20 percent of the attorneys in America were women.<sup>1</sup> Second, I wanted to be rich. I didn't have any clearly formed ideas of what I would do with the money I made, but in my small hometown of Brownfield, Texas, having a swimming pool in your backyard was a pretty big deal, and I think that was my primary aspiration at the time.</p><br><p class="p1">As I found out more about being a lawyer, Ilearned of two outstanding attorneys: RexE. Lee and DallinH. Oaks. They were faithful members of the Church, and they had achieved very visible levels of professional excellence. They became my ideals. My choice of a major as a freshman at BYU was simplified when I discovered that they had both been accounting majors, so accounting was my choice as well.</p><br><p class="p1">I was in heaven when I discovered that two of then BYU president Dallin Oaks's sons not only were in my BYU ward but were assigned to my family home evening group. I had visions of dazzling them and finding myself a member of President Oaks's inner circle. However, my Texas twang dashed these hopes. Upon learning I had an academic scholarship, one of my freshman friends informed me that I must be a lot smarter than I sounded. I accepted that I was not going to dazzle anyone, and I am still waiting for an entrée to Elder Oaks's inner circle. Nevertheless, I held on to my desire to emulate him by studying the law, and I absorbed the content, organization, and cadence of his talks.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I was likewise thrilled my freshman year to be invited to a lunch hosted by none other than RexE. Lee, who was then dean of the still new J. Reuben Clark Law School. It was a privilege to meet him, and I still remember his infectious smile and how he made me feel important. He encouraged me to study law and helped me begin to see the powerful advantages a legal education had to offer--advantages that went beyond proving myself in achallenging profession and getting rich.</span></p><br><p class="p1">One of these advantages became very compelling during my junior year of college. A well-known talk show host taped a show in Utah. He picked a controversial topic--one many people of faith would feel strongly about on moral grounds. When asked questions about why they objected to the position he took, however, many members of the audience were not able to clearly articulate their objections, even though very valid objections existed. As a result of hearing about these exchanges, I became even more committed to studying law so that I would be able to articulately and persuasively defend my positions on controversial topics.</p><br><p class="p1">Following my graduation from BYU--and despite having received an accounting job offer that could have satisfied my original two goals--Ibegan my studies at J.Reuben Clark Law School. For me, law school was a fun, exciting, and meaningful experience from start to finish. I learned to think in new ways, and I met people who remain beloved friends to this day. I also discovered and refined my true passion: advocacy. For me it was not enough to defend a position and to be thought reasonable; my highs came when I persuaded someone to think about an issue or another person in a way they had not before.</p><br><p class="p1">It is on being an advocate that I want to focus today. I want to encourage your advocacy in public settings, advocacy that is directed toward authority figures, legal systems, and institutions. But I also want to encourage your advocacy in less visible ways.</p><br><p class="p1">Let me show you a picture of my two older sisters, Marilyn and Denise (yes, the ones who would later set the kitchen timer), and me. [A picture of Gayla Sorenson as a baby was shown.] If you look closely at the picture, you will notice that my collar was pulled up a little. This is because I was still a little wobbly when it came to sitting up by myself, so my sisters were holding on to the back of my dress to keep me from falling. I have been the beneficiary of behind-the-scenes advocacy my entire life. It has been provided by family, friends, and professional associates in ways too numerous to mention. Today it is evidenced by the fact that my husband, my eighty-one-year-old mother, five of my six siblings (the missing sibling is with the U.S. State Department in Egypt and wishes he could be here), my brothers- and sisters-in-law, and several of my nieces and nephews have traveled approximately 15,000 combined miles to support me in person today. If you take nothing else away from my remarks, please think about those who advocate for your success in less visible ways and express your gratitude to them.</p><br><p class="p1">Now, in what I hope is true Elder Oaks ­fashion, I want to discuss three points about being an advocate: first, recognize that we are all called to be advocates; second, determine some key elements of what being an effective advocate means; and third, contemplate for whom and what we should advocate. I will then share some examples to illustrate these points.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Called to Be Advocates</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">We are advocates because Jesus Christ, our perfect Exemplar, is an advocate. In this dispensation He described Himself as an advocate on at least five occasions,<sup>2</sup> and prophets in other dispensations have also testified of this key role He plays.<sup>3</sup> He has given us the instruction "For that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do,"<sup>4</sup> so as we are striving to emulate our Savior--to do what He does--we should be advocates. He has placed people in your life whom you are called to love and whose circumstances you are called to support or change. Both will require your advocacy.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> While a law degree is not required to be an advocate--although it certainly does help develop that ability--I believe the major drop in the number of students enrolling in law school is evidence that our society places less value on advocacy than it has in the past. As I read articles, follow social media threads, and engage in conversations, I find that those who disparage seem to far outnumber those who advocate. We need to change this imbalance by playing the role of advocate more and the role of critic less. Remember, Christ is our example, so civility must be paramount. There is no room for mocking, labeling, bullying, or belittling.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Being an advocate takes more skill and work than being a critic does. I have spent decades observing other advocates and trying to refine my own abilities as an advocate. Based on this, Iwould like to share a few key aspects of effective advocacy that I have come to value and that may help you increase the effectiveness of your own advocacy. These principles apply both in and out of the courtroom, and while they are often used in adversarial situations, they also apply when no direct conflict exists.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>Appeal to Authority</i></b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Effective advocates present their case to the party who has authority to grant the relief sought. In lay terms, this means you should focus on persuading people who actually have the power to do what you ask. The Savior exemplifies this by being our Advocate with the Father; the Savior's pleading on our behalf is directed toward the ultimate Decision Maker. In the book <i>Making Your Case</i> by Antonin Scalia, a recently deceased justice on the United States Supreme Court, and BryanA. Garner, the authors observed:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> Nothing is accomplished by trying to persuade someone who lacks the authority to do what you're asking--whether it's a hotel clerk with no discretion to adjust your bill or a receptionist who cannot bind the company to the contract you propose. Persuasion directed to an inappropriate audience is ineffective.</i><sup>5</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Too often I see energy expended on actions that are at best preaching to the choir and at worst throwing gasoline on a fire. Facebook posts read by an audience with no more power to effect change than the writer does are not effective advocacy. While rallying others to your cause is sometimes an important part of advocacy, do not be distracted by thinking that this is your end goal. Whether working to help an individual do something she could not do for herself, promoting a cause, or changing an existing policy, effective advocates direct their energies toward those who have the authority to either finish the job or carry it to the next level.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>Be Knowledgeable</i></b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Effective advocates are knowledgeable. Passionate support can be part of the equation, but passion without knowledge carries little weight. As an in-house attorney for Motorola, I often participated in selecting what we referred to as "outside counsel" to represent the company in high-stakes matters. We were very focused on choosing attorneys who knew the law exceptionally well in the area of concern, whether that area be litigating intellectual property rights, complying with environmental regulations, or investigating an alleged antitrust violation. In this way we could be confident that they had credibility with the decision maker. In addition, they would have the power to plead our case in the best possible light, advise us about the areas in which our position was weak, and help us strengthen our position.</p><br><p class="p1">Outside the legal field, I likewise repeatedly see the value of in-depth knowledge. For example, our daughter Mandi graduated from college with an emphasis in special education--long before she knew she would be the mother of two children with special needs. She has drawn on her formal education and has supplemented that knowledge with informal learning in order to become a powerful advocate for her own children and for other children with special needs. I have marveled as I have watched her advocate on their behalf for services and opportunities, and I have watched our grandchildren's potential blossom as a result.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>Earn Trust</i></b></span></p><br><p class="p1">In persuading the person with power, substantive knowledge is important. However, I have often observed situations in which the point was not carried by the most intelligent attorney in the room but by the attorney who had gained the trust of those who needed to be persuaded. This characteristic was highlighted by Scalia and Garner, who noted that there is a "human proclivity to be more receptive to argument from a person who is both trusted and liked."<sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Moreover, while a general reputation as trustworthy is valuable, to be an effective advocate you must specifically earn the trust of those whom you are seeking to persuade. Trust must be earned, and it is not easily given. In too many cases I see individuals spend their energy insulting and criticizing from afar those who disagree with them rather than working to earn their trust. How can you earn someone's trust?</p><br><p class="p1">One way to earn the trust of those you are seeking to persuade is to get to know them. In a 2010 editorial in the <i>New York Times,</i> Senator Evan Bayh reflected on the changes that had occurred in Washington, DC, since the time his father had served as a senator from Indiana. He recounted:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> When I was a boy, members of Congress from both parties, along with their families, would routinely visit our home for dinner or the holidays. This type of social interaction hardly ever happens today, and we are the poorer for it. It is much harder to demonize someone when you know his family or have visited his home.</i><sup>7</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Or as the beloved but fictional attorney Atticus Finch put it, "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view-- . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."<sup>8</sup> Dialogue is enhanced and understanding is increased when underlying relationships are strengthened.</p><br><p class="p1">Another key way to earn trust is to be respectful. Rex Lee exemplified effective advocacy, and, as described by his son, he analogized effective advocacy to having "a conversation about an important topic with a friend--not just any friend, but one that is respected and looked up to."<sup>9</sup> Showing respect is of critical importance when dealing with those who have the ultimate authority to grant your request, but it can be of equal importance in dealing with those who have different points of view.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b><i>Acknowledge the Opposing View</i></b></span></p><br><p class="p1">A final key way to gain trust is to acknowledge the strengths of the opposing point of view. Good advocates do not try to defend the indefensible.<sup>10</sup> When the other side has valid arguments, Scalia and Garner advised:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Boldly proclaim your acceptance of them--thereby demonstrating your fairness, your generosity, and your confidence in the strength of your case, and burnishing your image as an eminently reasonable advocate.</i><sup>11</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Effective advocates can still ably represent their client's strengths while conceding that the other point of view is not entirely devoid of merit, and their credibility is significantly enhanced as a result.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>For Whom and What to Advocate</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">I hope that I have persuaded you to be an advocate and that you are realizing you have the ability to become a powerful advocate, especially if you come to law school! However, you may well be wondering for whom and for what you should advocate. As much as it pains me to admit, I cannot answer this question for you. However, I can share two guiding principles.</p><br><p class="p1">First, never forget that you are advocating for individual children of God. It is easy to become so caught up in the larger cause that we forget the individuals for whom we are advocating. Lani Guinier is a well-known civil rights attorney who became the first tenured professor at Harvard Law School who was a woman of color. In her memoirs she observed with regret that as the civil rights movement unfolded, she and her fellow advocates became so caught up in "developing legal doctrine and establishing legal precedent"<sup>12</sup> that they "distanced [themselves] from the very people on whose behalf [they had] brought the cases in the first place."<sup>13</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Constant reminders are necessary to avoid this pitfall. Elder Oaks has represented and led large institutions, and he keeps the picture <i>Forgotten Man, </i>by Maynard Dixon, in his office as a constant reminder of the importance of the individual.</p><br><p class="p1">The fundamental reminder, of course, is the example of our Savior. His advocacy is provided on an individual basis. For example, the Savior told the Prophet Joseph and a small group of elders, "Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am <i>your</i> advocate with the Father."<sup>14</sup> He told ParleyP. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Peter WhitmerJr., and Ziba Peterson that He was "<i>their</i><b> </b>advocate with the Father."<sup>15</sup> He is an advocate, not in some abstract, theoretical sense but on a very personal and individualized basis.</p><br><p class="p1">Second, be willing to accept the clients God sends your way, no matter how imperfect they may be. This I am sure about: they will come--inconveniently, surprisingly, and interruptingly, but they will come. As the Savior stated in His great Intercessory Prayer, "I pray . . . for them <i>which thou hast given me</i>."<sup>16</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Let me illustrate how this has worked in my life. At one point in my career I did volunteer work in the juvenile courts. I was serving as a court-appointed attorney, which means I represented anyone the court gave me to represent. Sometimes I found my clients easy to advocate for right from the start; other times, not so much. I had committed to accept those court appointments, however, and in every case I found it easier to advocate for my clients after I had truly gotten to know them and their stories.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In like manner, God has given me a family comprising unique individuals. He has given me visiting teachees and young women. And He has given me hundreds of applicants to BYU Law. Some of these clients have been easy to advocate for right from the start; others, not so much. However, there has never been a case in which I did not find it easier to advocate for these individuals after I had truly gotten to know them and their stories.</span></p><br><p class="p1">God does not give us perfect clients, but, thankfully, our Savior does not advocate for us because we are perfect but rather because He "knoweth the weakness of man."<sup>17</sup> As you seek to answer the specifics of "who?" for yourself, start with those people God places in your life.</p><br><p class="p1">God will also prepare you for what you should advocate for. As Eva M. Witesman recently pointed out in her devotional remarks:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>God knows you, and even though you may not yet know His plans, He knows the end from the beginning. He is preparing and qualifying you for the work He wants you to do.</i><sup>18</sup></p><br><p class="p1">You may end up advocating on behalf of disabled children or displaced families or individuals whose civil rights have been violated or elderly grandparents who need care. When God sends a client your way, He will have provided you with the opportunity to prepare to advocate for what your client truly needs. And when we are unsure what to advocate for, we can again take instruction from the example of Jesus Christ. As our Advocate, He pleads with the Father that we will be kept from evil, that we will develop unity, and that we will know we are loved.<sup>19</sup> We will never go wrong when we advocate for these results.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Examples of Advocacy</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">To illustrate these principles, I would like to share two examples of advocacy from the scriptures.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In the book of Numbers we find the account of the five daughters of Zelophehad.<sup>20</sup> Their father had died, and they had no brothers. Under the existing inheritance laws, they would not receive any of their father's land because they were women. But they did not sit around and complain to each other, nor did they simply whine about this injustice to their neighbors. Instead, they pled their case before Moses--someone in authority who had the power to grant their request. They were knowledgeable about the applicable laws, pointing out to Moses that their father had not violated any of the laws that would have required a forfeiture of the land and noting that the effect of the current law would result in their father's name being "done away from among his family."<sup>21</sup> Acknowledging the concerns of others about preserving tribal lands, they agreed to marry within their own tribe.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Moses was persuaded by their effective advocacy, and the result was a change in the inheritance laws, benefiting not only these women but future generations of Jewish women who might otherwise have seen their families' lands go to more distant relatives.</p><br><p class="p1">In the Book of Mormon the missionary Ammon became part of the household of King Lamoni and his unfortunately nameless wife, simply referred to as "the queen," who was the star advocate of this story.<sup>22</sup> Upon being taught the wonders of the Savior's Atonement by Ammon, Lamoni fell to the earth "as if he were dead."<sup>23</sup> He continued in this state for two days and two nights, and a great deal of lamenting took place.</p><br><p class="p1">After this length of time, certain members of King Lamoni's constituency decided it was time "to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre."<sup>24</sup> Fortunately, the queen recognized it was time to advocate for her husband. She realized Ammon had the power to help her husband, and she called for him. She showed Ammon respect by acknowledging that he was a prophet and could do mighty works in the name of God. She gained credibility by acknowledging the opposing point of view, but she also skillfully made the best of her client's position when she stated, "Others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me hedoth not stink."<sup>25</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Her advocacy was effective; Ammon responded to her request to examine Lamoni, and he promised that on the next day the king would rise again. The queen did not have a perfect client--to some people he literally stunk--but she was his advocate, and Lamoni was not buried alive.</p><br><p class="p1">In closing, I want to share a poignant example of advocacy from my own life. I did not get married until I was forty-six years old. I had reached the age when I thought that if I ever did get married, it would be a marriage of convenience--to someone I was comfortable with, nothing more, nothing less. Some close friends--Lois Jean Spencer, who is here today, and Marcie Lenio--introduced me to one of their other close friends who was a widower: Ferril Sorenson, a kind, faithful, wonderful man. They advocated for him with me and for me with him, and they were very effective advocates! We fell in love with each other--an all-encompassing love, nothing "convenient" about it.</p><br><p class="p1">We got married, and, as I continue to say, life became much better, but it did not become easier. I was working outside Philadelphia and Ferril was working outside San Francisco. Commuting coast to coast; merging two households; realizing I was no longer the only one whose opinion mattered with respect to setting the thermostat; figuring out my roles as wife, mother, and grandmother; and so forth was fun but demanding.</p><br><p class="p1">Ferril's youngest son, Travis, was still living at home, but he was planning to move out a couple of months after we got married, so I set my expectations accordingly. I was fond of Travis, but going from living alone to living with a husband was enough of an adjustment, and I didn't really have the desire or the energy to adjust to living with a twenty-one-year-old male at the same time.</p><br><p class="p1">Travis left in June as anticipated, and I wished him well while feeling a little more like the home in California was now <i>my</i> home. Then, in late August, Ferril let me know that because of some unfortunate circumstances, Travis was moving back in with us.</p><br><p class="p1">I was not happy about this at all, so I called my parents, expecting their complete sympathy. I explained the situation to them and how inconvenient it was going to be for me, how unfair this was when I was trying to adjust to married life, and how this would impinge on my precious time with Ferril. Clearly this was all about me.</p><br><p class="p1">The response I got from my parents was not sympathetic consolation. They became zealous advocates for Travis. They knew I had the power to make Travis's return positive or negative, so they advocated for the positive approach. They had gained my trust through years of interactions, so I was favorably inclined to hear what they had to say. They conceded there was some merit to my position (not much, but some)--acknowledging that this might not be the most convenient situation for me--but they focused on helping me see Travis in a different light. They pointed out how difficult this must be for him, how he probably wasn't any more excited about moving back in than I was, and how he was having to adjust to having a stepmother while still intensely missing his own mom. They helped me see how important it was that Travis feel loved.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Because of their advocacy, I genuinely ­welcomed Travis back into our home. I am sure I didn't always </span><span class="s3">show love to him perfectly, but I was much more </span><span class="s1">loving than I would have been without my parents' advocacy on his behalf. His living with us for the next year and a half became a great blessing in my life, and the love we share now is priceless to me.</span></p><br><p class="p1">God will guide us as we develop our advocacy skills, and He will provide us with opportunities to be advocates for His children. He will place some of us in situations to advocate to the highest legal authority in the land for changes that will benefit His children for generations. He will place others of us in situations where we can persuasively declare on behalf of one of our brothers or sisters, "To me he doth not stink." And I can virtually guarantee that He will enable each of us to advocate for one another within our families. Whatever the specific realm we may be advocating in, if we promote unity and invite others to love one another, we can be sure we are advocating in a way that is pleasing to Him.</p><br><p class="p1">I testify of these principles in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ, our Advocate with the Father, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Gayla M.

<h1>and Love: What Goes Around Comes Around - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">I would like to begin my remarks today by paying tribute to my parents. It wasn't until I began serving my mission that I realized some parents don't value their children, don't do everything within their power to make their lives better, and don't help their children aspire to be the best they can be. I was one of the fortunate ones, along with my brother and sister, to be born into a family where I was loved, nurtured, and taught by loving parents. They had high expectations for me, but when I failed, they were still there to guide, encourage, and show me how to pick myself up and move forward.</p><br><p class="p1">My parents, to the best of my knowledge, had never been very active in the Church. They encouraged us children to attend, but their attendance was infrequent. Yet it was from them that I learned how to live a Christian life. My father, in particular, was the kind of person who could never pass by someone who needed help.</p><br><p class="p1">I recall a trip that we made from Salt Lake City to Bear Lake, where a weekend of clear blue water, swimming, water skiing, and fun awaited me. Our typical route was to go to Evanston, Wyoming, and then on to Bear Lake. About twenty miles to the southwest of Evanston, my father noticed a man wastrying to flag down cars on the other side of the divided highway. My father could never pass by someone who needed help. He drove five miles up our side of the freeway until he found the first turnaround, drove back five miles, picked up the man who had run out of gas, went five miles in the wrong direction, turned around again, drove the twenty-five miles back to Evanston, helped the man get gas, and drove him back to his car.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Being an impatient teenager, I was more than irritated at the long delay. After we finally got on our way, I asked my dad why would he go so far out of his way to help someone. Surely someone else would have stopped and given that man assistance.</span></p><br><p class="p1">My dad simply responded, "What goes around comes around." After seeing the confused look on my face, he further explained, "I believe that someday maybe you or I will be on the side of the road looking for help, and someone will return thefavor."</p><br><p class="p1">Being ever the optimist, I replied, "I seriously doubt it."</p><br><p class="p1">So today I would like to title my talk "Living a Life of Service and Love: What Goes Around Comes Around."</p><br><p class="p1">We've heard this saying before in many different forms. The Boy Scout slogan: Do a good turn daily. Pay it back. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, which is the golden rule. You reap what you sow.</p><br><p class="p1">These are all well and good, but my dad lived by the mantra "What goes around comes around."<i> </i>He would help anyone anytime and anywhere.</p><br><p class="p1">But on the other hand, how many times have we heard or said that no good deed goes unpunished? In today's world we see evidence again and again, televised for the world to see, that the world is an ugly place where those who are innocent andwho try to do good come out on the short end of the stick.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Service Given, Service Received</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">I often hoped that my father's mantra was true, but I was never quite sure I believed it. Over the years I learned to admire the dedication that my father had to his mantra. But I must say that I never saw it "come around" until years later when we took a trip to Flaming Gorge Reservoir. I remember this trip clearly because it was Friday the thirteenth. Since I was the only child left in the house, I knew it would be a great getaway with my parents. We loved to fish at Flaming Gorge.</p><br><p class="p1">This happened while I was in high school--which, according to my kids, was shortly after the earth cooled and most likely during the Jurassic period.</p><br><p class="p1">We owned a small cabin cruiser that was about fourteen to fifteen feet in length. It was big enough to sleep three if someone was willing to sleep on the floor--and that was always me. We put our boat in at Sheep Creek Marina. Our goal was to go as far north as possible, spend the weekend in our little boat, and fish until we had our limit.</p><br><p class="p1">As I remember, we joked that it was Friday the thirteenth. What followed later that weekend etched that date forever in my mind.</p><br><p class="p1">On Friday, heading toward the Wyoming side of the reservoir, we traveled some distance before we began to fish. Frankly, the fishing wasn't very good, but we loved being out on the boat together in such a beautiful place.</p><br><p class="p1">I remember my father saying, "Look, there's a man on the far shore who's waving at us."</p><br><p class="p1">I looked up but could barely see anyone. Still, Iknew that it was time to pull in the lines. We fired up the motor and went toward the other side of the reservoir, where the man was still waving at us. It seemed odd to me that this man was standing on a barren hillside with no other boat in sight, but when he saw that we were coming, he motioned for us to go around a bend into a small hidden cove. When we came around the hill I was shocked to see a beautiful big yacht pulled onto the shore. It was easily twice the length and width of our little boat.</p><br><p class="p1">The man thanked us profusely for coming to his assistance. His battery was dead, and he wondered if we could help him. We did, and soon his big motor roared back to life. The man and his family were very grateful. We lost an hour of fishing, but we were soon back out on the reservoir.</p><br><p class="p1">The next day the fishing didn't improve. As a matter of fact, it was terrible, so we decided to call it quits and go back to the marina. We were about two miles from the marina where we had launched our boat when we found ourselves fighting a blustering headwind that slowed our progress. The waves were kicking up, and suddenly our engine decided to quit. We tried in vain to get it running, but it simply wouldn't start. My dad was a do-it-yourself kind of guy, and he had built our cabin cruiser from a basic hull. He could always keep our cars and our boat motors running, but not this time.</p><br><p class="p1">In the midst of trying to pull-start our outboard motor, much to our surprise, the fellow in the big yacht pulled up and asked if he could be of assistance. I had never been so pleased to see someone! Flaming Gorge is a very big reservoir, and we had been out there for two days. I was amazed that of all the people on the reservoir, he would be the person to show up to give us aid. He offered to tow us back to the marina, even though we were still quite a distance out. We happily accepted his kind offer.</p><br><p class="p1">All was going well, and we went at a nice and even slow click for some time, being pulled behind this monstrosity of a boat. We could actually see the marina in the distance when suddenly the motor on the yacht died. We checked the gas lines, the fuel filter--everything. But the motor wouldn't start. It was Friday-the-thirteenth-weekend kind of luck. We tried his little trolling motor, but it wouldn't start.</p><br><p class="p1">In the meantime, the wind had kicked up into a gale-force wind and was blowing us farther and farther away from the marina. I could barely see the marina in the distance as my dad and Mr. Yacht Guy worked on the engines. Three motors, and not a single one of them would start. What luck!</p><br><p class="p1">Out of the blue a little old man and his wife puttered up to us in a little twelve-foot, open-bow, aluminum fishing boat. I remember being shocked to see his wife sitting there all done up pretty withpancake makeup plastered on her windblown face.</p><br><p class="p1">I thought, "What in the world are these two doing out here in this tiny boat amid all of these winds and waves?"</p><br><p class="p1">The old gentleman offered to tow us in. Quite frankly, I looked at him in disbelief. He hooked a line to the big yacht, and with his little twenty-five horsepower outboard motor, he puttered away like a tugboat with a battleship. Soon he and the big yacht faded out of sight as they went toward the marina.</p><br><p class="p1">Meanwhile, we were being blown ever farther away from our destination. We were still in a pickle. But forty-five minutes later the little old man and his wife came back out to us, tossed us a line, and proceeded to tow us back to the dock. Iwas amazed that these folks were so willing to go so far out of their way to help us. Their kindness and willingness to give so much time and effort to assist total strangers was a gift that I will never forget.</p><br><p class="p1">By now we were fast friends--made so by the events of the day and the weekend. We helped the rich fellow get his yacht loaded onto his trailer, and next we helped load the little aluminum boat. As fate would have it, the old gentleman had left the lights on in his car, so his car battery was dead. My dad pulled out his jumper cables and got the car running. We all helped to get the little boat and ours safely secured onto our trailers.</p><br><p class="p1">We laughed all the way home about the adventures of that weekend. What goes around really does comes around. I finally had a chance to witness my father's mantra in action. I may be a little slow, but this was a lesson of a lifetime that Icouldn't ignore.</p><br><p class="p1">Thanks, Dad, for being such a great example tome.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What Is Service?</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">In 2013, President DieterF. Uchtdorf wrote:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>A favorite saying of mine often attributed to St. Francis of Assisi reads, "Preach the gospel at all times and if necessary, use words." Implicit in this saying is the understanding that often the most powerful sermons are unspoken.</i><sup>1</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I am grateful for the unspoken lessons that my parents taught me. When I would come up short in my obedience or actions, I would often attempt to justify my poor behavior by employing an overabundance of characteristically charming charisma.</p><br><p class="p1">My father would simply shake his head and reply, "Son, your actions are speaking so loud I can't hear a word you're saying."</p><br><p class="p1">To him, actions were more important than words. His living example of how to lead a Christian life taught me the following important principles regarding service:</p><br><br><ul><br> 	<li class="p1">Service should be given with a smile and with no expectation of a return.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Too often we pass by opportunities to serve because we can't see them.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Service is seldom convenient.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Service most often happens when we are on the way to do something else.</li><br> 	<li class="p1">Service will eventually come back around.</li><br></ul><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>A Lesson About Interruptions</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">I think these principles are self-evident, but let me elaborate on just one of them: service is what we do when we are on our way to do something else.</p><br><p class="p1">We can plan to give service--and I think that is excellent--but I believe the Savior taught and exemplified a better way. Christ most often blessed others when He was on His way to do something else.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One example is the parable of the good Samaritan. Wasn't the good Samaritan on his own journey, which he had to interrupt in order to provide assistance? The Levite and the priest both chose not to "see" the wounded man, passed to the other side, and stayed on their intended business.<sup>2</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1">Another example, found in Mark 10, happened when Jesus was teaching the people regarding marriage. He was interrupted by those who "brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them."<sup>3</sup> His disciples wanted Christ to get back to the real business that was at hand. However, we read:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</i><sup>4</sup></p><br><p class="p1">This became a powerful teaching moment in Christ's ministry.</p><br><p class="p1">In Matthew 9 we read about what appears to be a single remarkable day in Christ's ministry.<sup>5</sup> Christ was teaching His disciples when He was again interrupted.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.</i><sup>6</sup></p><br><p class="p1">On his way to see the ruler's daughter, Christ was touched by the woman who had an infirmity. He stopped and asked who had touched Him. Hethen blessed and healed her.</p><br><p class="p1">Christ then proceeded to travel on to the ruler's house, where He announced that the daughter was not dead but was sleeping. The people laughed him to scorn, yet He proceeded to raise the ruler's daughter from the dead.</p><br><p class="p1">Then verse 27 says, "And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us."</p><br><p class="p1">And then in verse 28 we read, "And when he was come into the house, the blind men" continued to implore him. Christ then healed them because of their great faith.</p><br><p class="p1">Next, "as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil."<sup>7</sup> The man was healed; the dumb spake.</p><br><p class="p1">Christ was interrupted again and again while He was about His own intended tasks, yet He was willing to see those who were invisible to others. He interrupted His plans and blessed those who needed His loving touch.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>The Law of Restoration</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Do a good turn daily. Pay it back. You reap what you sow. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. What goes around comes around.</p><br><p class="p1">These same concepts were taught by Alma to his son Corianton when Alma was trying to explain the meaning of the word <i>restoration.</i> Apparently Corianton believed that he could do evil today and that later good could be restored tohim. Alma taught:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; </i><span class="s2"><b><i>yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</i></b></span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><i> </i><b><i>For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored;</i></b></span><i> therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.</i><sup>8</sup></p><br><p class="p1">My father taught me, as Alma taught his son, that the kind of life you live will be restored to you. If you are merciful to your fellowman, mercy will come back to you. If you judge righteously, righteous judgment will return to you. If you do good continually, good shall return to you. If you are just, justice will be restored to you again.</p><br><p class="p1">In other words, if you want a friend, be a friend. If you want mercy, show mercy. If you want forgiveness, forgive others. If you want kindness, be kind. If you want respect, respect others.</p><br><p class="p1">We are all flawed beings. We have our ample share of problems, insecurities, weaknesses, and failures. But I have learned that one way to overcome them is to share whatever modest strengths and attributes we do possess with others. I testify that they will come back to you. And each time you repeat the process, your confidence and strength in that virtue or attribute will grow and become stronger.<sup>9</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Will there be bumps? Absolutely. Will the restoration of good for good be immediate? Most likely not. But somehow, somewhere, sometime these things will come back around to you in greater abundance than the amount that you gave. King Benjamin assured his people that if they would obey God's commandments, God would immediately bless them.<sup>10</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Don't despair when life is not fair or when it seems that no good deed goes unpunished.<i> </i>There is hope and a promise that a good life is its own reward. I personally find great hope in the ­following remarkable latter-day scripture--D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i></p><br><p class="p1">Do a good turn daily. Pay it back. You reap what you sow. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. "For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored."<sup>11</sup> What goes around comes around.</p><br><p class="p1">How does this apply to our lives here at BYU and to our lives in general?</p><br><p class="p1">We may not have the opportunity to jump-start someone's boat in a hidden cove in a vast reservoir, but we can share a smile and a hello with someone on campus whom we don't know--one of those students whom we pass by each day who has a downcast countenance, one of the many who are weighed down with the worries of their day. Asmile can turn a frown upside down.</p><br><p class="p1">We may not have the opportunity to go out of our way to refill someone's gas tank, but aren't most of us running only on fumes by the end of the day? I know that I feel this way all too often.</p><br><p class="p1">We can express confidence and trust in our fellow students when they struggle in class or stumble over something that might have been obvious to others. We can encourage each other as we attempt to do the many hard things that are part and parcel of college life.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>A Bucket Filler</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Many years ago my sweet wife presented an object lesson in a family home evening that had a lasting impact. With two buckets--one empty and one filled with water--she gave each of us an empty cup. She demonstrated how easy it was to deplete the full bucket of water by saying unkind things. She then gave each of us a chance to fill each other's cups by saying something kind. We took turns saying something nice, and with each act of kindness my wife added water to the cups of both the giver and the receiver of the compliment. This activity was a great visual representation of how easy it is to empty someone's bucket or, alternatively, how we can fill someone else's bucket by simple acts of kindness. And I must note that through the process of filling someone else's bucket, we fill our own.</p><br><p class="p1">President Gordon B. Hinckley said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I have discovered that life is not a series of great heroic acts. Life at its best is a matter of consistent goodness and decency, doing without fanfare that </i><span class="s1"><i>which needed to be done when it needed to be done. I </i></span><i>have observed that it is not the geniuses that make the </i><span class="s1"><i>difference in this world. I have observed that the work of the world is done largely by men and women of ordinary </i></span><i>talent who have worked in an extraordinary manner.</i><sup>12</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><i> </i>John C. Maxwell, who is recognized as a leading inspirational leadership coach, put it this way: "Doing the right thing daily compounds over time."<sup>13</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><i> </i>Our family has always loved the classic Christmas movie <i>It's a Wonderful Life,</i> starring Jimmy Stewart. Stewart played the role of George Bailey, who had aspirations to get out of his hometown, Bedford Falls, and see the world. He had big plans and big dreams. However, George spent his entire life giving up his big dreams for the good ofhis town. Of course you all know the movie, and if you don't, now is a good time to rectify your deficiency.</p><br><p class="p1">I can't think of a movie that better exemplifies the long-term effects of a good life, nor can I think of one that better epitomizes how the good you do will eventually come back to you. Think of the closing scene as the town rescued George and how he came to realize that he had a truly wonderful life.</p><br><p class="p1">The kingdom of God is built by small and simple things. In Alma 37:6 we read:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</i></p><br><p class="p1">In short, we don't have to do something gigantic or impressive to build the kingdom of God. We don't have to convert thousands, cut a hole in the rock and descend a thousand feet in a covered wagon, heal the toxic algae bloom in Utah Lake, or create a company that will make millions. We just need to work at being a little better each day by reaching beyond ourselves to serve in even the smallest ways: giving a word of encouragement, holding a door open, doing any act of random kindness, giving a reassuring smile to a friend who's having a bad day, or sharing the music of the songbird, the flutter of the leaves in the trees, the sound of birds in flight, the music of laughter, and perhaps the nearly silent sob of one who is suffering.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Learning to See Those Who Are Invisible</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">My father could see people who were in need whom others couldn't see. How is it possible that so many could pass by the man who was stuck on the side of the road, yet my father, who was going seventy miles an hour while driving down the other side of a divided highway, saw him like he was lit up with a neon sign? How did he see the invisible man who was waving for help on the far side of the gorge when all I could see was the water and my own fishing line?</p><br><p class="p1">Let me speak of those who are visible and invisible.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Have you ever felt invisible? I know that I have. Sometimes in a crowd, with very little effort, we can remain invisible to those who seem to be the life of the party. Even here at BYU, with more than 30,000 students, I am certain that all of us have, at times, felt invisible. I believe it is easy to feel like no one sees you--the real you; the vulnerable, insecure, and anxious you; the you who needs someone to believe in you; the person who is stranded on the side of the road while everyone else rushes by.</span></p><br><p class="p1">I sometimes worry that the habit of engaging with our cell phones too often has the effect of making everyone around us invisible. I myself am guilty. Though we are attempting to stay connected and visible to our friends, we inadvertently shut the world out. We won't recognize another's need if we can't see them. We won't be able to give service on our way to do something else if our eyes are fixed on a screen instead of on the humanity that surrounds us.</p><br><p class="p1">Ferris Bueller said it best: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."<sup>14</sup></p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>A Lifetime of Service</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">I love the hymn "Because I Have Been Given Much" because it teaches these same principles so powerfully.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Because I have been given much, I too must give;<br></i><i>Because of thy great bounty, Lord, each day I live<br></i><i>I shall divide my gifts from thee<br></i><i>With ev'ry brother that I see<br></i><i>Who has the need of help from me.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Because I have been sheltered, fed by thy good care,<br></i><i>I cannot see another's lack and I not share<br></i><i>My glowing fire, my loaf of bread,<br></i><i>My roof's safe shelter overhead,<br></i><i>That he too may be comforted.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Because I have been blessed by thy great love, dear Lord,<br></i></span><i>I'll share thy love again, according to thy word.<br></i><i>I shall give love to those in need;<br></i><i>I'll show that love by word and deed:<br></i><i>Thus shall my thanks be thanks indeed.</i><sup>15</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I have heard it said that a grateful child is one of life's greatest blessings, but I would have to add that one of my greatest joys as a parent has come when I have witnessed our children being kind and generous to someone they didn't know. That is probably because this represents and reflects the kind of love that Christ has for each of us.</p><br><p class="p1">Love--God's love. How do we bring people to Christ? We do so by sharing His love with our brothers and sisters. Today I hope I have been able to convey some of the small and simple ways that we can show and reflect God's love.</p><br><p class="p1">First, we must see--see those who are invisible and see those who need to be encouraged, lifted, and healed.</p><br><p class="p1">Second, we must be willing to interrupt our business, even for only a moment, while we are onour way to do something else.</p><br><p class="p1">Third, we must act through love. The more we love, the greater our capacity to love becomes. The more love we share, the more love we will have togive.</p><br><p class="p1">I testify to you that the more love we give, the more love will come back to us.</p><br><p class="p1">Do a good turn daily. Pay it back. You reap what you sow. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. "For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored."<sup>16</sup> Be a bucket filler. What goes around comes around.</p><br><p class="p1">I wish to express my deep and abiding love, affection, and gratitude for my wonderful parents and for their devotion and love that remain a constant in my life even though they have both passed on.<sup>17</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I leave you with my testimony that the greatest work we have in today's world is to see the unseen, to lift arms that have fallen, and to share God's love by loving our fellowmen. I believe that in doing so, we have the chance to heal ourselves and to bring all of us closer to the perfect love of God. Of the power, of the depth, and of the beauty of His divine love I stand as a humble witness. Inthe name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Kirt R.

<h1> of the Lord - Paul Caldarella - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="p1">Good morning, brothers and sisters. I first want to thank the Brigham Young University administration for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today. It is always a pleasure to meet with the Saints. I also commend you for attending and watching these devotionals. When I first began my employment at BYU, a colleague of mine told me that if I attended devotionals, my work at the university would be blessed. I have certainly found that to be true. It is an honor to speak to you today, and I pray that the Holy Spirit will attend to help edify and uplift all of us.</p><br><p class="p1">Since beginning employment at BYU, one of my greatest fears has been giving a devotional talk. However, when I prayed about the invitation to speak to you, I not only received confirmation to give this talk, but I also received the topic to cover.</p><br><p class="p1">I thought I would start by telling you a little bit more about myself. I am originally from Rhode Island. I joined the Church as a graduate student in Logan, Utah, and I was fortunate enough to meet my wife, Andrea, while in graduate school. We have two boys: AJ, age twelve, and Andrew, age seven. My family is the love of my life, and I am extremely grateful that the Lord has blessed me with them.</p><br><p class="p1">I also want to wish you all a happy Pioneer Day. I had not heard of this holiday before ­moving to Utah, but it is a day for which I am grateful. It is so important to remember our ancestors and the sacrifices they made for us. I am from a family of immigrants, so I can relate to the story of the pioneers, who traveled great distances and bore up under hardships seeking a better life.</p><br><p class="p1">My grandfather Emilio Caldarella immigrated to the United States on the <i>Gerty,</i> a steamship from Pachino, Sicily, on June 28, 1906, at the age of eleven with his fourteen-year-old sister, Maria, and his forty-nine-year-old mother, Concetta. They had just twenty dollars between the three of them when they arrived. The voyage by steamship across the Atlantic took nearly three weeks. They first settled in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and eventually moved to Providence, Rhode Island.</p><br><p class="p1">As I was preparing this talk, I began to wonder what had led people like my grandfather and the early pioneers to leave their homes and loved ones and travel long distances at great personal expense and sacrifice. As I pondered this question, I began to realize that they had heeded the call of the Lord. How else could they have made those long treks and withstood the hardships that often accompanied those experiences? When we are called of the Lord, we can withstand such challenges.</p><br><p class="p1">I am a pioneer of sorts in that I am the first and only member of my family so far to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In my devotional talk today, I am going to use scriptures, hymns, art, quotes from Church leaders, and some of my own personal experiences.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Being Called of God</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">The title of my talk today is "The Call of the Lord." The Lord calls us in different ways to do different things at different times in our lives--but always with the same purpose: to serve Him. In serving Him we are blessed, and so are those around us. Examples of ways I have felt the call of the Lord include feeling called to repent, to enter a profession, to move to a new place, to be baptized, to obtain the priesthood, to marry, and to serve in the Church. I also feel called to future full-time missionary service. Perhaps you can recall ways you have felt called by the Lord or how He may becalling to you now.</p><br><p class="p1">According to the Guide to the Scriptures, "To be called of God is to receive an appointment or invitation from Him or His duly authorized Church leaders to serve Him in a particular way" (s.v. "call, called of God, calling," scriptures.lds<br>.org). So the Lord can directly call to us or we can be called by our Church leaders to serve Him.</p><br><p class="p1">Examples of the Lord calling individuals to follow Him are found throughout the scriptures. The first mention of someone being called of the Lord is found in Genesis 3:9–10:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and Iwas afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</i></p><br><p class="p1">It is interesting that this occurred just after Adam had partaken of the forbidden fruit and was afraid.</p><br><p class="p1">I believe this passage shows Heavenly Father's love for us. He calls to us at various times in our lives, both when we are living worthily and when we sin, make mistakes, or are fearful. As we learn in Romans 11:29, "For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance." Indeed, His calls to us at such times may be particularly important, as they often prompt us to get back on the path that leads to true happiness, joy, and peace.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I can relate to this. When I was in my twenties, I was not a member of the Church but was an inactive member of another faith. I was going to college and associating with some friends who were not living gospel standards but who were instead focused on carousing and having a "good time." This lifestyle, while bringing some temporary pleasure, did not leave me with a feeling of lasting happiness, joy, or peace. I tried explaining to these friends my desire to serve and help others in meaningful ways, but they did not want to abandon their pleasure-seeking lifestyle. Over time I began to feel that I should not continue my association with them because they were not going in a direction I wanted to go. It took great effort to separate myself from these friends, but with the help of some trusted others who supported the change I was trying to make, I was able to do so.</span></p><br><p class="p1">I believe that this experience illustrates how the Lord was prompting me to change my life and to better serve Him by serving others and how I came to experience more lasting happiness, joy, and peace. Perhaps you can relate to times in your life when the Lord similarly called you to make such a change, or perhaps you are feeling the call of the Lord to do so now.</p><br><p class="p1">After graduating from college and breaking away from these friends, I moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to work and live. I also began taking part-time graduate classes to determine what I wanted to study in graduate school and which school I might want to attend. As part of this process, I met with one of my professors to discuss graduate school options, and he suggested that I consider schools in Utah. I was not sure why my professor suggested Utah, but I did look at schools there and eventually decided to attend Utah State University. I can still remember landing at the Salt Lake City airport and driving to Logan for graduate school interviews. It felt good to be in Utah. After meeting with faculty and students there, I knew I wanted to move to Utah to attend graduate school. I did not realize it at the time, but I was again feeling the call of the Lord, this time to move to Utah and to begin my new life as a graduate student.</p><br><p class="p1">The call of the Lord is also illustrated in Mary's miraculous birth of the Savior. In Luke 1:28–38 we read:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when </i>[Mary]<i> saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</i></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</i></span></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> For with God nothing shall be impossible.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</i></p><br><p class="p1">The angel also visited Joseph in a dream, saying:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.</i> [Matthew 1:20–22]</p><br><p class="p1">Joseph similarly accepted his call of the Lord.</p><br><p class="p1">I have always been impressed with this story and with the faith Mary and Joseph showed. They had received singular callings from the Lord, delivered by heavenly messengers, and while they both had some fears and doubts, they nevertheless responded, "Be it unto me according to thy word." This is a good example for all of us for when we are called of the Lord. We may have some fears and doubts, but if we have faith and heed the call, all will work out.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Fulfilling His Divine Calling</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">From the Guide to the Scriptures we learn:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Jesus Christ is the Firstborn of the Father in the spirit (Heb. 1:6; D&amp;amp;C 93:21). He is the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh (John 1:14; 3:16). He is Jehovah (D&amp;amp;C 110:3–4) and was foreordained to His great calling before the creation of the world.</i> [s.v. "Jesus Christ," scriptures.lds.org]</p><br><p class="p1">An example of Jesus knowing of His pre­ordained calling is found in Luke 2:40–49:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And the child grew, andwaxedstrong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and thegraceof God was upon him.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at thefeast of the passover.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when he was twelve yearsold, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew notof it.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him amongtheirkinsfolk and acquaintance.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in thetemple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, bothhearing them, andaskingthem questions.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And all that heard him were astonished at hisunderstanding and answers.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</i></p><br><p class="p1">Later Jesus also had to go through trials and temptations to fulfill His divine calling as He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. We learn in Alma 7:11–12 that Jesus had to experience all of the challenges that beset us here on earth in order to be able to serve us:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i></p><br><p class="p1">This is important to know and remember as the Lord calls us to serve Him. He knows our weaknesses and infirmities and will help us in our callings. This brings to mind one of my favorite hymns, "Be Thou Humble," from which I quote:</p><br><p class="p4"><i>Be thou humble in thy weakness, and the Lord thy God shall lead thee,</i></p><br><p class="p4"><i>Shall lead thee by the hand and give thee answer to thy prayers. ...</i></p><br><p class="p4"><i>Be thou humble in thy calling, and the Lord thy God shall teach thee</i></p><br><p class="p4"><i>To serve his children gladly with a pure and gentle love. </i></p><br><p class="p4">[<i>Hymns, </i>2002, no. 130]</p><br><p class="p1">So humility is needed to help us respond to the feelings of weakness we often experience when we receive and heed the call of the Lord. The Lord is there to help us as we strive to follow Him. President ThomasS. Monson has stated, "Remember that whom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/05/duty-calls?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Duty Calls</span></a>," <i>Ensign</i>, May 1996).</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Responding to the Call of the Lord</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">I have often felt feelings of fear or weakness as I have been called of the Lord. One example is when I was out of town at a professional conference and received a phone call from a Church leader asking if I would be willing to serve as the ward clerk. I remember thinking, "Can I really do this?" I had not grown up in the Church and had very little knowledge of how the clerk's office operated, though the clerk seemed to do many important things. However, when I got down on my knees and prayed to know how I should respond, I felt a confirming witness that I was to accept this Church calling and that I would be able to perform the duties associated with it--and that is exactly what happened. The Lord did qualify me, and He did send others to help me.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We also learn from the scriptures how Jesus called His early disciples and how they responded:</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. </i>[Matthew 4:18–20]</p><br><p class="p1">I have always found this to be a remarkable event. Here were these seemingly ordinary men at work, fishing for a living, yet Jesus knew their true potential and called them to fill the measure of their creation. They recognized that the Savior was offering them a better life, and they immediately accepted His invitation to follow Him. In the same way the Lord knows us and calls us to fill the measure of our creation that we might have joy by following Him. I have experienced this in my own life.</p><br><p class="p1">After arriving in Logan to attend graduate school, I began to notice that most of my neighbors were young, married Mormon couples who seemed happy and content. Their example impressed me, and I began to think that perhaps I wanted that in my own life. I also found myself gravitating toward faculty members whom I later learned were members of the Church. I began to realize that I wanted to learn more about the culture of these Latter-day Saints, though I was not consciously looking to join a new religion.</p><br><p class="p1">I had a particularly friendly neighbor who was a returned missionary. I can still remember the look on his face when I asked him if he had a copy of the Book of Mormon that I could borrow.</p><br><p class="p1">His eyes got very wide, and he seemed very pleased and excited. He returned to my apartment within minutes with a copy of the book.</p><br><p class="p1">I was surprised that he had been able to provide me with a copy so quickly! I said I would return the book to him when I had finished reading it, but he said that I could keep it. I thanked him and accepted, asking if I could pay him for it.</p><br><p class="p1">He said, "Oh, no," and reiterated that it was mine to keep.</p><br><p class="p1">Upon reading the Book of Mormon, I did not have an immediate experience of the truthfulness of the book; instead this developed "line upon line, precept upon precept" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12), as we are taught in the scriptures.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> My first experience of beginning to feel a call from the Lord regarding potentially joining the Church came during the first sacrament meeting I attended several weeks later. My neighbor invited me to attend services with him and his wife. What impressed me the most during that meeting was the way the Church members sang the hymns--they seemed to really believe what they were ­singing--and I felt the Spirit quite strongly. Ihave had a love of Church hymns ever since.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Eventually I began attending Church services more regularly and started taking the missionary discussions. I was later baptized after putting Moroni's promise to the test:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and ifye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, ­having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.</i> [Moroni 10:4–5]</p><br><p class="p1">I can still remember driving to the outskirts of Logan on a moonlit spring night, getting on my knees, asking God if the Book of Mormon was true, feeling the warmth of His love, and getting a clear answer that it was true. We can use this same process when we feel called of the Lord.</p><br><p class="p1">It was not an easy thing to be baptized. My loving parents were very much against my converting to a different religion. This was difficult for me, and I also had some behaviors and habits that I needed to change. However, with the help of the Lord and the people He provided to help me, I was able to be baptized and to feel the cleansing power of that ordinance.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Bearing Difficult Burdens</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">Often the Lord calls us to do difficult things that we may not be sure we want to do but that will bring great blessings. This is illustrated in the early life of President David O. McKay.</p><br><p class="p1"><i> When </i>[he] <i>was eight years of age, his father </i>[also named David]<i> received a call to go on a mission. To accept such a call for two or three years away from home was no easy decision to make. Another baby was on its way, and plans had been made to enlarge the house and furnishings. The responsibilities of running the farm were too great to be left to his wife, so when David showed the letter calling him to a mission, he said: "Of course it is impossible for me to go." Jennette read the letter, looked at her husband, and said decisively: "Of course you must accept; you need not worry about me. David</i><i>O. and I will manage things nicely!"...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> ... In the absence of his father, the boy David quickly redirected his energies to chores and farm work. Circumstances thus helped to produce a maturity beyond his physical years.</i> [Llewelyn R. McKay, <i>Home Memories of President David O. McKay</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1956), 5–6]</p><br><p class="p1">The life of the Savior is the ultimate example of doing hard things while responding to the call of the Lord. When Christ was in the Garden of Gethsemane, He said, "Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). We can learn from His example and similarly call to the Lord for help as we strive to follow Him. He will provide help to us--often in the form of another person. As stated by President Monson, "When we are on the Lord's errand, we are entitled to the Lord's help" ("Duty Calls").</p><br><p class="p1">One great source of help the Lord has provided me is my wife and helpmate, Andrea. She is a special daughter of Heavenly Father, whom I am lucky to have as my eternal companion. I met Andrea in Logan at a church dance that I was not planning to attend. However, a returned-­missionary roommate of mine persisted in asking me to go, so I relented and there met my future wife.</p><br><p class="p1">I can still remember the special feeling I had when we first embraced. It was the same warm, tender feeling I felt when I prayed asking if the Book of Mormon was true; the Spirit testified to me that Andrea was the woman I was to marry. She has brought blessings into my life for which I am eternally grateful. I share this in the hope that it may be of help to those of you searching for <i>your </i>eternal companion. I know how difficult that search can be. If you heed the call of the Lord, He will lead you through the difficult burdens you will encounter and on to the path leading to ­happiness, joy, and peace.</p><br><p class="p1">The most difficult burden I have yet been asked to bear was when my father was diagnosed with leukemia in April 2011. Upon hearing of his diagnosis, I felt the confirmation from the Spirit that his time on earth was coming to an end. He had been sick for some time, but we did not yet know the extent of his illness. He and most of my family remained hopeful that he would not die of this disease.</p><br><p class="p1">In the weeks that passed, as he became weaker and stopped eating, I felt prompted that it was time for me to travel back to Rhode Island to be with him. When I arrived, he was quite thin and frail and very anxious about dying. I tried to console him the best I could, but his anxiety regarding his impending death was strong.</p><br><p class="p1">I then felt prompted to ask my father if he would like me to give him a priesthood blessing, and--somewhat to my surprise--he agreed.</p><br><p class="p1">I contacted the local bishop and asked if he could arrange for someone to help me perform this ordinance. He agreed to do this himself despite his busy schedule.</p><br><p class="p1">In the blessing I was prompted to tell my father that he would soon be passing through the veil and that he would be reunited with family members who had already made that journey and who were joyfully waiting to receive him and be reunited with him. This blessing calmed my father greatly, and his anxiety decreased remarkably as he accepted the fact that the Lord was calling him home. He passed peacefully through the veil later that evening.</p><br><p class="p1">I was so grateful that this local bishop came to the hospital to help me give my father that priesthood blessing. I did not know him at all prior to this, but he responded to my call for help by performing this sacred priesthood ordinance.</p><br><p class="p1">As stated by President HenryB. Eyring:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>When we accepted the priesthood, we took upon us the responsibility to do our part in watching over the Church. None of us can escape accountability. ...</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> ... A shepherd watches over sheep. ... They need protection and nourishment. The Savior warns us that we must watch the sheep as He does. He gave His life for them. They are His. We cannot approach His standard if, like a hired servant, we watch only when it is convenient and only for a reward.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/05/watch-with-me?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Watch with Me</span></a>," <i>Ensign</i>, May 2001]</p><br><p class="p1">This bishop demonstrated to me that he knew the responsibility and calling he carried and that he was willing to serve with me as my father prepared to pass through the veil.</p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Disregarding Our Calls</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">But what about the times when we choose to disregard the call of the Lord? There are many examples of this in the scriptures as well. I will share just one account.</p><br><p class="p1">We can probably all relate to the story of Jonah, the prophet who denied the call of the Lord. We read:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. </i>[Jonah 1:1–3]</p><br><p class="p1">Jonah got on the ship, but a mighty tempest was stirred up by the Lord, forcing the sailors to cast Jonah into the sea, "for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord" (Jonah 1:10).</p><br><p class="p1">However, the Lord "prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah," and he "was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights" (Jonah 1:17).</p><br><p class="p1">Jonah said:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><i> Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</i> [Jonah 2:2–4]</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Jonah was then released from the fish, and the Lord again called him to go to Ninevah to preach and warn the people. This time Jonah agreed, and the people of the city--even the king--believed the word of God they heard from him. They prayed, fasted, and repented, and the Lord spared them.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> What a story! I used to think that the Lord hadtreated Jonah harshly, but now I see that He was trying to help Jonah fulfill his divine calling to preach to the people of Nineveh and save them--and himself. The message here seems to be that while we can choose to run from the call of the Lord, He will continue to try to help us turn to Him and serve those whom we are called to serve. As we do so, we can be blessed ourselves. I am grateful for this, as I am not always perfect in recognizing and heeding the Lord'scall.</span></p><br><p class="p1">President Eyring has reminded us:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Your call has eternal consequences for others and for you. In the world to come, thousands may call your name blessed, even more than the people you serve here. They will be the ancestors and the descendants of those who chose eternal life because of something you said or did, or even what you were.</i> ["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/11/rise-to-your-call?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Rise to Your Call</span></a>," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2002]</p><br><p class="p1">I have seen this partially fulfilled in my own life as I have been engaged in family history and temple work for my ancestors, and I have personally experienced the great blessings that heeding the call of the Lord brings.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s2"> In closing, I would like to bear my testimony. I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the gospel was restored through Joseph Smith. I know that the Lord is continually calling to each of us to follow Him, if we "have eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to feel" (Monson, "<span style="color: #33cccc;">B</span><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/05/be-thou-an-example?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">eThou an Example</span></a>," <i>Ensign, </i>May 2005). I knowthat our lives and the lives of others are greatly blessed when we heed the call of the Lord. I leave this with you humbly in the name ofJesus Christ, amen.</span></p><br><p class="p1"><i>Paul Caldarella, associate professor in the BYU Depart­ment of Counseling Psychology and Special Education and director of the Positive Behavior Support Initiative, delivered this devotional address on July 25, 2017.</i></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1">© Brigham Young University.

<p class="p1">I am going to tell you two stories today: a short one about dead cats and a long one about dead people.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Dead Cats</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">First, dead cats. Now, I know you might be tired of so many talks beginning with stories about dead cats, but bear with me.</p><br><p class="p1">My parents' views on pets--cats or otherwise--could not have been more different. My mother grew up in a household that didn't allow animals in the house; my dad grew up in a home where pets, at one point even including a monkey, were allowed inside. Over their sixty-some-odd years of marriage, my parents struck a bit of a compromise about pets in our home. Smaller cage-bound animals such as hamsters, snakes, frogs, toads, and fish were allowed inside, but larger animals such as cats, dogs, and any animal destined to become dinner stayed in the garage, the doghouse, or the chicken coop. Dogs were confined, but cats were free to roam. Well, they were free to roam as long as I didn't pick them up and dress them in my dolls' clothing--a fate most of them contemplated with a mixture of trepidation and resignation.</p><br><p class="p1">When I was very young, we lived on a busy intersection with constant traffic. The combination of this location and the pet policy meant that cats--and there seemed to be an endless parade of them that somehow ended up at our house--rarely died of old age. I liked the cats and mourned their loss, and at some point I began to memorize the names and faces of all the cats who had lived, loved, and then shuffled off their mortal coils at our house. Eventually I was unable to keep all of the memories and names straight, and, concerned, I asked my mom whether all those cats would meet us in heaven and whether they would recognize us and we them. She assured me that they would--that the cats would remember me and I them. Forever.</p><br><p class="p1">Now, the impact of that story isn't so much about the cats, but it <i>is</i> about my mother's assurances that relationships last, much like photographs of the two of us have lasted far beyond the moments they captured. Relationships are durable and meaningful--even beyond death. This idea was central to my childhood. As the youngest of nine children, I arrived after three of my four grandparents, a handful of cousins, and my brother had died. Knowing that death would not forever prevent me from knowing those people was deeply comforting and grounding.</p><br><p class="p1">In a way, that early understanding about relationships has shaped my professional pursuits. I have spent my entire adult life studying relationships, particularly family relationships, and the power they have--for good or ill--to shape social, economic, religious, political, material, and emotional possibilities and realities. My research focuses mostly on eighteenth-century England. This means I study dead people and what they can teach us. As Thomas W. Laqueur put it:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> The history . . . of the dead is a history of how they dwell in us--individually and communally. It is a history of how we imagine them to be, how they give meaning to our lives. . . . It is a history . . . of how we invest the dead . . . with meaning.</i><sup>1</sup></p><br><p class="p1">My research has taught me much about the meaning found in social and familial relationships in the past and today as well as about their undervalued potential to positively influence society and afford solutions for vexing problems.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Dead People</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">So let me talk about some of those dead people. I am going to begin with the story of a particular dead person: William Dade. He was born in late 1740 or early 1741 in Yorkshire in northern England. His parents, who married in their early thirties, already had three children when William was born.<sup>2</sup> His father was the local vicar and had a handful of additional livings (or parishes that supplied his employment and income), so William and his siblings--a sister and two brothers--were raised in the relative comfort that typified the genteel "middling sort" of England, as the phrase went.<sup>3</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> William was educated in Yorkshire schools, which required him to live away from home for long stretches of the year. Once they reached their late teens, both William and his eldest brother, Thomas, followed their father's path--first to the University of Cambridge and then into the church.<sup>4</sup> Their mother died when William was twelve, and their father died when William was eighteen, around the time he entered Cambridge. Two years later their brother John died at age twenty-two and was buried alongside their parents in the parish church where their father had been vicar. A monument to their collective memory, likely commissioned by William and his surviving siblings, hangs in the church to this day.<sup>5</sup></span></p><br><p class="p1">At the time of his father's death, Thomas, twenty-four and single, had been ordained, and his sister, twenty-three-year-old Mary, who was also single, presumably lived with him--or perhaps with William, who left Cambridge that same year. Within two years William had his own living in the city of York, when he was only twenty-two.</p><br><p class="p1">So far, this a rather unremarkable story of an eighteenth-century English family. Their parents' marrying in their early thirties was not unusual for those who came of age in the early 1700s. On average women married at age twenty-six and men at age twenty-eight in that period.<sup>6</sup> It was not unusual for children to die before their parents, though it was more common for them to die in infancy or in childhood than in young adulthood, as in William's brother's case. In some places a third or more of children did not survive to see their tenth birthday.<sup>7</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Children of most classes, no matter their wealth, left home for employment or schooling in their mid-teens, as the Dade brothers did.<sup>8</sup> This included most young women--though not usually women of the gentry or aristocracy. That the Dade siblings were not married in their mid-twenties was also not unusual for their cohort, which also coincided with large numbers of people who never married--somewhere between 15 to 20 percent in the middle of the eighteenth century. (For comparison, current UK statistics suggest that as little as 4 percent and perhaps no more than 9 percent of the population never marries or partners.<sup>9</sup>)</p><br><p class="p1">That the brothers followed their father's occupational path into the church is similarly unremarkable: between a quarter and a third of eighteenth-century English clergymen were the sons of clergy. This was typical of the eighteenth century, in which were perpetuated--often with great vigor--socioeconomic distinctions and inequalities.<sup>10</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Also, typically, sibling relationships were important, including to the Dade family. Their parents' marrying later and dying relatively young meant that, for the Dade siblings--and for many people in this period--siblinghood was the most central and durable family relationship. People depended on siblings for a host of material, social, and emotional supports. Siblings were close, or not, in ways that might look familiar to you. These relationships had great solidarity and great power that few other relationships did.<sup>11</sup></p><br><p class="p1">They continue to have great power and influence today. If you ever search for photos of siblings on Google, you will find an array of images of siblings who, even as adults, are dressed in matching outfits--a tradition not usually practiced beyond athletic teams. Let's just say that if any other adult suggested that you wear matching outfits, get matching haircuts, and have your picture taken, the happiness depicted in some of these photos would not be the likely outcome.</p><br><p class="p1">Like they are today, eighteenth-century siblings were lifelong, but unlike today, they were often on their own at the center of family relationships. Siblings came before spouses and children--who arrived late in life, if they arrived at all--and they outlasted parents who often died before all of their children reached age thirty.</p><br><p class="p1">These relationships weren't perfect; siblings fought and struggled with each other. Like it is for some of you and your siblings, it was not always easy for siblings to navigate a relationship that they did not choose but which was freighted with so many lifelong expectations. As one eighteenth-century man wrote to his brother:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Three wise words from your lips made me think you an inhabitant of another country. .</i><i>.</i><i>. You have the art to set me at a distance by three words when I am with you, and to draw me to you at a hundred miles off by the same method.</i><sup>12</sup></p><br><p class="p1">To return to William Dade, his story to this point--his late twenties--was unremarkable and like thousands of others. But in 1770, as he entered his thirties, William made a remarkable decision. He decided that Church of England parish registers should contain more information than they typically did. He wanted, in his words, to improve "the imperfect method hitherto generally pursued."<sup>13</sup> If you think that doesn't sound all that earth-shattering, just be patient with me, because this was an astounding development--a development with untapped potential to better the world today.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Dade's Parish Records</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">First I need to put William Dade's parish registers into a bit of context. English church registers began after Henry VIII's break with Rome and the establishment of the Church of England in the 1530s. From then until the eighteenth century, entries for baptisms, marriages, and burials typically had limited information. Baptism records might record only the name of the child, the date of the baptism, and the name of the child's father. Compared to continental registers, for example, English registers contained paltry information. For comparison, a Spanish record from 1764 contains not only the child's and father's names but also the mother's (including her original, or maiden, name), both sets of grandparents', and the godparents' names.<sup>14</sup> Even in the first half of the eighteenth-century, English registers became only marginally better: mother's first names, for example, were increasingly included. Sometimes extra bits and pieces might be included, such as the birthdate of the child or the occupation of the father.</p><br><p class="p1">William Dade himself benefited from an unusually detailed entry for his christening. Because his father was a vicar, the priest who christened William in a different parish took the time to include William's father's occupation and residence, but his mother was not named.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Dade followed common practice when he first became a curate, and he recorded the limited information that other parish priests did. But then in 1770 he began to record more information, such as the father's occupation, residence, and family connections. He also encouraged other vicars and rectors to follow suit. Some did, but the real boost to his scheme came when the archbishop of York encouraged the practice throughout the diocese in 1777. Some vicars obeyed, many did not, and many resented it and gave up after a short time. William's brother Thomas might have been in one of those latter groups, as the registers in his parishes show no such effort to record additional information.</span></p><br><p class="p1">Dade was also interested in local history--but that interest seems to have come later than did his scheme to improve parish registers. It was perhaps his exposure to the old records stored in parish churches that inspired his interest in historical research. He was inducted into the Society of Antiquaries in 1783, and he began two books: one detailing the local history of Holderness, where he had attended school as a boy, and the other listing the births, marriages, and deaths of prominent people.<sup>15</sup></p><br><p class="p1">It wasn't recording extra information or being a better record-keeper that set Dade apart--other clergy had similar inclinations.<sup>16</sup> For Dade, the switch to record more information did not come from a historical interest or passion for the past so much as it came from a concern for the future. As he wrote in the register when he began his efforts, "This scheme if properly put in execution will afford much clearer intelligence to the researches of posterity than the imperfect method hitherto generally pursued."<sup>17</sup> He reasoned that families in the future would want to know more about the past, particularly their personal past. What motivated him were future people and their needs; Dade was thinking of how his actions would echo beyond his lifetime into strangers' lives.</p><br><p class="p1">At its heart, this is what Ari Wallach, in a recent TED talk, described as "transgenerational thinking."<sup>18</sup> Wallach referred to an ethic that thinks beyond one's own comfort and considers how actions ripple into the future, long beyond an individual lifespan.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Two Aspects of Human Instinct</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Implicit in Dade's actions and Wallach's argument are two aspects of human instinct: first, the ability to think about, imagine, and plan for the future, and second, the impulse and capacity to think of strangers--to think beyond ourselves. The ability to plan for the future and to think about how today's actions will shape tomorrow is unique to humans.<sup>19</sup> It is an ability that separates us from all other living creatures.</p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Psychologist Daniel Gilbert nicely summed it up by saying, "We think about the future in a way that no other animal can, does, or ever has, and this simple, ubiquitous, ordinary act is a defining feature of our humanity." According to Gilbert, no chimpanzee "weeps at the thought of growing old alone, or smiles as it contemplates its summer vacation, or turns down a Fudgsicle because it already looks too fat in shorts."<sup>20</sup> Only we have that honor--even though we aren't always very good at using that skill to best serve ourselves and others.</span></p><br><p class="p1">We have another distinguishing characteristic that has great power, though we don't always use it powerfully or for good either: the ability to cooperate with strangers and to act in their best interest even in contradiction of our own interests. In fact, the ability to act cooperatively and even altruistically is one of the greatest achievements of humanity. Evolutionary biologists remark on this and assert that we are literally built to cooperate with others--not just with those we know or are related to but with innumerable strangers.<sup>21</sup> And it isn't just cooperation; humans have evolved a unique capacity to <i>care </i>about and have compassion for strangers--to take responsibility for strangers.<sup>22</sup> We are built, in other words, to belong to one another.</p><br><p class="p1">In fact, without this ability, we could not form effective groups much larger than 150 people, but with this ability we harness the power of millions and billions. In such large groups, when we ignore this capacity for caring, then suicide, addiction, unhappiness, and avariciousness expand. But when we act on this impulse, large groups of humans are capable of--and are biologically built for--great goodness.<sup>23</sup> I don't think I need to detail the ways in which we have clearly not fully tapped into this goodness. Though we are built for compassion, for care, and for love, we are also--in King Benjamin's formulation--fallen, weak, incapable of acting on our best instincts, and enemies to all our best, even divine, impulses.<sup>24</sup> But the fact remains that we are built to cooperate with and belong to not just our kin but to all humanity.<sup>25</sup></p><br><p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Atheists, philosophers, historians, podcasters, Holocaust survivors, writers, therapists, military veterans, ministers, and psychologists concur with biologists: building lasting relationships and connections with other people is the only way to live happy and meaningful lives. Author and atheist Alain de Botton, whose essay on marriage relationships was the most-read article on the <i>New York Times</i> website in 2016; <i>On Being </i>podcast host Krista Tippett; concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl; Christian social worker Brené Brown; war veteran and journalist Sebastian Junger; historian of Mormon theology Samuel Brown; Congregationalist historian and archivist Margaret Bendroth; Methodism's founder John Wesley; and BYU's own psychology professor Brent Slife do not, on the surface, seem to have much in common. But they all landed in the same spot: asserting that building relationships with others, loving others, is the most important work of humanity--not the byproduct but the purpose of life. In Slife's words at a recent forum, loving others must be "an end, not ... a means."<sup>26</sup> And in John Wesley's words, "The gospel of Christ knows of no religion but social; no holiness but social holiness."<sup>27</sup></span></p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Genealogical Consciousness</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">This winding through fields decidedly not related to my research, experience, and training may seem like a long sidetrack, but it demonstrates that when William Dade stated his reasons for adding more information to parish registers, he tapped into the apparently universal human ability to think about the future and the inclination to belong and connect. In that respect, he may not have been so exceptional, as his actions are ones that we could replicate. But it was his combination of these two human behaviors that made him exceptional. The social scientists, authors, and journalists I listed have emphasized the importance of relationships or have discussed the ability to plan for the future, but Dade did both simultaneously. He was thinking about relationships <i>across time--</i>across<i> </i>vast stretches of time--and he was thinking beyond the barrier of personal acquaintance to encompass strangers.</p><br><p class="p1">Many people before him thought about their famous ancestors or about their posterity or about enforcing rules of who constituted sufficiently illustrious ancestors and sufficiently legitimate posterity. Dade, on the other hand, stitched together his interest in the past to the lived, daily lives of the people whose details filled the books he kept and then stitched that to the concerns and desires of future strangers. That is not just transgenerational thinking; that is what I call genealogical consciousness. Genealogical consciousness is an ethic, a moral way of behaving based on seeing oneself and one's actions as inextricably linked with past, present, and future people's lives and hopes. Hoping future genealogists would have "clearer intelligence" in their research doesn't sound like much of a gift, but the real power in Dade's actions is that he considered himself and all those future strangers to be connected--and he could do something for them, something that came with no possibility of reward for himself, something they would be grateful for. He saw them, frankly, as people, not as objects, not as abstractions, not as something unimportant to himself.</p><br><p class="p1">Genealogical consciousness means seeing how past, present, and future are connected--again not in an abstract sense but in the lived reality of actual thinking and feeling people--and how they and we are connected over time and space. This echoes an idea from Margaret Bendroth, the archivist at the Congregational Library:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Instead of defining ourselves through associations with once-famous people, or taking our ancestors too lightly by assuming they were not as complex as we are, we should want an encounter with the past that will challenge and deepen </i>[us].<sup>28</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Similarly, we need an encounter with the future that challenges and deepens us.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>A Need to Be Remembered</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Most humans want to be remembered, to leave something that lasts beyond their lifespan, no matter the scale of that remembrance. In the words of Umberto Eco, "We [make] lists because we don't want to die."<sup>29</sup> Indeed, what are the book of Chronicles and all the pyramids, tombs, and masses for the dead if not hopeful expressions that we will be remembered? What else would have motivated the builder of my home in 1951 to write his name on plaster that was about to be canvassed and painted over, if not some vestigial hope that the recording of his name would grant him a measure of immortality that the bricks he used and the walls he built could not?</p><br><p class="p1">But Dade wasn't thinking of himself; he wasn't clamoring to be remembered. He was thinking of, well, us--of future strangers whom he would never know and of our need to belong and be connected to something larger and longer-lasting than ourselves.</p><br><p class="p1">The posterity William Dade imagined appreciating his efforts was not his own. He remained childless until his death in 1790, as did his sister, who died in 1782, and his remaining brother, who died in 1806.<sup>30</sup> The detailed forms Dade created and which recorded his and his sister's deaths versus the sloppy but more typical account of his brother's burial show that Dade's innovation had limited reach. He and his family passed into obscurity. In fact, despite his importance to English genealogy, his family did not appear as a group on either of the two largest collections of online family trees until this summer, when in researching this talk I organized and grouped together the Dade family files on FamilySearch's family tree.</p><br><p class="p1">It wasn't just the knowledge of Dade's family that died out. Despite additional Church of England clergy adopting Dade's pattern, his remarkable idea did not survive long. The practice largely disappeared after 1813, when regulations about Church of England registers changed. Parish registers were then required to be kept in preprinted books that limited the flexibility that had allowed Dade to think of registers more expansively. Some vicars continued to squeeze the extra bits of information into the printed boxes, even into the 1840s. But the practice largely disappeared, never to return. And other than the people who research their ancestors in these records, no one knows about William Dade ­anymore--well, except now all of you.</p><br><p class="p1">But all was not lost for genealogical consciousness. Joseph Smith, Wilford Woodruff, and Susa Young Gates took their personal religious and spiritual experiences and used them to think about all of humanity across all time and about our connections to one another and to God.<sup>31</sup></p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Susa Young Gates</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">We should pause here and recognize Susa Young Gates's remarkable work, which is often less well known than Joseph Smith's or Wilford Woodruff's. Prominent in late-nineteenth-century and early-twentieth-century Mormon leadership, central to the creation of the <i>Young Woman's Journal</i> and the <i>Relief Society Magazine,</i> and active in the struggle for women's suffrage, Gates was also passionate about genealogy. In the 1890s she collected information from living relatives and traveled to archives in the East to conduct research.</p><br><p class="p1">In 1902 she fell seriously ill and received a blessing. In the blessing she was told that she would continue to perform temple work but that she would also "do a greater work than [she had] ever done before."<sup>32</sup> Her understanding of this blessing turned her from someone acquiring genealogical knowledge for herself and her family to someone deeply committed to genealogical consciousness. She wrote that while she had already been interested in temple work, she now "felt that I must do something more, something to help all the members of the Church."<sup>33</sup> After this, Gates became a formidable force in genealogical efforts for others.</p><br><p class="p1">Though the Church had established the Genealogical Society of Utah (GSU) (now the Family History Department of the Church) in 1894 and had genealogical libraries housed at temples, there was no Church-wide effort for genealogical education and training at the turn of the twentieth century. Gates worked with the GSU, published genealogical articles, worked to improve the indexing of temple ordinances, founded the Daughters of Utah Pioneers, wrote genealogy lessons, wrote the first genealogical how-to manual in the United States in 1912, and made family history work central to the work of the Relief Society. She did this for two decades, until the Church gradually assumed greater involvement and centralization of genealogical efforts after the 1920s--which was her hoped-for goal all along.</p><br><p class="p1">Gates's perseverance is partly attributed to her strength of character, but I would assert that it was powered by genealogical consciousness--a power that came when she felt called to do something more to benefit people beyond her own kin.</p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Genealogical Knowledge and Identity</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">So what is genealogical consciousness for us? Some would claim that a largely Mormon audience is full of genealogical consciousness, but I want to push that idea a bit further and assert that a largely Mormon audience is full of genealogical knowledge and perhaps even a genealogically based identity, but those aren't the same as genealogical consciousness. Genealogical consciousness brings along with it an empathetic wisdom that knowledge alone cannot possess.</p><br><p class="p1">For me, genealogical knowledge is intriguing and thrilling. I have been filling out pedigree charts since I learned to write, and finding genealogical information is satisfying and exciting on its own terms. I dare say some of you find it equally satisfying and exciting--probably about 2 to 5 percent of you (if my ward's statistics on family history work are typical). And while that group can and should expand--which is, frankly, what my colleagues and I who teach family history majors hope<i> </i>will happen--it is unlikely that it will ever be the majority of people.</p><br><p class="p1">The good news is that though a passionate interest in gathering genealogical knowledge itself is far from widespread, a much larger group is interested in what genealogy can do for them and their families. For example, it is estimated that a third of adults in the United Kingdom have been online to look for their ancestors.<sup>34</sup> Most argue that this prevalent interest comes from genealogy's ability to give people a sense of identity. Undoubtedly, the focus on identity is the current obsession in Western genealogy, in the marketing schemes of the three-billion-dollar-a-year genealogical industry, and even in some aspects of Mormon genealogical practice.</p><br><p class="p1">But William Dade and Susa Young Gates didn't stop with personal identity. Finding an anchor for identity is valuable because it gives a sense of roots in a time that feels rootless--even replacing religion, in one Englishman's estimation, as something one can believe in.<sup>35</sup> But on its own, the search for identity can bring only partial belonging.</p><br><p class="p1">Rattling on about "endless genealogies" in order to prove our special status is not only a tedious thing to do; it is, if we take Paul literally, a destructive practice.<sup>36</sup> And the Savior Himself warned that being Abraham's seed was as meaningless as being a rock if it was not accompanied by a humbler way of living.<sup>37</sup></p><br><p class="p1">If genealogy stops with individual identity, it will never fully jettison its exclusionary tendencies. Genealogy's historical association with elitist and racist claims shows that it is too easy to slip into tribalism, eugenics, racism, rabid isolationist nationalism, and us-versus-them-ism. If we focus solely on our own identity, it is easy to myopically think that only <i>our </i>ancestors matter. We become all "manner of -ites," to borrow a phrase.<sup>38</sup> A genealogical understanding based solely on personal identity inevitably leads to excluding others' identities, whether they are based in race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, DNA, nationality, or any other category. Genealogical consciousness, on the other hand, doesn't just avoid these pitfalls; it prevents them. It has the power to obliterate them, to completely dissolve the destructive boundaries between us and them, to starkly remind us that there is no "them" and that there is only "us," and to pull people together <i>despite</i> differences.</p><br><p class="p1">If instead we see genealogical knowledge and even identity as tools, as means to an end, then we are on the way to genealogical consciousness. We often reverse this, prizing knowledge over the wisdom of consciousness. We race to find more names and make the consumption of more information more important than getting to know those who held the names we seek. This is meaningless and exhausting as we chase after ever more elusive proof of our righteous genealogical knowledge, as we constantly learn but never come to a knowledge of the truth.<sup>39</sup> We tire ourselves endlessly in the doing and miss the opportunity to become, thinking we can save getting to know them for "later." But getting to know them is the point. It is where the real power lies--not the other way around. To quote from Philippians, "If ... there is ... any consolation from love" or "any compassion and sympathy" in Christ, we need to also find them in one another. We should "do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than [ourselves]."<sup>40</sup></p><br><br><h2 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>True Genealogical Consciousness</b></span></h2><br><p class="p1">Genealogical consciousness goes beyond mere knowledge or pursuit of personal or group identity. Instead it makes us stop to consider and to reckon both with others' lives and choices and with our own. We can also imagine our shared humanity with people in the past and the choices they confronted.</p><br><p class="p1">I remember sitting in an English archive reading the papers of the Travell family. One day, while reading Anne Travell's diary from August 1780, I discovered that her "dear sister[-in-law] and friend" Martha had died suddenly at the age of forty-one.<sup>41</sup> I teared up, mourning the loss of Martha. I stopped myself when I realized that <i>everyone </i>from 1780 is dead. But then as I considered my response further, I realized I was not shedding tears for Martha's death as much as I was for the pain her death had caused her family and friends. Anne wrote that she spent the rest of that evening writing twenty "dreadful" letters informing friends and family of Martha's death.<sup>42</sup> I could imagine how dreadful that was, and I could imagine the pain of losing a lifelong friend and a much-loved sister-in-law--a person I too had grown to love as I had read her letters. I further considered what a devastating blow it would be to me to lose a sibling or a sibling-in-law. It was as if, in that moment, time and distance between Anne and me collapsed and virtually disappeared, replaced with a brief moment of ­connection and empathy.</p><br><p class="p1">If, like Dade, we pause to consider the long-since dead, we can pivot to considering present and future relationships. As Margaret Bendroth put it:</p><br><p class="p1"><i>The choice is not to load our ancestors down with honors or run away from them as fast as we can--our .</i><i>.</i><i>. faith requires us to take the past seriously and to receive its people warmly and wisely. It requires us to be generous, and in a fundamental way truly inclusive.</i><sup>43</sup></p><br><p class="p1">I would say it doesn't stop there. Because developing genealogical consciousness requires that we think about strangers in the past, it develops the possibility of thinking about strangers in the present and strangers in the future and about how our relationships and actions will last beyond death and echo into future strangers' lives. In doing so, genealogical consciousness makes heavy demands: it demands that we act more compassionately and more Christlike.</p><br><p class="p1">In conclusion, I am going to explain my title. As a historian of the eighteenth century, I have grown accustomed to the long, narrative titles typically used by that century's authors. And as a lover of fine children's literature, I am amused by E.L. Konigsburg's title of one of my favorite children's books: <i>Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth</i>.</p><br><p class="p1">But while those facts explain the long, narrative style of my title, they don't explain the content. And they certainly don't explain the dead cats. Why didn't I just entitle the talk "Developing a Genealogical Consciousness," since that's the <i>point</i> of the talk? I did not title it that because I had the suspicion--backed by decades of personal experience--that if any words resembling <i>genealogy</i> or <i>family history</i> were used to describe something to be presented to an audience of Latter-day Saints, attendance would either be virtually nonexistent or would consist entirely of those already seriously, passionately, and rabidly interested in family history. And as much as I love that latter group--and in fact count myself among them--I wanted to reach an audience of people who might not think they have anything to learn about the reasons for genealogical pursuits or who feel guilty or overwhelmed when the words <i>family history</i> are uttered. I did not want to burden that group any further; I wanted to offer an additional perspective or alternative approach.</p><br><p class="p1">Our shared theology is replete with genealogical consciousness and its potential to create meaningful change for the better. As PatrickQ. Mason has put it:</p><br><p class="p1"><i> This </i>[Mormon] <i>image of being knit together, with the children of God in all our diversity inextricably and intricately interwoven, is at the heart of Mormonism's social ideal. It reflects a life-affirming theology predicated on the notion that the entire family of God can and will be eternally bound together--that heaven is less about where we are than who we are with and the quality of our relationships.</i><sup>44</sup></p><br><p class="p1">Genealogical consciousness is merely a label meant to underscore that relationships with other people in the past, present, and future are durable--built for the eternities--and that from them we can access previously untapped mines of divine power. Simply put, we cannot afford to treat genealogy the way we have--as something, to quote an acquaintance of mine, "that dude in the Third Ward does" or as something that is satisfied by producing stacks and stacks of temple names in order to show them off or to rattle off numbers during Sunday School to impress or guilt others. If that is why we do it, then doing so is the only reward we will ever have.</p><br><p class="p1">More than something that that dude in the Third Ward or your great aunt does, genealogical consciousness is a way of being, a way of thinking about your place within and responsibility to the generations surrounding you. It holds a promise to erode racism and sexism; to reduce to rubble centuries of hatred and discrimination; to bind us together when all other ways of connecting only seem to drive us ever farther apart; and to take our instinct to belong, shatter its tribal proclivities, and replace them with inclinations to Zion. If Elijah was meant to return in order to save the world from being an utter waste, then there is more for us to do with the manifestation of the Spirit that bears his name.</p><br><p class="p1"><i>Amy Harris, BYU associate professor of history, delivered this forum address on July 18, 2017.</i></p><br><p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Notes</b></span></p><br><p class="p1">1.

<h1>d Education: “A Future Only God Could See for You” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is wonderful to be here. This is not an opportunity I would have imagined for myself. It is truly a future only God could see for me. I am grateful for a Father in Heaven who knows me--who knows my potential and who wants me to become like Him. I can't wait to someday see like He does--to know everything and to see the future and not just the past. But for now I will stand like a little girl on my Father's feet, holding His hands and trusting Him as He guides me through the dance of this life. As His daughter, I hope someday to grow up to be just like Him. I am trying to become more like Him now by learning as much as I can and by working to refine the spiritual gifts He has given me.<br><br><b>Daughters of God</b><br><br>Revelation given in the book of Joel speaks of the role of women in the latter days when it says that, in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ,<br><br><i>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, .</i>..<i></i><br><br><i> ...and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit</i>. [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/joel/2.28-29?lang=eng#p27">Joel 2:28–29</a>]<br><br>Your <i>daughters</i> shall <i>prophesy!</i> In these last days we are meant to seek and receive spiritual revelation by the power of the Holy Ghost. Like Rebekah, Hannah, Elisabeth, and Mary, women are meant to receive direct spiritual revelation through the gifts of the Spirit. Like Miriam (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/15.20?lang=eng#p19">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/judg/4.4?lang=eng#p3">Judges 4:4</a>), Huldah (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/22.14?lang=eng#p13">2 Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34.22?lang=eng#p21">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>), and Anna (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/2.36?lang=eng#p35">Luke 2:36</a>), we can develop the spiritual gift of prophecy and refine our ability to communicate with our Father in Heaven in ways that affect our own spiritual development and have a positive impact on the world around us.<sup>1</sup><br><br>These spiritual gifts bring us closer to the image of God, in which we were created. Through her choice to partake of the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden, Mother Eve made it possible for each of us to exercise our agency in a world filled with choices, thereby providing a way for us to spiritually develop. I do not think it was an accident that by knowledge she opened a pathway that would allow us to become more like God. Ibelieve this sets an eternal pattern. "The glory of God is intelligence" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#p35">D&amp;amp;C 93:36</a>), and we must likewise enhance our own inherent intelligence inorder to become like Him and receive His ­spiritual gifts.<br><br>How do we reach this divine potential? How do we strengthen these spiritual gifts that have been foretold? ElizaR. Snow wrote, "Let them seek for wisdom instead of power and they will have all the power they have wisdom to exercise."<sup>2</sup><br><br><b>An Expansive View</b><br><br>When God prepares a leader for the gift of prophecy, He expands their view; He does not narrow it. He provides context for the leader's personal prophetic development through lessons on the vast science and history of the earth and of the people on it.<br><br>To Moses He gave a vision of<br><br><i>the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not;</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> And he beheld many lands; and each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.27-29?lang=eng#p26">Moses 1:27–29</a>]<br><br>To the brother of Jared He gave a vision of "all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be ..., even unto the ends of the earth" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.25?lang=eng#p24">Ether 3:25</a>).<br><br>And to all the Nephite women, men, and ­children visited by Christ,<br><br><i>he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time that he should come in his glory.</i><i>.</i>..<br><br><i> And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful to be written. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.3,18?lang=eng#p2">3 Nephi 26:3, 18</a>]<br><br>Formal higher education provides an opportunity to see more as God sees--not through a narrow and shrinking echo chamber but with "the depth of the riches both of ... wisdom and knowledge" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rom/11.33?lang=eng#p32">Romans 11:33</a>), with all things continually before Him (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.7?lang=eng#p6">D&amp;amp;C 130:7</a>), "for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/26.35?lang=eng#p34">Alma 26:35</a>).<br><br>This vastness of knowledge must be earned through hard work and by leveraging a greater perspective than our own. Like Eve, we must have our eyes opened not only to new information but to new ways of thinking about that information. If we seek discernment through the Holy Ghost as we engage in this process, we will be brought to new ways of valuing, understanding, and perceiving truth.<br><br><b>Education Is a Commandment</b><br><br>Multiple prophets and apostles have made it explicitly clear that "for members of the Church, education is not merely a good idea--it's a commandment."<sup>3</sup> Speaking specifically to women, President GordonB. Hinckley said, "You must get all of the education that you possibly can."<sup>4</sup> And Elder DallinH. Oaks said, "We make no distinction between young men and young women in our conviction about the importance of an education and in our commitment to providing that education."<sup>5</sup><br><br>The Lord made clear that "all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.34?lang=eng#p33">D&amp;amp;C 29:34</a>). This means that the commandment to pursue education--no matter how temporally useful--is really about the development of our spirits and our spiritual gifts. We are commanded to receive education, and this is a spiritual--not merely a temporal--commandment.<br><br>Prophetic counsel to women has repeated the benefits of education in case we are called upon to become so-called breadwinners in our households. This is wise counsel, and I have seen its place in the lives of close friends and family members time and time again. But this counsel adds, "precept upon precept" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p29">2 Nephi 28:30</a>), to a deeper truth about the education of women: our pursuit of knowledge has its own spiritual value regardless of whether we ever enter the paid labor force.<br><br>President RussellM. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said:<br><br><i>Your mind is precious! It is sacred. Therefore, the education of one's mind is also sacred. Indeed, education is a religious responsibility.</i><i>.</i>..<br><br><i> ... In light of this celestial perspective, if you .</i>..<i> cut short your education, you would not only disregard a divine decree but also abbreviate your own eternal potential.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Our learning is of value not only if we become mothers or workers, church leaders or community activists. We are of value because of our divine heritage and because of what will one day be our divine inheritance. Our value is not merely instrumental. It is intrinsic. And our learning is not merely instrumental. It is essential.<br><br><b>Education: "On Holy Ground"</b><br><br>I love this powerful quote from President J.Reuben Clark Jr.:<br><br>[We]<i> who </i>[invade]<i> the domain of knowledge must approach it as Moses came to the burning bush; </i>[we stand]<i> on holy ground; </i>[we]<i> would acquire things sacred; </i>[we seek]<i> to make </i>[our]<i> own the attributes of deity. .</i>.. <i>We must come to this quest of truth--in all regions of human knowledge whatsoever, not only in reverence, but with a spirit of worship.</i><br><br><i> .</i><i>.</i><i>. Our knowledge is to be coterminous with the universe and is to reach out and to comprehend the laws and the workings of the vast deeps of the eternities. All domains of all knowledge belong to us. In no other way could the great law of eternal progression be satisfied.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br><b>"A Future Only God Could See for You"</b><br><br>President HenryB. Eyring said, "Part of the tragedy you must avoid is to discover too late that you missed an opportunity to prepare for a future only God could see for you."<sup>8</sup><br><br>That sentiment is so important that I would like to repeat it: "Part of the tragedy you must avoid is to discover too late that you missed an opportunity to prepare for a future only God could see foryou."<sup></sup><br><br>That could have happened to me. Women's stories are powerful, and they haven't always been told. So I am going to tell you a little bit of mine.<br><br>After graduating from college, I worked for a couple of years at a local nonprofit organization, where I was inspired by the skills of a new manager. I decided to pursue a master's degree so that I could gain the kinds of skills he had used to improve our organization.<br><br>Between the time I was accepted to the program and the time I was to attend, we learned that I was pregnant with our first child. Pregnancy is always a challenge, but due to some medical complications, pregnancies are particularly difficult for me. I was sicker than I had ever been in my life. I could only stand up for a few minutes at a time, and I was virtually no help as my husband, family, and friends packed up our little apartment and sent my husband to Indiana, where I was to attend graduate school.<br><br>By this time I had been prescribed temporary bedrest and was unable to travel. I called my program in tears and asked if they would be willing to hold my spot, even though I would miss the first weeks of school.<br><br>When I finally arrived to begin my master's program, the heaviest question in my heart was whether I should be pursuing the degree at all. After all, I was now anticipating motherhood. And though I did not yet understand the gravity of what that meant, caring for our unborn daughter was already the most physically, mentally, and emotionally challenging experience of my life.<br><br>In my new ward I was promptly called to be an assistant nursery leader. I was new to the ward and new to the state, and nobody there knew me, including the counselor in the bishopric who set me apart for my new calling. We had never had a conversation.<br><br>He laid his hands upon my head and bestowed upon me all the usual authority, gifts, and admonitions attendant on a calling in nursery--that I would have the strength to carry out my calling and that I would love the little children. And then, speaking to my most hidden fears and my deepest questions, he told me, in the name of Christ, to pursue and complete my master's degree, that this was the will of God.<br><br>So I did.<br><br>Near the conclusion of my time working on my master's degree, my husband received a good job offer in Washington, DC. I was preparing to be a stay-at-home mom to our then one-year-old daughter. We were making plans, scoping out neighborhoods, and undergoing background checks. I felt unsettled by the move, like something wasn't quite right, and I wanted the confirmation of the Spirit to help soothe me. But the more I prayed, the more agitated I became. This was not a mere lack of an answer, which sometimes suggests that the Lord wants us to move forward and use our own agency. This was an active sense of dread.<br><br>So my husband and I prayed, fasted, and attended the temple to seek guidance about whether or not to take the job. As we were leaving the temple, we shared our independent messages from the Spirit and discovered that we had both received the same guidance: we needed to adopt a child. This was unexpected but exciting, and we began the long process that ultimately led us to welcome our second daughter.<br><br>The matter of our imminent move remained unresolved until the very last day of class in my master's program. I was sitting in a darkened room as the professor projected slides about collaboration in the nonprofit sector. During that lecture I felt a tremendous and unmistakable outpouring of the Spirit, and a clear, quiet, and calm voice spoke to my mind, telling me I would return for a PhD. I was at peace. I knew what the Lord wanted and why I had been so uneasy about the move to Washington.<br><br>I didn't tell my husband right away what my prompting had been--only that I'd had one and that I was at peace. We decided that when he had the same sense of peace, we could make a plan together based on our individual promptings.<br><br>Soon thereafter, he felt strongly that we should make a short-term move to Finland for an internship he had been offered. I had received the prompting about my education in May, and ­applications to the doctoral program weren't due until January, so we took the internship.<br><br>From Finland I applied for the doctoral program. In Finland my husband started his ­business--the business that has made it possible for us to raise our children with at least one parent always in our home.<br><br>I finished the doctoral program in about three years and soon found myself--most ­unexpectedly--on the full-time faculty at BYU. Inaddition to food, clothing, and shelter, our work has afforded us freedom, family time, fulfillment, challenges, and a great deal of happiness. We now have four children, and they are--individually and collectively--the central joy of my life. This was a future only God could see for me.<br><br>I remember telling this story to my friend Kris, who shared that her own story was very similar to mine but had resulted in almost the exact opposite educational path. Kris had always hoped to pursue a PhD fairly directly after her undergraduate studies and had planned to do so. But when she inquired of the Lord, He led her in a different direction. The experience was powerful and clear, so Kris focused on raising her young children at home, trusting the Lord and His guidance. Together, Kris and I marveled that God's voice could be so clear in each of our circumstances, and, trusting in His goodness, we wondered how His plans for her would continue to unfold.<br><br>Similarly, when I told my story to another friend, Debbie, she laughed, because for her God had made it clear that in her home it was to be--as she put it--all hands on deck at home, all the time, by her. Debbie deferred completion of her undergraduate degree and taught and nurtured her four children--sometimes homeschooling them to best address their unique individual needs--until her youngest child was five, when she was prompted to return to BYU to finish her bachelor's degree in linguistics, with minors in Chinese and Japanese.<br><br>In a world that values education primarily as a means to increase our value in the workplace, nonlinear educational paths may sometimes be considered nontraditional, but they are <i>not</i> nonessential. As Kristen Oaks observed, "Women's educational paths and experiences are often very different from men's."<sup>9</sup> As Latter-day Saints, we know that the pursuit of education is not merely about gaining marketable skills in an efficient and linear fashion but that education is a tool for gaining important spiritual growth and spiritual gifts that can be used in all facets of our lives.<br><br>When I reached out to Kris to ask if I could share her story, I learned that the Spirit has begun to open new vistas for her future. She shared that it can be difficult and overwhelming to try to see what the Lord has planned--especially when such revelation doesn't come all at once. Idon't know what the Lord has in store for Kris, but I do know that it will be both challenging and beautiful.<br><br>When I contacted Debbie, she said that for her the Spirit seems to work by reawakening her own long-dormant dreams and goals when the time is right. She is now preparing to take the LSAT and hopes to become an attorney. "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/eccl/3.1?lang=eng#primary">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<br><br><b>"Potentials for Her Future Life"</b><br><br>Pakistani education advocate Ziauddin Yousafzai--whose daughter, Malala, joined his fight for the education of women in the face of Taliban rule--says that, for a woman,<br><br><i>enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name. Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Our intellectual and spiritual growth through education is a righteous pursuit and represents our willingness to fulfill a commandment of God. Investments in our own development are worthwhile because we are daughters of God, and He wants us to reach our divine potential in every possible way. But it should also be acknowledged that it is virtually impossible for the influence of a Spirit-led education to end with only our own benefit.<br><br>In1 Corinthians 13 we read:<br><br><i> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. .</i>..<br><br><i> Charity never faileth.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.2,8?lang=eng#p1">1 Corinthians 13:2, 8</a>]<br><br>Elder and Sister Oaks wrote, "Our religious faith teaches us that we should seek learning by the Spirit and that we have a stewardship to use our knowledge for the benefit of mankind."<sup>11</sup><br><br>We seek knowledge because it makes us more like God and brings us closer to Him, and His central trait is pure and benevolent love for all of humanity. The more we become like Him through knowledge and the more we hone our ability to hear Him testify of truth through the Spirit, the more these things will lead us to service in every aspect of our lives.<br><br>Women's voices are needed in all echelons of human activity. President SpencerW. Kimball said:<br><br><i>We wish you to pursue and to achieve that education .</i>.. <i>which will fit you for eternity</i><b><i> </i></b><b><i>as well as</i></b><i> for full service in mortality. .</i>..<br><br><i> ... We do not desire the women of the Church to be uninformed or ineffective.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Elder Oaks said:<br><br><i>Our young women's primary orientation toward motherhood is not inconsistent with their diligent pursuit of an education, even their efforts in courses of study that are vocationally related. .</i>.. <i>A young woman's education should prepare her for more than the responsibilities of motherhood. It should prepare her for the entire period of her life.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>President Hinckley said:<br><br><i>You can include in the dream of the woman you would like to be a picture of one qualified to serve society and make a significant contribution to the world of which she will be a part.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>President Hinckley also said:<br><br><i>Pursue educational programs which will lead to satisfying work and productive employment. .</i>..<br><br>. . . <i>Education will increase your appreciation and refine your talent.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>And President BoydK. Packer has taught:<br><br><i>We need women who are organized and women who can organize. We need women with executive ability who can plan and direct and administer; women who can teach, women who can speak out.</i><br><br><i> There is a great need for women who can receive inspiration to guide them personally in their teaching and in their leadership responsibilities.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>To this, President Nelson added:<br><br><i>We .</i>.. <i>need your strength, your conversion, your conviction, your ability to lead, your wisdom, and your voices. The kingdom of God is not and cannot be complete without .</i>..<i> women who can speak with the power and authority of God!</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i> ... I plead with my sisters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to step forward! Take your rightful and needful place in your home, in your community, and in the kingdom of God--more than you ever have before. .</i>..<i> As you do so, the Holy Ghost will magnify your influence in an unprecedented way!</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson said:<br><br><i>All women need to see themselves as essential ­participants in the work of the priesthood. .</i>.. <i>The kingdom of God cannot function unless we rise up and fulfill our duties with faith. Sometimes we just need to have a greater vision of what is possible.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>Sisters, never question the value of your education or wonder whether you will have an opportunity to learn and use the knowledge you have gained. God knows you, and even though you may not yet know His plans, He knows the end from the beginning. He is preparing and qualifying you for the work He wants you to do. He will continually guide you to ways in which your knowledge and skills can be of benefit to yourself, your family, your community, and His kingdom.<br><br><b>Preventing Friendly Fire</b><br><br>For the battles we face in this life, we need to allow God to arm us in His way, in His time, and with His spiritual gifts. But in preparation for these battles, our women are frequently wounded from friendly fire, even as we stand at the armory. President Kimball acknowledged this when he taught the brethren:<br><br><i> Sometimes we hear disturbing reports about how sisters are treated. .</i>.. <i>It should not be, brethren. The women of this Church have work to do. .</i>..<br><br><i> Our sisters do not wish to be indulged or to be treated condescendingly; they desire to be respected and revered as our sisters and our equals. I mention all these things, my brethren, not because the doctrines or the teachings of the Church regarding women are in any doubt, but because in some situations our behavior is ofdoubtful quality.</i><sup>19</sup><br><br>Virginia H. Pearce suggested that "when we feel that we must protect and defend ourselves..., our energy is used counterproductively and our learning and the learning of others is severely limited."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Consider this experience: Once, in an elevator, I encountered a young woman who was pursuing a master's degree. She hadn't taken any of my classes, but I had seen her in the building and knew her to be a promising mentee of one of my colleagues. I asked her how she was doing.<br><br>Her response to me, a virtual stranger, was this: "I'm struggling today because my family thinks I have been led astray by the devil to pursue my education."<br><br>I asked her if she herself was concerned that she was on the wrong path, as her family had suggested.<br><br>Between the first floor of my building and the seventh, this young woman bore testimony--and the Holy Ghost confirmed it to me--that the Spirit had guided her to pursue her studies and that she would continue to do what God asked of her.<br><br>Women frequently persevere in the face of insensitive comments on the part of those around them. We are prepared to soldier on through the attacks of the adversary, who seeks to deter the pursuit of our divine potential at every turn. We are often less prepared for the stinging and inappropriate attacks and judgments of our brothers in the gospel, fellow sisters, friends, spouses, and sometimes--as in the case of the woman in the elevator--even parents. I would be ungrateful if I stood here today and didn't acknowledge the unyielding support of my parents, siblings, and mentors as I have walked my own path, as well as the love and companionship of my husband, who has walked his path beside mine. We are able to accomplish more good together than we ever could apart.<br><br>If God has directed--even commanded--a woman to pursue her education, who are any of us to turn her away or to add to her burden as she makes her way to the summit God has bid her to climb? If God is preparing the women of His Church to fulfill prophecy--both ancient and modern--about the role of women of the Church in these latter days, we should be celebrating and supporting the women in our lives as they prayerfully seek inspiration and use their agency and intelligence to grow spiritually and serve mightily.<br><br>Latter-day Saint women are courageous, particularly when they have been emboldened by the knowledge that Heavenly Father has a plan for each of us and that He will qualify us to do the work that lies before us. Once we know what God wants us to do, we are fully capable of following the counsel of President Hinckley to "sacrifice anything that is needed to be sacrificed to ... train [our] minds and hands to become an influence for good as [we] go forward with [our] lives."<sup>21</sup> We will seek every good gift in the service of our God. All we ask is that others not stand in our way as we pursue the Lord's errand.<br><br>We hope instead that others will follow the example of Malala's father, who said:<br><br><i>People ask me, what </i>[is]<i> special </i>[about]<i> my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised? I tell them, don't ask me what I did. Ask me what I did not do. I did not clip her wings, and that's all.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I have a testimony of this gospel. God is real. He loves us, He knows us, and we have the potential to become like Him. I am grateful to be here in a place where I can pursue that goal, and I am thankful to be here with you today. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Eva M.

<h1> Learning: A Truly Educational Experience - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Internationally, BYU is known as "the language university." The 2017 edition of the pamphlet <i>YFacts</i> reported that approximately 65 percent of BYU students speak more than one language.<br><br>Let me do a quick survey to see if those assembled here today are representative of BYU students in general. If you know more than one language, please raise your hand. [The majority of the audience raised their hand.]<br><br>I hope you realize how extraordinary it is that you have been given the gift of being able to communicate in more than one language. Think about it: language is the most complex of all human behaviors, and most of you can communicate in more than one language.<br><h2><b>The Complexity of Language</b></h2><br>Since we can all read English, I would like to demonstrate the complexity of language by giving you a simple English test. How would you read "St. Paul St." aloud?<br><br>You probably said, "Saint Paul Street." And your response to this simple task was likely not only correct but automatic. But can you explain to another person the rule for determining what the abbreviation "St." stands for? Perhaps you would say that "St." before a noun is an abbreviation for "saint," and "St." after a noun is an abbreviation for "street."<br><br>Now test your rule on the following street sign, which I saw near Disneyland in California: "St.College St."<br><br>Oops, there is no saint named College! However, there is a state college, so we will have to refine our rule for pronouncing the abbreviation "St."<br><br>Yes, even <i>simple</i> language is complex. Language is so complex that we are often hard pressed to explain how it operates. Yet we are generally unaware of how complex language is. In some ways language is like the air we breathe: we don't pay attention to it--unless there is something wrong with it.<br><br>Because people don't pay attention to language unless there is something wrong with it, you should not take compliments about your language skills too seriously. The fact that someone complimented you on your language is an indication that they noticed it--and that happens when there is something wrong with it.<br><br>Early in my mission in Austria, I was quite confident of my German language ability. In fact, several members had told me how well I spoke German. Then one Sunday after I said a prayer in sacrament meeting, I overheard some members commenting on my language skills.<br><br>One sister offered the critique, "<i>War das nicht lieb? Genau wie ein kleines Kind!</i>" Which means, "Wasn't that sweet? Just like a little child!"<br><br>The sister who made the comment was too kind to ever provide that honest feedback to me personally, so I was grateful that I had overheard the comment she had made to others. Her candid assessment let me know that I needed to improve my language skills.<br><br>Another mission experience taught me how complicated it is to translate a concept from one language to another.<br><br>One of the best interpreters I have ever observed was Immo Luschin. At a regional conference in Vienna, Austria, Brother Luschin was asked to interpret the visiting speaker's English remarks into German.<br><br>Outside, snow was falling, and inside the chapel the heating system was struggling to cope with the cold weather. Noticing that those in attendance were shivering, the speaker began his remarks with the comment "Brothers and sisters, I see that many are cold but few are frozen."<br><br>Put yourself in the place of Brother Luschin. If you had been the interpreter, how would you have interpreted that pun?<br><br>Without a pause, Brother Luschin said in German, "Our speaker has just made a marvelous play on words that cannot be translated. Would everyone please laugh?"<br><br>Surprised by the request, the ­congregation laughed spontaneously, and the speaker ­proceeded--oblivious to both the challenge he had given the interpreter and the skillful way in which that challenge had been handled.<br><br>From that and other experiences with translation, I have concluded that when translating from one complex language into another complex language, the challenge one faces is a challenge that might be best described mathematically, not as complexity + complexity but as complexity x complexity, or complexity<sup>2</sup>.<br><h2><b>The Challenge of Language Learning</b></h2><br>Because language is the most complex of human behaviors, it follows that language learning presents a formidable challenge. In fact, language study is a discipline that supports all four of the aims of a BYU education. As you know,<br><br><i>a BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and ­service. </i>[<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i> and <i>TheAims of a BYU Education </i>(Provo: BYU, 2014), 5]<br><br>Let me show how language learning supports each of those four aims.<br><h3><b><i>Language Study Is Spiritually Strengthening</i></b></h3><br><b> </b>Reading the scriptures in more than one language gives you a more nuanced and fuller understanding of their intent than you can get from reading them in only one language.<br><br>Joseph Smith possessed a multilingual Bible, and in one speech he reported:<br><br><i> I have an old edition of the New Testament in the Latin, Hebrew, German and Greek languages. I have been reading the German, and find it to be the most [nearly] correct translation, and to correspond nearest to the revelations which God has given to me. </i>[<i>Teachings,</i> 349]<br><br>This comment from Joseph Smith also shows the value of having a translator who understands the content of what is being translated. When translators do not know the intended meaning of the original text, aberrations will occur. Joseph's awareness of the sometimes-conflicting translations of the Bible likely contributed to the caveat in the eighth article of faith that "we believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly."<br><br>Elder QuentinL. Cook pointed out in his April 2017 general conference address that the Greek word translated as "virtue" in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/8.46?lang=eng#45">Luke 8:46</a> in the King James Version of the Bible is translated as "power" in the Spanish and Portuguese versions of that scripture (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith?lang=eng">Foundations of Faith</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2017). We do not know why the translators of the King James Version of the Bible chose to use the word <i>virtue</i> instead of <i>power</i> in Luke 8:46. But we do know that they translated the very same Greek word as "power" when they translated it in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.13?lang=eng#12">Matthew 6:13</a>, which contains the familiar wording "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever."<br><br>As Joseph Smith found, misalignments between different translations of Bible texts are the result of choices made by translators--and those differences invite further study to determine which translation best aligns with the revealed truths of the restored gospel.<br><h3><b><i>Language Study Is Intellectually Enlarging</i></b></h3><br>The Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote, "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world" (<i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i> [London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1922], ­postulate 5.6, p. 74, gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740<br>-pdf.pdf).<br><br>Even here there is a translation issue. In the original German form, Wittgenstein used <i>bedeuten</i>, which is usually translated as the English word <i>mean </i>(<i>Tractatus, </i>postulate 5.6, p. 144). However, when talking about boundaries or borders, I think the word <i>define</i> is more consistent with the intent of the original statement, and one might even argue for the use of the word <i>determine.</i><br><br>While Wittgenstein's rationale for this postulate is philosophically more complicated than most realize, the implication is easily understood that someone with ability in more than one language can operate in more areas of the world.<br><br>John Taylor put the relationship between the breadth of our language and the breadth of our perceived intellect much more bluntly. Speaking in the Salt Lake Tabernacle in 1852, he said:<br><br><i>It is good for the Elders to become acquainted with the languages, for they may have to go abroad, and should be able to talk to the people, and not look like fools. Icare not how much intelligence you have got, if you ­cannot exhibit it you look like an ignoramus. </i>[<i>JD</i> 1:27]<br><br>Some of you may be asking yourselves, "Wait, what about the gift of tongues?"<br><br>Elder Taylor anticipated your question. He went on to say, "You may say, I thought the Lord would give us the gift of tongues. He won't if we are too indolent to study them" (<i>JD</i> 1:27).<br><br>We can understand that serving a foreign-­language-speaking mission can expand our intellectual and cultural horizons, but it has been difficult to quantify the extent of that intellectual growth. When I arrived at BYU in 2004, I repeatedly heard the question "How well do returning missionaries speak the language they learned ­during their missionary service?"<br><br>We have been trying to answer that question. To support that research, we have been testing returned missionaries using internationally recognized proficiency tests that are based on a hierarchy of functional communication ability. I have summarized the major levels of the proficiency scale applied in those tests into the following categories:<br><br><b> Novice:</b> I can communicate main ideas using words and phrases.<br><br><b> Intermediate:</b> I can communicate in sentence-length exchanges, such as in informal question-and-answer situations.<br><br><b> Advanced:</b> I can communicate factual information and supporting details in paragraphs woven into cohesive, lengthy narrations and descriptions.<br><br><b> Superior:</b> I can spontaneously deliver elaborate explanations and abstract reasoning in extended presentations and discussions.<br><br>[See "ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines 2012," American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, actfl.org/publications/guidelines-and-manuals/actfl-proficiency-guidelines-2012]<br><br>Please note that this scale describes one's ­spontaneous, sustained level of language abilities, not one's rehearsed or memorized abilities.<br><br>Looking at this summary, how would you rate your second-language proficiency? Which statement best fits your ability level?<br><br>If you are a returned missionary and you rated yourself as an "advanced" speaker, you are probably right.<br><br>Some results from our initial research compare the proficiency results of 391 recently returned missionaries studying at BYU with the proficiency levels of 501 non-BYU students who were junior- and senior-year language majors studying at five large liberal arts colleges with study abroad programs. On average, returned missionaries are more proficient speakers of their second language than are language majors graduating from other large U.S. universities. That is good news! (See Dan Dewey and Ray T. Clifford, "The Development of Speaking Proficiency of LDS Missionaries," in <i>Second Language Acquisition Abroad: The LDS Missionary Experience, </i>ed. Lynne Hansen [Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2012], 29–49.)<br><br>But we must remember that despite having developed a significant level of conversational fluency, the speech of returned missionaries showed consistent patterns of grammatical and vocabulary deficiencies--and those deficiencies limited their ability to communicate clearly about nuanced, complicated subjects.<br><br>Only 6 percent of the returned missionaries had attained a "superior" level of proficiency (see Dewey and Clifford, "Development of Speaking Proficiency," 36). That is an important threshold, because the "superior" level of proficiency is the level required for professional jobs in diplomacy, business, and higher education.<br><br>All language majors at BYU now take proficiency tests as part of their senior capstone course, and the data show that further language study at BYU adds value, is intellectually enlarging, and improves students' language proficiency.<br><h3><b><i>Language Study Is Character Building</i></b></h3><br><b> </b>What builds character? In my experience, for an activity to build character it must be inherently good, it must require concerted effort, and it must demand perseverance over an extended period of time.<br><br>Language study meets all three of these ­character-building prerequisites.<br><br>First, we know that language learning is good. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90.15?lang=eng#14">Doctrine and Covenants 90:15</a> we are counseled to "become acquainted with all good books." And as a reminder that not all good books are written in English, the verse adds, "and with languages, tongues, and people."<br><br>Second, studies show that learning takes effort. In the stairway between the third and fourth levels of the HaroldB. Lee Library is a framed copy of <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#117">Doctrine and Covenants 88:118</a>. As a student at BYU, I would read that reference every time Iexited the library after a long night of study. In particular, the last line would catch my attention. It states, "Seek learning, <i>even by study</i> and also by faith" (emphasis added).<br><br>I remember asking myself why this revelation included the word <i>even.</i> Wouldn't it be sufficient to say, "Seek learning by study and by faith?" Was the word <i>even</i> added to emphasize that also in education, faith without works is dead? In any case, the phrase "even by study" became a slogan and a guiding principle during my educational pursuits.<br><br>Of course, faith is also necessary. It provides ongoing motivation for us to persevere in our studies, but expecting to learn by faith alone is not realistic. Remember the advice of John Taylor: we won't be given the gift of tongues unless we study languages.<br><br>Third, language learning requires perseverance. Perhaps you have heard of the popular notion called the "10,000-hour rule." That rule suggests that to become an expert at anything requires about 10,000 hours of effort.<br><br>Since many missionaries study and practice their mission language for forty to sixty hours per week for up to two years, they might devote between 4,000 and 6,000 hours to the study of their mission language. By the time they return, they could amass half of the 10,000 hours needed to become an expert in that language. They are halfway to becoming language experts, and if they persevere, they can become experts. The expectation that learners will devote thousands of hours to the acquisition of language skills clearly meets the third criterion for building character: perseverance over an extended period of time.<br><br>Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool, the authors of the research that has been generalized as the 10,000-hour rule, continue to reject the oversimplification of their findings by reminding us that just spending time doing something is not enough to become an expert.<br><br>Attending 10,000 hours of piano concerts will not automatically turn you into a concert pianist. Just attending 10,000 hours of church meetings--the equivalent of attending a three-hour block of church meetings every week for sixty-four years--will not automatically turn you into a celestial person.<br><br>According to Ericsson and Pool, the key to becoming an expert is not just spending time but engaging in "deliberate practice." Deliberate practice is different from other types of practice in two essential ways: there must be established "criteria for superior performance" and there must be teachers "who can provide practice activities designed to help a student improve his or her performance" (Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool, <i>Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise</i> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016], 98). It is only possible to become an expert through deliberate practice, but deliberate practice is only possible under these two conditions.<br><br>Language study at BYU meets these criteria. The field of language study is a professional discipline with well-developed standards of superior performance, and BYU has more faculty with expertise in bringing learners to the superior level of language proficiency than you can find at any other university. As suggested by the need for deliberate practice, advanced language learning isnot a do-it-yourself project--but resources are available to help you improve your skills. So take the pledge: "I won't let my language languish." (Say that ten times quickly!)<br><br>BYU has many options for continued language study, and more options are being developed. I foresee a time when every BYU student will have the opportunity for advanced study of a second language--whether that be a language learned on a mission, a language spoken at home, a language learned through formal study, or a language acquired through other life experiences.<br><br>These learning opportunities will be structured as language programs that complement students' chosen academic disciplines. To accomplish this, our language programs will have multiple ­competency-based entrance and exit options and will offer both undergraduate and graduate instructional options.<br><h3><b><i>Language Study Leads to Lifelong Learning andService</i></b></h3><br><b> </b>Just as having the ability to communicate in another language will expand your intellectual horizons, knowing another language will have a multiplier effect on your post-BYU opportunities for service and lifelong learning.<br><br>When we hear the word <i>service,</i> our first thoughts are likely to turn to service opportunities in the Church--and they are plentiful. However, service and learning opportunities abound in our vocations as well.<br><br>For my entire life there has been a shortage of individuals with expertise in languages. A 1979 report to the president of the United States concluded, "Americans' incompetence in foreign languages is nothing short of scandalous, and it is becoming worse" (President's Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies, "Strength Through Wisdom: A Critique of U.S. Capability," November 1979, in <i>Modern Language Journal</i> 64, no. 1 [spring 1980]: 12).<br><br>Parallel conclusions were reached this year in a report by the national Commission on Language Learning (see <i>America's Languages: Investing in Language Education for the 21st Century</i> [Cambridge, Massachusetts: American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2017], amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/researchpapersmonographs/language/Commission-on-Language-Learning_Americas-Languages.pdf).<br><br>Regardless of where you serve, your language skills will make that service personally rewarding. You will get to know and come to love other peoples--and you will do so with a depth of feeling and understanding that would not otherwise be possible.<br><h2><b>The Language of the Spirit</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I would like to comment on another language that is available to us all but that is a foreign language to most of the world's inhabitants. It is the language that JosephB. Wirthlin called "the language of the Spirit."<br><br>Elder Wirthlin described this language as follows: "There is a mighty power that transcends the power of messages conveyed by words alone, and this is the power of messages communicated by the Spirit to our hearts" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1975/10/the-language-of-the-spirit?lang=eng">The Language of the Spirit</a>," <i>Ensign</i>, November 1975).<br><br>Of all the world's languages, it is the language of the Spirit that best satisfies the aims of a BYU education. I have personally experienced the language of the Spirit in my life, and I know it exists. I would like to share some personal examples with you.<br><h3><b><i>A Prompting for Preparation</i></b></h3><br>After five years of marriage, my wife and I had not been able to have children, so we applied to adopt a child through LDS Social Services. We were told that the process would take about two years.<br><br>After only six months, my wife, Karen, informed me one morning that "our" baby had been born. She knew by a communication of the Spirit that this had happened. She had just had a dream in which a beautiful, blonde baby girl had come from heaven to be in our home. She asked if I would come home early that day so that we could go shopping for baby clothes, diapers, a baby carrier, and a bathinette.<br><br>Later that afternoon, as we returned from shopping, I was just unlocking the door to our apartment when the phone began to ring. It was the adoption agency calling to inform us that a baby had been born the night before and that when they had prayed about placing the child, they had felt inspired that this child was meant to be part of our family.<br><h3><b><i>A Prompting for Change</i></b></h3><br>Decades later, when I was working as the chancellor of the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, I was informed that BYU would be hiring a director for a newly created Center for Language Studies. I did a pros and cons analysis of my options and quickly concluded that leaving my position in Monterey did not make sense. The logic of that conclusion was incontrovertible, but the Spirit kept nagging me toreconsider.<br><br>In response to those promptings of the Spirit, I went to the temple and prayed for guidance. "Should I apply for the BYU position?" was my simple question.<br><br>The Spirit's answer was immediate and direct: "Yes, and when you apply, you will get the position."<br><br>I have never gone into a job interview with such confidence as I did for that BYU position.<br><h3><b><i>A Prompting for Healing</i></b></h3><br>Almost two years ago I placed my hands on my wife's head. With the assurance of the Holy Spirit, I confidently blessed her that she would fully recover from the cancer with which she had just been diagnosed. That blessing has been fulfilled, and earlier this month my wife and I gratefully celebrated our fifty-first wedding anniversary.<br><br>Yes, learning other languages is important, but becoming proficient in the language of the Spirit should be our top priority.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I know the gospel is true, and I leave that witness with you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ray T.

<h1>nd Becoming: Thoughts from a Reluctant Grower - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
At some point after my first couple of years at BYU, a brother in my ward, who was retired from the BYU religion faculty, said, "Hey, you could speak at a devotional!"<br><br>I don't know why he thought I might be qualified for that, but I shrugged it off, thinking that if I sang often enough, I would surely be exempt from speaking. Just recently I had the thought that since I have been at BYU for ten years, I might need to lay low to dodge the devotional bullet.<br><br>However, six weeks ago I received an email from Vice President Matt Richardson asking if I would be willing to speak at this devotional. I reluctantly replied that I would accept the challenge, though I am not sure that "happily" would describe my attitude.<br><br>As I prayed for guidance on a topic, this thought came to me: "I am a reluctant grower." Ihad never used that term before, though it seemed to suit me well, so I can only guess that the Spirit had coined that phrase just for me.<br><br>Needing clarification on that phrase, I went to Google for a precise definition of <i>reluctant</i>. It said that <i>reluctant</i> is an adjective that means "unwilling and hesitant; disinclined." Its synonyms include being "loath to, unwilling to, disinclined to, indisposed to; not in favor of, against, opposed to." It's antonyms include being "willing" and "eager." The word <i>reluctant</i> originated in the mid-seventeenth century from the Latin word <i>reluctant,</i> which means "struggling against," and from the verb <i>reluctari:</i> the prefix <i>re-</i> means "expressing intensive force" and the suffix <i>luctari</i> means "to struggle." As a side note, the word ­<i>reluctant </i>is worth eleven points in Scrabble.<br><br>Am I, as this definition says, unwilling, hesitant, and even disinclined to grow? I will refer to myself, since I am confessing that I am a reluctant grower, but feel free to insert your name where applicable.<br><h2><b>Am I Reluctant?</b></h2><br>What is it that sometimes makes me hesitant to face a growing opportunity? I am not against hard work. I bore both of my children while pursuing a doctorate, working two jobs, singing operas on the main stage at Indiana University (one of the top music schools in the country), and maintaining a 3.9 GPA. No, I am not opposed to hard work.<br><br>Is it that I am not wanting to participate in activities? I am more than willing to fulfill my callings, go visiting teaching, take a dinner--that likely my good husband expertly cooked--to another family, or participate in my ward's day of service. No, I am willing to do things that are asked of me.<br><br>Am I afraid of the process of growing? Many times while sitting in Relief Society I will hear a sister say, "I prayed for patience" or "I prayed for charity."<br><br>I think, "Are you crazy?! Do you not know what challenges come when you pray for Christlike attributes?"<br><br>They then proceed to tell of the tragic circumstances that occurred to teach them those lessons.<br><br>You won't catch me praying for godlike qualities. It is hard to grow; it can be painful to grow. Thus it seems my proud and stubborn heart is, indeed, hesitant to grow.<br><h2><b>Plants, Pots, and Limitations</b></h2><br>As I was thinking of growth, my thoughts ­naturally turned to plants. When a potted plant gets root-bound, it has run out of room in its current pot. The roots cannot continue to grow, the soil is compact and depleted, and the plant is ­stagnant in its current state. When a plant is repotted, the roots are broken up, fresh soil is added, and the plant is placed in a larger pot.<br><br>Sometimes the plant does not immediately take to its new condition. I have a plant in my office that was recently repotted, and it looks rather sad with its yellowing, drooping leaves. It may take a while for the plant to adapt, to send out new roots, and to resume growing. However, in time the growth, which is so subtle in the moment, can be monumental. Eight and a half years ago we received as a housewarming gift from a dear friend a plant in a pot that was about a foot in diameter. The same plant is now in a pot just over two feet in diameter. The growth was slow--but ­exponential over time.<br><h2><b>The Difference Between Doing and Being</b></h2><br>We might say that Jonah of the Old Testament was a reluctant grower. When he received a call to preach repentance in Nineveh, he fled from the Lord, was tossed into the raging sea, was swallowed by a whale, and was then vomited onto land three days later. At that point he <i>still</i> needed to go to Nineveh to preach. And so he went.<br><br>When Jonah told the people of Nineveh to repent, they did--with their whole hearts. Yet Jonah, who had just experienced the Lord's mercy, did not accept their penitent state and sat back to watch Nineveh be destroyed. He was then chastened by the Lord for his disregard for the souls ofmen.<br><br>Jonah was reluctant in many ways. But had he not been, he could have avoided the whole whale and vomiting episode and just gone straight to Nineveh.<br><br>Laman and Lemuel were clearly reluctant growers. They were even visited and rebuked by an angel, yet seemingly five minutes after an angel left, they resumed their complaining.<br><br>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.31?lang=eng#30">1 Nephi 3:31</a> we read:<br><br><i> And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?</i><br><br>They were slow to learn and quick to forget the lesson.<br><br>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng">1 Nephi 16</a> alone, Laman and Lemuel repeatedthree times the cycle of murmuring, beinghumbled, and repenting. The last time was after Ishmael had died and Ishmael's daughters (Laman's wife and Lemuel's wife) were mourning. Laman and Lemuel even came to the point in whichthey conspired together:<br><br><i> And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16.37?lang=eng#36">1Nephi 16:37</a>]<br><br><i>That</i> is definitely reluctance to grow.<br><br>A common thread with these examples is that while each person was willing to <i>do</i> something, they were not willing to <i>be</i> something. Jonah did go to Nineveh and preach repentance. Laman and Lemuel did go back to obtain the brass plates, and they did go to the promised land. But none of them appear to have changed who they were.<br><br>I have learned that Heavenly Father does not just want me to <i>do</i> something; He wants me to <i>become</i> something. When I am striving to become, my heart will turn toward the things that I must do.<br><br>Elder David A. Bednar taught:<br><br><i> The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through the Savior's Atonement. True conversion brings a change in one's beliefs, heart, and life to accept and conform to the will of God ... and includes a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord?lang=eng">Converted unto the Lord</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 2012]<br><h2><b>Lessons from My Life</b></h2><br>Let me share a few opportunities for growth that Heavenly Father has thrust upon me.<br><h3><b><i>An Unexpected Mission Call</i></b></h3><br>I had always wanted to serve a mission. I grew up in Orem, Utah, and went to college in Arkansas. As I awaited my mission call, I was sure that with all of my language training and with my vocal skills I would be assigned to an exciting, exotic place--maybe even a place where I could make connections to later begin my fabulous ­operatic career!<br><br>I was at the University of Arkansas, where a mission call was an anomaly among my peers, so many waited with anticipation to see where I might go. I was assigned to the Utah Ogden Mission, speaking English.<br><br>I was almost embarrassed to tell anyone, but of course I went. Heavenly Father needed me to learn that in order to serve Him, I needed to be humble, and here was a small dose of humility just to get me started.<br><br>I spent most of my time on my mission in very small towns in Idaho and Wyoming, and I <i>love</i> the people from my mission! I learned so many important things and grew my testimony like never before. And that mission location directly affected my post-mission plans and my ­subsequent life course, including where Ieventually went to graduate school and met my husband.<br><h3><b><i>An Invitation for Greater Spirituality</i></b></h3><br>A few years ago I was invited to serve on the BYU Women's Conference Committee. You may have noticed the 15,000 women on campus last month. That really had been my only experience with Women's Conference prior to this invitation. But I felt strongly about the divinity of women and was happy to help with the planning.<br><br>It did not take long for me to see that this was not a typical university assignment. The committee was composed of women from the campus, from the community, and from the Church general boards. I found myself resistant to being a part of this company of women. What did I have to offer? I was not like them: I did not have a wardrobe of cute, coordinated jackets, and my hair was very long and somewhat unruly--not in the accepted style!<br><br>As the semester went on, and as these ­remarkable women accepted me with open arms, I began to realize that what I really desired was to be like them. I wanted to delve into the scriptures as they did and draw upon the Spirit as they did. Ihad to painfully look into myself to see that I was reluctant to be repotted. But if I was to become a woman of God, I needed to allow myself to become more and to be uprooted; I needed to dig a little deeper. I softened my heart and allowed myself to grow, with great gratitude to those beautiful examples on that committee. And Ibelieve my hairstyle is getting closer.<br><h3><b><i>A Study Abroad Experience in Vienna</i></b></h3><br>The BYU School of Music sponsors a study abroad program in Vienna, Austria, each spring term. I had never had a study abroad experience as a student or as a faculty member, and I had never been to Austria--or even to much of Europe. I really wanted this experience for myself and even more for my family.<br><br>In August 2015 I emailed the new director of the School of Music to let him know I would like to lead this program sometime.<br><br>He immediately replied, "How about this next spring term?"<br><br>Again I hesitated. That was only eight months away! I had no idea how to do anything in a study abroad program, but I knew that it would be a lot of work. And I did not speak German. What was Ithinking?<br><br>But my husband, Steve, who was also anxious for this experience, said, "Reply <i>yes</i>!"<br><br>As I expected, it was a lot of work to ­prepare for the program. However, the ­experience was even more than I had hoped for. For a ­musician, Vienna--the home of Mozart, Schubert, Johann Strauss, and Beethoven, among others--isa paradise.We heard wonderful concerts and operas. We saw beautiful and historical places throughout Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and England. My teenage children not only experienced Europe but learned that they could face challenging and unknown situations and could learn to adapt--including adapting to haircuts from non–English-speaking Turks. They saw the Church as an international congregation in Vienna and as a branch of twenty in a village in England. All of the participants gained confidence and grew parts of their own testimonies. In addition, we added nineteen wonderful BYU students to our family circle. It was life changing.<br><br>I cringe to think that my hesitation might haverobbed us of those experiences and of our individual opportunities for growth.<br><h2><b>How to Achieve Maximum Growth</b></h2><br>Even as I approached this talk, I thought, "Perhaps I can revamp a previous talk. That won'tbe too hard."<br><br>That was not the case. Heavenly Father had yet another painful lesson that I needed to learn about myself: I needed to embrace growth in order to become who He has in mind.<br><br>When I fear growth, I must keep in mind <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7?lang=eng#6">2Timothy 1:7</a>, which reads:<br><br><i> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</i><br><br>And also, as stated in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4.18,18?lang=eng#17">1 John 4:18</a>:<br><br><i> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</i><br><br>I cannot fully take advantage of the Atonement of Jesus Christ when I fear or when I am unwilling, because then I am doubting our Savior and the power of His Atonement. But I can repent and grow and eventually be made perfect through the love of our Savior.<br><br>When a plant is struggling with growth, we often give it a dose of Miracle-Gro or some other plant food. Miracle-Gro is composed of basic yet fundamental elemental nutrients--nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate.<br><br>What might our spiritual Miracle-Gro consist of? What are the spiritual elemental nutrients?<br><h3><b><i>Prayer</i></b></h3><br>There are many scriptural examples of the power of prayer, but I was drawn to Enos in the Book of Mormon<i>.</i> When Enos began to ponder "the words which [he] had often heard [his] father speak concerning eternal life" and his "soul hungered," he knelt before his Maker and cried in prayer for his own soul (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3,4?lang=eng#2">Enos 1:3–4</a>). He prayed all the day long and through the night, and he was changed through long and earnest prayer. If you are not sure where to start on your own journey, begin to pray.<br><h3><b><i>Scripture study</i></b></h3><br>Nephi taught us:<br><br><i> And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. </i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26?lang=eng#25">2 Nephi 25:26</a>]<br><br>The very purpose of the scriptures is to bring those who read and study them closer to Christ.<br><h3><b><i>Fasting</i></b></h3><br>Fasting is another elemental nutrient. When Alma the younger and the sons of Mosiah were reunited after their very long missionary service, they rejoiced in the faithfulness and strength of one another. We read in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2,3?lang=eng#1">Alma 17:2–3</a>:<br><br><i>For they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</i><br><br><i> But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</i><br><br>Jesus Christ fasted for forty days and nights toprepare Himself for His ministry. Fasting with prayer endows us with the Spirit and with power from on high.<br><br>These very basic yet fundamental elements--prayer, scripture study, and fasting--will ignite our faith, nourish our souls, and give root for change and growth.<br><h2><b>Humility Through Life's Hurdles</b></h2><br>When a challenge is before us, it is not required that we conquer that challenge with ease. We may not even possess the skills to accomplish the task before us. All that Heavenly Father requires is prescribed in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?lang=eng#19">3 Nephi 9:20</a>: "And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit."<br><br>Elder BruceD. Porter of the Quorum of the Seventy taught:<br><br><i>Those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit are willing to do anything and everything that God asks of them, without resistance or resentment. We cease doing things our way and learn to do them God's way instead. In such a condition of submissiveness, the Atonement can take effect and true repentance can occur. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/a-broken-heart-and-a-contrite-spirit?lang=eng">ABroken Heart and a Contrite Spirit</a>,"<i> Ensign, </i>November 2007]<br><br>Having a broken heart that is willing to do the Lord's will does not make us weak or insufficient. Instead it helps us to be humble in our mortality and to recognize that we need heavenly help to face life's challenges. We are promised in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#26">Ether 12:27</a>:<br><br><i> And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.

I am grateful that He has promised that He will stand by me. And with that promise, I can exercise my faith and feel peace and security in letting my heart become broken in order togrow.<br><h2><b>Returning Home Willingly</b></h2><br>I do have a deep desire to be a disciple of Christ.

Instead I choose to be like Nephi, to "go and do" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.7?lang=eng#6">1 Nephi 3:7</a>) and, more important, to <i>become</i> what the Lord commands.<br><br>Ultimately, I am always grateful for the growth that comes from hard things.

I treasure the lessons I have learned through challenges, including what Ihave learned while preparing this address.<br><br>I know that my Heavenly Father loves me and that He loves you. I know that He sees fit to help us become worthy to return to His presence someday. I am grateful for the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, which allows me to repent, change, grow, and correct my course so that I can willingly--not reluctantly--return to my Heavenly Father.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Diane Thueson Reich, an associate professor of voice inthe BYU School of Music, delivered this devotional address on June 6, 2017.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>Matter to Him - Keith Wilson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Six years ago President Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave a profound conference talk entitled "You Matter to Him."<sup>1 </sup>In his talk he explained that God is the Creator of all things and yet is concerned about each one of us individually. Today I would like to build upon President Uchtdorf's topic and title my remarks "BYU Matters to Him." However, I would like to redefine the acronym for Brigham Young University as B-Y-You, as in <i>you</i> (y-o-u). Thus the title of my address is "B-Y-You Matter to Him."<br><br>This past semester one of my students submitted the following account. With her permission, I share her tender feelings about when she first arrived at BYU:<br><br><i> Leaving everything you have known for the entirety of your life to attend a university that is 547 miles away is difficult. You can no longer lean on the support of your family and friends; you can no longer enjoy the safety and security of your home; you can no longer simply follow your parents. Your life is in your own hands, and it is terrifying. I distinctly remember the hurricane of emotions I experienced as I bid farewell to my dad as he drove away, leaving me standing outside my dorm with five people I had never met. I had to make my own food, and I felt sorely unprepared. Actually, I felt more than unprepared--I felt absolutely and entirely lost</i>.<br><br>My student then went on to describe her feelings that day as those of "ultimate vulnerability."<sup>2</sup><br><br>As I pondered my student's feelings of vulnerability and isolation, I felt a personal surge of déjà vu from when I first arrived at BYU some forty-seven years ago. My student's account stirred within me some tender and painful emotions from decades past. I suspect that many of you here today can also recall the daunting memories of when you first arrived on this campus. As I address you today, perhaps some of you find yourself in the throes ofsimilar feelings of trepidation or of being lost.<br><h2><b>The Greatness of BYU</b></h2><br>I do not mean to minimize these feelings of loneliness or intimidation, but they present a marked contrast to the feelings we first had when we were accepted to BYU. Consider the following glossy accolades and advantages of attending Brigham Young University.<br><br>BYU consistently ranks in the top 25 percent of national universities.<sup>3</sup> BYU is in the top five of the best value universities<sup>4</sup> and costs around $30,000 less per year than other private schools.<sup>5</sup> Consequently, BYU students graduate with substantially less debt.<sup>6</sup> BYU is the number-one stone-cold sober university,<sup>7</sup> and students will never have to tolerate drunk classmates or professors. Also, BYU has launched more of its ­students into PhD programs than Harvard, Yale, or Stanford.<sup>8</sup> Upon arrival, every student here has a church unit waiting to receive and support them. Additionally, more than 60 percent of the students at BYU are returned missionaries.<sup>9</sup> And please don't forget that BYU has been rated number one in the nation for students who are both "hot and smart."<sup>10</sup><br><br>The list goes on and on. In some respects, if you were a student named Charlie in search of a golden coupon in a winning chocolate bar, you might have danced around in your pajamas singing, "I've got a golden ticket! I'm going to BYU!" when you received your BYU acceptance letter.<br><h2><b>Feelings of Discouragement</b></h2><br>So why then does this winning chocolate bar sometimes begin to melt in our hands after we start here at the Y? Was our impression to come here misguided? What causes this reversal to occur so quickly?<br><br>Almost five decades of experience with and observation of this campus have sensitized me tosome of the reasons for this BYU "deflation syndrome." Do any of these sound familiar?<br><br>First, the size of BYU's student body is a reminder that this Church is growing and dynamic, yet we often feel very alone in a sea of 30,000 unknown students.<br><br>Second, the bureaucracy of a large university like ours can seem very impersonal and cold.<br><br>Third, the high level of academics here--which we are proud to acknowledge--can absolutely intimidate many of you, especially when you realize that you will be graded on a curve. How about this number for evidence of these high academics: this past year, more than fifty freshmen entered BYU with perfect ACT scores!<sup>11</sup><br><br>Fourth, even though BYU is the world's best bargain in higher education, $15,000 to $18,000 per year is still a chunk of change, and many of us struggle to know which bank to rob in order to pay rent or tuition on time.<br><br>Fifth, and not to be overlooked, BYU is the LDS mecca for marriage prospects, and yet the bulk of you may not even have a date this weekend!<br><br>The number of things that can deflate the college bubble are as diverse as each person and can surface anytime during your years as a student. But there is one concern that seems to show up often in my students and even in my own seven children who have studied here. And that is this: "Do I really matter to BYU? Or should this university be more appropriately called 'B-Y-Many?'"<br><br>This quandary, for most, is linked with another question: "Am I, as an individual, important to God?" The reason for the overlap of these two questions is this: Prior to coming to BYU, most of us felt God's hand in directing us or bringing us here. Many of us prayed during the admissions process that we could make the cut. Some of us were actively considering other universities and had our hearts turned to the Y. And some of us were even prayed here by our righteous mothers! Regardless of the mechanism, most of us seem to trust that God wanted us here.<br><br>So this is where it gets a little confusing. If God wanted us here, then why do we become discouraged once we are here? And if our discouragement or loneliness becomes too intense, sometimes we wonder what God is doing--why is a loving Father allowing this to happen? Finally, this quandary can bottom out with "Does God even really care about me personally?"<br><br>You and I instinctively know the doctrinal answer to this age-old question. We have heard it from our first days in nursery to our most recent Relief Society or priesthood lessons. The scriptures remind us of this fundamental truth.<br><br>Consider this psalm:<br><br><i> What is man, that thou art mindful of him?...</i><br><br><i> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>In the Hebrew text, the word for "angels" in this verse is <i>elohiym</i>. In the King James Bible, <i>elohiym</i> is translated as "God" more than 2,000 times, and so it should be translated as "God" here.<sup>13</sup> In reality, this verse says, "Man is just slightly below God." Plainly, if each of us is just slightly below God, then each of us is very important individually to God.<br><br>During His life here upon the earth, Jesus openly described Himself as "the good shepherd," and then He added, "And [I] know my sheep."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Another favorite verse of mine is when the Lord revealed His purpose to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>15</sup> Please note here that the Lord's job description centers on bringing <i>man</i> (as an individual) to eternal life--not even plural <i>men--</i>thus highlighting His interest in us as individuals.<br><br>Yet as clear as our doctrinal dictations about God knowing and working for each of us personally are, these same doctrines sometimes dim or may not be very convincing when we face discouragement or loneliness at BYU.<br><h2><b>The Widow of Nain</b></h2><br>There is one story in the scriptures that demonstrates the Savior's interest in and love for each of us. For me, it represents the quintessential example of His acute awareness of us individually. The example comes from the Savior's mortal life, specifically from His interactions with the widow of Nain, a woman we learn about in the Gospel of Luke. As with all miracles--but especially so with this one--the context is vital to understanding this incident. Having taught at the BYU Jerusalem Center and having been on-site in Nain, let me share with you some personal insights.<br><br>A brief synopsis of the miracle depicts Jesus intercepting a burial procession and miraculously bringing a dead young man back to life. But there is much more to understand about the setting. During Jesus's time, Nain was a small farming village nestled up against Mount Moreh, which defined the east side of the Jezreel Valley. The town itself was off the beaten path, and access to it was limited to a single road. During Jesus's time, this hamlet would have been small and relatively poor, and it has remained that way ever since. At times in its history this town has encircled as few as thirty-four homes and 189 people<sup>16</sup> (the size of some apartment complexes in Provo). Today it is home for about 1,500 inhabitants.<br><br>The account is only recorded in Luke.<sup>17</sup> Jesus was in Capernaum the day before and had healed the centurion's servant.<sup>18</sup> Then we learn that "the day after," the Savior went into a city called Nain, and a large group of disciples accompanied Him.<sup>19</sup><br><br>This sequence of events is very important. Capernaum is situated on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee at an elevation of 600 feet below sea level. Nain is about thirty miles away from Capernaum at 700 feet above sea level, thus requiring an arduous, uphill climb of more than 1,300 feet to get to Nain. In order to walk from Capernaum to Nain, it would have taken at least one or two days. Recently it took a group of BYU Jerusalem Center students ten hours to walk this route. This means that Jesus probably had to walk during the night in order to intercept the burial procession "the day after."<br><br>As Christ approached the city after a very taxing journey, a young man in his twenties was being carried out on a burial bier.<sup>20</sup> Luke wrote that this young man was a widow's only son, and some scholars interpret the Greek text to imply that she had no other offspring.<sup>21</sup> A large group of villagers accompanied her in this most unfortunate family tragedy.<br><br>Obviously, having a son die would be a tragedy for anyone, but consider the implications for this widow. Just what would it have meant socially, spiritually, and financially to be a widow without an inheritor in ancient Israel? In Jewish culture, it was believed that when a husband died before old age, it was a sign of God's judgment for sin. Thus, through the law of retribution, God was meting out punishment upon this surviving widow. In the Old Testament, when Naomi was widowed at an early age, she bemoaned, "After all, the Lord is against me, and the Almighty has broken me."<sup>22</sup><br><br>Not only was there spiritual and emotional pain, but this widow of Nain was also facing financial ruin--even staring starvation in the face. Upon marriage, a woman was assigned to her husband's family for financial protection. If he died, then her care was delegated to her birthright son. Now that the birthright--her only son--was dead, this widow was at the end of her rope financially. She probably was a middle-aged woman who was living in a small, secluded farm town and who then found herself spiritually, socially, and financially destitute.<br><br>Precisely at the narrow window of time when the villagers were carrying this woman's son out to be buried, Jesus happened upon the procession and "had compassion on her."<sup>23</sup> Actually, this might be Luke's greatest understatement. Jesus somehow sensed the utterly desperate situation of this widow. Perhaps she had spent the night sprawled on her dirt floor, begging the Lord to know why. Perhaps she had even openly questioned why the Lord was requiring her to live any longer on this earth. Or perhaps she was terrified of the pending loneliness that she was facing. We do not know. But we do know that Jesus chose to leave Capernaum immediately, which would have required Him to walk through the night in order to intercept the burial procession right before they put the body in the ground. Yes, when He saw her tear-stained face as she walked behind the funeral pallet, Jesus felt great compassion for this woman--but it came from feelings that He had experienced long before He just "happened" to intercept that burial entourage. He clearly had planned to be there in her moment of need.<br><br>Jesus then told the widow to "weep not." Unafraid of ritual uncleanness, He touched the pallet, and the procession "stood still." He then commanded, "Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."<sup>24</sup><br><br>Following this, Luke recorded, "And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And [Jesus] delivered him to his mother."<sup>25</sup><br><br>Naturally, the crowd of villagers and Jesus's followers were awestruck as their shared grief turned to shared joy. But this miracle was not just about impressing a community. It was all about rescuing one desperate soul. Jesus was aware that something was very wrong for this woman--someone who was a true "nobody" in her culture. Her situation cried out for His immediate attention. Even if He had to skip a night's rest, He knew her desperate situation, and He came running.<br><br>President Monson spoke undeniable truth when he said, "One day, when we look back at seeming coincidences of our lives, we will realize that perhaps they weren't so coincidental after all."<sup>26</sup><br><br>I hope this woman's experience will be of great comfort to each of you here at BYU, especially when you feel rather insignificant. Jesus hurried to the widow, and He will hurry to you as well.<br><br>A second reason why I hope this account etches itself into your consciousness is that by coming to BYU, the Lord intends for you to bless others around you. Many will be discouraged. If you can tell them about "Sister Nain" and how the Lord knew precisely her discouragement and great personal crisis, I believe their hearts will change from night to day. He cares about B-Y-You.<br><h2><b>The Story of Mary Ann</b></h2><br>My final evidence of God's love for the individual comes from the experience of a family friend named Mary Ann.<sup>27</sup> Mary Ann was raised in a devout Latter-day Saint family in Wisconsin and lived for the day when she could attend BYU and have strong Latter-day Saint friends. The time came when she received that acceptance letter and then found herself as a freshman at BYU.<br><br>During the first week in her Book of Mormon class, Mary Ann's professor challenged the whole class to read the Book of Mormon for thirty straight days and promised that it would make a difference. Eagerly, she accepted his challenge and diligently read every day. As the challenge was drawing to a close, she began to get discouraged because no answers had come. Even though she had good roommates, they all were absorbed in their own challenges, and her dream of great Latter-day Saint friends was not what she had hoped for. To top it off, the weather had started to change, and the days were wet and gray.<br><br>On one particularly dreary morning, as Mary Ann left her apartment to walk across campus to her first class, it seemed as if the bottom was falling out from under her. She felt so discouraged that, as she walked among the sea of foreign faces, she began to silently pray. With tears in her eyes, she wondered if she could go on. She questioned why she had come to BYU since things were just not working out.<br><br>As she arrived at her first class, she took up her normal chair in the back of the room. It was a big general education class with at least 150 students in a theater-style room. As she prepared for the start of class, she looked up to see if the professor was already there. When she located him up front, she realized that he had been looking directly at her. Somewhat embarrassed, he looked back down at his notes and readied himself to begin speaking to the class. Then, in a spontaneous move, he left the podium platform and climbed the stairs to the aisle chair where she was seated.<br><br>The professor stopped in front of her and said, almost in a whisper, "I don't know why, but I feel impressed to tell you that the Lord loves you deeply and that He knows you."<br><br>He then smiled kindly and returned to the podium. It was the only time that semester that they interacted personally, but it was a game changer for this discouraged young lady from Wisconsin. The Lord was aware of her. She knew that He knew about her.<br><br>I wish that I knew the professor's name so that Icould acknowledge his identity before our university audience this morning.<br><br>President Kimball's teachings capture Mary Ann's experience rather succinctly. He said, "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs."<sup>28</sup><br><br>This is one area in which, I believe, we all here at BYU could improve. Did you notice the similarity between my friend Mary Ann and the widow of Nain? Jesus reached out to Sister Nain. The professor took the responsibility of reaching out to Mary Ann. Here at the Y, I fear we have let the size of this school dictate our posture toward each other.<br><br>Recently my student researcher, Julia Brown, and I wondered about the casual interactions of students on campus. We walked the pathways at BYU doing informal survey research. Fewer than 30 percent of the hundreds of students we passed even looked up at us when we walked by them.<sup>29</sup> That's fewer than one in three.<br><br>Consider our own experiences between classes. Do we acknowledge those whom we are passing? Or do we let our cell phones, ear buds, and sunglasses protect us from having to engage in ways that might be out of our comfort zones? Listen to the prophet Jacob in the Book of Mormon: "Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and <i>be familiar with all</i>."<sup>30</sup> Granted, Jacob was speaking in terms of reaching out to others financially, but I still believe his admonition applies--especially to us at BYU. Remember, if we are to be God's hands as He reaches out to lift other needy souls, it will start by opening our eyes and our hearts to recognize those whom we can lift.<br><br>In summary, I do know that <i>you </i>of BYU matter to the Lord. Please never let our size, our professionalism, our academic rigor, or any other aspect of Brigham Young University convince you otherwise. Forty-seven years ago I wondered if I belonged here. Now, in the sunset of my career, as I look back, I almost have to pinch myself because my stay here has been so rewarding. And while there are manifold blessings from my time here, one of the greatest joys has been to get to know more than 20,000 of you on a first-name basis. Ihave felt compelled to learn the names of each of my students--even in a class of 150 or 200 and with a total student load of 600 to 700 students--because of this absolute certainty: He knows your name. And if He deems it that important, then so shouldI.<br><br>I leave you my witness that <i>you</i> here at BYU matter to Him. Don't ever, ever doubt that. The widow of Nain, Mary Ann, and I all bear testimony of this simple but profound truth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Keith J.

<h1> the Limitations of Psychological Explanation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It may not surprise you, but I want to declare at the outset that I have been multiply blessed. I want to initially mention an important blessing--this university--and then I would like to dwell<i> </i>on a forty-one-year blessing--my marriage. Those who have received this award in past years have stood here to express their gratitude to BYU, but I feel especially blessed in receiving this award as a non-Mormon. This university has insisted on valuing me regardless of my religious minority status. I am a religious "other," yet this university has not only accepted me as a colleague and a friend but also persisted in recognizing me and celebrating my work. I think this is a sort of minor miracle. As you will see in the case of my wife, I honestly believe that when we truly value and even love those who are "other" in some way, God is there.<sup>1</sup><br><br>I also want to acknowledge how important this university has been to my academic work. I have long desired to actively interface the sacred and the secular--the sacredness of my faith and the secularity of my discipline of psychology--but there are few places that permit this work. BYU, however, has not only welcomed this type of scholarship but also encouraged and facilitated it. For this reason, I have never had to compartmentalize my Christianity away from my discipline; I have been able to integrate the two--which has been an incredible blessing to me!<br><br>As I mentioned, however, the blessing I want to dwell on today is the love I feel for my wife. But discussing such a personal experience may seem a bit strange for a psychologist. Psychologists are supposed to deal with objective data.<sup>2</sup> Unfortunately, love isn't objective, so psychology's knowledge of love has been meager over the years. Consider renowned love researcher Harry Harlow and his lament in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association:<br><br><i>So far as love or affection is concerned, psychologists have failed in this mission. The little we know about love does not transcend simple observation, and the little we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>This conclusion was stated many years ago, but it is not unusual for even modern investigators of love to echo Harlow's lament. Zick Rubin, for example, believes that some progress has been made, but he comments that love has "seemed safely beyond the research scientist's ever-­extending grasp."<sup>4</sup><br><br>I won't get into psychological methods here. Suffice it to say that a relatively new brand of psychological method--qualitative ­investigation--was specifically set up to study subjective experiences. And qualitative investigators are not afraid of even just one person's experiences, especially when those personal experiences teach us something about the phenomenon of interest.<br><br>As a marital therapist of thirty-five years, I have long realized the great blessing of my love for Karen. I know that everyone is supposed to love their spouse, but I don't just love my wife; I am still <i>in love</i> with her. I love the way she stands, the way she walks, and the way she talks, even after all these years. And it turns out that I am not the only one who feels this form of love. Qualitative research indicates that there are many whom I will typify with my personal experiences today.<sup>5</sup> Indeed, I don't doubt that many of you will see yourselves in my description.<br><br>My purpose today is not to romanticize this love. Instead, my desire is to understand it, at least to some degree. As I interface the sacred and the secular, I am struck by how little my experience of this love is explainable in conventional psychological terms, or, indeed, in <i>any</i> secular terms. And I am not merely intellectually curious about this issue. As a marital therapist, an understanding of love would help me to address the problem marriages I hope to heal. Why is my marriage thriving while other marriages are dying?<br><br>My presentation today will first attempt to describe why I believe several aspects of psychological explanation make little sense of what I experience in my love for Karen. The presentation will then turn to philosopher Jean-Luc Marion, who seems to think outside the explanatory box on this particular topic.<sup>6</sup> As I will describe, Marion agrees with me that the ideas underlying our current ways of thinking about love don't inform us about what it is. Indeed, he is clear that these current ideas serve instead to drain away any meaning that could resemble what most of us experience as love.<br><h2><b>Love of Karen</b></h2><br><b> </b>Allow me to begin with some background information on Karen and myself. Like people in a lot of marriages, we could not be more different. Karen is one of those sweet and generally enthusiastic people. She's the kind of person whose only question in writing personal notes is how many exclamation points to put at the end of a sentence. She's also a uniquely loving person; she's very other-centered--very aware of the needs of those around her. As for me, I believe that I can safely say that I am more I-centered--more egoistic. I am certainly not sweet and certainly not naturally loving. I could cite witnesses from my family of origin as evidence, but suffice it to say that there is no evidence that I could love someone over the long haul.<br><br>Yet my experience is precisely the opposite. My love for Karen has lasted more than forty years and has endured amazing changes in our identities, bodies, and situations. And, as I mentioned, this love is not some abstract "I care about her"; it is the beguiled and captivated kind of love that many seem to lose after the honeymoon period of marriage. I am still excited at her touch and her presence. I thrill in holding her hand, sitting beside her, or kissing her. And if you are a student in one of my classes, you have to put up with me talking about her--because I like to so much!<br><br>For example, I constantly experience how cute she is. I don't quite know what I mean when I say "cute" here, but I know that she feels entirely special and dear to me--like a one-of-a-kind person whose attractiveness never flags. This is not to say that my experience of her cuteness is always good for our relationship. When she's angry at me, I think she's cute, which gets me into trouble. When she's sad, I think she's cute, which gets me into trouble. When she's hurt, all I want to do is apologize, even if I have no clue how I have hurt her, which can also get me into trouble. You would think that a psychotherapist would have a little more emotional intelligence, wouldn't you? But it's out the window with Karen. When my students ask how I might diagnose her, I reply without skipping a beat: "Severely cute."<br><br>And this is my first problem with conventional explanations: How can my love last so long, across so many changes, and with me as an egoistic lover? Psychology's theories can explain me when I am egoistic but not when I am truly loving her. Egoism assumes that we are all ultimately watching out for "number one." Our motives and goals are fundamentally those that benefit us in some way or another. True to this egoism, all the conventional theories of psychology fall into line: psychoanalysts talk about the ego benefiting from pleasure, behaviorists tell us how we are ultimately motivated by rewards, and humanists discuss <i>self-</i>actualization rather than <i>other-</i>actualization.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Even the social interactions that many economists discuss are egoistic.<sup>8</sup> From their perspective, we would be irrational without some type of self-benefit motivating our interactions. This is part of the reason so many psychologists assume that mutual self-benefit, a kind of business transaction, is the best we can do in marriage, where I won't scratch your back until I am reasonably sure you will scratch mine. These mutual self-benefit relationships are certainly what the vast majority of social scientists expect, and I clearly see these types of "calculator" marriages in my practice, where spouses are angry because they have given six units of love today and their spouse has provided only four.<br><br>The difficulty with this egoistic understanding of relationships is that I experience none of it in my love for Karen--over four decades of time! My experience just doesn't seem like the kind of thing most psychologists would predict. I experience my behavior with her as almost completely <i>un</i>selfish. And perhaps most astounding to me, I experience my unselfishness toward her as <i>easy--</i>even easier than being selfish. I don't want you to think that I am knighting myself here; my egoistic sense of myself is still intact, except<i> </i>for those I love. My point here is that conventional explanations do not predict or even render as plausible my ­loving behaviors.<br><br>A second problem for conventional explanations concerns the "others" of our lives, those who are unlike us for whatever reason--a different race, gender, religion, or political persuasion. Psychologists have an international conference called Psychology and the Other that is devoted to this problem because otherness is viewed as disruptive to relationships. My students seem to feel this problem because they fear otherness when they are looking for dates and eventual marital partners. They look, instead, for a match--a set of similarities--as the dating website Match.com exemplifies. Our culture and my discipline tend to view similarities--not differences--among people as the fundamental bonding agent of relationships. Even communities and organizations are typically thought to be unified through common beliefs and values, with differences in beliefs and values frequently viewed as threats to the community.<sup>9</sup><br><br>But again, this emphasis on similarities is not my experience in my relationship with Karen. As many marital partners will tell you, they cannot imagine someone more different from them than their spouse. And when I hear my friends or clients describe this otherness, it almost always points to problems in their relationships. Yet nothing could be further from the truth in my experience with Karen. Indeed, her extreme otherness from me feels like the spice of our marriage, the really good stuff. She and I can experience the same hike or discussion and come away with dramatically differing perceptions, yet I experience these differences with her as delightful. How is my delight possible, given the so-called problem of otherness and our culture's emphasis on similarity?<br><br>None of this is to say that Karen and I don't fight, argue, or generally conflict. How could you really be "other"<i> </i>than someone and not conflict? It is to say, instead, that our love disallows the conflict from being threatening. Unlike most secular understandings of relationships, I experience my love for her not <i>in spite of </i>her otherness but <i>because </i>of it. Conflict, in this sense, feels more like a kind of intimacy. It's hard to be angry with someone you don't care about. In conflict I have the privilege of getting to know the person <i>through </i>the interaction. Imagine how our world would be if we stopped seeing differences as obstacles to relationships but rather saw them as the healthy tension that can promote character, deepen intimacy, and kindle friendship.<br><br>These few snippets of my experience with Karen say nothing about other facets of psychological explanations, such as their abstractness, their amorality, and their determinism. I don't have time today, but I believe I could demonstrate how each of these facets of explanation also<i> </i>hinders efforts to understand love. And, honestly, I don't experience laypersons faring much better in attempting to explain their love. My clients will routinely challenge their spouses to tell them why they love them. Yet the most articulate and educated of spouses inevitably sense the inadequacy of their answers. This is surely the reason so many of us resort to poetry or ballads; the usual cultural explanations of our loving relationships appear to be just as empty as psychological explanations.<br><br>As I mentioned at the outset, I believe that the French philosopher Jean-Luc Marion comes to our rescue.<sup>10</sup> And, as it happens, Marion agrees with me about the unexplainability of love. He demonstrates that this unexplainability is not just the phenomenon of love but also the inadequacy of our cultural and philosophical frameworks for comprehending love. Specifically, he believes that we are using the wrong ideas to understand our relationships with other people.<br><h2><b>Descartes on Self</b></h2><br><b> </b>These wrong ideas, Marion argues, were popularized by the great philosopher René Descartes. We cannot overestimate the influence of this philosopher on our basic understandings of our relationships with others. Most everyone has probably heard Descartes's famous proposition "I think, therefore I am,"<sup>11</sup> in which he equated the thinking-I, the rational self, with our identity. Marion sees this proposition as a symptom of a framework for the self that messes up our understanding of love, that indeed makes it unexplainable.<br><br>A pivotal part of this Cartesian framework is that the thinking-I, the self, exists separately from other people. After all, I don't need other people in order to think, so my basic identity has little to do with other people or even the world around me. I am who I am <i>without </i>you and the world. And when I do perceive the world, it is a mere perception or representation of that world; it is not the world itself. When I lovingly perceive Karen, I am not experiencing the real person; I am experiencing my representation of her. And there is all sorts of evidence that our mental representations don't always correspond to the person whom our image is supposed to represent. The sweet and loving person I am describing to you right now may not be the authentic Karen at all but merely my mental image of her, which I control to some degree.<sup>12</sup> These representations are called many things in psychology--mental sets, scripts, stereotypes, or schemas--but they all function in the spirit of this Cartesian sense of the self.<br><br>An important implication of this Cartesian view of the self, according to Marion, is that we are all in a world of our own representations. It makes sense from this perspective that we would all be egoistic, because everything in our world is basically <i>us--</i>the things we control and the things we want. My representation of Karen is itself egoistic because it has more to do with me than with Karen.<sup>13</sup> It is how I <i>want </i>to think of her rather than how she <i>really </i>is. Descartes's rationality, in this sense, functions solely for my benefit.<sup>14</sup> We are, in effect, naturally selfish, because any self in Descartes's scheme would maximize the benefits of its representations, which, as I mentioned, is the assumption of many economists.<br><br>This selfishness means, of course, that I am not really capable of acting in Karen's best interest, especially<i> </i>if her best interest conflicts with my own. I am more likely to use<i> </i>Karen and treat her as a means to my own ends, which is consonant with much of positive psychology, where others exist primarily to make us happy.<sup>15</sup> Many marriage researchers see this selfish mode as the primary cause of our high divorce rate:<sup>16</sup> we see marriage as a means to our individual happiness, not as an end in itself. The bottom line for Marion here is that Descartes's understanding of the self makes truly gracious love impossible--not just unexplainable--because truly loving someone means treating them as<i> </i>an end, not as a means, and our Cartesian selfishness always makes the self the end. The best we can do in Descartes's framework is to use each other for mutual benefit.<br><br>But if all humans are doomed to our own represented<i> </i>world, according to Descartes, how do we function in the real<i> </i>world? Many clinical psychologists might answer this question with one word: <i>poorly.</i> Consider how many of us go through the day experiencing all kinds of misunderstandings with other people. This is because the parts of the real<i> </i>world that don't fit our represented<i> </i>world rarely change our representations. Because <i>I</i> control my representation of Karen, her actual self in the real world can't disrupt my little represented world.<sup>17</sup> Her otherness in the real world won't necessarily alter my stereotype of her. In fact, Descartes predicts that I will make her otherness into the enemy. I will focus on how she is similar to my stereotype of her. This is the reason people want their spouses to be similar to them. Similarities best fit our represented world.<br><br>Now, to give Descartes credit, his understanding of self and others makes sense of a lot of my experiences, and this is surely why this understanding is so prevalent in psychology. Still, the question I am raising today is, why doesn't Descartes's understanding make sense of my experiences of love? As I have described, I experience none of these implications of his understanding of the self. I am not the selfish dolt that Descartes would predict. Ialso experience a lot of otherness with Karen, but I experience it not as an enemy of my self and my control. Indeed, I willingly give up my control, allowing for the disruption of my represented world, because of my delight in her otherness. I guess I could be deceiving myself about my unselfishness and my delight, but this deception doesn't account for my other more egoistic relationships, which I apparently see quite clearly. It also doesn't account for those who experience this same type of love--perhaps many of you. What is it, then, about this gracious love that leads us to be so different in these loving interactions?<br><h2><b>Marion on Love</b></h2><br><b> </b>Although Marion agrees with Descartes on many things, he presents a markedly different understanding of the self. Perhaps first is Marion's contention that not everything we experience is representable,<sup>18</sup> with love being one of those things.<sup>19</sup> Gracious love is what he considers a "saturated" experience.<sup>20</sup> Saturation occurs when an experience touches us so deeply that we can't explain or even fathom it. Have you ever witnessed such a stunning sunset that you can't find the words to describe it? Gracious love is similar. It is saturated so much that our experience of it is more than we can grasp or contain in a representation.<sup>21</sup><br><br>Here Marion hits the nail on the head for me. My experience of Karen's love is so luminous and so glorious that it feels unearthly. This is the reason we become tongue-tied when trying to explain or justify our love for another. It is the reason we recite poetry or croon love songs.<br><br>But why <i>is </i>love so difficult to grasp? Gracious love is gracious for Marion because it is never deserved or rational in the conventional sense;<sup>22</sup> it is a pure gift without strings attached, logical justifications, or ulterior motives. Again, this feels right to me in my relationship with Karen. I naturally sense that I don't deserve her love.<sup>23</sup> Unlike the Cartesian approach, in which everyone <i>must </i>deserve the love they receive from the benefits they provide, love from Marion's perspective cannot be controlled through reciprocal benefit and is <i>never</i> truly deserved or justified. Love literally defies conventional logic. Indeed, it is so illogical that Marion believes we are incapable of giving such a pure gift without getting one ourselves--God's gift of Jesus Christ.<sup>24</sup> Only a truly grateful heart, a heart that has already experienced the Purest of Gifts, can truly love someone in this manner.<sup>25</sup><br><br>As the philosopher Paul Woodruff describes so well, the only proper response to that which is above or beyond us is reverence.<sup>26</sup> When I come face-to-face with a saturated experience--the wonder of a baby's birth, the illumination of a spiritual insight--the only realistic response is a profound honoring of and appreciation for it. This is the reason for my use of the term "blessed" when describing my marriage; our love feels sacred to me, like one of my main duties in life is to reverently protect and nurture it. Miroslav Volf puts it this way: "We enjoy things the most when we experience them as sacraments--as carriers of the presence of another."<sup>27</sup><br><br>Gracious love, then, is so "other"--so above and beyond--that it doesn't fit our stereotype or representation of the world.<sup>28</sup> It throws us; it knocks us off our egoistic thrones as controllers of our own little universe.<sup>29</sup> This is the reason we feel so vulnerable when we love. Our egoistic world is put in jeopardy. There is someone <i>else </i>in our world, some "other" who matters to me besides me. Karen's differences from me, then, are not <i>outside </i>of my love, as if they are foreign or threatening. They are <i>within </i>and an essential part of my love, even when they exceed my understanding. This excess could, in fact, be the secret of our love's duration across the span of our marriage. Our love is never familiar or predictable, so it can never be staid or boring. Indeed, it fills me with a kind of everyday reverence that I strive to honor and appreciate.<br><br>We are also no longer separate selves in the Cartesian sense. My relationship with Karen, because of this saturated experience of love, is part of my very identity. This relationship helps to constitute who I am. I have a kind of shared being with her--perhaps even "one flesh," as the scriptures teach us.<sup>30</sup> You all know about the old couple who finish each other's sentences. Marion puts it this way: "I am [only] insofar as I love and [am loved]."<sup>31</sup> How, then, can I be selfish or use her to my own ends when she is part of me?<sup>32</sup> And Marion doesn't believe that she merely enters my world; my love for her serves as a bridge to the real world, where I don't always get what I want. I'm not the king or the ultimate controller in the real world. In this sense, Marion doesn't just believe that love is required for good relationships; he believes that gracious love is required to be <i>in touch with reality</i>.<br><br>In fact, it is only when we are in touch with this loving reality that we can truly develop as selves. We were reminded of the need for gracious love in 1989 when severely neglected orphans were discovered in Romania.<sup>33</sup> Infants simply cannot thrive without gracious love.<sup>34</sup> I say <i>gracious</i> love specifically because infants never do anything to deserve the love of their caretakers; infants just <i>are,</i> in all their otherness from us. There is no reciprocity with infants, no business transaction; we love them because of who they are. With infants, an experience with a gracious caregiver is a saturated experience, one that breaks through their mental representations and invites them into the real world. Marion's understanding of love, for this reason, explains why gracious love is central not only to our mental health but also to our initial and continuing growth as people.<br><br>American poet Christian Wiman seems to ­capture some of the spirit of Marion's account and my own experience of Karen when he writes about falling in love with his own wife:<br><br><i>Not only was that gray veil between me and the world ripped aside, colors aching back into things, but all the particulars of the world suddenly seemed in excess of themselves, and thus more truly themselves. We, too, were part of this enlargement: it was as if our love demanded some expression beyond the blissful intensity our two lives made. I thought for years that any love had to be limiting, that it was a zero-sum game: what you gave with one part of yourself had to be taken from another. In fact, the great paradox of love, and not just romantic love, is that a closer focus may go hand in hand with a broadened scope.</i><sup>35</sup><br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br><b> </b>So what, in conclusion, are the practical implications of Marion's understanding of love for our everyday lives? What lessons can we draw? I ask you to consider ten such lessons.<br><br>1.Love is to some degree ungraspable, so don't get upset when your spouse's description of his or her love is inadequate.<br><br>2.Love isn't deserved; it's a gift. We don't deserve true gifts; otherwise it's not a gift at all--it's a business transaction. We don't ask true givers to justify their gifts. We accept them humbly, enjoy them, respond with gratefulness, and then give gifts to others who don't deserve them, like us.<br><br>3.Avoid "calculator relationships," in which we keep track of units of love given to one another. If we're keeping track of them, they aren't units of love at all.<br><br>4.You don't love someone so they can be happy. Love isn't the means to something else; it's the end. The quality of your relationship is the main thing, not the emotional satisfaction of the individuals in the relationships.<br><br>5.Love is widely recognized as crucial to mental health, but psychologists typically interpret it as an instrument of individual happiness rather than a crucial pathway out of our egoistic world.<br><br>6.Unlike egoistic theories of the social sciences, we are completely capable of unselfishness, whether it is love of a country or love of a person. And, perhaps surprisingly, true unselfishness isn't necessarily experienced as sacrificial, because the other who is loved is literally part of us.<br><br>7.Otherness is not the enemy or disrupter of relationships. Loving someone who is different can make us vulnerable, but this vulnerability is part of us giving up control and getting in touch with the real world.<br><br>8.When otherness is not the enemy, marital conflicts are less threatening and more productive.<br><br>9.The otherness of gracious love is pivotal to our initial and continuing development as persons.<br><br>10.Otherness ultimately becomes the spice of our relationships; loving similarities solely is akin to loving a mirror image of ourselves, which is just another kind of selfishness.<br><br>These, I believe, are some of the lessons of Marion. I hope they bless your lives as they have mine.<br><br><i>Brent D. Slife, a professor in the Department of Psychology, gave this forum as the KarlG.

In Marion's view, by contrast, "I am not in control" (Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 221).<br><br>18. By "experience" here I do not mean my own "consciousness," because this is still what I am calling here a representation and thus a reduction to an "object," which for Marion eliminates any possibility of love. "Love as a figure of consciousness always ends up in self-idolatry" (Gschwandtner, <i>Reading Jean-Luc Marion,</i> 231). By experience of a truly other (Karen), I mean that I must allow her own intentionality, her own agency, and her own "counter-current of consciousness" (Marion, <i>Prolegomena to Charity,</i> 82).<br><br>19.

Marion, <i>Phenomenon,</i> 195.<br><br>32. Similar to Lévinas (see <i>Totality and Infinity</i>), love goes beyond the universality and abstractness of deontological ethics, and it issues an ethical call for the particular other.

<h1>d upon the Word”: The Power of Wholehearted Living - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When I was fifteen years old, I worked on a sod farm located close to where the Payson Utah Temple now stands. To cut the sod, we used a harvester that weighed about fourteen tons.<br><br>One day I was assigned to work with my high school classmate on the back of the harvester. We were moving the harvester from one end of the field to another. I was walking alongside the slow-moving harvester, and I attempted to jump up onto the platform to sit next to my friend. Imisjudged my jump and landed only partway on the platform. I lost my balance and fell in front of the double set of dual wheels underneath theplatform.<br><br>I immediately tried to scurry out of the path ofthe wheels, but the big, knobby tires caught my high-top sneakers, and the wheels started to roll up my leg, throwing me to the ground. I quickly realized I was in quite a predicament. I was now lying feet first directly in the path of the wheels that were going to roll over the entire length of my body, starting with my feet and ending with my head.<br><br>I felt my right leg break under the immense weight. The wheels continued to roll, crushing my pelvis. I have never felt anything so excruciatingly painful in my life. My back and ribs were the next to break in multiple places as the wheels climbed up my stomach and chest. Then the machine mercilessly twisted me onto my back, with the knobby treads passing over my shoulder and the side of my face and neck, miraculously missing most of my head.<br><br>By the time the fourteen tons finished their devastating work, I had lost consciousness. The first thing I remember when I opened my eyes was the inconceivable pain. I couldn't breathe. It felt like I was underwater. I was trying to breathe, but things weren't working the way they were supposed to work. I couldn't speak. I couldn't cry out, even though I frantically wanted to cry for help. Everything hurt. I quickly grasped the fact that I was about to die. Honestly, the pain was so extreme that I wanted to die. I just wanted it tostop.<br><br>I later learned that I had suffered a traumatic pneumothorax, or, in simple terms, my lungs had collapsed. If there is a puncture in your lung due to trauma, the air escapes from the lung to the area outside of your lungs inside the chest ­cavity. As a result, your lungs push together like a wet paper sack. The air inside your chest cavity is unable to escape, and the pressure keeps the lungs from expanding. This can lead to cardiac arrest or respiratory failure.<br><br>Everything in my body was screaming for oxygen. In my desperation to breathe, I had to expand my chest cavity to gather air. The pain of my broken ribs and back from even the slightest movement was more than I could possibly endure.<br><br>In a matter of minutes the farm manager, Stan, arrived out of breath. He could sense I was deep in shock and on the verge of death. He asked if I could move my legs. I couldn't respond. He knelt on the ground, took my head in his hands, and gave me a priesthood blessing. For whatever reason, his words reached through my panic and pain. He told me I was strong. He blessed me that I would live.<br><br>Before that moment it had never entered into my mind that I was going to live. The only thought I had up until that moment was how long the pain would continue until I could die and make it go away.<br><br>Stan continued, "McKay, I bless you that you will walk again."<br><br>I started to believe.<br><br>He told me I would go on a mission, hold positions of leadership, marry, go to school, and become a father.<br><br>These words had a profound effect on my thinking. It was as if there was a tremendous tug-of-war going on inside me. On the one end of the rope were panic and pain pulling me toward closing my eyes and giving in. On the other end was the hope that Stan's words were giving me. In spite of all that was going on around me, I could picture in my mind what Stan was saying to me. And I started to lay hold upon his words. Istarted to believe.<br><br>In reflecting on that moment, I imagine some of you question whether you can endure at times. Can you recover from a spiritual injury or from sin? Can you persevere despite challenges? Maybe you have felt like giving up at times here at school. If so, please know you can lay hold upon words that will lift and save you.<br><br>It would be more than fifteen minutes--which seemed like fifteen years--before the ambulance would arrive. The hospital ordered the insertion of a chest tube, which meant they would cut through my chest cavity and insert a tube to evacuate the excess air from inside my chest. It hurt so bad I couldn't cope, but soon the pain in my chest diminished and I could breathe a little better.<br><br>It took a long time for me to recover. Much of that time I spent flat on my back in bed. I had to learn to walk again. Walking was something I wasn't sure I would ever be able to do again. It took some time, but, as you can see, I do walk; Ieven run.<br><br>Through this experience I learned the power of words. I learned that when you lay hold upon the word, it is quick--full of life--and powerful. The word can lead you and bless your life for good.<br><br><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.29,30?lang=eng#28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helaman 3:29–30</a> reads:<br><br><i> Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked--</i><br><br><i> And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven.</i><br><h2><b>Lay Hold upon the Word</b></h2><br>I have pondered on two words in particular from this verse: "lay hold." What does it mean to "lay hold upon the word"?<br><br>As a freshman here at BYU, I attended mission prep on Sunday mornings at 7:00 a.m. Our teacher was Herschel Pedersen, center on the BYU basketball team from 1953–56 and former mission president in New Zealand. One Sunday, Herschel quoted <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.61?lang=eng#60">Doctrine and Covenants 84:61</a> and shared his testimony. As he did, I read along in my scriptures, and the Spirit spoke to me. I knew then that I wanted to serve a mission for my Savior Jesus Christ. I laid hold upon those words. They inspired me to serve. Those words changed my heart and my life.<br><br>Most of you at some time have experienced what it is like to lay hold upon the word. When you lay hold, you take it to heart, follow it, taste it, acquire it, make it your own, identify with it, fully give yourself to it, follow it with real intent, and let it change you. When you lay hold upon the word, it becomes "an anchor of the soul."<sup>1</sup><br><br>The word can come to us in many forms: scripture, testimony, blessings, priesthood and Relief Society lessons, and class discussions here at BYU. As I entered graduate school, I was married and working and needed to get good grades. One day my professor said something that caused me to lay hold.<br><br>He asked, "Do you want to do well in school? Do you want to know the secret? Do two things each day: first, study your scriptures before you study anything else; and second, don't go home until your homework is done."<br><br>It was like a lightbulb had turned on inside of me. I took his words to heart. From then on I carried my scriptures in my backpack, and when I would sit down to study, I studied my scriptures first. And I would stay in the library--where there was no TV and no distractions--each evening until my homework was done. As a result, the following two years were the only years I earned straight As in my classes.<br><br>The scriptures include excellent examples of people who laid hold upon the word. Enos said the words of his father "sunk deep into [his] heart."<sup>2</sup> Joseph Smith said, "Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart."<sup>3</sup><br><br>What happens when we lay hold upon the word? Like Enos and Joseph, we connect deeply with the word, and it often leads to personal change and spiritual growth.<br><br>Of all the blessings we receive, do you not think that the majority come by way of the word? Yes, God can change circumstances, soften hearts,and even heal sickness. But in my life, most of the blessings I have received have come by way of theword.<br><br>I believe that Heavenly Father loves to bless us through His word. I suspect we only lay hold of a fraction of the word that He sends to bless our lives. I imagine He prepares the word like wrapped gifts for us, places them within our reach, and waits for us to lay hold upon them. Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't. Perhaps this is why Moroni beckoned us to "come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift."<sup>4</sup> And perhaps this is why Alma said the word of God is "liberal unto all."<sup>5</sup><br><br>If Heavenly Father sends His word to us liberally, then why don't we lay hold upon it more frequently?<br><br>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said:<br><br><i>Part of our challenge is, I think, that we imagine that God has all of His blessings locked in a huge cloud up in heaven, refusing to give them to us unless we comply with some strict, paternalistic requirements He has set up. But the commandments aren't like that at all. In reality, Heavenly Father is constantly raining blessings upon us. It is our fear, doubt, and sin that, like an umbrella, block these blessings from reaching us.</i><sup>6</sup><br><h2><b>Centering</b></h2><br>In addition to fear, doubt, and sin, I would like to add one additional reason why we don't lay hold upon the word more often: we are distracted. I believe that one of the most significant obstacles to our laying hold upon the word is our inability to fully immerse ourselves in the word or other worthwhile things--our inability to fully focus onthem.<br><br>I call this concept "centering." Centering means you center your attention and effort on what is currently before you. It means you do that thing "with all your heart [your feeling and passion], might [your energy], mind [your focus and attention] and strength [your physical will]."<sup>7</sup> If you are reading scriptures, give them all your heart and mind. If you are in class, give that all your mind and strength. Centering means to be ­wholehearted--totally invested and engaged.<br><br>When I taught business strategy at the Marriott School, I was amazed to see that wholehearted students got so much from my class and that halfhearted students took away so little. Both types of students attended class for the same amount oftime and both were present for the same discussions, but some left enriched and others left indifferent.<br><br>Best-selling author Anthony Robbins said:<br><br><i>One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. . . . In fact, I believe most people fail in life simply because they </i><b><i>major in minor things.</i></b><sup>8</sup><br><br>Centering helps us concentrate our power. Imagine that you have several important tasks to complete today and that during the time you have set aside to do each task, you do it with all your heart, might, mind, and strength. No distractions. No text messages. No Instagram. You give each task your whole heart. Would you get more out of your day? Would you lay hold upon more truth? Would you learn more? Yes, of course.<br><br>Perhaps some of you undervalue the power of centering. You think you can multitask your way through school and gospel life. But the truth is that you cannot multitask important things.<br><br>Let me give you a simple example. I would like you to raise your right foot two inches off the floor. Go ahead. Now, using your knee as the hinge, rotate your lower leg and foot clockwise in a circular motion. Keep rotating. As you rotate your lower leg and foot, hold out one hand, making a flat surface like a piece of paper, and take your index finger on your other hand like a pencil. Keep rotating your leg and foot clockwise in a circle, and with your index finger write the number six on your hand.<br><br>You see, when we are distracted, we lose power and willpower. When we focus wholeheartedly, we move in the right direction--and, I believe, in a more inspired direction. It is in the depth of things that you are inspired to lay hold upon the word in ways that can change you and change your life.<br><br>So how can you begin to center when you are not yet good at it? Centering is just like building a muscle. The next time you study the scriptures, turn off social media; give the scriptures your full attention. In your next class don't surf the Internet; instead, listen and participate. In your next sacrament meeting, listen with all your heart. Soon you will notice the power within you to give things your whole heart. It will become a habit.<br><h2><b>Blessings of Centering</b></h2><br>There are other blessings that will come to you if you are centered. Centering will help you lay hold upon your purpose in life, even your major. Some of you struggle, wondering if you have chosen the right major. At times you may even wish for a sign that it is right for you, hoping that then you will be able to ignite that passion inside of you for what you are studying.<br><br>What if you gave all you had to your major? What if you gave your whole heart? What if you jumped in with both feet, focused on it, spoke highly of it, and became an expert in it? You would soon find your passion. You may even start to see that your major and your classes are more captivating than you thought.<br><br>In my last semester at BYU, one of my professors was Steve Albrecht. If students in his class were married, he asked that their spouse attend class with us.<br><br>In his class one day, he taught us a simple principle. He said, "As you leave BYU and start earning money, except for a home and education, don't buy anything unless you can pay cash for it."<br><br>After class that day, my wife and I talked about this principle of money management. We felt his words were inspired. We laid hold of them, and we promised to follow them.<br><br>Not long after graduation we moved to Cincinnati. Excited to be earning a salary, we rented a townhome and went shopping for a washer and dryer. At the appliance store I remember standing in front of a new, shiny, white washer-and-dryer set. They were beautiful! Of course we didn't have the cash to pay for them. If we were going to buy them, we would have to use credit. As we stood there, Jennifer looked at me and I looked at her, and we both knew we couldn't buy them unless we paid cash.<br><br>So, heads hanging low, we drove down to the secondhand store. There we bought a used green washer and a yellow dryer for $25 a piece. We made a pact that as soon as they stopped working, we would buy that new washer-dryer set. Wouldn't you know it, but that old washer and dryer worked for ten years! Because we laid hold upon Professor Albrecht's words, we have lived debt free ever since. What a tremendous blessing has come to us as a result.<br><h2><b>Power to Change Lives</b></h2><br>If we study and pursue goals in a more centered way, we are given this promise by President Spencer W. Kimball:<br><br><i>We shall experience the Holy Ghost broadening our understanding, find new insights, witness an unfolding pattern of all scripture; and the doctrines of the Lord shall come to have more meaning to us than we ever thought possible.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Many of you have served missions. As a missionary you tried to share the word with other people, hoping they would lay hold upon it. Why did some people lay hold and others did not? You knew that if they would give you their attention and begin to center on your message, the likelihood of them laying hold upon the word of the gospel was significantly higher. How did you feel when they would not lay hold?<br><br>Could it be that Heavenly Father feels the same about us? He knows that if we will just give His word our wholehearted attention, we will likely lay hold of it and it will bless our lives. The amazing thing is this: when we lay hold upon the word, we actually open ourselves up to receive more of His word and to lay hold of it in greater ways.<br><br>Alma taught:<br><br><i>And therefore, he that willhardenhis heart, the same receiveth thelesserportion of the word; and he that willnotharden his heart, to him isgiventhe greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>When my mother was sixteen, one Sunday her Sunday School teacher taught about the concept of love. She invited all the youth in the class to go home and tell their parents that they loved them.<br><br>My mother listened and laid hold upon the words of her teacher. After the class ended, she waited for her classmates to leave and then said to her teacher, "I can't do what you asked me to do. Ican't tell my father I love him."<br><br>You see, at the time her father was a mechanic on an army base. He wasn't active in the Church. And he was often rough, gruff, and mean, just as you might expect from an army mechanic. At that time, "I love you" was not something they said to each other in their family.<br><br>"Well," the teacher said, "you have to do it. Your father--especially your father--needs to hear those words from you. He deserves your unconditional love."<br><br>So my mom went home. All week the words of her teacher stayed with her. Finally, on Saturday night, knowing she would be facing her teacher the next day, my mom found her courage.<br><br>Her father had just walked into the kitchen to put out his cigarette. My mom got up her courage and blurted out the words "Dad, I have something to tell you. I love you."<br><br>With those words, her father turned around with his back toward my mom and leaned against the fridge with his head bowed down. My mom thought he was angry. He just stood there, back turned and head down.<br><br>Then my big, burly grandfather turned around, and he was weeping. My mom hesitated, and then she stepped over to him. He wrapped his arms around her and said, "I love you."<br><br>As long as she could remember, this was the first time that he had hugged her and said those words to her.<br><br>It was then, with those words, that my grandfather's heart began to soften. Years later, when I would visit my grandfather, the first thing he would do was hug me and tell me he loved me. When I knew him, he was a faithful member of the Church. I wonder what would have happened if my mother had not laid hold upon the words of her Sunday School teacher.<br><br>When my mother laid hold upon the word and acted on it, my grandfather did the same: he laid hold upon her words. And that opened the door for other significant blessings in their life.<br><br>Laying hold upon the word is quick and powerful. As the psalm pleads, "Quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word."<sup>11</sup><br><br>When you lay hold of the word, it can guide you. It can give you a new view of things. It can quicken your understanding. It is able to change you. It is able to protect you.<br><br>Paul called the word "the word of . . . grace," a gift, a favor, a privilege that "is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."<sup>12</sup><br><br>When you leave here today, look for ways you can lay hold upon the word. By doing so you will lay hold upon every good gift that our Heavenly Father has prepared for you. By continually laying hold upon the word, you will come to know the Word, even Jesus Christ, "for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Elder Gary L. Pocock said:<br><br><i>As we "lay hold upon the word of God," it lays hold upon us, guiding our thoughts, words, and deeds, drawing us ever closer to the Great Source of those inspiring words.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>When I came to BYU, my goal was to get a ­master's degree in business administration and work for the best marketing company in the world: Procter &amp;amp; Gamble. It took a lot of sleepless nights, sacrifice, and my own money to earn my degree. Because of BYU, I got the job.<br><br>I remember my first day of work. I parked my car down the road and across the freeway from P&amp;amp;G's headquarters in Cincinnati. I can't describe the feeling of accomplishment I had as I walked across the overpass bridge to my new job. I had done it. I was about to start a career for which I had struggled and sacrificed.<br><br>But suddenly my thoughts changed. Do you know what I noticed? I noticed that I was walking. And I remembered my accident and I remembered the words of that blessing when Stan said, "I bless you that you will walk again. I bless you that you will hold positions of leadership and make a difference in the world." There I was, dressed in my new suit, headed to my first day of professional work, and crying like a baby as I walked into my newlife.<br><br>I know what happens when you lay hold upon the word. Get centered, immerse yourself in the word of God, listen, and give your whole heart to what is here in front of you at BYU, and I testify you will rise to become exactly what God wants you to be. By so doing you will come to know yourself, your purpose, and your Savior. In the name of our Savior Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>McKay Christensen, managing director of Alumni and External Relations, delivered this devotional address on May 9, 2017.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/heb/6.19?lang=eng#18">Hebrews 6:19</a>.<br><br>2. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.3?lang=eng#2">Enos 1:3</a>.<br><br>3. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.12?lang=eng#11">Joseph Smith--History 1:12</a>.<br><br>4. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.30?lang=eng#29">Moroni 10:30</a>.<br><br>5. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/6.5?lang=eng#4">Alma 6:5</a>.<br><br>6.

<h1>;s Not Leave Jonny Behind - Thomas Stone - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good afternoon, honored trustees, distinguished guests, family, friends, and, most important, my fellow BYU graduating class of 2017! It is truly an honor to share this day with you all.<br><br>Attending BYU has been a privilege and has taught us many practical lessons that will guide us in the coming years. One such lesson is to never give up, which we learned from our daily ascent up the Richards Building stairs or perhaps from watching the City of Provo as it meticulously paves--and repaves--every street in town. Another lesson we have learned is to obey with exactness, which the BYU parking police have so gently taught us over the years. Finally, taking classes in the winding Jesse Knight Building has prepared us to navigate our way through the ambiguous, multi­dimensional parts of our lives.<br><br>Above all, our time at BYU has taught us to lift and serve others. I witnessed one such act of service this past September when I flew to Cozumel, Mexico, as a member of Team USA to compete in the ITU Triathlon Age-Group World Championships. While I was there, all three medalists from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games competed for the $30,000 grand prize in the men's elite category. Two of the triathletes, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, were brothers from Great Britain who had won the gold and silver medals in the triathlon at the 2016 Olympics.<br><br>In Cozumel, when the competitors neared the end of the grueling, nearly two-hour race, Jonathan Brownlee held a comfortable lead with his brother, Alistair, trailing him and Henri Schoeman from South Africa close behind. Video footage of the race shows that with 500 meters to go until the finish line, justas the crowd erupted in applause as Jonathan rounded the final corner, the heat began to take its toll upon Jonathan's body. All of a sudden Jonathan's pace slowed to a stumble, and he collapsed onto a volunteer standing by the sidelines. There was an audible gasp among the spectators.<sup>1</sup><br><br>When Alistair rounded the final corner, he saw his dangerously dehydrated younger brother unable to finish the race. Without hesitation Alistair ran toward Jonny, threw his dazed brother's arm around his neck, and half-carried him as they ran the last 500 meters side by side. Alistair's deviation cost him a chance at first place, allowing Schoeman to overtake the two and be first to break the tape.<br><br>As the brothers approached the finish line, Alistair pushed Jonny across ahead of him, earning them third and second places, respectively.<br><br>Alistair was half a kilometer from winning gold as a world champion. Yet rather than race to the end to claim victory for himself, he slowed, picked up his brother, and enabled Jonny to do something he could not do for himself: finish the race.<br><br>Reporters swarmed Alistair, incredulous at his noble sacrifice. To their queries he simply replied, "Mum wouldn't have been happy if I'd left Jonny behind."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Just as Alistair's mother instilled within him a sense of integrity and moral character, our time at Brigham Young University has taught us how to learn and how to serve.<br><br>So here we are--at the starting line. Today's graduation ceremony marks our own plunge into the race of life as college graduates. There will most likely be times in this race when we too will be forced to make the decision between helping someone else or getting ahead. Our brother or sister may not literally drop down in front of us, but there will be, and certainly are, people in our lives right now who feel like they are falling down within.<br><br>Just as Alistair sacrificed to stop and help his brother, we can--and should--make sacrifices in our own lives to help those who are struggling along the way. Our diplomas can serve as a reminder that "unto whom much is given much is required,"<sup>3</sup> because some races are simply worth finishing <i>together</i>.<br><br>As we graduate and go out into the world, searching for purpose in our careers and our families, let us remember the poignant words of Charles Dickens, who once wrote, "No one is useless in this world ... who lightens the burden of it for any one else."<sup>4</sup><br><br>So let's not leave Jonny behind. Let's dare to be kind when others run by. Let's lift those around us without hesitation. I know that if we do so, we will cross the finish line together and make our "mums" proud!<br><br>Thank you and congratulations, Class of 2017!<br><br><i>Thomas J.

<h1>! Words to Live By - Kevin J Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended.<br><h2><b>First Charge: Be Awful</b></h2><br>The first part is a simple two-word admonition: "Be awful." Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge.<br><br>Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called <i>pejoration.</i> "<i>Pejoration</i> is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations"<sup>2</sup> over time.<br><br>One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word <i>silly.</i> In the ­thirteenth century the word <i>silly</i> meant ­"worthy, good," and "pious, holy."<sup>3</sup> Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to "innocent" or "harmless," then to "deserving of pity or sympathy," to "weak/feeble," then to "ignorant." By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to "foolish," its ­current meaning.<sup>4</sup><br><br>The same thing has happened to the word <i>awful.</i> It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word <i>awful</i> had a very positive connotation. Itsoriginal meaning was "awe-inspiring," "worthy of ... respect," and "profoundly respectful or reverential."<sup>5</sup> But as one author explained, "Since what inspires awe isn't always so pleasant, [over the centuries, <i>awful</i>] came to mean something negative."<sup>6</sup> The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today <i>awful</i> has come to mean "terrible, dreadful, appalling"; something not just bad but "exceedingly bad."<sup>7</sup> Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be.<br><br>My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense--that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will.<br><br>"Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast--in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.--that we struggle to comprehend it."<sup>8</sup> It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses "greatly marveled and wondered."<sup>9</sup> As a result, he came to realize things he "never had supposed."<sup>10</sup> He was in awe--or full of awe.<br><br>Being awful in that way has its rewards. Itmakes life fuller, more enjoyable, and more productive. Matthew Hutson explained in a recent article in the <i>Atlantic</i> magazine that awe<br><br><i>shrinks our ego. Awe makes</i> [us] <i>feel a greater sense of oneness with others. And this oneness can make us nicer: Researchers found,</i> [for example], <i>that inducing awe--</i>[such as] <i>by having people stand in a grove of tall trees--increased generosity. ... Awe also shapes our sense of time. One series of studies found that awe made time feel more plentiful, which increased life satisfaction.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Most important, experiencing awe can help us keep things in perspective. That is what happened to Moses. His vision caused him to think deeply about the grandeur of God and His plan of salvation. Moses understood things he had never even supposed before. That in turn caused Moses to have greater faith in God and in God's plan for him.<br><br>I am confident that all of you during your time here learned something that you never had supposed. It may have been an insight into a subject you were studying. It may have been the discovery of something you did not know about yourself. It may have been inspiration concerning the goodness of God and His love for you and for others around you. I hope that each of you took advantage of those opportunities to be filled with awe--to be awful. Moreover, I hope you continue to have such experiences for the rest of your life.<br><br>Unfortunately, increased knowledge can sometimes diminish our ability to experience awe. President DieterF. Uchtdorf put it this way:<br><br><i>It seems to be human nature: as we become more familiar with something, even something miraculous and awe-inspiring, we lose our sense of awe and treat it as commonplace.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Thus the first part of my charge is to not let your education diminish your willingness to experience awe, for there is so much in the world around us that can cause us to be full ofawe.<br><br>BYU professor DavidW. Hart stated it well in a devotional talk he gave here a couple of years ago. He said:<br><br><i>Make an extra effort to find awe in the everyday aspects of your life and take a moment to say, "Wow!" In so doing, your senses will be heightened and, in turn, will reveal more about you as well as additional opportunities to apply your uniqueness.</i><sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>Second Charge: Don't Pejorate; Ameliorate</b></h2><br>The second part of my two-part charge consists of a three-word admonition: "Don't pejorate; ameliorate." Just as words can pejorate and acquire a more negative meaning over time, words can also acquire a more positive meaning. Linguists call this <i>amelioration.</i> A classic example is the word <i>nice,</i> which in the twelfth century meant "careless, clumsy; weak; poor, needy," but which through a series of changes over the centuries has ameliorated to mean "kind, thoughtful."<sup>14</sup><br><br>As each of you are now graduates from BYU, you will carry with you your good name and the good name of this university. What people think of those two names will largely depend on their interactions with you. The second part of my charge to you is that you never do anything to pejorate your name or the name of your alma mater, that you instead strive to ameliorate both. My hope is that those who encounter you and learn that you are a graduate of Brigham Young University will think better of BYU because they know you, that the term <i>BYU</i> will ameliorate--not pejorate--as a result of what you do and who you are.<br><br>Moreover, most of us have also taken upon us the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Please do nothing to diminish the importance of that name, for "Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby [men and women] can be saved."<sup>15</sup> As we are filled with awe for Him and for His works, as we act in accordance with the promptings we feel at such times, His name will not only ameliorate but will eternally be glorified by what we do. I hope you make that one of your postgraduation goals as well.<br><br>So be awful. Don't pejorate; ­ameliorate. Words to live by. May weall do so is my humble prayer, which I express in the awe-inspiring, holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, gave this commencement address on April 27, 2017.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>ing of Common Values - Emma Nicholson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Your excellencies, presidents and vice presidents, and graduates and your families, I stand humble to become one of the newest alumni of one of the most prestigious universities in the globe. I follow in the eminent steps of President Dieter F. Uchtdorf and Dick Cheney and other eminent people.<br><br>Our university--and I can call it that now--is widely known and internationally renowned for the breadth and depth of its study. It is globally respected, for it produces graduates, such as yourselves, who are tolerant yet critical in thinking, who respect and honor the other while respecting and honoring themselves. My own experience with this wonderful establishment stretches over five years now, and my pride at being accepted into its honored halls is probably even higher than yours.<br><br>How did I come to be one of your companions? Well, we share common values, you and I; we strive for common goals. But like all good things, my relationship with you started with one person, with making an acquaintance that just grew and grew.<br><br>Jim Olson was that man. We met in the Department of Defense when I was presenting the work of the AMAR Foundation in Baghdad to a Pentagon conference on civilian health in conflict. We found that between us we had a common interest in the public good, a shared concern--a lifelong concern--for the outsider, for the other one in need of friendship, fellowship, and support. In other words, we found our common values; our common goals were shared.<br><br>On Jim's introduction I caught a flight from Washington to Salt Lake City, and all sorts of fascinating personalities emerged. And, vastly important for someone with my interests, I found that my new friend's work was similar but most probably considerably better than my own and that it was carried out for just the same purposes: conquering poverty, building local skills, giving people pride in their own work, bringing international standards of performance, delivering service with their own hands to the world's poorest and most desolate people, and implementing all aspects of the United Nations Convention for Human Rights--freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, including the all-important freedom to worship.<br><br>So we made friends. Sharon Eubank and her amazing colleagues led me to form a deep and powerful partnership between LDS Charities and the AMAR Society, which I chair. Elder JeffreyR. Holland--the high academic, theologian, and man of compassion--brought me early to Brigham Young University and introduced me to your great thinker and powerful teacher President Worthen himself. I found BYU and our discussions here with both Elder Holland and President Worthen so fascinating and so important that I set up following meetings in my place of work: Britain's upper chamber, the House of Lords. And in that ancient, royal palace--large parts of which date back to the eleventh century--Elder Holland became the first BYU eminence to address a formal British political meeting in Parliament.<br><br>And we did much, much more. Together--and with the backing of Sharon Eubank's refugee knowledge and the professional teams of doctors, nurses, and teachers of AMAR--<br>Iset up a unique conference cycle on ­religious persecution and its inevitable outcome of forced migration. For our first conference, held September of last year, we brought together leading Mormons; academics; the Bishop of Derby; Canon Edmund Newell of Cumberland Lodge and other ordinands of our national church, the Church of England; a Jewish Ashkenazi rabbi from a Syrian refugee family; some Yazidis--all victims of IS, the notorious death cult in northern Iraq; Shia and Sunni Iraqis of the AMAR team; plus Native Americans. We met in another unique setting, St. George's House in Windsor Castle, and were welcomed by the governor of the castle, who spoke on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen. Our findings were listened to and studied in the highest circles, and they have benefited some of the world's most persecuted faiths internationally.<br><br>But we have just begun. Our next meeting in that historic setting is this September. Our theme will be integration after persecution, and at the base of our thinking will be the sharing of common values, thus the critical place of the rule of law. This way of thinking reminds us of the need to create the laws internationally and initially, whereby freedom to speak, to move, to earn, and to worship is not amatter of whim, nor is it one bound by personal rulers' tastes. It is one which Parliament, or its national equivalent, has laid down as obligatory for all citizens to follow. I am a working politician, and I see the world's populations in that light. I look at their sufferings, and I turn to find a mix of possible solutions togive them success, to free themselves.<br><br>One absolute essential in a modern functioning society is the university. All around the globe, major universities hold in their keeping science, technology, the arts, and cultures in their halls of learning and in their research establishments. And from high-­quality universities, such as BYU, come our future leaders in all walks of life and all societies. Our professors and dons open up vistas of thought and imagination while ensuring that critical thinking is the foundation stone of learning. Even in societies in which public opinion's expression is heavily constrained, universities are granted considerable license, since almost all societies recognize that human thoughts and values enshrined in learning are the futures of their own societies. But only when universities and other professional institutions are assaulted do we outsiders wake up and recognize that a civilization is ending, albeit temporally. For example, the burning of the libraries of Alexandria led directly to the destruction of ancient seats of learning and worship in the Nineveh Plains today.<br><br>But to have intellectual strength, it must be accompanied with action. In AMAR--now twinned with LDS Charities--we are the deliverers of your love to millions of others. We think of healing in all its aspects. In working up the newest thinking for BYU and for myself in the House of Lords, and even using one of your professors, one of your academics, Paul Kerry--and I thank President Worthen so very much for allowing us the chance to work together--it is my view that building the professions is the key. Every dictatorship deliberately destroys its nation's academic and professional heritage. Doctors, academics, teachers--those are the men and women who are hunted down and destroyed by iconoclasts, by mob rule, and by dictators.<br><br>Today in London's famous Royal Academy of Arts--which is 300 years old--there are two wonderful exhibitions. One is about the onset of communism in Russia, the Soviet Union, in the early 1900s up to the 1930s. There is a list, a beginning-and-end list, of the men and women who were destroyed: the professors, the teachers, the doctors, the nurses--all of those who had the knowledge and who had the wish to give it to others. Just a floor upstairs there is an exhibition on the American fall, the economic collapse that also happened in the 1930s. Again you see people struggling to survive. In the Russian exhibition you see mob rule killing people; upstairs you see the hope of everything getting better.<br><br>I am so proud to be in your ranks; count me in as one of you, ready with all of the knowledge and experience that life has given me. I will be using that knowledge and experience--if you will allow me--to help you succeed. Call on me anytime, ask me your questions, visit me in the House of Lords, and make demands on me that will enhance your understanding of our common heritage, our shared values, and our pursuit of freedom for all of humanity.<br><br>And a final thought: it is just one person who counts. Some weeks ago I was on the Mosul front line with the deeply satisfying duty of fully and completely equipping a small front-line hospital--from beds right to all the surgical needs. The hospital was full of wounded people, full of people in despair, full of people who might not survive, with patients coming in from the front line of the Mosul battle. On one of the new beds that I had just delivered sat a miserable, tiny boy who, I thought, was around two to three years old. He was completely silent, and his face was motionless; he was not moving at all. He was with his mother, who was pregnant.<br><br>I asked her what had happened. "Why has he distanced himself so completely?"<br><br>She said, "Look at his hair." He had a shock of hair, but on his scalp were big blank patches--most extraordinary.<br><br>I said, "What happened?"<br><br>She said, "ISIL came into our house. They looked at him, they picked him up by the hair, and they just swung him around like a toy. And they came back, and they did that again and again. He hasn't spoken since."<br><br>I had one of my colleagues with me with his camera. He leaned forward and took a little picture of the boy. He turned the camera around, and he showed the boy his picture. Very surprised, the boy's eyes caught his own face, and he looked. And suddenly he smiled.<br><br>What a wonderful moment that was to remind us all that saving just one life--giving that little boy hope--is worth all of the effort that we can put in.<br><br>I congratulate you. I honor you for your achievements. I look forward to learning of your successes, and I thank you very much for allowing me to be a part of you. Thank you.<br><br><i>Baroness Emma Nicholson, a member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, delivered this commencement address on April 27, 2017.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ni Association: Be Part of Something Greater - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a beautiful sight! It is my privilege to stand before an audience as full of promise and potential as this one. As president of the BYU Alumni Association, it is my privilege to hereby confer on each of you graduates lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. I offer you congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 415,000 alumni.<br><br>Our alumni association had an ad campaign prompting us to remember our time at BYU with the tagline "Remember when; remember why." We all have a BYU story. Recently I asked some of you graduates why you chose to come here.<br><br>One of you said:<br><br><i>Both of my parents went to BYU. Hearing their stories and seeing the relationships they built here made me want to have that experience for myself.</i><br><br>Another graduate answered:<br><br><i>I chose BYU because of the concentration of goodness I found when I first visited the campus.</i><br><br>I can relate to these reasons. I fell in love with BYU at a young age, when my family lived in Heritage Halls for a couple of summers while my dad worked on his doctorate.<br><br>But some of you might have had very different reasons for attending BYU. My husband came here on an athletic scholarship. He knew very little about Mormons then. Imagine his surprise on the first fast Sunday when the Cannon Center did not open for breakfast.<br><br>Regardless of why we chose to attend this university, we all now have in common a BYU experience. Some of the fond memories that you graduates have shared with me include this one:<br><br><i>Professors knew my name, wanted to hear about my life, and cared about me as a person.</i><br><br>Another graduate shared the following:<br><br><i>One of my professors asked our class to tour the</i> <i>Education in Zion exhibit. During my visit, I realized that I was part of something greater than just earning my bachelor's degree. I realized the sacrifice that was required to build such an elite institution, and I realized that I had a part to play in continuing the tradition of educating Zion, wherever I went forth to serve.</i><br><br>Finally, here is something recalled by another alum:<br><br><i>We would meet for church every Sunday in the Clyde Building foyer. I will never forget ­watching from the long windows as the snow fell when I received the prompting that I should serve a mission.</i><br><br>Our BYU stories have played a major role in shaping us. We all leave this place with memories and experiences that have shaped our future for good and serve as a springboard for the next phase of life.<br><br>The BYU Alumni Association is really all about this next phase. Our purpose is to help you stay connected to BYU. One way alumni help that happen is by mentoring and supporting current students.<br><br>Carrie O'Dell is a recent graduate of BYU. Like you, she worked hard and sacrificed to make the most of her BYU education. Because of a family hardship, she needed a little financial help. She got that help in the form of a replenishment grant that was funded by BYU alumni who live close to her home in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She is now back in Tulsa, serving as a leader in a BYU Alumni chapter there. It is the same chapter that helped her when she was a student. Carrie is excited to be involved and is doing what she can to bless the students from Tulsa with the opportunity for a BYU education.<br><br>You will soon start to receive <i>BYU Magazine</i> in the mail. I hope you will read it. I hope you will join the BYU Alumni chapter where you live. Go to alumni.byu.edu to find your chapter, to learn about other inspiring alumni, and to share your own story.<br><br>Congratulations, graduates. Welcome to the family. Your fellow alumni are rooting for you. We love you and want all the best for you. As you go out into the world, remember your BYU story and stay connected for good.<br><br><i>Amy Fennegan, president of the BYU Alumni Association, gave this commencement address on April 27, 2017.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>crets of Life - Bradley D. Foster - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Elder Holland, President Worthen, honored guests, graduates, friends, and families, you are a beautiful sight. There is a buzz in the air of hard work and accomplishment. I like how Ifeel when I am with you.<br><br>What a wonderful day it is for parents who have helped and supported both financially and emotionally to get you graduates to this point. You have made friends, have struggled to meet deadlines, have learned to exist on next to nothing, have had fun, have had trials, and have survived it all. I feel privileged to spend time with you today.<br><br>I learned a long time ago to always listen to old men who, like me, are nearing the end of their lives. They always talk about what matters, not about what seems to matter. Now this is not an announcement, but I am certainly closer to that event than you graduates are. So for my theme today I want to use the following statement:<br><br><i>On the day you were born, you cried and your ­family and friends rejoiced. Live your life so that when you die, others cry and you rejoice.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>What do I mean by that? When you are looking back on your life, you will want to have the feeling that you used your time in mortality well, that you learned and grew a lot, that you chose wisely, and that you became all that you needed to become.<br><br>Often when people have lived a life that has earned the respect and love of those around them, there is sadness when they are gone. Those who are left behind no longer have their presence and wisdom that they have come to rely on--and that can be a reason to cry. Choose to live so that when it comes time to graduate from this life, you leave behind a legacy--one such that others will cry and you will rejoice.<br><br>In some ways this statement is the practical essence of God's plan of happiness and eternal progression for us. We have a certain amount of time in mortality, and in that time we make choices that help us grow and stretch--choices that help us <i>become.</i><br><br>I really like something the cartoonist Bil Keane used in one of his comic strips:<br><br><i>Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a </i><b><i>gift.</i></b><i> That's why it's called the present.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>With this gift of time, you won't always be able to choose what happens to you, but you can always choose how you handle what ­happens to you.<br><br>Develop your legacy intentionally. Deter­mine right now how you will measure your life when it is over, and then choose accordingly.<br><br>Today I have three secrets of life to share with you.<br><h2><b>First Secret</b></h2><br>God has given us two things in life: <i>time</i> and the <i>opportunity</i> to choose what you do with it.<br><br>This is your turn on earth. In eternal time, it is like a minute. There are only sixty seconds in it. We can't refuse it. But it is up to us to use it. We must suffer if we lose it. We must give an account if we abuse it. It is just a tiny little minute, but your eternal future lies within it. Now don't you miss it.<br><br>In the book of Helaman, Nephi described his time as "our days."<sup>3</sup> Friends, these are our days.<br><br>What do our days look like in the world that we live in? The Lord gave us a hint when He said, "It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things."<sup>4</sup> But He also gave us opportunities to choose so we can learn from that opposition.<br><br>I have learned much from a book entitled <i>Why Did This Happen to Me?</i> by Ray Pritchard. Mr. Pritchard said:<br><br><b><i>Sometimes we will face things for which there is no earthly explanation.</i></b><i> In those moments we need to erect a sign that reads, "Quiet: God at Work." Meanwhile, hold on, child of God. Keep believing. Don't quit. Don't give up. Let God do Hiswork in you. The greatest tragedy is to miss what God wants to teach us through our troubles.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>This life isn't easy. It wasn't designed to be. It is very hard. These are the last days, but you are a chosen generation blessed with what you need for these times. You have lived in the promised land, but it is not Disneyland. Throughout your lives, all of you will experience both success and failure. Do not be too anxious for the applause for the success or for the pity for the failure. Remember, the common denominator in both success and failure is that neither of these conditions is permanent.<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter taught us:<br><br><i>If our lives and our faith are centered upon Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can ever go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, noother success can ever be permanently right.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>So it is up to you. Let me add a few words toBerton Braley's poem titled "Success":<br><br><i>If you want a thing bad enough</i><br><i>To go out and fight for it,</i><br><i>Work day and night for it,</i><br><i>Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it,</i> ...<br><i>If you'll simply go after that thing that you want,</i><br><i>With all your capacity,</i> ...<br><i>Faith, hope and confidence, stern</i> [tenacity], ...<br><i>If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,</i><br>[If you determine now how you will measure your life in the end,]<br><i>You'll get it!</i><sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>Second Secret</b></h2><br>Know who you are in relation to God and to each other. When you really understand this, you will act differently and will treat others differently.<br><br>Let me tell you a story about some children who knew who they really were and who understood their relationships to each other.<br><br>The story occurred at a track and field meet for children with special needs. The children had trained and were so excited for this day. Try to imagine the parents of these ­physically or mentally challenged children who had decided to run in these races. The parents thought that if their children could win, it would be good for their self-esteem.<br><br>The parents sat in the stands waiting for the races to begin. Their children were on the track getting ready for the 100-meter dash. As the gun fired, all nine contestants began to run. Not long into the race, one of the boys fell down, hurt his knee, and started to cry. The other racers, hearing him cry, stopped, turned around, and went back and gathered around him. One little girl with Down syndrome kissed him on the head and said, "Now that will make it ­better." Together they lifted him up, joined arms, and walked to the finish line together.<br><br>To the parents, what had begun as an exciting race was now a little confusing as they watched those little athletes walk to the finish line together. The parents stood and cheered. And they cheered for a long time. They realized that these children knew all along who they really were and what winning really means. The parents thought self-esteem would come from winning, but they learned that self-esteem comes from doing <i>esteemable</i> things every day.<br><h2><b>Third Secret</b></h2><br>Never love anything that can't love you back. Remember, a distraction doesn't have to be evil to be effective.<br><br>Now make no mistake: we want you to be competitive, we want you to be successful, and we want you to rise to the top. But you might think owning things will make that easier--the latest cell phones and devices, virtual reality, and surround sound. These things are wonderful to have, but in life the real dance starts when the music stops.<br><br>Life is not about accumulation. Life is about contribution.<br><br>The world would have you believe that success is all about fame and fortune. But as we have all heard before, money does not buy happiness; it only makes you wealthy. Happiness is not measured in zeros but in relationships.<br><br>Now don't be afraid that you won't become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Tom Brady or J.K. Rowling. Here is what ought to scare you to death: that at the end of your life you won't have become who you were supposed to have become while you were here.<br><br>John Greenleaf Whittier wrote:<br><br><i>For of all sad words of tongue or pen,</i><br><i>The saddest are these: "It might have been!"</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Graduates, you are ready to launch. And the Lord is counting on you.<br><br>The story of Job is a wonderful example of the principles that we have talked about today. At the beginning of the story, Job was described as an upright man who feared God, and God blessed him. Job had vast wealth, a good family, and was important in the community and amongst his peers. Then Job had all of that taken from him.<br><br>In Job 29 we find Job remembering the days when he had all those things. His words teach us a very important principle. He recounted, "Oh that I were as in months past."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Now that is a reflection of a man looking back on his life. That will happen to you someday as you reflect back on your lives.<br><br>Job went on to say that the Lord had blessed him with the Spirit and that he had had his children around him. Describing his great wealth, he said, "The rock poured me out rivers of oil."<sup>10</sup> It seemed that everything Job had touched had turned to gold. He had had the respect of others. When Job approached, "the young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. The princes refrained talking."<sup>11</sup><br><br>Job described those wonderful days, and then he taught us the secret. Job said he had had allof these things<br><br><i>because I delivered the poor</i> ... <i>and him that had none to help him. ...</i><br><br><i>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</i><br><br><i>I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>The reason Job had all that wealth and status was because he was good to his fellowmen. He did all of the "esteemable" things that we do for those who need our help. Job even went looking for ways to help others.<br><br>All along Job knew the secret and the order from which greatness comes. Job also knew who would get him through the dark and difficult days. Job used his time wisely and intentionally. He knew who he was in relationship toGod and to others. He loved the right things.<br><br>As we seek the Lord, we should remember His promise to us: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God ...; and all these things shall be added unto you."<sup>13</sup> We must always seek Him first and not the reverse.<br><br>The Lord knows who you are. He knows your circumstances, and He will help you. He will bless you as you bless others. As inscribed at the entrance to this university, "Enter to learn [which you have done]; [now] go forth to serve." On behalf of your professors, your parents, and your friends, I give you words from a song written by Don Besig:<br><br><i>The time we had together is almost at an end,</i><br><i>and now we have to try to say good-bye.</i><br><i>There's so much to remember, and so much still ahead,</i><br><i>I wish you all the good things you can find.</i><br><br><i>Wherever life may lead you, may you go with a song in your heart,</i><br><i>and a spirit inside that makes you want to sing.</i><br><i>When you find someone who needs you, may you share the song in your heart</i><br><i>and discover all the joy that it can bring.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>This graduation day is just one beginning ofmany. When you look back upon this experience called mortality, how will you measure your life? My prayer is that when you graduate from this earth life, you will rejoice and others will cry.<br><br>I testify that the Savior lives and that the day will come when we will go to be with Him or He will return to be with us. And when He does, "we shall see him as he is."<sup>15</sup> And He will see us as we are, or as we have become. May we become like Him I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bradley D.

<h1>y and Other &quot;Wicked Problems&quot; - Eric Gillett - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In recent years there have been glowing, breathless reports appearing in the media that speak of a new approach to problem solving. This method promises a competitive edge for businesses, organizations, and governments alike. Innovation consultants use the approach to tease out new ideas, collecting hefty fees in the process. <i>Time</i> magazine, <i>Harvard Business Review,</i> and a new binge-worthy Netflix series all extol its virtues.<sup>1</sup><br><br>In the corporate boardroom, the CDO, or the chief design officer, has joined the ranks of the CEO and the CFO. Design-driven companies like Apple, Nike, and Target consistently outperform their competitors.<sup>2</sup> It seems that "design thinking," as it is known, is all the rage. Corporate profits alone, however, cannot explain all the new interest in design thinking.<br><br>In 1973 a German design theorist introduced the concept of a "wicked problem."<sup>3</sup> Contrary to what you might expect by the name, a wicked problem does not refer to something evil or sinister but instead describes something so tricky and complicated that it seems to defy solution. With a wicked problem, the situation is dynamic and often involves multiple variables. Both the exact nature of the problem and the solutions remain unknown when the project begins. Examples of wicked problems might include climate change, poverty, the Syrian civil war, or American healthcare, to name a few. For these problems there are no easy answers, no silver bullets.<br><br>When other approaches fail, design thinking offers a fairly reliable process for solving wicked problems. It values empathy, understanding, and usability, all part of the human experience. Instead of counting widgets or poring over sales charts, design thinking takes a more anthropological approach, uncovering the human motivations behind complex problems.<br><br>As I thought about the message I could share with you today, I was reminded that many design principles offer insight into solving some of life's great challenges. I believe that by applying these principles to your own wicked problems, your chance of solving them may improve. While this morning I have chosen to apply these principles to building a testimony, the methods are transferable to any problem you face in your life that you deem wicked.<br><br>Before we review these principles, take a moment to think. What is <i>your</i> wicked problem?<br><br>Maybe it is making your next tuition payment, choosing a new roommate, finding a summer internship, or even getting a date for Saturday night. Perhaps, though, your wicked problem is more complex--maybe it is a bit trickier. You struggle with certain Church doctrines, you doubt your testimony, or you wonder whether you will stay active in the Church after you graduate.<br><br>My maternal grandparents, Bill and Aleda Shuldberg, faced problems very similar to these. They were about the same age as many of you when they were courting in 1928. Although they did not have the luxury of attending college or know the stress of choosing a major, they both struggled with feelings of resentment toward the Church and toward their very active, devout parents.<br><br>As a boy, my grandfather posed with his mother and siblings for a family photo to be sent to his father, who was serving a mission in Sweden, his native country. What you do not see in the photo is the harsh poverty they endured while their father was away.<br><br>My fourteen-year-old grandfather and his ­sixteen-year-old brother were tasked with running a large dry farm all on their own. With no time left for schooling, my grandfather dropped out to carry the heavy burden of supporting the family on his young shoulders. He was particularly incensed at his father and Church leaders for the extra physical burden this placed on his mother, who at one point had to haul water for drinking, washing, and cooking from a well that was six miles from their home.<br><br>My Grandmother Aleda had also experienced hardship while she was growing up. She frequently recalled being left hungry and alone whileher mother, the ward Relief Society president, traveled to help neighbors and friends during childbirth, distress, or illness. Her mother often stayed away for nights on end.<br><br>It is little wonder that both Bill and Aleda felt forgotten, marginalized, and bitter. They longed for escape and found comfort in their common circumstances. Against the advice of their parents and the bishop, and while they were expecting their first child, they struck off on their own for a place called Mud Lake, Idaho. Their timing could not have been worse, because just a few months later the stock market crash of 1929 ushered in the Great Depression.<br><br>On arriving in Mud Lake, my grandparents found much of the land abandoned. It had been devastated by drought, harsh weather, and crop-eating jackrabbits, so earlier homesteaders had picked up and moved away. Bill and Aleda had no money, no work, and very little education, so having a testimony at that point in their lives was not a priority. My grandparents had a wicked problem.<br><br>The allegory on testimony found in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.38-39?lang=eng#p37">Alma 32:38–39</a> perfectly describes their circumstances:<br><br><i>If ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</i><br><br><i>... It is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</i><br><br>Design-thinking principles are not the exclusive domain of designers. As my grandparents' story shows, they apply to everyone. Although they most likely would dismiss these ideas as hoity-toity nonsense, my grandparents actively employed them to great success in their lives. You will recognize many of these principles as natural, even obvious parts of your own problem-solving routine because, to a large extent, design thinking is simply gospel thinking.<br><h2><b>Having Faith in Ambiguity</b></h2><br>Before beginning the design process, we must agree to a few conditions. First, since solutions to wicked problems cannot be reduced to a series of linear steps, the uncertainty found in the beginning is to be expected. I have heard this phase referred to as "the fuzzy front end."<sup>4</sup> Another designer visualized the design process in a haphazard, chaotic drawing called the "design squiggle."<sup>5</sup> The squiggle accurately depicts every design problem I have faced, most discussions at our family dinner table, and, most important, my own search for a testimony. Although the design process begins with uncertainty, a designer recognizes ambiguity as an opportunity to innovate, disrupt the status quo, or reframe a problem. A designer believes a solution to their problem will eventually appear. While the secular world would be loath to label this concept faith, the parallels are unmistakable.<br><br>When my grandparents began their fuzzy, complicated journey, they had few other options. Perhaps naïvely, they maintained enough faith to believe in a positive outcome, no matter how precarious their risk.<br><br>I feel certain that Joseph Smith would find the squiggle similar to his own experience as a young man searching for a solution to his wicked problem. Like some of us, he was confused by contradictory information. He struggled with Church doctrine, doubted his testimony, and was not sure if he would remain an active churchgoer.<br><br>As you consider the condition of your own testimony, do not overlook the importance of doubt. Doubt causes you to question. It causes you to study. It causes you to seek reassurance from loved ones and your leaders. Most important, it causes you to approach the Lord for guidance.<br><br>Rather than a sign of rebellion, I believe doubt to be an essential part of the testimony-building process. In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.5?lang=eng#p4">James 1:5</a> we read:<br><br><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.</i><br><br>"Upbraideth not" means the Lord will not find offense in your questions. Rather, He wants to guide us toward the answers. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8?lang=eng#p7">Doctrine and Covenants 9:8</a> suggests:<br><br><i>You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br>While many of his initial questions were answered by the events of the First Vision, the uncertainty that Joseph Smith faced would remain with him for years. Like an effective design thinker, he had to stay curious and open while undertaking a new experiment. He had to embrace uncertainty as both an opportunity and as a motivating force and maintain sufficient faith to proceed.<br><h2><b>A Prepared Mind</b></h2><br>The chemist Louis Pasteur identified our second condition when he said, "In the fields of observation, chance only favours the mind which is prepared."<sup>6</sup> Working to solve a particularly difficult problem, he said, "I am on the verge of mysteries, and ... the veil which covers them is getting thinner and thinner."<sup>7 </sup>Pasteur was referring to the intense preparation that precedes a significant breakthrough--the aha moment. Those moments typically come <i>after</i> a domain has been mastered, not before. In other words, Louis Pasteur didn't just dabble in chemistry; he made it his life's work. Before we can recognize an important insight into our own wicked problem, we have to first put in the effort required to study it out in our minds.<br><br>Bill and Aleda couldn't dabble in farm work either. They had to show up for work seven days a week, no excuses. Dependent on favorable weather and a small herd of farm animals, they had to be all in.<br><br>With a slight change, could we not adapt the concept of a prepared mind to testimony and the spiritual realm? The work of building testimony comes through the everyday activities of Church membership--home teaching, serving as the ward nursery leader, personal prayer, and study. Chance dictates that if we choose to <i>engage</i> in the work of the Church rather than <i>dabble</i> in it, our minds will be prepared to recognize the Spirit's confirmation.<br><h2><b>Line upon Line</b></h2><br>For my grandparents, their first steps together were tentative. After living and working in Mud Lake with extended family during their first year of marriage, Bill and Aleda decided to stay. One day while twenty miles out on the desert, my grandfather found a fixer-upper--an old, two-room house on an abandoned homestead. With eight borrowed horses, he and a friend hoisted the house up and put it on two sleds and dragged it back twenty miles across the frozen desert. Later, when the family had outgrown that house, construction began on a new one. Before the house was finished, however, World War II broke out, and building materials were rationed. The family moved into the basement, where they lived for ten years until the house could be finished.<br><br>Whether they knew it or not, my grandparents were demonstrating another design principle. The term <i>heuristic</i> roughly translates to "find" or "discover." It implies problem solving by active experimentation through a pattern of trial and error. In other words, fake it until you make it.<br><br>Bill and Aleda built their house line upon line as resources became available. For us, faced with a similar problem, it doesn't really matter sometimes what your first step is. The important thing is that you have taken one. When things don't go as planned, taking a single step can cause self-doubt, fear, and paralysis to fade. Your confidence will increase, and another step will then seem possible.<br><br>This process is described in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p29">2Nephi 28:30</a>, when the Lord said:<br><br><i>I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn ­wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.</i><br><br>A cognitive scientist referred to this process as "incremental development."<sup>8</sup> We make our best guess based on the knowledge we have at the time and then move forward.<br><br>For a designer, the process looks something like this: We have an idea and start with a <i>thumbnail</i> sketch. Most of the time we fail. A wise designer shared this thought: "Fail early to succeed sooner."<sup>9</sup> After a slight adjustment, based on our first experience, we try again. This time we call it a <i>rough comp.</i> Again the process continues line upon line, sketch after sketch, as we make gradual adjustments. At some point one of our ideas bears fruit, and something interesting starts to happen. An idea takes shape and begins to appear. We call it a <i>tight comp.</i> Although not perfect, our idea improves as we continue to refine until suddenly we are getting somewhere and have a <i>final comp.</i><br><br>With no stable income, Bill and Aleda traded their extra eggs and butter to a local farmer for what they called "bum lambs." Since the lambs' mothers had died during birth and other ewes would not accept them, bum lambs were sometimes left to starve because they required constant attention. Bill and Aleda woke every two hours to hand-feed the lambs from a pop bottle filled with cow's milk.<br><br>In the midst of these struggles they found refuge in the friendship of other Church members facing similar challenges. As more children came and hearts began to soften, they began to participate in activities with local branch members. Line upon line, precept upon precept, their fragile testimonies grew as they planted small seeds in their hearts:<br><br><i>If ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye donot cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p27">Alma 32:28</a>]<br><br>As a fourteen-year-old boy, Joseph Smith had no idea what he was getting himself into when he inquired of the Lord "which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.18?lang=eng#17">Joseph Smith--History 1:18</a>). Joseph said, "It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.14?lang=eng#13">Joseph Smith--History 1:14</a>).<br><br>In his anxiety, Joseph had taken his first shaky step without knowing where it would lead. Then he waited for further direction. He was proceeding heuristically--he began with a thumbnail sketch. After years of building line upon line, he eventually restored the keys and the authority and the organization that brings us here today.<br><br>Now, if you are like me, comparing my own experience and spiritual maturity at age fourteen to Joseph Smith's is, well, a little awkward. I don't see much correlation. But I take great comfort in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.11,12?lang=eng#10">Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–12</a>, which explains that gifts of the Spirit are given to each of us in different ways:<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i><br><br>This scripture offers reassurance that I don't have to measure up to a prophet. My spiritual gifts and small steps toward building a testimony will be different than his and different than yours. We all start in different places, and the Lord will meet us wherever we are.<br><br>Alma invited us to begin<br><br><i>an experiment upon my words, and exercise a ­particle </i><i>of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to </i><i>believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27?lang=eng#p26">Alma 32:27</a>]<br><h2><b>Divergent Gospel Thinking</b></h2><br>My favorite part of the design process is the "what if" or ideation phase of design thinking. Curiosity and an ability to generate many ideas is a key characteristic of a design thinker. In the words of the chemist and author Linus Pauling, "If you want to have good ideas, you must have <i>many</i> ideas."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Divergent thinking means thinking inside, outside, and under the box. Designers may change their perspective, reframe the problem, or challenge a widely held assumption. Using active methods that flip, invert, or reverse, they work to disrupt conventional ways of thinking.<br><br>One of my favorite divergent thinking methods is called <i>bisociation.</i><sup>11</sup> More commonly known as a mash-up, it forces together two unrelated domains in an effort to find an unexpected combination. Your experience at BYU is an example of a mash-up. You could all receive an excellent education at another university, but instead you are combining a rigorous study of your major (one domain) with matters of faith (another domain). The hope is that something innovative will result from this unique combination. The smartphone in your hand is also an example of bisociative thinking; it is a big, beautiful, addictive mash-up of many technologies.<br><br>Bill and Aleda perfected the mash-up by ­thinking divergently with humor and grace. When a family member needed a new dress, they went to the mill with Aleda to choose a flour sack. When the sack was empty, it was dismantled and sewn into their new dress. Aleda saved every scrap of fabric, no matter how worn. She remade tattered coats to fit smaller family members, turned Grandpa's old ties into what is called a crazy quilt, and braided the leftover scraps into rugs. When Grandma got her hands on a surplus parachute after the war, she was giddy about repurposing the fancy new fabric called nylon. Spreading out the parachute on the living room floor, she began to cut out patterns for all of her children, then for all of her nieces, and, finally, for all of the neighbors. Never mind that the nylon was hot and itchy, everyone was going to have a new blouse.<br><br>Not to be outdone, Grandpa's bum lambs grew into a mighty flock. During the harvest, lambing, and grazing seasons, he often hired extra farmhands and knew exactly where to find them. As a very tall deputy sheriff, he was in charge of crowd control at the local dance hall on Saturday night. His billy club knew exactly where to land when the drunken sheepherders got out of hand. Then, on the next day, the Sabbath, he was the local bishop. In a beautiful mash-up of gospel teaching, farm work, and law enforcement, he took the <i>human</i> bum lambs into his home, his fields, and his ward. Many received their first introduction tothe gospel through Brother Bill.<br><br>My grandparents also frequently prayed over their flocks and fields. For them, mashing together work and worship came naturally. While most of us no longer work in the fields or with the flocks, the principle is still valid. We can ask for divine guidance in any aspect of our lives--home, school, or family life.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith is also an excellent example of a divergent thinker. The founding story of the Church reveals him to be a radical thinker who challenged long-held assumptions, questioned authority, and gave voice to highly divergent ideas. I find it slightly ironic that divergent thinking, questioning, or rethinking the status quo may appear to some as antithetical to Church culture. Itis true that as small children we learn to sing:<br><br><i>Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,</i><br><i>Follow the prophet; don't go astray.</i><br><i>Follow the prophet, follow the prophet,</i><br><i>Follow the prophet; he knows the way.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Yet the principle of obedience is distinct, complementary, and compatible with the principle of divergent thinking. In my experience, the most effective and obedient home or visiting teachers are the ones who break from the standard script. They use creativity to serve the needs of their families.<br><br>Thinking divergently about your testimony offers the chance to escape the familiar ruts and tired patterns of Church membership. If Church life is stale, it is time to disrupt your routine. Try home teaching on the <i>first</i> day of the month. Say one prayer without resorting to vain repetition. Sing harmony this Sunday instead of the melody, and do it as loud as you dare. Rather than say you know the Church is true when you might not, bear your testimony of a single point of doctrine that you do know is true.<br><h2><b>Prototype Early to Succeed Sooner</b></h2><br>After hovering in the ideation phase for as long as possible, we eventually converge upon our best ideas in the prototype and testing phase. Learning from mistakes and failures, we apply the knowledge to our next iteration; consequently, the veil gets thinner. By its very nature a prototype signifies a work in progress and implies that we will fail. To the experienced design thinker, failure is only temporary; it is simply part of the process. Henry Ford said, "Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again."<sup>13</sup><br><br>In his journal Joseph Smith described himself as "a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else."<sup>14</sup><br><br>What did Joseph mean? He was undergoing user testing. His ideas were in the rapid proto­typing department. He was a work in progress.<br><br>After the Lord has shown you line upon line, precept upon precept, He promises to "try you and prove you herewith" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.12?lang=eng#p11">D&amp;amp;C 98:12</a>). Bill's growth in the Church came incrementally. His leadership skills were prototyped and tested as heserved as the first presiding elder, branch ­president, and finally bishop of Mud Lake--a position he held for ten years. When the time finally came to build a chapel, the work fell to local ward members. Since they were all farmers, they could only work on the building during the cold winter months. As the building neared completion, a date for its dedication was set.<br><br>But in the rush to finish, my grandfather realized in horror that they had forgotten to budget for chairs or pews, and the congregation was completely out of money. Faced with the approaching deadline, he remembered a coffee can sitting on the top shelf in his kitchen at home. To earn money for new winter coats, the children had cared for a new crop of bum lambs all summer and had just sold them at market. The tin can contained all their hard-earned money. The Shuldberg family quietly took the can down, consecrated their offering to the Lord, and bought chairs for the new chapel.<br><br>With their prototyping and test complete, a promised blessing now awaited them. Aleda made over their old winter coats and they attended the dedication, sitting in new chairs that others barely noticed. On the day of the dedication, the apostle Joseph F. Merrill came from Salt Lake City to offer the dedicatory prayer. Unaware that the farmers usually ran out of irrigation water long before the growing season was over, he blessed the stunned members that there would always be sufficient water for their crops. Shortly thereafter one of the largest underground aquifers in the United States was discovered below Mud Lake.<br><br>In the words of Alma:<br><br><i>And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet ...; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.42?lang=eng#p41">Alma 32:42</a>]<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>By applying basic principles of design and gospel thinking, we can accept Alma's advice to experiment upon the word. Like the braided rug made with Aleda's scraps of fabric, a testimony only becomes durable and resilient when the small, individual experiences of gospel living are woven together. What was once discarded, worn, and insignificant on its own can offer great strength and comfort in the face of wicked problems.<br><br>So when the trial of your faith or any other wicked problem comes, remember to do the following:<br><ul><br> 	<li>Embrace doubt and uncertainty as essential elements in problem solving. Let them motivate you to seek greater understanding.</li><br> 	<li>Remember that a testimony as well as knowledge are built line upon line. Rather than focusing on what may seem like an unreachable goal, incremental development comes from small, well-placed steps.</li><br> 	<li>If chance favors the prepared mind, your preparation will come through <i>immersing</i> yourself in Church life rather than through <i>dabbling</i> in it.</li><br> 	<li>If gospel living has become routine and ­uninspiring or if you feel stuck with a problem, look to change your perspective through divergent gospel thinking.</li><br> 	<li>Finally, growth in your testimony comes only through the tests and trials of life. Prototype early and often to succeed sooner.</li><br></ul><br>From my own personal experience, if you have even a desire to believe, the seed of testimony can grow and take root within your heart. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Eric Gillett, chair of the BYU Department of Design, delivered this devotional address on April11, 2017.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>upon the Lord: The Antidote to Uncertainty - Erin Holmes - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am very grateful for the opportunity I have to speak with you today. I would like to begin with a scripture in Ecclesiastes 9:11:<br><br><i>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; </i><b><i>but time and chance happeneth to them all.</i></b>[emphasis added]<br><br>I ponder this scripture each time I have a conversation with someone who didn't get into the graduate program they applied to, doesn't know what job to take, came home from their mission early, or has had other unexpected experiences. As I listen to their stories, my mind returns to that scripture and the reality that "time and chance happeneth to [us] all."<br><br>Today I would like to explore this scripture with you, but I suggest that another way of talking about time and chance is to use the word <i>uncertainty.</i><br><h2><b>Uncertainty as a Core Human Experience</b></h2><br>Though the sources of your uncertainty will likely differ from mine, I believe this scripture in Ecclesiastes speaks the truth. No one will be immune from uncertainty or from the struggle, questioning, heartache, and pain that may ­accompany it.<br><br>Uncertainty has many faces. It includes questions, doubts, ambiguity, and the discovery that persons (or things) are not quite what we expected. In essence, uncertainty is a reflection of the gap between our desire for the ideal and our experience of reality. The ideal represents how we think things ought to or should be; reality is how things actually are. Though we live our lives in the real world, our dreams and goals are often reflected in ideals. When we experience "a gap between the ideal and the real,"<sup>1</sup> we experience uncertainty.<br><br>In some of my research I have studied this gap for women transitioning to parenthood. My colleagues and I have focused our attention on what new mothers thought their ideal work situations would be versus what their real work situations were. We defined work situations broadly, including opportunities to stay home, to combine work and family, or to combine school and family. The majority of the mothers in our sample (more than 70 percent) experienced a gap between what they believed to be ideal and what their actual work and family situation was.<sup>2</sup> I tell you this to exemplify the claim in Ecclesiastes that "chance happeneth to themall."<br><h2><b>Uncertainty Challenges Us</b></h2><br>My colleagues and I also discovered that the greater the gap, the higher the likelihood that a mother would experience depression. I think this finding reflects something else about uncertainty: gaps between our ideals and our real circumstances challenge us. When reality hits or when things don't go as planned, we may struggle.<br><br>About two and a half years ago, after many years of hoping another child would come to our family, my husband and I discovered we were pregnant. Even our children had been hoping we would have another baby. They had been praying in family prayer for a new brother or sister, and my son told me he had dreamt of a new baby coming to our family. Because of their prayers, we told our children about the pregnancy right away, thinking it would reaffirm their faith and shore up their testimonies.<br><br>Unexpectedly, about ten weeks into the pregnancy, we lost that baby. The pregnancy had felt like such a miraculous gift after so many years of waiting; losing that baby felt like God was taking the gift away.<br><br>The loss left me with many unanswered questions and much uncertainty. Loss was not a new experience for me, but somehow this loss shook me to my core. Frankly, I didn't know if I could hope for another child; I didn't know if I could trust God the way I had before this loss. I felt like somehow I had failed God--or maybe He had failed me. This was a time of uncertainty. It reflected a gap in my own life between the ideal (a fertile body, a healthy pregnancy, and a healthy baby) and the real (infertility and a miscarriage).<br><br>Uncertainty can be painful.<br><br>If uncertainty is inevitable and if it can be so challenging, what do we do about it? Elder RobertD. Hales taught:<br><br><i>As we ask these questions, we realize that the purpose of our life on earth is to grow, develop, and be strengthened through our own experiences. How do we do this? The scriptures give us an answer in one simple phrase: we "wait upon the Lord" </i>[Psalm 123:2].<sup>3</sup><br><br>I would like to spend the remainder of this address talking with you about how we can put Elder Hales's insight to use in our own lives by waiting upon the Lord during times of uncertainty.<br><h2><b>A Study on Waiting: Four Principles</b></h2><br>One of the most beautiful scriptures on waiting upon the Lord is found in Isaiah 40. Listen to these promises:<br><br><i>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.</i><br><br><i> He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.</i><br><br><i> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</i><br><br><i> But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br><i> </i>Because the Lord "fainteth not, neither is weary," He will be the source of our strength. Notice Isaiah did not say that you will find the Lord right away or that He will answer all of your questions right now. He did promise, however, that as you wait upon the Lord, you will have the capacity to endure life's uncertainties.<br><br>As I have turned to scriptures like this one for answers and have reflected on my own experiences with uncertainty, I have discovered four basic principles that help us wait upon the Lord. I believe this waiting is the antidote for uncertainty.<br><br>First, waiting includes actively seeking God. Aswe seek, we must trust that we will find Him.<br><br>Second, waiting includes trying to understand God's plan for us.<br><br>Third, while waiting, we can choose faith and hope.<br><br>Fourth, as we struggle in the waiting, we can find reassurance in God's love for us.<br><h3><b><i>First Principle: We Must Actively Seek God to Find Him</i></b></h3><br>First, we must actively seek God. As we seek Him, we must trust that we will find Him. Here are two scriptures that form the foundation of this principle.<br><br>The first is found in Isaiah 8:17: "And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him."<br><br>The second is found in Jeremiah 29:13: "And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart."<br><br>If we could have a conversation with each other right now, I would want to hear your stories about times when you felt the Lord was hiding and you had to look for Him or times when you felt you searched for Him with all your heart. Usually we talk about searching with our eyes, so I am intrigued by the concept of searching with our heart.<br><br>Since we can't have that conversation in this setting, I will share one of my stories with you. My miscarriage was not my first experience with uncertainty. One of my first major bouts with uncertainty began when I was in my early twenties. My husband, Chris, and I were recently married and were hoping to have children. As months passed, and then years passed, we discovered that it would not be easy for us to get pregnant. So we waited. In the waiting, we filled our lives with graduate studies, Church service, and friendships. We had a good life. But our struggle with infertility was deeply painful to me. There was so much uncertainty in that waiting. Would we ever discover why we were unable to have children? Would we finally be able to welcome a child into our family? What should I do with myself while Iwaited? Work? Get a PhD?<br><br>This uncertainty and waiting invited me to regularly turn to God for answers. I was discovering the first principle of waiting upon the Lord: I had to actively seek God in order to find Him. To seek Him, I studied the scriptures. I studied teachings of prophets. I attended ward meetings. I went to the temple. I magnified my calling. I prayed fervently. Despite my seeking, the answers did not come swiftly.<br><br>I remember sitting with my ward in Newark, Delaware, on a day when I felt like the heavens were particularly silent. (Remember that scripture in which Isaiah referred to the Lord hiding His face?) One of our congregational hymns that Sunday was "I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go." We sang these words:<br><br><i>But if, by a still, small voice he calls</i><br><i>To paths that I do not know,</i><br><i>I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:</i><br><i>I'll go where you want me to go.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Those lyrics represented my uncertainty--those "paths that I do not know"--and through the other lyrics of that hymn, I began to receive an answer to my prayers. In the midst of my uncertainty and longing to know, I had to put my hand in the Lord's hand. I had to let Him lead me.<br><br>As we continued singing the hymn, I received a distinct impression that the Lord wanted me to go deeper into darkness and uncertainty on an unknown journey. I felt impressed that the journey would include further graduate studies, but Ialso felt that I would not immediately receive the answers I sought about having children. Instead, I had to keep moving forward. I had to keep waiting and seeking. In such darkness, I couldn't seek the Lord with my eyes alone. I had to seek Him with my heart. What a deeply humbling thing it is to wait upon the Lord. Though I did not receive all of the answers I sought, I was finding the Lord, and He was helping me feel His presence in my life.<br><br>So I kept moving forward. Later in that same school year I attended the general Young Women meeting. Many of the talks that ­evening focused on personal revelation. The ­closing address was given by President GordonB. Hinckley. This was a significant talk for me. President Hinckley taught:<br><br><i>Find purpose in your life. Choose the things you would like to do, and educate yourselves to be effective in their pursuit. .. . In this day and time, a girl needs an education. She needs the means and skills by which to earn a living. . . .</i><br><br><i> Study your options. Pray to the Lord earnestly for direction. Then pursue your course with resolution.</i><br><br><i> The whole gamut of human endeavor is now open to women. There is not anything that you cannot do if you will set your mind to it. You can include in the dream of the woman you would like to be a picture of one qualified to serve society and make a significant contribution to the world of which she will be a part.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>In this message the Lord offered me a vision through His prophet of the kind of future that could be mine. Again, I received no particular answer to my lingering question about when or whether I would have children. My uncertainty was not resolved, nor was my waiting over. Yet Iwas reminded that "the whole gamut of human endeavor" was open to me. Regardless of whether I became a mother, there could be a work for me to do. I felt a confirmation that continuing my education could help me become "one qualified to serve society and make a significant contribution to the world" around me. President Hinckley was reinforcing the message I had received a few months before while I sang that hymn with my ward members.<br><br>In faith, seek the Lord. Put your hand in His, and take this unknown journey together.<br><br>President DieterF. Uchtdorf said it beautifully: "The Savior is 'not far from every one of us' [Acts 17:27]. We have His promise that if we seek Him diligently, we will find Him."<sup>7</sup><br><h3><b><i>Second Principle: Waiting Includes Trying to Understand God's Plan for Us</i></b></h3><br>The second principle I have discovered is that waiting upon the Lord includes trying to understand God's plan for us.<br><br>I felt as I listened to that hymn and as I listened to President Hinckley that God had a plan for me. If I continued to faithfully seek Him, things that needed to be revealed to me would be revealed.<br><br>Today I want to share that same faith with those of you who are struggling through uncertain times. God has a plan for you. As you seek Him, He will help you come to know what that plan includes. But as I share my faith with you, I also want to share a few other things about the phrase "God has a plan for you."<br><br>First, the plan God has for you may not match the ideal you have envisioned. In fact, if we take that scripture in Ecclesiastes seriously, it probably won't match the ideal you have envisioned. But you can have faith that together you and the Lord can create something truly remarkable.<br><br>Some of my students this semester shared a blog post with me titled "You're Not Messing Up God's Plan for You." The author taught, "It's tempting to think that God has some master plan that He's measuring me against, and if I take one misstep I've missed my chance for happiness forever."<sup>8</sup><br><br>I can relate to that fear. When life doesn't seem to match the ideals we envision, we may struggle just as this author did, worrying that we don't measure up or fearing that we are disappointing God.<br><br>She continued:<br><br><i> But you know what? As I've examined that mindset, I've learned that I need a better understanding of God and what the term "His plan for me" means.</i><br><br><i> I'm learning that God is much less a divine dictator who demands perfect compliance to a ­predetermined plan for our individual lives and much more a cocreator with us of the kind of lives we want to live.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>What a fantastic distinction! God is not a dictator; instead He is a cocreator. His plan includes creating a remarkable life <i>with </i>us.<br><br>Part of understanding God's plan for each of us is having the faith to enter into a partnership with Him. We do this by making and keeping covenants. When my eldest daughter, Elena, was baptized, I tried to teach her about how our covenants connect us with Christ by sharing this quote by Elder WilliamR. Bradford: "Be a companion with Christ, and he will draw near unto you and be your best friend. There is no better friend than Christ."<sup>10</sup><br><br>Through our covenants we are bound to Him and He is bound to us. What better friend could you have than Christ? Together you and He can create a remarkable life.<br><br>Second, God's plan for you will not match the plans God has for others. You must come to know what the Lord wants for you personally. President Uchtdorf taught:<br><br><i> We may share the same gene pool, but we are not the same. We have unique spirits. We are influenced in ­different ways by our experiences. And each of us ends up different as a result.</i><br><br><i> Rather than attempting to force everyone into a mold of our own making, we can choose to celebrate these differences and appreciate them for adding richness and constant surprises to our lives.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>It takes courage and faith to celebrate and appreciate the beauty of our differences, to give others space to discover their own paths, and to trust that God will help you just like you see Him helping those around you. This may include celebrating the wedding of a friend when you have no marriage prospects on the horizon. It may include being excited for someone who just got into the graduate school of their dreams even though you didn't. I know what it is like to feel forgotten or insecure when others get the things you hoped for, but if you can learn to celebrate and appreciate differences, I believe your heart will be more open to what God has in store for you.<br><br>At BYU Women's Conference in 2015, Elder M.Russell Ballard pled:<br><br><i>Each of you must come to know what the Lord wants for you individually, given the choices before you. ...</i><br><br><i>Once you know the Lord's will, you can then move forward in faith to fulfill your individual purpose. One sister may be inspired to continue her education and attend medical school, allowing her to have significant impact on her patients and to advance medical research. For another sister, inspiration may lead her to forego a scholarship to a prestigious institution and instead begin a family much earlier than has become common in this generation, allowing her to make a significant and eternal impact on her children now.</i><br><br>Then he posed this question: "Is it possible for two similarly faithful women to receive such different responses to the same basic questions?" He emphatically responded:<br><br><i>Absolutely! What's right for one woman may not be right for another. That's why it is so important that we should not question each other's choices or the inspiration behind them.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>What is right for one of you may not be right for another. With this understanding, we can encourage each other, celebrate and appreciate our differences, and move forward in a partnership with the Lord. We need not judge or criticize. Our encouragement and love amid our differences will enhance our capacity to ­celebrate together. It will also enhance our individual capacity to understand God's plan for us as we create that plan <i>with</i>Him.<br><h3><b><i>Third Principle: As We Wait, We Can Choose Faith and Hope</i></b></h3><br>Waiting, seeking, and understanding God's plan for us all require a tremendous amount of faith and hope. But how do we maintain faith and hope when uncertainty has such a strong capacity to make us doubt and fear?<br><br>That question leads to my third principle: as we wait upon the Lord, we can choose faith and hope.<br><br>To me, the opposite of faith and hope is fear. When I say that we can <i>choose</i> faith and hope, I am also implying that we can choose faith and hope over fear.<br><br>Some of you may be like me: a little anxious and a little afraid to try new things. When you experience anxiety or fear, it seems innate, not like a choice. In a 2008 devotional Professor Gregory Clark grappled with this tension between faith and fear. He argued that when we wake up every day, we choose to be either faithful or fearful. When we choose faith, we minimize fear. When we choose fear, hope and faith are virtually impossible.<br><br>Professor Clark explained:<br><br><i>When I am living in fear, I find change and changing--for the better, at least--almost impossible. It is important to learn how to live in faith rather than in fear because the process of changing for the better is atthe very foundation of the Father's plan for us.</i><br><br>He then asked, "What is the source of fear?" Ireally like his answer:<br><br><i>I think it is rooted in the assumption . . . that I must solve all my problems and face all my challenges alone, using my own resources. That is frightening, because deep in my heart I know how limited those resources are. . . . Knowing that I am not capable of changing myself or my circumstances for the better, I stand frozen in fear.</i><sup>13</sup><br><br>Fear comes from the false belief that we are allalone.<br><br>What then is the source of faith and hope? Professor Clark said, "Faith is founded upon our memory of divine witnesses and blessings received in the past and upon our hope in divine promises for the future."<sup>14</sup><br><br>When we remember spiritual experiences or blessings the Lord has given us, it is easier to hope for those same things in the future. They remind us that we are not alone. This optimism in Christ's divinity and this belief that we will continue to be blessed are the very essence of hope and faith. One thing that helps me remember is keeping a record of the spiritual experiences and blessings I have received in my life. On my hardest days I like to pull out that journal and realize just how much the Lord loves me and watches over me.<br><br>When I begin to feel afraid, rereading my journal reminds me that it would <i>not</i> have been better to lose hope, to stop trying to have children, to stop working toward my PhD, or to stop seeking God despite the heartache and challenges that have been part of my journey. Choosing faith and practicing hope have empowered me to act on God's will--which includes embracing uncertainty and enduring beyond what I thought I could endure.<sup>15</sup><br><h3><b><i>Fourth Principle: If We Feel Lost as We Wait, We Can Find Reassurance in God's Love for Us</i></b></h3><br>After my miscarriage, I discovered a painting by Brian Kershisnik. It is titled <i>She Will Find What Is Lost.</i> This painting has come to represent my fourth principle: if we feel lost as we wait, we can find reassurance in God's love for us.<br><br>Sometimes amid the waiting, and despite our best efforts, we may find ourselves feeling lost. I told you about my experiences with infertility, my resulting questions about my purpose in life, and my struggle following one of my miscarriages. What I didn't tell you is that after that miscarriage, aside from losing a child I had longed for, I began to lose myself. I felt distant from God; I sought Him but felt I couldn't find Him. I struggled to find a sense of meaning or a sense of direction in my life. It took a considerable amount of waiting and struggling to choose hope, but I worked at it.<br><br>About a year and a half after that miscarriage, I discovered I was pregnant again. My anxiety about losing this baby was high. Despite my excitement about a new pregnancy, I began again to feel lost. One day while at work, that lost feeling was intense. I knelt down in my office in the Joseph F. Smith Building, and I prayed fervently that God would be with me in my waiting. It was a prayer full of faith and longing. In faith, I asked God to be with me in my waiting. I really longed for Him to confirm to me that my baby would be healthy. But while praying, I knew that I had to pray for something else: I had to pray that whatever happened to this baby in this pregnancy, God would be with me, that He would help me manage whatever pain, sorrow, or loss could happen. I had to pray for this because, though losing a baby is not ideal, the possibility was real. That was a humbling experience.<br><br>After that fervent prayer I stood up and tried to return to my regular routine. Part of my routine that day included walking down to the Richards Building to meet my daughter after her ballroom dance practice. As I walked down the steps and into the building, the most remarkable thing happened. It stopped me in my tracks. I felt a tingling from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. It was truly electric. In my mind and in my heart I knew God was fully aware of me. He understood how lost and afraid I felt. He was with me then and would continue to be with me however long I needed Him. That was a rare but needed gift for me in that moment.<br><br>The title of Brian Kershisnik's painting returned to my mind again: <i>She Will Find What Is Lost.</i> God was helping me find what was lost. Iwas not alone.<br><br>Sadly, I did have another miscarriage. But this time I did not lose that powerful, sustaining ­witness of God's love for me. When we feel lost, we can find reassurance in God's love for us.<br><br>Previously I suggested that a core principle of waiting is that we have to seek the Lord in order to find Him. My experience has taught me that there is an interesting paradox amid that truth: sometimes, when we are lost, He will also find us.<br><br>This paradox may be best reflected in the ­parable of the lost sheep.<sup>16</sup> President Uchtdorf taught about this parable. He said:<br><br><i> Is it possible that the Savior's message was that God is fully aware of those who are lost--and that He will find them, that He will reach out to them, and that He will rescue them? . . .</i><br><br><i> Our Savior, the Good Shepherd, . . .</i><br><br><i> . . . knows when you are lost, and He knows where you are. He knows your grief. Your silent pleadings. Your fears. Your tears. . . .</i><br><br><i> . . . You are His child. And . . . He loves His children.</i><sup>17</sup><br><h2><b>In My Waiting</b></h2><br>In closing, I would like to share one more message regarding uncertainty. Sister NeillF. Marriott taught:<br><br><i>Scripture says, "Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good"</i> [D&amp;amp;C 90:24].<i> This doesn't mean all things </i><b><i>are</i></b><i> good, but for the meek and faithful, things--both positive and negative--work </i><b><i>together</i></b><i> for good, and the ­timing is the Lord's. We wait on Him, sometimes like Job in his suffering, knowing that God "maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole" </i>[Job 5:18].<i> A meek heart accepts the trial and the waiting for that time of healing and wholeness to come.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>I am still waiting. In my waiting I have sought God and found Him. His plan for me is unfolding as I take His hand and accept the invitation to become a cocreator with Him. I am trying to choose hope and faith. Sometimes, when I am lost, He finds me.<br><br>Despite life's uncertainties, I pray that you will also seek Him, that you will strive to understand His plan for you, and that you will choose faith and hope. As you do these things, I hope you will receive heavenly reassurance. He knows you. He loves you. I testify that following these principles has helped me face uncertainty. I believe they can help you too. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, amen.<br><br><i>Erin Kramer Holmes, associate director of the BYU School ofFamily Life, delivered this devotional address on April 4, 2017.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<br>
<br>
I am grateful and humbled to be with you today.<br><br>As I was preparing for my talk, I was reminded of a story I once heard in a stake conference session a number of years ago. The story begins with a rancher performing chores out on his ranch one morning when he sees a shiny pickup truck drive onto his ranch and park.<br><br>Out of the truck steps a man in uniform who walks up to the rancher and states, "I'm here to inspect your ranch for any illegally grown drugs."<br><br>The rancher responds, "Fine, but do not go in that field over there," and points to a beautiful field to the east.<br><br>The officer replies, "Mister, I don't think you understand me. I am here to inspect your ranch, and I have the authority of the federal government behind me." Reaching into his pocket he pulls out some form of a badge and proudly displays the badge to the rancher. "See this badge, old man? This badge means I am allowed to go on any land," he says, pointing all across the farmer's ranch. "Have I made myself clear?"<br><br>The rancher apologizes, nods, and goes about his chores.<br><br>A short while later the old rancher hears someone screaming, looks up, and sees the officer running while being chased by a large bull in the field that the rancher had told the officer not to enter. With every step the officer takes, the bull takes two. With the distance shrinking between the charging bull and the frantic officer, the rancher steps up onto the fence enclosing the field and yells, "Your badge--show him your badge!"<br><br>On college campuses everywhere, including this one, we do a fair amount of badge showing--and for good reason. Our faculty have gone to top graduate schools and have trained with many of the best scholars, which, among other benefits, has helped prepare them to stand at the front of their classrooms and speak with expertise and authority. Unfortunately I have no badge to pull from my pocket demonstrating my credentials to speak today. I am grateful for the vote of confidence from President Worthen and Vice President Richardson in extending this invitation. I am also grateful to each of you for coming to today's devotional. It is not lost on me that you have the choice to attend or not. To this end, I hope and pray for the presence of the Spirit and that we may be edified as a result.<br><br>I am grateful for my wife, Marcie, and for my children, all of whom are here except for our oldest daughter, Sarah, who is serving a mission in South Carolina and happens to return from her mission next week; we are excited at our house. Iam grateful for my mother, other family members, and dear friends and colleagues who are here today as well.<br><h2><b>Rafting Gone Awry</b></h2><br>I had the good fortune of growing up in the state of Alaska. It was a fantastic place to be raised. As an example of this, each year our Boy Scout troop would plan and carry out amazing high-adventure camps. We would go backpacking, canoeing, and even white-water rafting. For one such summer camp we decided to raft a well-known section of the Gulkana River. We had a great time. Despite a lot of rain--which is a reality of summers in Alaska--we rafted through beautiful country, caught seemingly endless numbers of fish, and saw abundant wildlife, including bald eagles and grizzly bears.<br><br>On one of the final days of the trip, we came up against the signature white-water challenge of the river: a section of rapids ending with a seven- to ten-foot waterfall. At this point many rafters would take their rafts and gear out of the river in a portage around the falls to ensure against harm or losing gear. We decided to carry our gear around the waterfall but to enjoy the thrill of running the rafts through the rapids and over the falls.<br><br>I went in a raft with my father, who happened to be one of our youth leaders. He situated himself at the center of the raft, where he could use the two large oars to steer. I sat near the front of the raft and was given a paddle, but my primary role was to stay out of the way. I still remember smoothly navigating the rapids, feeling confident and exhilarated as we approached the waterfall. Everything was lined up perfectly, and--much like you would experience on a roller coaster--we shot off the falls down to the water below.<br><br>Just after passing over the falls, the raft paused a bit and started moving backwards. I didn't understand why this was happening, so I turned back toward my father only to see him being engulfed by the falls, which immediately knocked him out of the raft and into the river.<br><br>Let me take a quick detour from this story to explain a bit more about the flow and current of this waterfall. As water flowed over the falls, the force carried the water down to the river bottom, where the current rebounded, causing it to flow back toward the surface following a circular path. When the water came back up to the surface, it formed a wave that forced the water back upstream toward the falls. This wave, sometimes called a standing wave, was what our raft had hit and what had driven us back into the falls.<br><br>Now back to the story. There I was, alone in the raft--which had turned sideways from the force of hitting the falls--and in a brief moment I went from excitement to panic. But the ordeal was not over. Over the course of the next few minutes, which seemed to go on forever, the raft would slowly float downstream away from the falls until it hit the standing wave, which would reverse the raft's course back toward the falls. As the raft would approach the falls, the cascading water would hit the nearest side tube of the raft and force it to tip toward the falls as though it were about to flip over with me in it. However, each time the raft would approach the point of flipping, it would stop, fall back flat, and then float out toward the standing wave--repeating the process all over again. This back and forth between the falls and the standing wave was repeated about ten times.<br><br>During all of this back and forth my youth leaders and fellow youth were standing on the bank of the river shouting support and instructions to me in the raft. Though they stood only about fifteen feet from me and were shouting as loud as they could, it seemed impossible at the time for me to hear exactly what they were saying. The noise of the waterfall, the number of different people who were shouting at me at the same time, and, probably most of all, the overwhelming intensity of the situation drowned out their words. I could not hear what they were saying. At one point I came to the brilliant conclusion that they were trying to tell me to hold tight to the raft. So, trusting and having faith in their instructions, I did my best to tighten what was already a death grip on the raft.<br><br>Finally, after yet another near flip into the falls, the raft--now almost full of water--fell down and floated over the standing wave instead of getting pushed back again. It then moved into a section of calmer waters, where I was immediately rescued by my leaders, who pulled the raft to the side of the river. As a side note, my father was also successfully rescued from the river about a third of a mile downstream.<br><br>Later that day we all gathered together and talked about what had happened. One of the Young Men leaders, who happened to have stood closest to me on the bank and who had shouted more than the others, told our Scout group how proud he was that I had shown courage and had followed the instructions they were shouting to me to "lean against the tipping raft." He said that this was what had saved the boat from flipping and what had saved me from being seriously injured--or worse.<br><br>As he talked to the group about my obedience and bravery, I began to convince myself that his story was exactly what had happened. I had been brave; I had leaned against the tipping raft to keep it from flipping over. However, as time wore on and as I thought more about what had happened on the river, I realized that his description was not entirely accurate. What had saved me from the waterfall was the raft filling up with water and becoming heavy enough to keep it from tipping and to carry it through the standing wave. It had little to do with my following the instructions of the leaders. In fact, I hadn't followed their instructions because I hadn't heard what they were saying. The circumstances of that event made it difficult to figure out what had really caused my safe escape from the waterfall.<br><h2><b>Incomplete Conclusions</b></h2><br>I believe my experience on the raft that day and the difficulty of determining what caused my safe escape represent, in some ways, the challenges we face in determining the true causes of outcomes in our lives. We make many mistakes in determining causality. Each party involved in my rescue had come to an incorrect or incomplete conclusion about what had led to my successful escape. Iwould like to address each party.<br><br>First, my Young Men leaders. I am sure that they were fearful for my safety and that their intentions were to do everything they could to save me. But they could not make it out to the raft, so they could not experience what was happening to me on the raft. They wanted to believe that their instructions were making a difference, but they were unable to tell that the sound of the rushing water was so loud that I could not hear their instructions. Perhaps they saw the tightening of my grip following their shouting and viewed this as my leaning against the tipping raft, concluding that their instructions had been received and obeyed and had caused my safe escape.<br><br>Second, the other young men. I believe they, like the leaders, were fearful for my safety and somewhat overwhelmed by the situation. They witnessed the leaders shouting instructions and likely saw what appeared to be my obeying those instructions. But there was enough uncertainty about what I had actually done that it allowed them to accept a story of my obedience and bravery. Perhaps they may have even said to themselves, "There is no way I could have done that. But Keith is brave, so of course he would have followed the instructions and saved himself."<br><br>Last, myself. I wanted to believe that it was my bravery that had contributed to my escape, and while I know that my actions had something to do with the escape--since I had held on with the best grip a fifteen-year-old could muster--I did not do all that the leader claimed I had done. Yet I liked my leader's story better, and perhaps due to my own insecurities at the time, I was glad that his story brought me attention and respect from both the leaders and my peers.<br><br>As this experience illustrates, we face many situations as helper, observer, or participant in which we can be misled or can make a mistake when assessing the true causes of the outcomes in our lives. Fear, insecurity, the distractions of the world around us, and an overwhelming number of voices can combine to confuse us and keep us from drawing the right conclusions about real causes and real effects.<br><br>I would like to spend the remainder of this talk discussing some of the challenges of drawing the right spiritual inferences and discussing a tool the Lord has provided to help us avoid making these mistakes. Like the use of inference in a statistical setting, the point here is not only to know the correct conclusion to draw but to realize that in some cases you should not draw any conclusions.<br><br>You might ask why I would make this the topic of my devotional. You wouldn't be alone in asking this question; the same question was posed by my own children when I told them of my plan. My response to them and to you is that one of the great challenges of mortality is to learn to make correct judgments in the face of uncertainty. This ability to discern is an essential part of the plan. Satan does not make this easy.<br><br>In a recent broadcast, President RussellM. Nelson said:<br><br><i> Pray to discern between God's laws and the philosophies of men, including those cunning counterfeits of the adversary. Through eons of time, Lucifer has honed his craft. He is skilled at distraction, distortion, deception, and misdirection. I plead with you to avoid his cunning snares as you would avoid a plague! </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/article/worldwide-devotionals/2017/01/prophets-leadership-and-divine-law?lang=eng">Prophets, Leadership, and Divine Law</a>," worldwide devotional for young adults, 8 January 2017]<br><br>Another perspective of this challenge comes from the following quote:<br><br><i>Man is so intelligent that he feels impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic.</i> [Aldous Huxley, <i>Texts and Pretexts: An Anthology with Commentaries </i>(New York: Harper and Brothers, 1933), 278]<br><br>Now, <i>lunatic</i> is a strong word, but on our own we too frequently fail to see the real cause-and-effect relationships. I suspect that if each of us were to take a quick inventory of our recent past, we would find an occasion in which we drew the wrong conclusion or the wrong spiritual inference about what caused an outcome in our lives or in the life of a loved one. As President Nelson stated, the consequences of such errors can be as severe as a plague.<br><h2><b>Satan's Deception</b></h2><br>Similar to the way the youth leaders and perhaps my peers were led to think that I was the cause of my safe escape, Satan can deceive us into focusing our attention on the outcome more than on the causes. For example, I could claim that since my raft did not flip over and I was able to escape, my actions must have caused this to happen.<br><br>The scriptures teach us that in the premortal existence each of us was given a choice about whose plan to follow: God's plan or Satan's plan. Satan's plan confounded cause and effect. His plan would save all mankind--the desired outcome--but would do so without the development that was central to God's plan, which development would be the real cause of our eternal life. Yet Satan's plan appealed to a third of the hosts of heaven, convincing them that this was the right way to achieve eternal life. As we know, they were incorrect in their evaluation of the plans and would face eternal consequences as a result.<br><br>Let me present a case that may be even closer to us. Do we think of serving a mission in a way similar to the way one-third of the hosts of heaven thought of Satan's plan for eternal life, by focusing more on the outcome? Or do we focus our efforts on the behaviors that will<i> cause</i> a successful mission? To focus primarily on the outcome--serving a mission--we may miss important preparation or shortchange our need for growth. We may even be inclined to ignore sins or imperfections in our lives if we believe they might keep us from the desired outcome of serving a mission. To view serving a mission in this way will keep us from coming to know Christ and His Atonement and from qualifying for the companionship of the Holy Ghost--the most important companion of asuccessful missionary.<br><br>Another of Satan's tools is his ability to convince us that certain correlations are actually causations. Now, I know we have all regularly heard that correlation doesn't confirm causation, yet we still fall prey to its lure. I share a somewhat silly example: a plot of two variables that appear to be quite correlated--the number of movies with actor Nicolas Cage that come out yearly and the corresponding number of annual deaths by drowning in a pool. [The speaker displayed a line chart with two nearly identical lines.] By simple visual analysis, one might conclude that an overconsumption of Nick Cage movies might actually drive movie watchers to drown themselves in their backyard pools. My children have offered some theories as to why this relationship might be causal, but we know that this correlation should not lead us to any cause-effect conclusions.<br><br>This is an overly simple example of why we should reject causality, but we know that Satan uses much subtler methods to deceive us into believing causal relationships that will draw us from the straight and narrow path onto alternative paths that end in unhappiness. How often do we observe others struggling with faith crises and conclude that the causes of their struggles are based on behaviors or information that we observe and that appear to be correlated? Or perhaps, in contrast, do we observe friends who seem to be living a life without trials and conclude that they must be spiritually superior because their paths seem clearer when compared to the many obstacles we see in our own lives? The Lord exhorted us to "judge not" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/7.1?lang=eng#1">Matthew 7:1</a>), but the allure of observable correlations can be challenging to ignore. The best response in many cases is to not draw causal conclusions based solely on correlated information.<br><br>Related to his correlation tool, Satan works to confound and confuse us through unobserved or omitted information. If we go back to the example of the raft, the outside observers--the Young Men leaders and my peer Scouts--did not know that the noise of the crashing water kept me from hearing their instructions, nor did they appear to see that with each trip into the falls the raft was filling up with water. Had they observed these facts, they would likely have altered their conclusions about what had caused my safe escape.<br><br>In many cases we will never be given all of the information to determine causality, and what we do not observe may be a key driver of the outcome. Just as before, our best conclusion may be to draw <i>no</i> inference, realizing that we just don't have all of the information. However, Satan lures us into the need to try to explain all behavior, and his offered conclusions lead us away from seeing others as God does.<br><br>Satan will also work to convince us to use unobserved or omitted information to our advantage. I liked the conclusions of my Young Men leaders when they saw me as brave and obedient. It actually took me a few hours to come clean to them that I had not in fact leaned against the tipping raft.<br><br>One of the great attractions of social media is that we can control what information is conveyed to the world and what information is not. We must remember, as stated in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16.7?lang=eng#p6">1Samuel 16:7</a>, that "the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." There is no information unobserved by or omitted from the Lord, and His love for us is not dependent on how perfect we appear on Instagram. But Satan will work to convince us that we can be justified "to cover our sins" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37?lang=eng#p36">D&amp;amp;C 121:37</a>)--to hide the true causes of our outcomes--if doing so will work to our worldly advantage.<br><br>Satan will accomplish this by playing on our insecurities and fears. Elder NealA. Maxwell stated, "He who was thrust down in the first estate delights to have us put ourselves down. Self-contempt is of Satan" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/10/notwithstanding-my-weakness?lang=eng">Notwithstanding My Weakness</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> November 1976). Even after I was rescued, for a period of time I was still shaken and scared. I did not feel like I was on solid ground. When the story was told of my bravery, I almost immediately--but temporarily--began to feel better about myself. I liked the positive attention, until I admitted to myself that it was not based on the truth.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost: A Spiritual Instrument</b></h2><br>In their search to determine causal relationships, economists and statisticians have defined the term <i>instrument</i> as information that can help to rule out unimportant correlations, to control for unobserved or omitted variables, and to determine the direction of cause-and-effect relationships. I would like to borrow this term and discuss a powerful spiritual instrument the Lord has provided to help us identify causal relationships and make correct spiritual inferences. This spiritual instrument is the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Elder JamesE. Faust taught:<br><br><i> Satan has had great success with this gullible generation.</i> ... <i>There is, however, an ample shield against the power of Lucifer and his hosts. This protection lies in the spirit of discernment through the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift comes undeviatingly by personal revelation to those who strive to obey the commandments of the Lord and to follow the counsel of the living prophets. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1987/10/the-great-imitator?lang=eng">The Great Imitator</a>," <i>Ensign</i>, November 1987]<br><br>The phrase "spiritual discernment" that President Faust used parallels very closely with the phrase "spiritual inference" that I have been using throughout my talk. As President Faust stated, the Holy Ghost helps us to see the real causes of real effects. He also told us how we can qualify for this gift: through striving to obey the commandments and by following the counsel of our living prophets. Notice that President Faust did not say that we have to be perfectly obedient to the commandments, only that we must strive. Also, in contrast to perhaps the world's view, we will better see and understand causes and effects when we exercise faith in our leaders and obey their counsel.<br><br>Recently our Church leaders have reminded us of the roles that the Sabbath day and sacrament observance can play in maintaining our relationship with the Spirit. Proper participation in the sacrament will more fully bring the Spirit into our lives. Elder DavidA. Bednar made clear the connection between the sacrament and our relationship with the Holy Ghost:<br><br><i> Through the ordinance of the sacrament we renew our baptismal covenant and can receive and retain a remission of our sins (see Mosiah 4:12, 26). In addition, we are reminded on a weekly basis of the promise </i><b><i>that we may always have His Spirit to be with us.</i></b><i> As we then strive to keep ourselves clean and unspotted from the world, we become worthy vessels in whom the Spirit of the Lord can always dwell. </i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/04/that-we-may-always-have-his-spirit-to-be-with-us?lang=eng">That We May Always Have His Spirit to Be with Us</a>," <i>Ensign,</i> May 2006; emphasis in original]<br><br>I am personally grateful for Aaronic priesthood holders who petition God each week on my behalf for help that I might always remember Christ and always have His Spirit to be with me. Renewing those covenants on Sunday has brought the Spirit more deeply and consistently into my life.<br><br>Let me share an example from my family's life of how the Holy Ghost can help us to see the truly causal relationships. A number of years ago our family was on a trip to visit relatives. While sitting in a small plane waiting to take off to another airport, where we would catch a connecting flight, a lightning storm arose and caused a significant delay in our departure. All planes were grounded for a while. Marcie's and my immediate response to this delay was to get on the phone and call airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies to discuss contingencies if we did not make the connection.<br><br>During the chaos of these calls, our youngest daughter suggested that we pray for help. The thought hadn't crossed my mind, but it was quickly supported by her brother and sisters.<br><br>With Marcie's endorsement, we did our best to gather among the two rows of seats we were sitting in, and, trying not to draw attention, we offered a brief, sincere prayer for the Lord to provide a solution to our predicament. The prayer brought relief and peace, and soon thereafter the plane took off.<br><br>Not long before we arrived at the connecting airport and well after the time our connection was scheduled to leave, the pilot came over the intercom and stated that contrary to typical practice, the connecting flight was waiting at the gate for those on our flight. We were able to make the connection.<br><br>My sharing this story is not to indicate that God cares about the Vorkink family vacation plans; that might be a likely interpretation, but that would be the wrong inference to draw. What we learned from that experience and what the Spirit communicated to me in that simple prayer was that God was most interested in letting a young girl and her family know that He listens to us and answers our prayers.<br><br>In conclusion, the bulk of my talk has been a cautionary tale against claiming causality when we do not have the ability to truly identify it. I want to end, though, with a witness of a causal relationship that we all know and that I personally know. Jesus Christ is the great cause. He has a perfect knowledge of things as they really are, including of each of us. Through His Spirit He can change our minds and our hearts. He will help us to see with spiritual eyes the causal relationships that will lead to happiness and eternal life and to ignore those that will draw us away from Him and His love. This I testify in His name, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Keith Vorkink, associate dean in the Marriott School of Management, delivered this devotional address on March 28, 2017.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>The Rock of Our Redeemer - Weatherford T. Clayton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
During our mission in Canada, my wife and I gave a "last instruction" to departing missionaries the day before they went home. Each of these young elders and sisters were heroes to us, and we wanted their transition home to be very, very successful. Our instruction was given with love and good fun. I particularly enjoyed instructing on dating and marriage.<br><br>One afternoon as I stood at the blackboard during a last instruction, the Spirit pressed Helaman 5:12 deeply into my mind. This scripture came from what could have been the Book of Mormon prophet Helaman's "last instruction" to his sons prior to their departure for their magnificent mission to the Nephites and the Lamanites.<br><br>We all quoted the scripture together:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i><br><br>What a magnificent verse of scripture. Think of it: Helaman promised us that if we build our foundation upon our Savior, we cannot fall, regardless of what Satan throws at us. What a powerful promise!<br><br>Our Savior gave the same promise in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br><i>Whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken .</i><i>.</i><i>. unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock--</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>I bet a lot of you Primary graduates are thinking of a song. Would you sing it with me--just the first two verses, with hand motions?<br><br><i>The wise man built his house upon the rock,</i><br><i>The wise man built his house upon the rock,</i><br><i>The wise man built his house upon the rock,</i><br><i>And the rains came tumbling down.</i><br><br><i>The rains came down, and the floods came up,</i><br><i>The rains came down, and the floods came up,</i><br><i>The rains came down, and the floods came up,</i><br><i>And the house on the rock stood still.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Thank you! Doesn't this simple song teach a powerful lesson?<br><br>Luke put it slightly differently:<br><br><i>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them .</i><i>.</i><i>.</i><br><br><i>... is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon arock.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>When a person comes to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and hears Their words and lives by them, he is building his house upon the rock. And regardless of Satan's efforts to destroy it, this type of house won't fall. Why? Because it is built upon "the Rock."<sup>4</sup> We build our house upon our Savior and Redeemer, who is "[our] rock, and [our] fortress";<sup>5</sup> "[our] everlasting God, [our] rock and [our] salvation";<sup>6</sup> "the rock [from] whence ye are hewn";<sup>7</sup> "a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation";<sup>8</sup> "that spiritual Rock";<sup>9</sup> "the Rock of Heaven";<sup>10</sup> "the stone of Israel."<sup>11</sup> Our Savior has always been and, as we follow Him, can always be our Rock.<br><br>The apostle Paul's words can help us understand Helaman's metaphor. In Ephesians 2 Paul wrote that as members of Christ's Church we are<br><br><i>of the household of God;</i><br><br><i>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</i><br><br><i>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Just as Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone of the Church, we should allow Him to become the chief cornerstone of our lives. We too must build our foundation on the teachings of the Savior and His apostles and prophets. And just as the household of God grows "unto an holy temple in the Lord," we too can become more holy. What could be better than that?<br><br>Let's take a closer look at how Christ teaches us to do this. Christ said, "Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will [liken unto a wise man]."<sup>13</sup> Here Christ invites us to come to Him, to follow Him, and to do as He does. Remember:<br><ul><br> 	<li>"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."<sup>14</sup></li><br> 	<li>"Come and follow me."<sup>15</sup></li><br> 	<li>"Follow me, and listen to the counsel which Ishall give unto you."<sup>16</sup></li><br> 	<li>"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."<sup>17</sup></li><br></ul><br>How do we come to Him? We begin with faith in Christ, and central to true faith is action. When we have faith in Jesus Christ, we want to act according to that faith. The Book of Mormon prophet Moroni called this having "real intent."<sup>18</sup> For example, if we have faith in Christ, we come to church each Sunday. If we have faith in the Savior, we pay our tithes and offerings. If we have true faith in our Redeemer, we do something about it, because we have real intent. And every time we act according to our faith in Him, we follow Him by hearing and "doing" His words. As we act with faith in Him, the Lord confirms our faith by blessing us with peace, answers to prayer, direction, comfort, and joy. And thus our foundation becomes stronger, wider, and deeper.<br><br>As we act on His words, we are doing something called repenting. In the New Testament, repentance comes from the word <i>metanoeó,</i> from the words <i>metá</i> and <i>noeó,</i> meaning "to change one's mind or purpose."<sup>19</sup> Isn't that interesting?<br><br>Every time we turn more to Christ, we are repenting--we are following Him.<sup>20</sup> When we sincerely pray to the Father, in a very real sense we are repenting. When we read the scriptures and ponder them, we are repenting. As we make changes because of what we are learning about Christ and His gospel, we are repenting. When we do things that make us better, kinder, gentler, more sensitive, more spiritual, more virtuous, and truer, we are repenting. Whenever we choose the better path, we are repenting. Though we all repent of things that are sinful in our lives, most of our repenting comes from hearing His words and doing them--from turning to Him. This builds our foundation, and we want that foundation to be as big and as wide and as deep and as sturdy as possible.<br><br>A friend of mine, Michael Koerber, discovered these principles when he was studying the gospel. Initially he didn't take the lessons too seriously. He said that he was stubborn and did not read the Book of Mormon. However, due to a singular spiritual experience he and his wife, Audrey, had with the missionaries, he realized that he had to make more than a casual commitment. He committed toread the Book of Mormon.<br><br>One morning while on vacation he was reading the Book of Mormon. He reported his experience in these words:<br><br><i>I was reading in Alma somewhere. I remember ­having come to the end of my reading for that morning and coming to a very clear and undeniable realization of the truth of the Book of Mormon. It is indescribable. All I know is that it is as though every cell of my body rang out or sang out or shouted out, "This is it! This is true! Here it is! Look no further! You have the answer to your prayers!"</i><br><br><i>I remember getting up and walking over to my wife and saying to her, "We are joining this church."</i><br><br><i>Audrey then asked, "Why now? What changed?"</i><br><br><i>I answered, "I don't know. But I do know that this book is true. And if this book is true, then it was translated by a prophet of God. And if it was translated by a prophet of God, then I am joining this church."</i><br><br>As we come unto the Savior by exercising faith in Him and repenting every day, we prepare ourselves to follow Christ by receiving ordinances. The first ordinance of heaven is to follow Christ into baptism. Baptism is how we manifest our faith to the Father. The Book of Mormon prophet Nephi taught us to<br><br><i>follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name ofChrist, by baptism--yea, by following your Lord andyour Savior down into the water ..., behold, thenshall ye receive the Holy Ghost.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>So we follow Christ by being baptized, which Elder DavidA. Bednar referred to as "a necessary <i>initial cleansing</i> of our soul from sin."<sup>22</sup> Baptism continues the process of establishing our lives on the foundation we are building upon the Rock.<br><br>After we are baptized, we receive our next ­ordinance: confirmation. This is when the Father gives us His great gift, the Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead. This is called the ­baptism of fire. Nephi taught that after the ­baptism of water comes<br><br><i>the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>In his October 2007 general conference talk, Elder Bednar quoted President MarionG. Romney:<br><br><i>The baptism of fire by the Holy Ghost "converts [us] from carnality to spirituality. It cleanses, heals, and purifies the soul. ... Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, and water baptism are all preliminary and prerequisite to it, but [the baptism of fire] is the consummation. To receive [this baptism of fire] is to have one's garments washed in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ."</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>The blessings that come from baptism and confirmation are marvelous--so great that many people cannot wait to be confirmed in sacrament meeting after their baptism. Recently a wonderful sister who had been baptized the day before dressed and waited for an hour to be picked up for church, but no one came. She called her missionaries to ask them why. They didn't initially pick up but listened to her message and immediately called her back.<br><br>They said, "It's 12:30 a.m. It's midnight!"<br><br>And she responded, "Oh no!" And then she laughed really hard!<br><br>After receiving these first two ordinances, we have the privilege of living what Nephi called "after the manner of happiness"<sup>25</sup>--growing our faith, repenting each day, receiving the priesthood, studying the scriptures, praying with real intent, inviting others to come unto Christ, obtaining all the ordinances of the temple available to us, marrying and having a family, searching out our ancestors and performing ordinances for them, having many friends, and much, much more.<br><br>Each of these activities is associated with great blessings, not just for ourselves but for our families and our friends. These behaviors build and broaden our foundation. Think of our present-day apostles and their lives. Think of how substantial and formidable their foundations must be, built each day by repentance and righteous living.<br><br>As we stand upon the foundation we are building upon Christ and His apostles, we notice the influences of Satan around us. Nephi called these "the mists of darkness" or "the temptations of the devil" that "blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost."<sup>26</sup> But we have heavenly help and protection from his influences. Helaman's promise is true, that when Satan shall send forth his whirlwind, hail, and mighty storm, they "shall have no power over you ... because of the rock upon which ye are built, ... a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall."<sup>27</sup><br><br>One such person who stayed on his foundation was my wife's great-great-grandfather William Geddes. He joined the Church at the tender age of fourteen after hearing the missionaries preaching on a street corner in Scotland in 1847. When his family learned of his baptism, they threw his few belongings out the door and refused to let him be part of the family. He learned to survive on the streets while working in the coal mines, and he continued to learn and grow in the gospel, building his foundation on the Savior.<br><br>A few years later his family allowed him to move back in, but only if he agreed to never speak to them about his religion. He respected their wishes but continued his activity and growth in the gospel.<br><br>Sometime after returning to his family, William contracted cholera and became very ill. His condition worsened until he was near death. He begged his parents to let the Mormon missionaries come to give him a blessing. At first they refused, but they finally relented because they felt this was the last request of their dying son.<br><br>The elders came and administered to William. He was healed immediately and went out that night with the missionaries to preach the gospel! Because he stood on his foundation, he was able to face temptations and trials even at a very young age.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we will all face challenges. The scripture doesn't say "if" we will feel Satan's storms but "when." Look around you. They are here now. We see wars and rumors of wars; love of money and appearance; immorality; pornography; infidelity; drug, alcohol, and social media addiction; attacks on religious freedom; attacks on the nature of marriage; and even attacks on the Savior Himself.<br><br>Isaiah saw our day. He said, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness."<sup>28</sup> We do not have to experience the evil or the darkness. We can join with the people of Alma and "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in."<sup>29</sup><br><br>When we stand upon our foundation with the Savior and His apostles, we can see much more clearly what is true and what is not. With the clear and magnificent light of our Savior, aided by the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost, we can detect the temptations of clever Satan in his efforts to weaken our faith. Remember that Paul warned us:<br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, I need to speak soberly to you for a moment. Please listen carefully. Should you ever choose to step off that wonderful foundation you are building upon the Rock, for whatever reason, be warned that the mists of darkness will almost immediately surround you. You will become vulnerable to "the fiery darts of the adversary."<sup>31</sup> The first emotion you will probably feel is confusion. You will not see clearly and likely won't be able to see where you have come from nor where you are going. Relationships with people who have loved and blessed you will change.<br><br>Can you feel Satan's shafts in the whirlwind here? You may find yourself wanting to hide what you are doing from others who love you. You will likely find yourself growing irritated and angry more easily. You will probably find fault with others more frequently, even with those closest to you. You may become casual in keeping covenants and, with time, simply not keep them at all.<br><br>Can you feel Satan's mighty storm? You will most likely find that you are just not as happy. With time, if you do not step back onto your foundation, you may forget the many, many marvelous things the Lord has given you and find yourself falling "away into forbidden paths and [becoming] lost."<sup>32</sup><br><br>I join the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob in ­saying to you:<br><br><i>O ... my beloved brethren</i> [and sisters], <i>repent ye, and enter in at the strait gate, and continue in the way which is narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal life.</i><br><br><i>O be wise; what can I say more?</i><sup>33</sup><br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, should this ever ­happen to you, repent and get back onto your foundation. Start building your house again. Regardless of where you find yourself off your foundation, you can come back. The Savior's Atonement is real, and through Him we have power to resist any of Satan's temptations and tobe forgiven for our sins. As the Savior said:<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same isforgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i><br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>Remember what Helaman promised his sons? He promised that Satan's mighty winds, storms, hail, and whirlwinds "shall have no power over you ... because of the rock upon which ye are built."<sup>35</sup> This is a true promise.<br><br>Now let us examine who gave this promise and to whom he gave it. Helaman was a faithful father teaching his sons to prepare and empowering them as they went forth wearing the armor of God.<sup>36</sup> These teachings were given in a family.<br><br>Throughout the scriptures we read about fathers and mothers teaching their families. What does that mean to us? It means we aren't building our foundations just for ourselves; we are building them for ourselves and our loved ones.<br><br>We who have come to know the goodness of God and His blessings must build a foundation big enough and broad enough and sturdy enough to bless our marriages and to raise our children on. We protect our children from the fiery darts of Satan by teaching them from their youth to build their foundations upon the Rock. We must help them find faith in Christ, repent, and obtain every ordinance. It is our privilege and responsibility "to teach and help raise a sin-resistant generation."<sup>37</sup> What could be more important?<br><br>In 1869 my great-great-grandfather EdwinS. Graham wrote a letter to his children prior to traveling to Texas from Iowa. Having a strong Christian faith and knowing that he might not live to see them again, he gave them what could have been called his last instruction. He wrote:<br><br><i>In the event ... that I should not live to return to you, ... I know that in</i> [your] <i>mother</i> [you] <i>will have all</i> [the] <i>affection and devotion that</i> [you] <i>could possibly have, as long as she might live. ... Robby, you and Lizzie are so young that ...</i> [should you] <i>forever be bereft of your father's care, advice and instructions, ... live in the fear of God, your Redeemer. Never wrong in any way your fellow man. In morals be ever particularly careful, prudent,</i> [and] <i>discreet. ... Never lie. Never make a harsh promise. Master, always master, never let passion master you. ...</i><br><br><i>In all things be true to yourselves and to others, withGod's blessing and protection.</i> [May He] <i>ever guide and direct you.</i><sup>38</sup><br><br>My great-great-grandfather was right: we must live in the fear--or respect--of God. Helaman was right: we must build our foundation on our Savior. If we do so, we cannot fall, regardless of what Satan does.<br><br>Let me repeat that: regardless of what Satan does, we cannot fall! Heavenly Father loves us so much that He prepared a perfect plan of salvation. In the center of that plan is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. If we choose to come unto Christ and receive His gospel, we can return home to live with our Father again and with our family and there together enjoy eternal life. His perfect plan is working.<br><br>I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I know that ThomasS. Monson is the prophet and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Savior's Church. I testify that all these things are true. I testify that they are all central to the foundation that we are ­building upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Weatherford T.

<br>
<h2><b>Play Through Your Mistakes</b></h2><br>Music has always been a very important part of my life. Nearly every major memory of my childhood involves music of some kind: singing with my family on road trips to pass the time; learning barbershop music with my mom and sisters; listening to the Tijuana Brass band on the record player while decorating our Christmas tree; singing my father's favorite song, "Love at Home" (see<i>Hymns,</i>2002, no. 294), for family home evening; and admiring my mother as she played the organ in our sacrament meeting every week--something she still does at the young age of eighty. Given that music played such a prominent role in my youth, it will not surprise you to know that I took piano lessons for ten years, from the age of eight to seventeen.<br><br>My first piano teacher--we will call her Mrs. Smith--was very strict and had high expectations for mastery. During my lesson she would often follow the music with a pencil as I played. Sometimes, after I hit a sour note or used the wrong fingering, Mrs. Smith would flick my fingers with that pencil. She intended to help me recognize the mistake so that I could correct it. Unfortunately, after several experiences with the dreaded pencil, I learned that the least painful way to handle my musical mistakes was to remove my hands from the keys as quickly as possible.<br><br>This habit of abruptly stopping after a mistake was also unintentionally reinforced when I would practice at home. Our piano was positioned on a wall that was opposite our kitchen; in fact, it was back-to-back with our stove. I would often practice while my mother was making dinner on the other side of the wall. When I would make a mistake, she would make a staccato "ah" sound. Startled, my hands would fly from the keys.<br><br>I know this was not the intended outcome because I heard her do the same thing when she made her own mistakes at the organ or piano. She still does this today, but only in practice. When she is at the organ or piano for performance, there are few errors, but when they occur, they are hardly noticeable. She can play right on through a mistake like nothing happened. I, on the other hand, cannot.<br><br>Most of my piano recitals with Mrs. Smith took place in the chapel of my home ward building. These were reverent occasions--no clapping after the end of each performance, just polite smiles from the audience as we each took our turn at the grand piano. We were not allowed to use our music, so for me, the walk up those three velvety red steps to the piano felt like walking into a battle unarmed. I was terrified that I would make a mistake, take my hands from the keys, and be unable to find the right placement again.<br><br>This terror of performing would follow me into adulthood. When I was still in the early years of my public accounting career and had two small children at home, I was called as the Relief Society pianist.<br><br>The first week was a disaster. I lurched through some prelude music from the back of the<i>Children's Songbook</i>(chosen for its simplicity) and then practiced a little deep breathing to calm down during the announcements. Then it was go time. I began playing the first chords of the opening song, but before I could make it through the intro, I plunked a sour note, and, unsurprisingly, my hands rapidly retreated from the keys. Panicked for a measure or two, I desperately tried to get back into the groove. As usual, the chorister led everyone through all of the verses. The longer they sang, the worse I played, until I was reduced to picking out just the melody line for the last verse.<br><br>This little episode played out like an old rerun each week until, fatefully, someone in the presidency asked if I would like a key to the church so I could practice. I politely declined, explaining that I actually had a piano at home. Iwas released within the month.<br><br>To this day, even when I am home alone practicing in complete solitude, I cannot play "Sweet Hour of Prayer" (<i>Hymns,</i>no. 142)--the simplest of hymns--without stopping, unless I have the unlikely good fortune to get through it with no mistakes. For this reason I try not to call attention to my piano training (cat's out of the bag now, Iguess). I am so paralyzed by my mistakes that Iam of no practical use at the piano.<br><br>It may be easy to say that this paralysis is not my fault and that the teaching style was somehow to blame. But I cannot hold Mrs. Smith nor my mother responsible for this problem. You see, my sister, Terry, had the same piano teacher with the same pencil, the same mother with the same "ah" emanating from the kitchen, and the same recital settings. Yet she has gone on to accompany many performers, play for work parties, play both the piano and the organ at church, and, in general, bless the lives of others with her musical training and talent.<br><br>When you allow yourself to be paralyzed by your mistakes, you diminish your ability to be useful in God's kingdom. Making mistakes is simply part of the human condition and can be one of your most productive learning tools. Yes, you need to recognize your mistakes. But more than that, you need to find a way to effectively play through them.<br><br>I picked up the ukulele several years ago when I was called as the Young Women camp director. I learned a whole slew of camp songs in just a few weeks, thanks to all of that piano training. I still love to play the ukulele while my family sings, and I sometimes use it to write little educational songs about accounting--to the everlasting delight of my students, I might add. I still make mistakes with my uke, but they don't stop me from moving on.<br><br>The stories I have chosen to tell you today are not easy for me to share. These are not my proudest moments in life, and I usually prefer to wear my confident, professional persona for public consumption. However, I have come to appreciate the value of weakness and the strength that comes from acknowledging it. I hope that by sharing a few of my failures you can find some appreciation for your own.<br><h2><b>Show Up and Try</b></h2><br>Three years ago a few faculty in our department decided to take a ski-instructor class together. The idea was that we could spend Friday afternoons learning how to teach something completely outside of our expertise while also enjoying some recreation together and generally deepening our friendships. A few of us--me included--invited our spouses to join in the fun aswell.<br><br>We met together for the first time in a classroom and introduced ourselves to our new classmates. In the process, students commented on their self-assessed ski abilities, and I realized, with some growing trepidation, that I was likely the least prepared for the expectations of the course.<br><br>The following week we met at Sundance and spent a fair amount of time on the flat area by the lift just learning how to orient a beginner to the gear and how to teach someone to get in and out of skis and how to get on and off the lift. We played a couple of simple games together, and I remember feeling somewhat more confident about my place in the group. All was going relatively well for me in the class--until we rode the Arrowhead lift to the top of the resort.<br><br>Prior to getting on the lift, we had been instructed to exit to the right at the top, ski to the beginning of Bear Claw run, and then look down and to the left, where we would see the instructors gathering the class. We were then supposed to join the group, after which we would be split up by ability before heading down the mountain. I made my way to the top of Bear Claw without much trouble, but when I looked to see my classmates skiing to the rendezvous point, I froze. If I were to follow my peers, I would have to ski at what appeared to be an impossible angle. I had never skied on something quite like that before, and I immediately started looking around for other options.<br><br>I determined that rather than ski directly down the mountain, I would simply ski the mountain horizontally, back and forth, allowing me to take a less severe descent to the desired location. I took a deep breath and skied to the right toward the trees and then forced as sharp a turn as I could manage to head back to my class. Unfortunately, my calculations were off, or perhaps my snowplow was ineffective, and I could see that I would be well below the rest of the class upon completing my epic return across the face of the mountain. Flustered from this realization, I fell.<br><br>Mark, one of the course instructors, hurried over to try to give me a couple of pointers. After what must have been a few frustrating moments for him, he hollered up to the group that he would stay with me and that the others should go ahead. The class had been divided into its groups: the advanced skiers (which included my husband, Spencer), the intermediate skiers, and me. I was humiliated.<br><br>Mark stayed with me and did his best to coach me down the mountain, and given that I had no other options, I did my very best to listen to his counsel and imitate his movements. Much of that day is a blur to me. I was constantly switching focus between Mark's patient instruction and my own thoughts about the futility of the whole endeavor.<br><br>I left Sundance that Friday unsure if I would ever return to class. I even worried about what would happen when I returned to face my colleagues on Monday morning. I fully expected some good-natured teasing and a little fun at my expense, but instead, everyone simply talked about how much fun it was to do something different together. To my surprise, no one focused on my inability; rather, they talked about their own improvements and their desire to keep learning. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and I privately resolved that I would finish the class.<br><br>I skied alone a lot in the beginning, and it was hard. I didn't become an incredible skier ­overnight--or ever. I did join the intermediate group for a few runs toward the end of the course, but I was always the last one down the mountain. Still, even I could see that I had improved.<br><br>This experience gave me a deep appreciation for the value of the "try." Simply showing up and starting where you are is all that can be asked of you. Regardless of your level of experience, your failures, or your perception of your own potential, wherever you are in life, you just need to show up and try. Try to listen to the patient instruction of the Savior, try to imitate His movements, try to ignore the negative self-talk when your movements do not measure up, and try to focus on the joy in the learning instead of the defeat in the failure. And amidst your "try," recognize that others around you are in the middle of their own "try." Celebrate their progress, even when they seem to be farther along than you, and give them a pass when they fall short.<br><br>In my own classroom I have seen through experience that failure is one of the best ways to generate lasting intellectual learning. Let me share something from the authors of<i>Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning:</i><br><br><i>Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourage deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied, creating fertile ground for its encoding, in a way that simply reading</i>[or being given]<i>the answer cannot.</i>[PeterC. Brown, HenryL. RoedigerIII, and MarkA. McDaniel (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2014), 88]<br><br>I look forward to these unsuccessful moments with my students, though I know they are in pain. It is very satisfying as a teacher to witness the transition from failed attempt to recognition and understanding.<br><br>Failure is useful in physical development as well. Strategically working a muscle to failure--the point at which you can no longer lift or push or pull whatever you are lifting or pushing or pulling--and then allowing proper time for the muscle fibers to repair is one of the most effective ways to build strength. This process of failing and repairing eventually results in stronger, more efficient muscles.<br><br>To improve my overall health and fitness, I recently started working with a trainer. My trainer, Josh, is big on this idea of failure. He chooses movements and weights that will get me to the failing point just at the end of a set, and somehow he knows when to step in to help me finish. It used to irritate me to have him grinning and laughing while helping me through the last few failed reps, but I realize now that he saw progress where I saw failure. He looks forward to those moments, like I do with my students, because he gets to be a real participant in my growth.<br><br>If failure is important to our intellectual and physical improvement, perhaps it is important in our quest for perfection as well. Could it be that our moments of extremity are necessary for our spiritual progress and that our Savior knows that only then we are ready to learn? Regrettably, accepting help when we need it most can be difficult.<br><h2><b>Accept Help</b></h2><br>In March 2008 two of my former students, Mike and Taylor, invited my family to go spelunking in Spanish Moss Cave. We were all excited to accept the invitation, though we were not experienced rock climbers. Mike started us out early on the appointed morning to do a little training at an indoor gym, after which we hiked five miles into Rock Canyon and up to the cave entrance.<br><br>Upon arrival, Mike and Taylor took a few minutes to unlock the metal gate and arrange the ropes we would use to rappel into the cave. Taylor entered first, and then it was my turn.<br><br>The initial descent is into a corkscrew-shaped crack in the rocks that twists downward for fifteen to twenty feet before it finally opens into the domed roof of the cave. Once through the crack, we each rappelled approximately fifty feet down to a sloped floor that continued into the belly of the cave.<br><br>We spent a couple of hours exploring, marveling at the oddly shaped formations along the way. As we picked our way through the loosely marked trail, our only light source, beyond the occasional flash from my husband's camera, was the light produced by our headlamps. I could see only a small circular area directly in front of me that quickly faded into blackness. Limited by the darkness and the unfamiliar terrain, the progress was slow.<br><br>At the bottom of the cave, just before we turned around, Taylor took a picture of my family--my daughter Shamae, Spencer, and my son Riley. Ilike recalling this part of the journey because I remember feeling charged with the exhilaration of a great adventure with my family. It captures the pinnacle of my experience. I felt triumphant, like I had accomplished something different, something unique and special. But I would not carry that same feeling with me out of the cave.<br><br>The return trip was harder than the descent, largely due to the lack of light. I look back at the photos we took and wonder why I was trying to scramble over rocks when there seemed to be a clear path just a few feet to the side. I can see those pathways now with the benefit of flash photography, but at the time I was not able to see the route with any clarity.<br><br>We clambered back up to the domed room, but the real challenge remained: we still had to negotiate the rope that hung from the ceiling and disappeared into the winding rock exit above. And this time we would be climbing up with the assistance of ascenders instead of dropping effortlessly down.<br><br>Mike ascended first and secured himself above with a second rope, ready to assist us. When it was my turn to exit, Taylor stabilized the bottom of the rope and Mike positioned himself in the corkscrew to coach me through the process. I had only learned to use the ascenders that morning, and although it had seemed simple in the climbing gym, I struggled to get my arms and legs to work together now.<br><br>I managed to inch about halfway up the rope before I had to stop, slumping down in the climbing harness to rest my legs. But fear would not let me rest my arms. I clung tightly to the ascenders, refusing to let go and unable to relax. I spent several minutes dangling twenty-five feet above the ground, mustering the necessary strength to keep climbing.<br><br>I gathered myself and continued up the remaining visible length of rope until the top ascender would move no further. I had reached the rock above and needed to let go of the ascenders. This was the only way I could find handholds and ­continue climbing.<br><br>Again, fear took hold of me, and I had neither the strength nor the fortitude to let go. Every muscle in my body shook, and I began to contemplate what living in a cave might be like. In this panic-stricken state, I heard Mike talking above me. He was telling me to relax and to stay calm, giving me instructions on where to reach.<br><br>I pointed my headlamp upward to shed light onmy path, but I could not see any suitable holds, so I told Mike, "I cannot do this."<br><br>I looked up again hoping to see him, but because of the curvature of the rock I could only hear his voice. He tried different instructions, but there was no way I was letting go of those ascenders. I didn't trust the rock, I didn't trust myself, and I didn't trust my ability to leave the perceived safety of the gear to which I clung. I remember hearing some movement above me and then ­nothing. Then Mike told me to take his hand.<br><br>This time when I looked up, I could see Mike's forearm, with his hand open wide. I laughed out loud. "You are just going to pull me up one-handed?" I asked.<br><br>"Sure!" he said confidently. We argued the relative merits of this idea for a time, me telling Mike that it was impossible for him to just yank me up there with no leverage while harnessed to a rope and cramped in a crevice and Mike insisting that he could do it. Given that I am telling you this story from the Marriott Center and not from inside Spanish Moss Cave, you can guess who won that argument.<br><br>Looking up again, I was seized with the realization that I really didn't want to stay in the cave forever. I wanted to go home. This awareness gave me the courage to trust Mike and reach for his hand. One moment I was dangling from the dome and the next I was wedged into the crevice, still clinging to one ascender with my free hand. Icould finally relax my arms.<br><br>Then Mike's steady and confident voice guided me farther up the twisting exit: "Move one hand up. Reach your foot farther to the left. Switch hands in that hold. Use your legs. Stretch a little farther."<br><br>Mike kept me moving in the right direction until we encountered one last challenge: I was too short to reach the next hold and too timid to make a swing for it. Mike suggested that he try to pass me in the crevice, get beneath me, and then boost me up to the hold. I was not sure the maneuver would work, but by this point I was humbled enough to listen to his advice. Mike managed to find a way around me and secure himself against the wall just below me. When he told me to use his back as a step stool to reach the next hold, I had visions of me standing on his back, his hands slipping against the rock under my weight, and his body falling through the hole in the cave ceiling. We again argued over the merits of his crazy idea--I am a stubborn one--but I finally gave in and stepped on Mike, who held firm so that Icould reach the hold I needed. From there it was a relatively easy climb to the open air, and I soon found myself alone with my thoughts while Mike returned to assist the others.<br><br>Sitting on top of that hill looking out over the valley, I couldn't suppress a nagging feeling of defeat that contrasted starkly with my proud moment at the bottom of the cave. I replayed everything that had just happened. Did Mike really pull me up from the top of a fifty-foot drop? Did I really step on him? Was I really that needy? Yes, yes, and yes.<br><br>We are all that needy. Perhaps you would have fared better than I did in Spanish Moss Cave, but we all, at one time or other, will be in a situation in which our strength or knowledge or skill or perhaps even our desire is not enough. These are the times when your Savior pulls you up out of the darkness--if you will let go and take His hand. These are the times when His voice guides you to safety--if you will listen carefully. And it is for these times that He descended below all things--to become your stepping-stone.<br><br>I love these words of Elder JeffreyR. Holland:<br><br><i>When</i>[the Savior]<i>says ..., "Come unto me," He means He knows the way out and He knows the way up. He knows it because He has walked it. He knows the way because He</i><b><i>is</i></b><i>the way.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Things to Mend</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2006; emphasis in original]<br><br>I asked Mike recently whether he was ever concerned about getting me out of the cave that day. Without even thinking about the answer, he replied, "No, there was always a plan. I carried all kinds of gear you never saw. There is always a way. Sometimes it is 5 percent me and 95 percent the other person; sometimes it is 99 percent me and 1 percent the other person. But I know I can work with whatever the person has to give."<br><br>Our Savior is the same. He can work with ­whatever you have to give if you are willing toaccept His help.<br><br>Brian K. Ashton of the Sunday School general presidency reminded us that "repentance is not a backup plan just in case our plan to live perfectly fails." He also said, "[Repentance] is not just for big sins but is a daily process of self-evaluation and improvement that helps us to overcome our sins, our imperfections, our weaknesses, and our inadequacies" ("The Doctrine of Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2016).<br><br>Living perfectly is not the plan. Repentance is the plan. Jesus Christ is the plan. I think we erroneously equate perfection with living a perfect life, with never failing or falling short, but Jesus Christ is the only one who ever did or ever will do that. Perfection for us, then, must be about something else.<br><br>John S. Robertson explained in a BYU devotional that our understanding of the word<i>perfect</i>has changed over the last 400 years: whereas we use<i>perfect</i>to mean "flawless" today, its Latinate root meant something closer to "finished." Furthermore, the Hebrew word that was translated as "perfect" in the Bible might have been more accurately translated as "complete" (see"<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/john-s-robertson_complete-look-perfect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Complete Look at Perfect</a>," BYU devotional address, 13 July 1999). Perfection, for us, is not about being flawless; it is about being finished.<br><br>Artists who practice the Japanese art form<i>kintsugi</i>repair broken pottery by filling the cracks with a lacquer made from gold, silver, or platinum, restoring the damaged piece to something beautiful and whole. Kintsugi teaches that scars are not something to hide; rather, they are to be celebrated for the unique beauty they exhibit. The scars themselves are considered precious and therefore are mended with precious metals to honor their value. The finished piece is even more beautiful than the unbroken original.<br><br>Similarly, we honor the scars of our Savior, forHe has graven us on the palms of His hands (see Isaiah 49:16). He is not ashamed of His scars. On the contrary, He has given us this invitation:<br><br><i>Arise and come forth ... that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am .. . the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i>[3 Nephi 11:14]<br><br>When we turn our broken pieces over to the Savior, our gaps are filled with Him--with His perfection--and we are made complete; we are finished by the Great Creator through the restorative power of "the author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2). We come to know the Savior not just by recognizing and reverencing His scars but by recognizing and reverencing our own. We are bound to the Savior through our mutual scars, "and with His stripes we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5; see also verse 4).<br><br>I echo the words of Elder Holland:<br><br>[When]<i>you are lonely, please know you can find comfort.</i>[When]<i>you are discouraged, please know you can find hope.</i>[When]<i>you are poor in spirit, please know you can be strengthened.</i>[When]<i>you feel you are broken, please know you can be mended.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2006/04/broken-things-to-mend?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Things to Mend</a>"]<br><br>Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, desires to mend your broken pieces, fill your empty spaces, and make of you a vessel that is more beautiful and whole.<br><br>May you each find the strength to fail and, in the hands of your Savior, the power to finish. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cassy Budd, a professor in the BYU School of Accountancy, delivered this devotional address onFebruary 14, 2017.</i><br><br>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>t of Consequences: The Cumulative Result of All Choices - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the most cunning aspects of the adversary's efforts to thwart our Father in Heaven's plan of happiness is his deceitful teaching that there is no evil influence or devil<sup>1</sup> and his attempt to redefine evil as good and good as evil, darkness as light and light as darkness, and bitter as sweet and sweet as bitter!<sup>2</sup><br><br>This is sometimes called a paradigm shift--or "when the usual way of thinking about or doing something is replaced by a new and different way,"<sup>3</sup> thus portraying things to be exactly the opposite of what they really are. In his classic novel <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> C.S. Lewis wrote from a senior devil's point of view. Lewis inverted traditional values using irony and satire to make evil appear good and good appear evil.<sup>4</sup><br><br>In this vein I had a provocative meeting with an internationally recognized advertising expert a few months ago. He is an unusually gifted and creative thinker. We were discussing the influence of evil and the consequences of bad choices.<br><br>He envisioned an interesting hypothetical account of the adversary (Lucifer) meeting with an advertising agency. The adversary described his dilemma: He and his followers had rebelled and rejected the Father's plan and had come to understand they could not prevail against God. Lucifer understood that while the Father's plan was about joy and happiness, his own plan was resulting in grief and misery. The problem, Lucifer explained to the ad executive, was how to attract followers.<br><br>After contemplating this problem, it was determined that Lucifer's only hope of success was to achieve a paradigm shift or values inversion--in other words, to characterize the Father's plan as resulting in grief and misery and Lucifer's plan as resulting in joy and happiness.<br><br>While this contemplated meeting with an advertising agency is hypothetical, it serves a useful purpose. The truth is, not only do the enemies of Father's plan attempt to undermine the doctrine and principles of the plan, but they also attempt to mischaracterize the blessings that flow from the plan. Their basic effort is to make that which is good, righteous, and joyful seem utterly miserable.<br><br>I will discuss some of the adversary's efforts to mischaracterize and undermine the blessings of living according to the Father's plan.<br><h2><b>Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>My first example is the Word of Wisdom. I fully recognize that you magnificent students understand the importance of the Word of Wisdom and have agreed, on your honor, to live by it. However, over the course of a lifetime I have seen many of my friends' lives blighted and sometimes destroyed by alcohol. An alcohol culture isn't just about Church doctrine; it is about the health and happiness of everyone. You can be an important voice in educating society about the consequences of this issue.<br><br>In the Father's plan, the Word of Wisdom--section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants, given because of "evils and designs ... of conspiring men"--provides health principles. It is "adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints." It sets forth particulars, including that "wine or strong drink [i.e., alcohol] ... is not good." Tobacco and hot drinks (i.e., tea and coffee) are "not for the body."<sup>5</sup> This revelation also advocates wholesome health practices with a promise. It promises those acting in obedience to the divine command great physical and spiritual rewards.<sup>6</sup> They "shall receive health ... and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge."<sup>7</sup><br><br>The distortion--paradigm shift--that the adversary utilizes is clearly illustrated by his advocacy for tobacco and alcohol.<br><br>Even the hypothetical advertising agency would have a hard time casting tobacco in a favorable light today. The Word of Wisdom revelation was received in 1833. In 1921 President HeberJ. Grant, inspired by the Lord, called on all Saints to more fully live the Word of Wisdom. At the time, mass marketing and glamorization in the movies made cigarette smoking appear fashionable, sophisticated, and fun. It wasn't until 1964, forty-three years later, that the surgeon general of the United States concluded, "Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action."<sup>8</sup><br><br>The statistics today with respect to cigarette smoking are not in dispute. Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to develop heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. It is estimated to increase the risk of lung cancer by twenty-five times.<sup>9</sup><br><br>So what the adversary portrayed as fashionable, sophisticated, and fun has in fact resulted in misery and untimely death for millions of people.<br><br>Alcohol is another example. Think again of the adversary's campaign and of how BYU's Honor Code has been portrayed. We are all pleased that BYU consistently rates as the highest "stone cold sober school." The word <i>stone</i> as an adverb can mean "entirely, utterly."<sup>10</sup> <i>Cold</i> as an adverb can mean "with utter finality: absolutely, completely."<sup>11</sup> <i>Sober</i> can be defined as alcoholic abstinence.<br><br>Some other schools are identified as "party schools," which is understood to mean they have alcohol parties. <i>Party</i> is defined as "a gathering for social entertainment, or the entertainment itself."<sup>12</sup><br><br>To the average young person looking for higher education--particularly those not of our faith--"stone cold sober" might sound like misery, and "party" might sound like having fun and being joyful.<br><br>Over many years I have followed a research project that commenced in the 1940s. Initially there were 268 men attending Harvard University who were periodically studied over their entire lives. Later, others, including women, became part of the study. The goal of the original study was to find out about success and happiness. The study showed that college entrance scores and grade averages did not predict either success or ­happiness in later life.<br><br>This study contains three significant insights for me. First, adult happiness has a high correlation with childhood family happiness, especially love and affection from parents.<sup>13</sup> Second is the importance of a healthy, stable marriage to lifelong happiness.<sup>14</sup> Third is the negative effects of alcohol on marital and lifetime success and happiness. Alcohol abuse touches one-third of families and is involved in one-fourth of hospital admissions. It plays a major role in death, bad health, and ­diminished accomplishment.<sup>15</sup><br><br>In "Wine, Women and Danger," a recent <i>Washington Post</i> front-page article based on U.S. federal health data, it was reported that "women in America are drinking far more, and far more frequently, than their mothers or grandmothers did, and alcohol consumption is killing them in record numbers." The article concluded with comments by RobertD. Brewer that "the current and emerging science does not support the purported benefits of moderate drinking" and that "the risk of death from cancer appears to go up with any level of alcohol consumption."<sup>16</sup><br><br>In the last two or three years, many universities across the world have been trying to diminish alcohol use because of its connection to serious antisocial behaviors, including sexual assault and serious health concerns, especially from binge drinking. The terrible impact of alcohol on young brains is now medically established.<sup>17</sup><br><br>In reciting primarily personal health issues, I have not attempted to categorize other serious alcohol impacts such as accidents while driving under the influence, men trying to excuse physical and sexual assaults because of alcohol impairment, and the effects on fetal brains from alcohol use during pregnancy.<sup>18</sup><br><br>As if cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, and an opiate epidemic<sup>19</sup> were not harmful enough to society, we now see the forces of evil pushing legalization of recreational marijuana.<br><br>To come back to our advertising analogy, "stone cold sober" is ultimately joy and happiness, and, in many cases, "party"--as in an alcohol party--isultimately grief and misery.<br><h2><b>Family Choices</b></h2><br>Family choices follow a similar pattern. In the Father's plan, the role of families is clearly set forth. In "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," weread:<br><br><i>The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>It is fairly common in today's world, in another paradigm shift, to trumpet alternative choices in a positive way that are in direct conflict with this plan and that are unfavorable to marriage and family. Let me mention a few.<br><ul><br> 	<li>The choice for both women and men to put education and careers ahead of marriage andfamily.</li><br> 	<li>The choice to purposefully have no or few children or to terminate pregnancy when it isinconvenient.<sup>21</sup></li><br> 	<li>The choice to engage in immoral conduct as a substitute for the sacred institution of marriage.</li><br></ul><br>The adversary has targeted women and has painted motherhood as a dead-end road of drudgery. He has targeted men and has painted fatherhood as unimportant and fidelity as "old-school." The alienation and objectification of pornography is an example of immoral conduct being substituted for the sacred institution of marriage. It underscores the horrific turning from truth and righteousness that the adversary seeks.<br><br>Inappropriate alternative choices are painted as appropriate in helping to achieve the worldly goals of freedom and equality. As a result of such choices, the average number of children a woman will bear in her lifetime is declining dramatically. It is estimated that 46 percent of the world lives in countries in which the fertility rate is below 2.1 children--the rate necessary for the population to remain stable. Most European and Asian countries are below this level. Italy and Japan are both at about 1.3 births. Japan is expected to decrease in population from 120 million to about 100 million by the year 2050.<sup>22</sup><br><br>This worldwide decline in population has been described by some as the "demographic winter."<sup>23</sup> Many countries are not having enough children toreplace the generation that is dying.<br><br>Let's see if we can illustrate this problem here in the Marriott Center. Will all of you who are the oldest child in your family please stand and remain standing? In today's world, in many of these countries, but not in the United States, most of the rest of you who are still seated would never have been born.<br><br>Thank you. Please be seated.<br><br>Now, everybody who is the third or later child in your family, please stand and remain standing. You would not have been born, even in the United States, if the current trends applied. Can you see why they call it the demographic winter?<br><br>Thank you. Please be seated.<br><br>Let me share one other reality that is of great concern to me. I had a sobering experience in Jerusalem last October. We visited the Children's Memorial, which is part of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. Elder JeffreyR. Holland and I, together with two American Jewish leaders, laid a remembrance wreath. As you move through the Children's Memorial, the first names of the children and their ages at death are announced one after another with a background of music that portrays this terrible atrocity. It is believed that more than one million Jewish children were killed during the Holocaust.<sup>24</sup><br><br>As I experienced the museum, I was overcome with emotion and completely devastated. Standing outside to regain my composure, I reflected on the horror of the experience and suddenly realized that in the United States alone there are as many abortions every two years<sup>25</sup> as the number of Jewish children killed in the Holocaust during the Second World War.<br><br>Now, as a lawyer, I am cognizant that the motives and intent of these two tragedies are entirely different. The Jewish children were killed because they were Jews, and there is no analogue to this in all history, but the intensity of my feeling was about the loss of children. Bringing children into the world is a sacred part of our Father in Heaven's plan of happiness. We are so numbed and intimidated by the immensity of the practice of abortion that many of us have pushed it to the back of our minds and try to keep it out of our consciousness. Clearly the adversary is attacking the value of children on many levels.<br><br>Abortion needs to be approached very carefully. This is a problem that will probably not be solved by personal condemnation or judgmental accusations. Some have cautioned to not judge a ship--or men or women--without understanding the length of the voyage and the storms encountered.<sup>26</sup> I might add, many who engage in this deplorable conduct do not have a testimony of the Savior or knowledge of the Father's plan.<br><br>However, for those who believe we are accountable to God--and even for many of those not of our faith who are secular but pride themselves on being on the so-called "right side of history"--this has become a tragedy of monumental proportions. When you combine it with the demographic winter that we have just explored, it is a serious moral blot on our society.<br><br>President SpencerW. Kimball taught:<br><br><i>Supreme happiness in marriage is governed considerably by a primary factor--that of the bearing and rearing of children. ... The Church cannot approve nor condone</i> ...<i> measures which</i> ...<i> greatly limit the family.</i><sup>27</sup><br><br>With respect to the number and spacing of children, the health of the mother must be considered, and the decision should be made <i>prayerfully</i> by husbands and wives.<sup>28</sup> Such decisions should never be judged by outsiders.<sup>29</sup> Some faithful Saints are not able to have children or may not have the opportunity to marry. They will receive every blessing at the ultimate banquet of consequences.<sup>30</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, Lucifer has supported abortion and convinced many people in a horrific paradigm shift that children represent lost opportunity and misery instead of joy and happiness.<br><br>As Latter-day Saints, we must be at the forefront of changing hearts and minds on the importance of children. The attacks on the family that I just described ultimately result in grief and misery.<br><br>The Lord has declared that His work and His glory is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."<sup>31</sup> The plan is established through families. Every family member is important, and their roles are beautiful, glorious, and fulfilling.<br><br>The family proclamation could not be more clear about the consequences of choices inconsistent with the Father's plan. It unequivocally proclaims:<br><br><i>We warn that the disintegration of the family will bringupon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.</i><sup>32</sup><br><br>This clearly sets forth the ultimate banquet of consequences and the cumulative impact of choices not in accordance with the Father's plan ofhappiness.<br><br>In all marriages and in raising children there are challenges and sacrifices. But the rewards both in this life and in the eternities are breathtakingly beautiful. They emanate from a loving Father in Heaven.<br><h2><b>Prospering in the Land</b></h2><br>Most of you are on the verge of that period of life in which financial matters and the choices you make about them are exceedingly important. A familiar scripture found in Alma 36:30--and similarly in many other places in the Book of Mormon--has two parts. It reads, "Inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land." The second part reads, "Inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence." It is clear that having the blessing of the Holy Spirit is aprincipal element of prospering in the land.<br><br>Along with having the Spirit, sacred teachings of the Church establish having sufficient for our needs as the best measure of temporal prosperity. Lucifer's paradigm shift here is to elevate the seeking of great wealth and the acquisition of highly visible luxury products. Some seem absolutely driven to achieve the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Excess wealth is not promised to faithful members, nor does it usually bring happiness.<br><br>As a people, the Latter-day Saints have indeed prospered. Some achieve wealth as the result of very worthwhile and appropriate pursuits and use that wealth to bless mankind and further the Lord's purposes.<br><br>Wise financial principles include seeking the kingdom of God first; working, planning, and spending wisely; planning for the future; and using wealth to build up the kingdom of God.<br><br>Many years ago President N.Eldon Tanner gave a classic talk entitled "Constancy Amid Change." The principles he taught are as applicable today as when he taught them:<br><br>First, "pay an honest tithing."<br><br>Second, "live on less than you earn."<br><br>Third, "learn to distinguish between needs and wants." In doing so, remember that yesterday's luxuries have in some cases become today's necessities.<br><br>Fourth, "develop and live within a budget" but plan on the unexpected.<br><br>Fifth, "be honest in all your financial affairs."<sup>33</sup><br><br>President Tanner's admonition to live on less than you earn is a fundamental principle. In its most simple form, this is the principle: If you earn $100 and you only spend $95, you will be happy. Ifyou earn $100 and you spend $105, this could be a recipe for misery.<br><h2><b>Lucifer's Objective Is to Undermine the Father'sPlan</b></h2><br>In addition to portraying blessings as misery, Lucifer's objective is to undermine the Father's plan and destroy faith in Jesus Christ and His doctrine. The assault on the Bible and the divinity of Jesus Christ has never been more pronounced in my lifetime than it is today. As the scriptures predicted, Lucifer is using many devices to accomplish this objective.<br><br>As Helaman taught:<br><br><i>Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>It is one thing to be misled by the adversary. It is another to be one of his mercenaries. Elder NealA. Maxwell, as usual, said it beautifully:<br><br><i>How tragic it is that so many mortals are mercenaries for the adversary ... and are ... bought off at such low prices. A little status, a little money, a little praise, a little fleeting fame, and they are willing to do the bidding of him who can offer all sorts of transitory "rewards," but who has no celestial currency.</i><sup>35</sup><br><br>This echoes the famous words of Alma speaking of Korihor, who had spread the old militant atheist lies and then discovered that "the devil will not support his children at the last day."<sup>36</sup><br><br>There is probably no better example of the impact of mercenaries than Lehi's vision of the tree of life and the great and spacious building in the Book of Mormon. There were those in the vision who pointed fingers at those who had grasped the rod of iron and had even partaken of the fruit of the tree. The mocking caused the partakers to be "ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost."<sup>37</sup><br><br>Thus, bad choices result in a banquet with ­bitter, rancid, nasty, and miserable results.<br><br>Compare this to the glorious banquet of consequences that is promised to you who are faithful. You will "be filled with the glory of the Lord" and "sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of" your body, and all that the Father hath will begiven toyou.<sup>38</sup><br><br>In such a banquet of consequences, the spiritual food we feast upon is delicious, savory, sweet, succulent, nourishing, and fulfilling and will allow our hearts to rejoice. When we "come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted,"<sup>39</sup> we can follow the narrow path and the straight course that will bring us to the Holy One of Israel, "for the Lord God is his name."<sup>40</sup><br><br>Isaiah has promised that at the final banquet of consequences the Lord of Hosts "will swallow up death" and "wipe away tears" from all faces, and "we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation."<sup>41</sup><br><br>I leave my sure witness of the Father's glorious plan and of the Savior's love, Atonement, Resurrection, and divine guidance, in the name ofJesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Quentin L.

<h1>r of Your Words - Craig Manning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to explain the sequence of how I was first contacted to speak at this devotional. It was on a Monday that I got a text message from a number I didn't recognize. It had been a hectic day, and I didn't read the text fully. Thinking it was a request to speak at an upcoming Church assignment, I texted back politely asking who the text was from.<br><br>MatthewO. Richardson, BYU advancement vice president, responded that it was he who had sent the text asking me to speak at a BYU devotional.<br><br>The first thought that popped into my mind was, "Are you crazy? Do you not realize that I can barely speak the English language, let alone speak in front of so many people?"<br><br>My wife, who was with me at the time, responded without hesitation, "That is desperation, not inspiration!"<br><br>I texted President Richardson back with, "Ithink you have the wrong Craig Manning."<br><br>He then replied, "Oops, sorry, I do have the wrong person!" But he then clarified that he did have the right person.<br><br>As intimidating as it is to speak in front of you, the experience of preparing for this devotional has been great. I have found that every time I have put on the radio, in every activity I have participated in, and with every thought I have had, I have double-checked myself to make sure I was in alignment with the Holy Ghost so as to have the Spirit with me. I do pray that the Spirit will be with me today as I deliver my thoughts.<br><br>I would like to talk to you today about a couple of life-changing lessons the Lord has taught me.<br><br>I was born and raised in Canberra, Australia. My mother was, and still is, a Catholic, and my father was a member of the Church of England before he passed away from cancer twenty years ago. We attended church on Sundays, and I attended Sunday School, completing my first Holy Communion. As I got older, I started playing rugby. Games were on Sundays, and it wasn't long before we stopped attending church.<br><br>I remember coming home from a rugby game one Sunday when my mother said to me, "You are really good at sports, so you won't be very good at school."<br><br>This statement confused me. Although I didn't have the maturity and clarity of thought at the time to articulate my emotions, I can look back now and see why this statement bothered me. Was there some phenomenon that controlled my destiny? I couldn't help being good at sports; it just seemed to happen. Every time I participated in an athletic contest, I was reminded that I was a good athlete. So did that mean I had no chance of ever being a good student, and did I have any say in any of this?<br><br>I don't share this story to accuse my mother of bad parenting but rather to illustrate what can happen when we don't understand the Lord's plan or, more important, when we don't learn to live and apply the gospel of Jesus Christ. I spent my teenage years focusing the majority of my attention on sports, particularly on tennis, while directing little attention to my academics. Doing so had become a habit, and I never really stopped to consider doing anything different. This was not to say that I wasn't attending school; I never missed a class unless ill. But just because I was there physically did not mean I was there mentally. I was passing classes without really learning anything. I don't believe I was unintelligent; I was just never really paying attention.<br><h2><b>Faith Is a Belief and an Action</b></h2><br>From the <i>Lectures on Faith </i>we read<i>:</i><br><br><i>"Now faith is the substance (assurance) of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."</i> [Hebrews 11:1]<br><br><i> From this we learn that faith is the assurance which men have of the existence of things which they have not seen, and the principle of </i><b><i>action</i></b><i> in all intelligent beings.</i> [7 (1.8–9); emphasis added]<br><br>My personal interpretation of this passage is that without a belief that it is possible to be successful in the classroom, we will not put forth any action toward being successful. I had been in the classroom physically but not mentally; my mind was somewhere else. When I was in high school, my mind was more often than not on the tennis court.<br><br>Another passage from the <i>Lectures on Faith</i> reads:<br><br><i>If men were duly to consider themselves, and turn their thoughts and reflections to the </i><b><i>operations of their own minds,</i></b><i> they would readily discover that it is faith, and faith only, which is the moving cause of </i><b><i>all action</i></b><i> </i><i>in them; that without it </i><b><i>both mind and body</i></b><i> would be in a state of inactivity, and all their exertions would cease, both physical and mental.</i> [7 (1.10); emphasis added]<br><br>My personal interpretation of this passage is that we don't do anything without first putting in the mental effort. If we are not mentally engaged, we do nothing--or, at best, we do very little.<br><br>On the tennis court I had, first, the belief that Iwas good or could be good, which then, second, led to the physical effort and hard work. In the classroom I did not believe I was smart or could be smart; I turned up physically but did not apply myself mentally.<br><br>I love Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i> And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><br><br>To me, these two scriptures map out the formula for success: we need to work hard both mentally and physically to increase our knowledge and intelligence.<br><h2><b>The Danger of Self-Doubt</b></h2><br>By the time I had graduated from year twelve, Ihad become an accomplished tennis player, and Iwas selected to travel around Europe with a team of Australian prospects. We spent the first month in France, traveling around playing in small pro tournaments. It was at the end of the winter, so the tournaments were on fast indoor courts. Because I am from Australia and I grew up playing on artificial grass courts, my tennis game was built for quick, explosive points. I did well the first month, performing to my potential and winning a lot of matches on the fast indoor courts. Ithought, "This is it; I am making my dreams come true."<br><br>Feeling really good about myself, I left France with my team and headed for Austria. The first tournament of the summer was on slow red clay. If you don't understand the mechanics of the greatest game ever invented--and, I might add, the toughest mental sport to master--going from fast indoor courts to slow red clay requires a dramatic shift in skill sets. For the first time--and the only time in my forty years of playing tennis--Ilost 6–0 6–0, a double bagel, we call it. It rocked my world. I had no idea what had gone wrong. Unwisely, I dwelled on my deficiencies from the match for days; a week later I was still dwelling on the loss. At the time I didn't realize I was doing anything wrong.<br><br>I have since learned that dwelling obsessively on what we do wrong is one of the greatest sources of interference to maximizing our potential. Self-doubt is dangerous. I once had a young thirteen-year-old snowboarder, in answer to my question of what it means to doubt yourself, say, "Don't say don't." It is unimaginable the damage that self-doubt does to your hopes, dreams, and hard-earned skills.<br><br>This is what doubt looked like for me: I would miss a backhand into the top of the net and say to myself, "Not again. Your backhand stinks. You can't make a backhand. Why do you even play this game? You just stink."<br><br>The problem with doubt is that it doesn't just stay isolated to your backhand. Doubt is a mental habit, and it can--and does--spread to other areas of your life.<br><br>Not identifying the root of the problem at the time, I struggled on the tour for the next year and a half, ending my pro tennis aspirations. My poor performance would later be a blessing because I never made any money and could still claim amateur status.<br><br>Since that time I have seen self-doubt in many people: athletes, coaches, musicians, students, and children. And as a bishop, I see it in the ward members who I am a steward over. Once self-doubt takes hold of an individual, action is halted. I believe doubt to be one of, if not the greatest of, the adversary's tools. It is the antithesis of faith. President ThomasS. Monson recently said, "Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/11/sunday-morning-session/be-an-example-and-a-light?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Be an Example and a Light</span></a>," <i>Ensign, </i>November 2015).<br><br>When the opportunity arose for me to come and play tennis at BYU, I thought it was an opportunity to reset. However, I quickly learned that practice does not make perfect; once a bad mental habit is created, it will not go away anytime soon. The problem for me was that I didn't know how to fix my bad mental habits. I knew faith was at the root of the answer, but how do you <i>do </i>faith? How do you apply faith on the tennis court, in the classroom, and in life from one moment to the next?<br><br>I thought that the answers might come from the field of psychology. I had always been fascinated by the mind, and I believed it was a key component to success not only on the tennis court but in life. I switched from studying accounting to studying psychology and began a journey that has led me to many personal discoveries.<br><h2><b>The Law of Occupied Space</b></h2><br>One of the greatest of these discoveries is that no matter how well the scientific method is applied to human behavior, if I cannot find the parallelism between a theory and the gospel of Jesus Christ, Iam very cautious of using that theory. If a connection can clearly be made between a natural law and the gospel, I have found that that law always helps people to be better.<br><br>One such law is the law of occupied space. This law states that an object can only occupy one place at a time. As it applies to the mind, both faith and fear, self-belief and self-doubt, or simply positive and negative thoughts cannot occupy the mind at the same time.<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 states:<br><br><i> There is a </i><b><i>law,</i></b><i> irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i> And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated. </i>[Emphasis added]<br><br>I interpret this to mean that any law that is discovered by a man or a woman was originally created by the Lord, and obtaining any ­blessings--such as winning a tennis match or building a loving relationship with a spouse--requires obedience to that law.<br><br>I love this law and have received tremendous blessings from learning how to apply it. When I was a student at BYU, I realized that I needed to think more positively. I started working on this, and every time I caught myself thinking or talking to myself in negative, reactive ways, saying, "Your backhand stinks" or "Don't miss that backhand," I would stop that thought and immediately replace it with thoughts such as "I love my backhand" or "I am going to rip it down the line." And instead of saying to myself, "School is tough; BYU is too hard for me," I started telling myself, "I've got this; I can get good grades." At some point I realized that I would always say to myself, "Don't forget this" or "You'd better not forget this for the exam," so one of my favorite phrases became "Iwill remember this."<br><br>It took some time, but everything started to change. I was playing amazing tennis (at least for me), and I was studying half the time and getting better grades--a lot better. More important, there was no more fear. This change in thinking was a constant work in progress, and I constantly battled to apply the Lord's lessons.<br><h2><b>Faith Begins with How You Talk to Yourself</b></h2><br>What is potentially the greatest lesson the Lord has taught me is that faith begins with how you talk to yourself.<br><br>From the <i>Lectures on Faith</i> we read:<br><br><i>It is by words . . . with which every being works when he works by faith. God said, "Let there be light, and there was light." Joshua spake, and the great lights which God had created stood still. Elijah commanded, and the heavens were stayed for the space of three years and six months, so that it did not rain. . . . All this was done by faith. . . . Faith, then, works by words; and with these </i>[words]<i> its mightiest works have been, and will be, performed.</i> [61 (7.3)]<br><br>As I continued my education, my passion for wanting to understand the application of true principles and facts continued to grow. I was fortunate that BYU hired me as the women's head tennis coach, and I worked hard to apply what I was being taught. As the time arrived to do my dissertation, I wanted to study how attentional control, or focus, impacted human performance. While working on my dissertation, I would awake early in the morning and pray for guidance from the Lord. It was a draining experience; having a full-time job, four kids, and a dissertation to write did not come easy for me. I will forever be indebted to my wife's sacrifices during this period of time.<br><br>Out of this experience the Lord taught me how to take principles, facts, or ideas and break them down into actionable knowledge. This process is called mind mapping or coding the mind, turning knowledge into an action or a skill, and it applies not only to physical skills but to mental skills. Mind mapping is accomplished through the creation of relevant cues. A relevant cue is two to three actionable words that act as triggers and that are exact enough to hold an individual's attention under extreme pressure or extreme boredom. These cues enable an individual to direct his or her attention to very specific actions, rapidly creating relevant skills.<br><br>I applied this process to my coaching and was amazed by the dramatic increase in performance from the tennis players I was working with. Prior to using relevant cues, I would work hard during a one-hour tennis lesson to have the athlete hitting the ball well by the end of the hour, only to have the athlete return for the next lesson and have to spend the first twenty to thirty minutes going back over what we had last worked on. Retention was not where it needed to be.<br><br>When we used relevant cues, the athlete's ­retention increased to the point that it would take amaximum of only five minutes to review the skills the athlete had learned in the ­previous ­lesson, as the skills had been retained. This increased retention allowed for rapid progression to the next skill. I started applying this process to other sports and then to business, then to music, and now to addiction recovery.<br><br>One athlete I worked with using this method was a U.S. Olympic mogul skier who, seven months prior to the Vancouver Olympics, was on the C team and was not ranked very high. Her coach approached me and asked me to work with her with the hope that she might be ready to compete at the Sochi Olympics four and a half years down the road. I remember the conversation. The coach wanted to test the effectiveness of mental strength training. He said to me that this particular athlete would do what I asked and that she was my guinea pig.<br><br>The athlete worked hard on training her thoughts to be positive and proactive and on using relevant cues to purify her thought patterns. She did everything I asked. On November 19 she called me in tears. She had just made the last discretionary position on the World Cup tour. This was a subjective coaches' decision to bring someone onto the World Cup team who had minimal professional experience.<br><br>As the season progressed through the early winter months, this athlete continued to develop her skills rapidly to the point that, by the time the World Cup at Deer Valley came around at the end of January, she was sitting in tenth place on the tour. She had achieved several fourth-place finishes to get to tenth in the world, but she had never finished on the podium.<br><br>One of the tools I like the athletes I work with to have is a power statement. A power statement is a tool to use when doubt comes at critical moments. It floods the mind with positive, strong thoughts and instantly squeezes out any negative thoughts and emotions.<br><br>After the prequalifying races, this athlete was in fourth place. She attended to all of the media obligations, family commitments, and so forth and then came over to talk to me. This is the conversation that transpired:<br><br>Athlete: "I don't think today is my day."<br><br>Me: "Really?"<br><br>Athlete: "There is a ton of media here and a lot friends and family. I don't think today is my day."<br><br>Me: "Yeah, you just stink, don't you!"<br><br>Athlete: "What?"<br><br>Me: "Well, is that the right mindset?"<br><br>Athlete: "Oh, right. I need to remember my power statement."<br><br>She told me after the event that when she had gotten on the chairlift to go up for her finals run, the doubt had gotten in again. She began telling herself, "It's okay. No one expected me to do this well. My family will still love me."<br><br>She then caught herself and said, "No! Today is my day! I am making it happen today!"<br><br>She told me she was feeling good mentally while being processed for her run. And then, while standing in line only two athletes away from her turn, the doubt came in again: "It is okay. No one expects me to--"<br><br>This time she was mad. She got out of her skis, walked out of the starter's box, and yelled up into the mountain, "Today is my day! I am making it happen today!"<br><br>I could see her determination as she came back into the starter's gate. She put on her skis and grabbed her poles with purpose.<br><br>This athlete ended up skiing faster than she had ever skied before. She was farther on the front of her boots, she got bigger air, and she finished tied for first place. Two days later she backed up her performance with a second-place win.<br><br>This athlete, who only six months earlier was called a guinea pig, went to the Vancouver Olympics as the number-two mogul skier in the world and as our top U.S. mogul skier. All of this happened because she applied the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I love studying the Lord's mysteries, and I love the Book of Mormon. I make these comments in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Craig L.

<h1>rine of Christ: Our Daily Walk - Douglas D. Holmes - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is difficult to express what a surreal experience it is for me to stand at this pulpit and speak at a BYU devotional. For many years I have been somewhat of a BYU devotional junkie. When I was a student here, I discovered that you could purchase cassette tapes of selected devotional talks, and I bought several. I remember well StephenR. Covey's talk "An Educated Conscience."<sup>1</sup>Listening to TrumanG. Madsen's talk "House of Glory" was perhaps the best temple preparation I received.<sup>2</sup>Nowadays I have the BYU Speeches podcast and listen regularly.<br><br>In all my years of listening to these devotionals, it never occurred to me that I would be speaking in one. Since receiving this assignment a few months ago, I have pondered and prayed earnestly to know what the Lord would have me share. As I pondered, I was reminded of these words from President DieterF. Uchtdorf:<br><br><i>Strength comes ... from being settled on a firm foundation of truth and light. It comes from placing our attention and efforts on the basics of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. It comes from paying attention to the divine things that matter most.</i><br><br><i>Let us simplify our lives a little. Let us make the changes necessary to refocus our lives on the sublime beauty of the simple, humble path of Christian ­discipleship--the path that leads always toward a life of meaning, gladness, and peace.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>We live in days in which the mists of darkness are "exceedingly great."<sup>4</sup>Satan is "the father of lies,"<sup>5</sup>and his lies "blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men."<sup>6</sup>One of Satan's subtle but more pervasive strategies is to distract us from the things that matter most with a never-ending array of mind-numbing trivialities.<br><br>With President Uchtdorf's counsel burning in my heart, I will focus today "on the basics of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ"--"the sublime ... path of Christian discipleship." My great desire is for each of us to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him."<sup>7</sup>My message is centered in that quest and how we can be more diligent, joyful, and successful in that journey.<br><br>As you begin a new year and a new semester, I hope that some of what I say will help you focus your goals on "the divine things that matter most." I invite you to pay close attention to what the Holy Ghost whispers to your heart during our time together. More important than the words I speak, I pray that your hearts and minds will be open to receive light and truth from the Holy Ghost. The light and truth that the Restoration of the fulness of the gospel has brought about can push away all darkness from our minds and lives. We need to remember that the Lord has also described our day as "noon-day."<sup>8</sup><br><br><b>Our Identity</b><br><br><b></b>A foundational truth we need to clearly understand is our divine identity. Since you were a child, many of you have been taught and have sung, "I am a child of God, And he has sent me here,"<sup>9</sup>and as you have sung and listened, you have felt the Spirit witness this truth to you.<br><br>Unfortunately, as with any basic truth that is repeated often, there is a danger that it may become trite. In other words, we say it, hear it, and sing it so frequently that we may not give much thought to what it actually means to be a child of God.<br><br>Knowing what it means to be a child of God requires us to come to know God. Only as God is revealed to us through the Holy Ghost can we comprehend the inheritance that can be ours as His children. As God's glory, attributes, and perfections are revealed to us, the reality of being "sons and daughters, children of a King"<sup>10</sup>pierces our hearts and fills us with hope and joy.<br><br>However, coming to know God is not for the spiritually lazy. He can only be known through revelation, and powerful personal revelation from the Holy Ghost requires diligent seeking and righteous living.<br><br>Joseph Smith said, "It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God."<sup>11</sup>Joseph also gave us insights into the effort required to understand who God is. He said: "The things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out."<sup>12</sup>If we want to know God and His Son, we would do well to turn off our devices, remove other distractions, and spend meaningful time in "careful and ponderous and solemn" thought.<br><br>I invite you to be serious about your study of God and your pursuit to truly know Him. He is revealed by His prophets and through the power of the Holy Ghost as we seek Him. "No message appears in scripture more times, and in more ways than, 'Ask, and ye shall receive.'"<sup>13</sup>When Ihear this invitation, I hear a loving Father pleading with His children to learn of Him and commune with Him.<sup>14</sup><br><br>As we come to know God, we begin to really know ourselves and our potential. These two things cannot be separated. Joseph Smith taught, "If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves."<sup>15</sup>As we come to know God--and consequently ourselves--better, we will see more clearly and understand more deeply what it means to be His sons and daughters. We will start to glimpse the profound fact that we have divine DNA within us as well as God's transcendent promise that we can receive and possess all that He has and is.<sup>16</sup><br><br>But there is another critical dimension in coming to know God. Just as a shallow understanding of God leads to a shallow understanding of our true identity, a naïve understanding of being God's children can blind us to the reality of our present state. What will strike you as you come to know God more fully is your current, relative nothingness. That is what happened to Moses when he came to understand His true identity as a son of God. He declared: "Now ... I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed."<sup>17</sup><br><br>This confrontation with the reality of our fallen state is also illustrated in King Benjamin's message to his people. It is important to remember that King Benjamin described his people as being diligent "in keeping the commandments of the Lord."<sup>18</sup>These people were what we might call covenant-keeping Latter-day Saints. As King Benjamin delivered his angelic message, his people saw God and the Son more clearly than they ever had before. This greater understanding of God caused them to view "themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth."<sup>19</sup>The knowledge of God's goodness, His matchless power, His wisdom, His patience, His long-suffering, and, most significantly, the sacrifice of His Son awakened them to a sense of their "worthless and fallen state."<sup>20</sup><br><br>That may not sound like much of a reward for coming to know God better. Don't we want a God who makes us feel good and builds us up? Yes, but we also want and worship a God of truth, a God who deals not in illusion but in reality, not in niceties but in power and glory. We don't simply want to know God, we want to become like Him, and until we see ourselves as we really are, we can't become what He really is.<br><br><b>The Fall</b><br><br><b></b>Thus, to understand our identity, we need to understand the Fall--the reality that King Benjamin's people finally confronted. President EzraTaft Benson taught:<br><br><i>Just as a man does not really desire food until he is hungry, so he does not desire the salvation of Christ until he knows why he needs Christ. No one adequately and properly knows why he needs Christ until he understands and accepts the doctrine of the Fall and itseffect upon all mankind.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>"The Fall" is how we commonly refer to those events that led to our current condition and the consequent opportunity for our exaltation.<sup>22</sup>But to understand the individual nature of the Fall, we need to see it at a personal level. Latter-day revelation teaches that because of Christ's Atonement, each of us is born into this world pure and innocent.<sup>23</sup>But we disobey God, lose our innocence, and become natural or fallen men and women.<sup>24</sup>We have each made an independent choice to sin--to hearken to the voice of Satan. We become, in the language of the scriptures, "subject to the will of the devil,"<sup>25</sup>which, tragically, becomes our own will.<sup>26</sup>In effect, we sell our birthright for a mess of pottage,<sup>27</sup>or, likethe prodigal son, spend our inheritance in riotous living.<sup>28</sup><br><br>When we understand that we are children of "the Most High God"<sup>29</sup>but also realize that we have made choices that prevent us from returning home, we understand how desperately we need Christ to regain what we have lost. We understand that we need another chance, a way to be born again.<br><br>Alma the Younger declared this clearly:<br><br><i>Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, allnations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</i><br><br><i>And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom ofGod.</i><sup>30</sup><br><br>To our great joy, God has provided a Savior who performed a perfect Atonement and provided a path for us to return home and receive all that He has. His covenant to us, His children, is that despite our inevitable fall, we can be transformed from beings whose impure hearts, desires, and wills cannot abide His presence into sanctified beings who can abide His glory. We can indeed be born again to a glorious inheritance. The robe, the ring, and the fatted calf can be ours again.<sup>31</sup><br><br><b>The Doctrine of Christ</b><br><br><b></b>But how are we born again? How do we grow in light and truth "until the perfect day"?<sup>32</sup>We walk the path God has prepared for us. That path is called "the doctrine of Christ."<sup>33</sup>It is the path that, for you returned missionaries, was the core of your purpose: "faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end."<sup>34</sup><br><br>The path is both beautifully simple and yet profoundly deep. The very simplicity of the path and our assumed sophistication can lead us to look beyond the mark, as Nephi's people did when he masterfully taught this doctrine.<sup>35</sup>Our desire for more intricate solutions may be one reason Christ strongly cautioned us with these words:<br><br><i>This is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.</i><br><br><i>And whoso shall declare</i><b><i>more or less</i></b><i>than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>I hope you will stay with me as we try to see the profound nature of this simple path, for it is through the doctrine of Christ that we access the power of Christ's Atonement in our lives. It is how we receive the enabling power of grace. It is how we are changed and become "partakers of [His] divine nature."<sup>37</sup><br><br>Rather than view the doctrine of Christ as a few items on a lengthy gospel checklist of things to do, I have found it helpful to see the doctrine of Christ as the daily path I walk to come unto Christ.<br><br><b>Faith in Jesus Christ</b><br><br><b></b>Faith in Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ is the source of every good gift. It is faith that motivates and inspires us to take all the other steps. Why repent or be baptized if we don't truly believe that Christ, by virtue of His Atonement, can save us from the hopelessness of our fallen state?<br><br>You may remember these words from King Benjamin's people when they confronted the reality of their fallen state: "O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified;<i>for we believe in Jesus Christ,</i>the Son of God."<sup>38</sup>Their "exceeding faith" in Jesus Christ delivered them from their hopeless state and filled their souls with joy.<sup>39</sup><br><br>We sometimes criticize our evangelical friends for their sole focus on believing in Christ to be saved, but it is through true faith in Christ--and Him alone--that we are saved. The Book of Mormon is a very clear witness of this.<sup>40</sup>We must recognize that faith in Christ is not static but that it can grow into exceeding and even perfect faith. Brothers and sisters, we must believe in Christ, and we must believe more than we do now.<sup>41</sup><br><br><b>Repent and Obey</b><br><br><b></b>A critical and powerful element of the doctrine of Christ is that each step is connected to and motivates the next. Faith always leads to repentance. Samuel the Lamanite taught, "If ye believe on his name ye will repent."<sup>42</sup>And, I would add, the more you believe, the more you will repent. This is simple celestial calculus: true faith in Christ is always "unto repentance."<sup>43</sup><br><br>Faith in Christ always leads to repentance because the more we learn of Christ and His character, perfections, and attributes, the more we trust Him and the more willing we are to give up our own agenda for His. We offer a broken heart to receive a new heart. Turning to Christ and following Him more diligently--or obedience--is the essence of repentance.<br><br>Sometimes I think we don't understand repentance. We tend to picture a tearful confession to the bishop regarding a violation of the law of chastity or some other serious transgression. Repentance is certainly needed in such cases. But more often repentence deals with the small and simple things in our lives that need to change. The Lord calls them "things which are not pleasing in my sight."<sup>44</sup>If we want to be holy as He is holy, we need to yield our hearts to Him.<sup>45</sup><br><br>God knows the next step you need to take in your journey to Him, and if you will ask and listen, He will tell you. As Elder LarryR. Lawrence said in a recent conference talk, the Spirit may surprise you with messages such as clean up your room, stop interrupting,<sup>46</sup>or manage distraction in your life and focus more on those around you. All of these are individual invitations to repent. The Holy Ghost will show us all things we should do,<sup>47</sup>and my experience is that He always invites me to turn and follow the Savior more closely. That is repentance.<br><br>Hugh Nibley shared this gem on repentance:<br><br><i>Who is righteous? Anyone who is repenting. No matter how bad he has been, if he is repenting, he is a righteous man. There is hope for him. And no matter how goodhe has been all his life, if he is not repenting, he is a wicked man.</i><sup>48</sup><br><br>The Lord has said, "Say nothing but repentance."<sup>49</sup>Maybe we should pay more attention tothat.<br><br><b>Ordinances</b><br><br><b></b>Our repentance leads to and is completed as we make covenants with God in ordinances. In the ordinances of baptism and the sacrament we witness our repentance and commitment to follow God in a physical sign--a "deed for word."<sup>50</sup>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught, "The renunciation of sin, coupled with our covenant of obedience, completes our repentance; indeed, repentance remains unfinished without that covenant."<sup>51</sup><br><br>Significantly, the ordinance of the sacrament confirms our repentance and renews all covenants we have entered into with the Lord, thus becoming a vital conduit for us to receive the power of godliness into our lives.<sup>52</sup>Our weekly physical witness of our commitment to remember and obey and of our willingness, even anxiousness, to take Christ's name upon us is a vital and empowering part of this journey. Through the sacrament we are also reminded that becoming like Christ is a step-by-step process: little by little, week by week, we are transformed.<br><br><b>Receiving the Holy Ghost</b><br><br><b></b>Ordinances unlock greater access to the Holy Ghost in our lives. When we understand the doctrine of Christ, our greatest desire is to receive the Holy Ghost.<sup>53</sup>Elder David A. Bednar declared:<br><br><i>The commandments from God we obey and the inspired counsel from Church leaders we follow principally focus upon obtaining the companionship of the Spirit. Fundamentally, all gospel teachings and activities are centered on coming unto Christ by receiving the Holy Ghost in our lives.</i><sup>54</sup><br><br>In my continuing quest to walk this path, I have been inspired by these words of Elder BruceR. McConkie:<br><br><i>As starving men crave a crust of bread, as choking men thirst for water, so do the righteous yearn for the Holy Ghost.</i><sup>55</sup><br><br>Elder McConkie also said:<br><br><i>There is no price too high</i>...,<i>no sacrifice too great, if out of it all we</i>...<i>enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i><sup>56</sup><br><br>It is in receiving the Holy Ghost that we receive "the baptism of fire."<sup>57</sup>This baptism removes the effects and the bondage of our sins and sanctifies us.<sup>58</sup><br><br>The Holy Ghost also imparts to us the fruits and gifts of the Spirit--the attributes and powers of God. Chief among those attributes is His perfect love--charity. "Charity is not an emotion or an action. It is not something we [simply] feel or do.<i>Charity is who the Savior is.</i>It is His most defining and dominant attribute."<sup>59</sup>God's promise is that the Holy Ghost will fill us with this perfect love.<sup>60</sup><br><br>C. S. Lewis observed, "After the first few steps in the Christian life we realise that everything which really needs to be done in our souls can be done only by God."<sup>61</sup>It is through the Holy Ghost that God does this marvelous work within us. He gives us a new heart.<sup>62</sup><br><br>Paul criticized the Saints of his day for their zeal in going about to establish their own righteousness instead of submitting themselves to the righteousness of God.<sup>63</sup>At times we may be guilty of this same sin. We need to remember that Christ is "the fountain of all righteousness"<sup>64</sup>and that He will impart that righteousness to us through the Holy Ghost. It will then be in us as "a reservoir of living water."<sup>65</sup><br><br>With Joseph Smith I testify that "as the Son partakes of the fullness of the Father through the Spirit, so the saints are, by the same Spirit, to be partakers of the same fullness, to enjoy the same glory."<sup>66</sup>Brothers and sisters, I invite you to make receiving the Holy Ghost your "overarching ­spiritual quest."<sup>67</sup><br><br><b>Enduring to the End</b><br><br><b></b>This leads us to the little understood doctrine of enduring to the end. Enduring to the end simply implies that we engage in this cycle "repeatedly and iteratively."<sup>68</sup>We know that we are not transformed into Christlike beings overnight. As Joseph Smith said, "No man ever arrived in a moment."<sup>69</sup>We are changed degree by degree in the process of time as we grow in faith, repent, participate in ordinances, and receive ever-greater endowments of the Spirit in our lives.<sup>70</sup>Receiving greater endowments of the Spirit always increases our faith, and the cycle continues.<br><br>The Lord describes His course as "one eternal round,"<sup>71</sup>but I don't think He intends for us to just go around in circles. I have found it helpful to visualize this journey not as a linear path but as a continuing upward cycle--a spiral staircase, if you will. This image came to me most clearly when I first saw the spiral staircase in the Nauvoo Temple. This image gives me hope and perspective that I can make the journey to come unto Christ by diligently and repeatedly applying His doctrine in my life. Step by step and degree by degree I can continue in the course of the Lord--His eternal round--and His grace can carry me upward.<br><br>I love the perspective and wisdom President Benson provided relative to this journey:<br><br><i>We must be careful, as we seek to become more and more godlike, that we do not become discouraged and lose hope. Becoming Christlike is a lifetime pursuit and very often involves growth and change that is slow, almost imperceptible. The scriptures record remarkable accounts of men whose lives changed dramatically, in an instant, as it were. ... Such astonishing examples ofthe power to change even those steeped in sin give confidence that the Atonement can reach even those deepest in despair.</i><br><br><i>But we must be cautious as we discuss these remarkable examples. Though they are real and powerful, they are the exception more than the rule. For every Paul ... and for every King Lamoni, there are hundreds and thousands of people who find the process of repentance much more subtle, much more imperceptible. Day by day they move closer to the Lord, little realizing they are building a godlike life. They live quiet lives of goodness, service, and commitment. They are like the Lamanites, who the Lord said "were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not."</i><sup>72</sup><br><br>President Benson understood this journey.<br><br>Can you see how viewing the doctrine of Christ as a continuing upward cycle can deepen His influence in our lives and bring focus and hope to our journey to be with Him and be like Him? This is the doctrine of Christ and the only way we come unto Him and are perfected in Him.<sup>73</sup><br><br><img class="wp-image-12101 aligncenter" src="http://speeches-beta.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/png/Picture1.png" alt="" width="882" height="881" /><br><br><b>The Word</b><br><br><b></b>There is a final critical aspect of the doctrine of Christ that I must mention. Every process needs fuel to keep it going, and this one is no different. In this case, the word of God provides the fuel. The light of the word ignites our faith and then continues to increase our faith as we feast on and obey it. Speaking of our journey on this path, Nephi testified, "Ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ"; we need to "press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ" if we are to endure to the end.<sup>74</sup>Like fuel in our vehicles or carbohydrates in our bodies, we need constant nourishment by the word of God--the iron rod--to move us along the path. Thus the word becomes the center post of our spiral staircase that we hold to as we progress upward.<br><br>Because the word brings faith<sup>75</sup>and because we need ever-increasing faith for this journey, daily feasting on the words of the scriptures and the living prophets as well as following the personal whisperings of the Holy Ghost are essential to successfully navigating this path. Elder Richard G. Scott understood this when he said, "Feasting on the word of God each day is more important than sleep, school, work, television shows, video games, or social media."<sup>76</sup><br><br><b>Things That Matter Most</b><br><br><b></b>Brothers and sisters, I testify that this is the way we are born again and receive the glorious inheritance that is ours as children of the living God. As you begin this new year, I invite you to reevaluate your goals to ensure that you focus on the "simple, humble path of Christian discipleship."<sup>77</sup><br><br>I promise that as you do, you will receive grace--the strength that comes from being built on a sure foundation. You will find joy and peace in a journey that increasingly reveals God and His glory. You will see more clearly your divine identity, and you will be filled with hope that you, in fact, can receive all that Hehas.<br><br>I testify with all my heart that Jesus Christ is God's Almighty Son. This is His doctrine and the only and sure way to come unto Him. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Douglas D.

<h1>uit of All Truth - Kevin J. Worthen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Each year Oxford Dictionaries selects a word of the year--"a word, or expression, that ... is judged to reflect the ... mood ... of that particular year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significance." Past selections include<i>unfriend</i>in 2009 and<i>selfie</i>in 2013. In 2015 the word of the year was not a word but a pictograph: the "face with tears of joy" emoji.<sup>1</sup><br><br>Recently, Oxford Dictionaries announced that the word of the year for 2016 is<i>post-truth,</i>a word they define as "an adjective ... denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief."<sup>2</sup>Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Dictionaries, explained the selection: "Fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment,<i>post-truth</i>as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time. ... I wouldn't be surprised if<i>post-truth</i>becomes one of the defining words of our time."<sup>3</sup>Reflecting this view, several commentators have recently asserted that we live in a post-truth world, or a world in which truth "has become unimportant orirrelevant."<sup>4</sup><br><br>It is hard to know with certainty whether truth is really less important than it has been in the past. But it is clear that because we live in a digital age, in which there is so much information and there are so many different contending views of what is accurate, some people find that new information confounds and confuses rather than clarifies and enlightens. Modernizing the plight of the thirsty Ancient Mariner, who proclaimed, "Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink,"<sup>5</sup>many today lament, "Data, data, everywhere, and not a thought to think."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Living in a post-truth world in which there is more information available than there is time to process it presents particular challenges. Many do not know how to determine the accuracy or the truthfulness of new information. Some deal with the matter by looking for reinforcement of their own preexisting, and sometimes ill-informed, notions, limiting their pursuit of truth to only those sources that support their views. Stuck in an echo chamber of their own making, they stunt their ability to learn truth by sealing themselves off from any meaningful dialogue with any who may have different viewpoints. A manifestation of this is the increasing polarization in American politics.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Others go to the opposite extreme, finding any piece of information that disrupts their prior views as sufficient reason to throw aside, without further inquiry, truths that have provided sure guidance to them and others in the past. These individuals, to use the words of the apostle Paul, are "tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men."<sup>8</sup>This tendency sometimes manifests itself as a crisis of faith--triggered by the receipt of pieces of information, true or not, that do not coincide with previously held views.<br><br>While there are many causes for political polarization and crises of faith, one common feature is that they are often a partial result of living in a post-truth world in which truth seems so difficult to discern that many may wonder whether it is worth the effort--or even possible at all.<br><h2><b>The Existence and Importance of Truth</b></h2><br>My message to you today is that truth does exist, it does matter, and it can be discerned. Amajor part of your purpose here at BYU is to enhance your knowledge of the truth and your ability to discern it. In fact, a major part of our purpose in this mortal existence is to enhance and refine our ability to discern, apply, and ultimately internalize truth.<br><br>Scriptures reveal that one of the defining characteristics of Christ--and one source of His supreme power--is that He is full of truth.<sup>9</sup>His knowledge of all truth and His adherence to those principles gives Him all power. Indeed, He has internalized truth so well that He rightly proclaimed that He is "the truth."<sup>10</sup>He further declared that if we come to know the truth in its fullest sense, the truth will make us free<sup>11</sup>--free to realize our full potential as sons and daughters of God and "joint-heirs with Christ."<sup>12</sup>One of our hymns thus correctly asserts that truth is "the brightest prize To which mortals or Gods can aspire."<sup>13</sup><br><br>To give us hope that we can eventually realize this almost incomprehensible goal of being full of truth, the scriptures make clear that Christ "received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness."<sup>14</sup><br><br>Thus it is both important and possible for us to be able to discern, apply, and internalize truth, despite the fact that we may be living in a post-truth world. And one of the major purposes of your education here is to progress in that manner.<br><br>The BYU mission statement indicates that ­"students at BYU should receive a broad university education." One of the principal ways we do that is through our general education requirements. Because of those requirements, most of you are familiar with this part of our mission and mission statement. However, we too often skip over the introductory phrase to that charge. BYU students are to receive a broad university education, the mission statement says, "because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth."<sup>15</sup>That statement implies at least three things: (1) that there is such a thing as truth, (2)that its acquisition is possible, and (3)that facilitating its pursuit is one of the purposes of this university.<br><h2><b>The Definition of Truth</b></h2><br>But all this begs the question that Pontius Pilate put to the Savior: "What is truth?"<sup>16</sup>We could spend well more than several devotionals pursuing that question in depth. Indeed, there are courses on this and other campuses dedicated to that very question,<sup>17</sup>and philosophers have for centuries debated both the nature and the existence of truth without coming to any definite consensus. While Christ did not answer Pilate's question directly, in modern revelation He has provided both testimony that truth exists and a general definition of what it encompasses.<br><br>In section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord declared, "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<sup>18</sup>The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob echoed the same theme, observing that truth includes "things as they really are, and ... things as they really will be."<sup>19</sup><br><br>That simple definition is more profound than it may at first appear. For example, because it defines things as they<i>really</i>are, truth is not dependent on popular opinion or the assent of experts. It is, to use the scriptural phrase, "independent in that sphere in which God has placed it."<sup>20</sup><br><br>President SpencerW. Kimball explained it this way:<br><br><i>The earth is spherical. If all the ... people in the world think it flat, they are in error. That is an absolute truth, and all the arguing in the world will not change it. ...</i><br><br><i>God, our Heavenly Father, ... lives. That is an absolute truth. All ... the children of men on the earth might be ignorant of him and his attributes and his powers, but he still lives. All the people on the earth might deny him and disbelieve, but he lives in spite of them. They may have their own opinions, but he still lives, and his form, powers, and attributes do not change according to men's opinions. In short, opinion alone has no power in the matter of an absolute truth.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Truth is not only independent; it is completely comprehensive. It encompasses all knowledge and all accurate information--in all worlds that have ever been or ever will be. As B.H. Roberts put it:<br><br><i>When you say that truth is that which is, that which has been, and that which is to be in future, ... you make it "the sum of existence": You will include the past, present, and future of all existences--their "sum"; and this is truth: The "sum" of existences, past, present, and yet to be.</i><sup>22</sup><br><br>Given that there are worlds--or existences--"without number,"<sup>23</sup>knowledge of all aspects of each of their pasts, presents, and futures is vast and comprehensive.<br><br>Thus, in one sense, as Elder Roberts noted, "Theabsolute truth as ... set forth [in section 93] is beyond the grasp of the finite mind."<sup>24</sup>However, it is incumbent upon us to learn as much of the truth as we can as part of our pathway in becoming like Him who embodies all truth.<br><br>Brigham Young put it this way: "[Our] religion ... prompts [us] to search diligently after knowledge. There is no other people in existence more eager to see, hear, learn, and understand truth."<sup>25</sup>And this is where your current experience at BYU comes in.<br><h2><b>The Role of Study and Faith in Pursuing Truth</b></h2><br>BYU is an educational institution. It is a place dedicated to the acquisition of knowledge. In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord provided a list of things we should learn. You should be familiar with it. It sounds much like the broad general education that we provide to allourstudents as part of our mission statement. We areto<br><br><i>be instructed ... in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God ...</i>;<br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><sup>26</sup><br><br>That description seems to cover pretty much everything from geology to geography and from astronomy to anthropology. But note especially these three subjects in the middle of the list: "things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass." While this is not a verbatim repetition of the definition of truth in section 93, it is so close that the two are surely connected. That it is embedded in the middle of this more specific list of subjects suggests that truth is found in each of these other subjects and, correspondingly, that when we study any of these topics, we are engaged in "the pursuit of all truth," as our mission statement challenges us to do. Thus all courses at this university--indeed, all we do at this university--should be focused on the pursuit of truth.<br><br>But the pursuit of truth requires that we be able to recognize it and that we be able to distinguish information that is true from that which is not. How are we to do that, especially in a world that is increasingly post-truth? The familiar scriptural injunction that we "seek learning ... by study and also by faith"<sup>27</sup>is fully applicable in this regard.<br><br>The role of study in the identification and acquisition of truth is more well-known and widespread in universities. That is likely the primary means by which you will come to develop the skills and capacity to discern and apply truth in the subjects you are studying. You will hopefully develop your capacity to think clearly and rationally about the matters put before you. That is how most students at most colleges spend most of their time, and that is how most of you will spend most of your time here.<br><br>But at BYU we are committed to the proposition that faith can also play a critical role in the recognition and acquisition of truth. Alma distinguished faith from perfect knowledge. He noted that "faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things" but instead is a "hope for things which are not seen, which are true."<sup>28</sup>But this hope is not a self-created wish. Faith is, as described in Hebrews, "the substance [or the assurance<sup>29</sup>] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."<sup>30</sup>Thus faith seems to be a God-granted way of discerning truth before one has perfect knowledge of the matter. Faith is an extra-rational means of discerning truth--through revelation.<br><br>Elder DallinH. Oaks has observed that ­"revelation ... occurs when a scientist, an inventor, an artist or great leader receives flashes of enlightenment from a loving God for the benefit of His children."<sup>31</sup>I suspect that many of you have had the experience of being stuck on a problem for hours or days or even weeks or months and then having the solution come to you in a flash. I certainly have. I can best account for those sudden insights by reference to Joseph Smith's description of the revelatory process, in which he said, "You feel pure intelligence flowing into you, [giving] you sudden strokes of ideas."<sup>32</sup>Such revelatory experiences are greatly enhanced, as the Prophet Joseph taught, by the exercise and enhancement ofour faith in Jesus Christ.<sup>33</sup><br><br>The fact that faith is a lesser-known means of discerning truth should not obscure the reality that it is, in the long run, more reliable than mere rational argument, which depends on the experience and limited reasoning abilities of imperfect, mortal beings. It is, after all, "by the power of the Holy Ghost" that we "may know the truth of all things."<sup>34</sup>Indeed, the most important truths can be learned only by revelation based on faith. As Elder NealA. Maxwell explained, "God's plan ... is not something to be deduced by logic alone, nor is human experience deep enough or long enough to inform us adequately. It requires revelation from God."<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1986/10/god-will-yet-reveal?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>35</sup></a><br><br>While study and faith are two different tools in the process of discerning and acquiring truth, the two are interconnected in that process. For example, faith can be the initial impetus for productive study. Faith in a perfect God whose word does not fail and who created worlds governed by eternal laws that do not change<sup>36</sup>gives us an assurance that the often difficult, and sometimes tedious and frustrating, work of acquiring truth by study is an endeavor worth pursuing. If we truly had no belief or hope that there are ultimate answers to our questions, we would be less likely to engage in a deep, meaningful search for the answers. Faith in God can provide the hope, and--in its more advanced stages--even the certainty, that we are seeking for something that can be found.<br><br>Similarly, study is often a prerequisite for the revelatory experience that characterizes learning by faith. As President SpencerW. Kimball once observed, "Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is excellence."<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_second-century-brigham-young-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>37</sup></a>Elder Oaks explained that "revelation in a particular discipline or skill is most likely to come to one who has paid the price of learning all that has previously been revealed [on that subject]."<sup>38</sup><br><br>Discerning truth by study and by faith is not an easy process. You should not expect that if you study enough and have enough faith that you will be able to complete the process before you graduate, either from this university or even this mortal existence. In a post-truth environment--indeed, in any mortal environment--challenges will come and questions will arise to which we don't have ready answers. How do we know in those situations what is truth?<br><br>Let me provide four suggestions that I believe are specific applications of the "by study and also by faith" paradigm I have described. These are four things that may help you better distinguish truth from falsehood and productively deal with the uncertainty inherent in the truth-seeking process.<br><br><b>First</b><b>,</b>when you receive new information, consider the source. Some sources are more reliable than others. In the digital age, everyone has a platform. That has some upside, as it allows voices that were previously unheard to participate in the conversation that is part of the pursuit of truth. At the same time, it allows almost anyone to claim almost anything without the same fact-checking filter that has existed for many mainstream sources in the past. If the information comes from a source with which you are not familiar, both the source and the information might require more in-depth scrutiny. At one level, we all know the assertion "it is on the Internet, so it must be true" is a false statement. But too many act as if it is true.<br><br>On the flip side, there are sources of information that have a long track record of reliability and veracity. Peer-reviewed texts and articles are usually more likely to be trusted for that very reason. That is why the educational process relies so heavily upon them.<br><br>More important, the scriptures are always reliable and are always true. They therefore serve as a measuring stick for other information. That is one reason they are called "standard works." The teachings of modern prophets are similarly reliable, particularly if they are repeated over a period of time.<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2015/10/why-the-church?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>39</sup></a><br><br><b>Second</b><b>,</b>consider the context in which the information arose and is presented. A statement may be accurately reported but still be untrue because it is taken out of context. The story is told of a candidate for election to the local school board who urged voters not to support his opponent because witnesses accurately reported that she had said that the first thing she would do would be to burn down the school. What the candidate failed to reveal is that his opponent made the statement forty years earlier when she was unprepared for an assignment in her second-grade class. Context does matter.<br><br>In that regard, I urge you to evaluate new information in light of the entire plan of salvation--one guiding truth that provides accurate context for all aspects of our lives. Evaluating new information in light of the plan of salvation is helpful both because it helps determine the veracity of the information and because it helps determine how important the information is.<br><br><b>Third</b><b>,</b>be patient, both with yourself and with the process. It is important to understand and remember that one purpose of our mortal experience is to learn to operate by faith--to discern truth without perfect knowledge. Thus, in this life there will never be ready answers to all our questions, despite what modern technology may cause us to think. As Elder M.Russell Ballard observed, "James did not say, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him Google!'"<sup>40</sup>Instead, God created an entire earthly experience to allow us to develop our ability to recognize and apply truth through trial and error so that we could increase our ability to act by faith.<br><br>Furthermore, there are likely eternal truths that we simply cannot comprehend in our current mortal and finite condition. And without all truth, we cannot answer all questions. As Elder NealA. Maxwell once observed, sometimes "we can't make it all add up because clearly we do not have all the numbers."<sup>41</sup><br><br>So don't be distressed if you don't find all the answers immediately. The pursuit of truth is a lifetime and likely eternal pursuit. In the meantime, hold on to what you know to be true, as Elder JeffreyR. Holland and President DieterF. Uchtdorf have both implored us to do.<sup>42</sup><br><br><b>Fourth</b><b>,</b>and most important, if you want to understand truth, draw closer to Him who is the source of all truth and light, who declared Himself--even Jesus Christ--to be "the way, the truth, and the life."<sup>43</sup>Every single point I have made--the existence of truth, the definition of truth, the importance of truth, and the role of study and faith in pursuing the truth--rises or falls with Jesus Christ. If you have doubts about Him, that is where you need to begin the process.<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith once observed:<br><br><i>The greatest truth</i>[is]<i>... that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, who came into this world to die that men might live. ... It is far more important to know that ... than it is to know all that can be obtained in secular education.</i><sup>44</sup><br><br>I close by bearing my witness that Jesus Christ lives. He is the Truth. He and only He can lead you to all truth. He is anxious to bless you not only in your educational endeavors here but in all your doings in all places at all times. If you will focus on Him in your pursuit of truth, you will succeed here and beyond. This I witness in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kevin J Worthen, president of Brigham Young University, delivered this devotional address on January 10, 2017.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>lace: Effective Communication - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When we moved to Provo thirty years ago, I was in my twenties. Our oldest son was two, and our youngest son was just a few weeks old. I had been a member of the Church for less than ten years.<br><br>Shortly after arriving in Provo, I met Bertha. Bertha was in her sixties. I knew a little bit about Bertha. I knew she lived in our stake. I knew she was respected by those who knew her. I also knew that she was a leader and a woman of service. People sought her advice.<br><br>I remember attending a stake Relief Society function at which Bertha was one of the women on a panel that was answering questions and giving advice to those in attendance on a variety of topics. I noticed that Bertha was being asked for a lot of advice about raising children. I soon discovered why. She was the mother of thirteen children. I appreciated her responses to the questions. She seemed to have all the wisdom and experience that I lacked.<br><br>Another thing I knew about Bertha was that she seemed to like walking. Sometimes I would see her walking in the neighborhood. One morning while I was walking with my friend, she asked me if it would be okay if Bertha joined us occasionally on our walks. I told her that was fine. But privately, the thought of walking with Bertha intimidated me somewhat, mainly because I held her in such high esteem.<br><br>A few days later my friend invited Bertha to walk with us. Before Bertha met us for our walk that morning, my friend told me a couple of things about Bertha that she thought would be helpful to me. She told me that Bertha sometimes had a little difficulty hearing and that her shins sometimes bothered her--especially when walking uphill. Ithought these things were good to know.<br><br>Our walking route that day began in the Tree Streets south of the Provo Temple. We headed toward the temple, which is a steady uphill walk. I don't remember much of our conversation that day. I remember only the question I asked Bertha once we reached the top of the road by the temple and began our steady descent toward home.<br><br>Remembering that Bertha's shins sometimes bothered her, I asked, "Bertha, how are your shins?"<br><br>There was a bit of an awkward pause, and then, with much earnestness, Bertha replied, "I'm working on them, and hopefully they are improving every day."<br><br>I responded, "Oh, that's good. Thankfully it's all downhill from here."<br><br>I was feeling pretty magnanimous about my expressed concern for Bertha. For a couple of minutes we walked along in a somewhat awkward silence.<br><br>Then my friend suddenly got a relieved look on her face and, turning to me, exclaimed, "You said<i>shins,</i>didn't you?"<br><br>My first thought was, "Yes, of course I said<i>shins."</i>Then it occurred to me that they had both thought I had asked Bertha how her<i>sins</i>were doing!<br><br>I was mortified! There I was, this inexperienced young mother, asking Bertha, this accomplished and wise woman, how her sins were doing! How impertinent I must have seemed, especially to have commented that it's all downhill from here--as if implying that once you hit a certain age, it can only be downhill.<br><br>I really don't know what Bertha thought of me. I do know that I was grateful that my friend clarified the misunderstanding that I had unintentionally caused.<br><br>That experience and many others like it have taught me the critical importance of effective communication. Our ability to communicate with one another is one of the most important aspects of our lives.<br><br>In Ether 1:33–37 we see that the importance of communication was understood by the brother ofJared. "At the time [when] the Lord confounded the language of the people" (verse 33), the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord so that He would not confound the language of his family and friends. The brother of Jared realized that effective communication was vital to the on-going well-being ofhis people.<br><br>The BYU mission statement emphasizes the importance of clear communication. It states that a BYU education should "help students ... communicate effectively."<sup>1</sup>My New Year's plea for you is that you emphasize this part of your education this year.<br><br>Effective communication is essential to many aspects of your university life. This past semester I attended one of the Eternal Family religion courses. One of the class sections was on dating. One day the professor conducted a live, in-class survey. The questions focused on what the students would like to change about their dating experiences and what they appreciated about those experiences. The majority of the responses related to communication.<br><br>Here are some of the things the students, both men and women, wanted to change:<br><ul><br> 	<li>They wanted their dates to be better at communicating.</li><br> 	<li>They wanted their dates to sincerely listen and show that they were interested in them.</li><br> 	<li>They wanted their dates to put away their cellphones.</li><br> 	<li>They wanted their dates to express their ­feelings better.</li><br> 	<li>They wanted their dates to be patient with them when they were having difficulty expressing their own feelings.</li><br></ul><br>Here are some of the things the students ­appreciated about their dating experiences:<br><ul><br> 	<li>When their dates would communicate clearly with them.</li><br> 	<li>When their dates would listen sincerely to them.</li><br> 	<li>When their dates would show that they were interested in them.</li><br> 	<li>When their dates would put away their cell phones.</li><br> 	<li>When their dates would show patience with them when they were having difficulty expressing themselves.</li><br></ul><br>In sum, what the students wished they could change and what they appreciated were mirror images of each other. They wished their dates communicated better, and they appreciated the times when they communicated well.<br><br>Of course there were comments that related to things other than communication. For example, one man commented that he liked it when his dates didn't "check out" his roommates. Another said that he liked it when his dates complimented his muscles. But by far the most commented upon topic--for good or ill--was communication.<sup>2</sup>Communication is the key to all successful relationships, including in dating and marriage.<br><br>Let me provide three simple suggestions to help us increase our ability to communicate effectively:<br><br><b>First</b><b>,</b>we should learn how to listen more closely and pay more attention to what is being said, even if that means putting away our cell phones. Listening is a skill that is not easily developed, and being in a university setting sometimes makes it more difficult.<br><br>S. I. Hayakawa, the former president of San Francisco State College and a former United States senator, made this astute observation:<br><br><i>Few people ... have had much training in listening. The training of most oververbalized professional intellectuals is in the opposite direction. Living in a competitive culture, most of us are most of the time chiefly concerned with getting our own views across, and we tend to find other people's speeches a tedious interruption of the flow of our own ideas. Hence, it is necessary to emphasize that listening does not mean simply maintaining a polite silence while you are rehearsing in your mind the speech you are going to make the next time you can grab a conversational opening. Nor does listening mean waiting alertly for the flaws in the other</i>[person's]<i>arguments so that later you can mow</i>[the speaker]<i>down. Listening means trying to see the problem the way the speaker sees it--which means not sympathy, which is</i><b><i>feeling for</i></b>[the speaker],<i>but empathy, which is</i><b><i>experiencing with</i></b>[the speaker].<i>Listening requires entering actively and imaginatively into the other</i>[person's]<i>situation and trying to understand a frame of reference different from your own. This is not always an easy task.</i><br><br><i>But a good listener does not merely remain silent.</i>[Agood listener]<i>asks questions. However, these questions must avoid all implications ... of skepticism or challenge or hostility. They must clearly be motivated by curiosity about the speaker's views.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>We will all communicate more effectively if we concentrate more on what<i>others</i>are saying and less on what<i>we</i>plan to say.<br><br><b>Second</b><b>,</b>we should make sure that we are considerate of those who are communicating with us and of the impact our words and expressions have on them. A friend shared an experience she had with one of her former mission companions. Since their mission they had seen each other occasionally. On one of these occasions, the mission companion confided in my friend about the difficulties she was facing with one of her children and the trial and heartache this experience created.<br><br>In the course of the conversation, the mission companion asked my friend what her greatest heartache was. My friend, feeling that she could safely share her thoughts and feelings about her greatest heartache, proceeded to tell her mission companion about the heartache she was currently facing with one of her own children. Instead of responding with the expected empathy and understanding, the mission companion immediately was critical of my friend, judging her and her situation with harshness.<br><br>My friend was surprised and shocked, to say the least, at her companion's response--especially since it was the mission companion who had asked the question in the first place. My friend thought that she was in "a safe place" while relating her experience to her former mission companion, but instead she found herself exposed to criticism and harsh judgment with no empathy or understanding.<br><br>While there is some disagreement about the role of safe places for public discourse on college campuses, personal communication is best accomplished in an environment in which both participants feel they are in a private, safe place--one in which thoughts and opinions can be expressed without hostile responses.<br><br><b>Third</b><b>,</b>we need to remember that our most important communication is with our Heavenly Father. Not only will He listen to our prayers and answer them when we ask for His help, but He will teach us through His example how to become better listeners and communicators. He is a careful and empathetic listener. Our communications with Him are safe. And He can help us develop the skills we need to communicate effectively.<br><br>That we may follow His example in this and all aspects is my hope, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Peggy S.
