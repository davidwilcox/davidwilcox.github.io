<h1> and Personal Inspiration - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My young brothers and sisters, as I contemplate your great future, your wonderful potential, as well as your acute challenges, I am humbled with the responsibility of speaking to you. Being somewhat closer to the eternities than you are, I have chosen to introduce you to concepts that may be new to some of you. I do so in the spirit of the song from<i>Mary Poppins,</i>"A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."<br><h2>The Meaning of Epiphany</h2><br>I wish to emphasize a profoundly significant phenomenon that occurs in life. It is inspiration. I also want to introduce you to the word<i>epiphany.</i><br><br>In the Christian tradition, epiphany is the twelfth night of Christmas, usually January sixth. It celebrates the revelation of Jesus the Christ to the Gentiles, the magi at Bethlehem. We do not celebrate the day of epiphany, and it is not part of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. However,<i>epiphany</i>has another meaning: the appearance of or manifestation from God or a supernatural being. It is also described as a phenomenon that occurs with and seems to result in another.<br><br>Writer James Joyce used the word<i>epiphany</i>to designate an event in which the essential nature of something--a person, a situation, an object--was suddenly perceived. It is thus an intuitive grasp of reality achieved in a quick flash of recognition in which something, usually simple and commonplace, is seen in a new light. In our understanding, this can be inspiration.<br><br>To be able to perceive by inspiration the common and ordinary things of life in their true meaning is a great blessing. We heard of an example of this from a woman who had just adopted a new baby. In her joy she said, "I now have two hearts." Mothers seem to have as many hearts as they have children.<br><br>Tonight, however, I wish to speak of a few uncommon, remarkable, spiritual events that have occurred throughout history.<br><br>The First Presidency recognized that many historical figures and events were inspired by God. They wrote:<br><br><i>The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.</i><br><br><i>The Hebrew prophets prepared the way for the coming of Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, who should provide salvation for all mankind who believe in the gospel.</i>[In Spencer J. Palmer,<i>The Expanding Church</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), frontispiece]<br><br>Spiritual intuition has its roots in the Garden of Eden. Mother Eve was caught in a dilemma. She could either avoid partaking of the forbidden fruit and stay in the Garden of Eden, or she could partake of the fruit and have a mortal existence, becoming the mother of the human race. After Adam and Eve had achieved mortality, Eve stated:<br><br><i>Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i>[Moses 5:11]<br><br>Interestingly, these personal epiphanies often come to young people. In secular history we read of Joan of Arc, a simple peasant girl who could neither read nor write. She claimed visions from heaven directing her to liberate her oppressed country, France, from the English. At seventeen, she left her home to fulfill those visions. At first people laughed and declared her insane, but in the end they gave her a horse and the escort of a few men to go and see the king.<br><br>Young King Charles VII of France lived in a castle in Chinon. The long Hundred Years' War with the English had impoverished and divided his country. Charles had heard about Joan and decided to test her. He slipped into the ranks of the army and let one of his trusted associates occupy the throne. When Joan came into the room, she barely acknowledged the man on the throne but walked up to Charles and curtseyed to him as the king. That convinced the king, and he gave her command over his twelve thousand troops. At first the French soldiers did not want to obey her, but when they saw that all succeeded who followed her, and no one succeeded who disregarded her, they got into line and looked upon her as their leader.<br><br>Clad in a suit of white armor and flying her own standard, Joan of Arc liberated the besieged city of Orleans in 1429 and defeated the English in four other battles. Twice she was wounded, but each time she recovered and went on fighting. Her orders were those of a military genius. She marched into the city of Reims and stood with sword and banner in hand while Charles was crowned king. She fought in the Battle of Paris until the Burgundians, who were allies of the English, captured her at Compiégne and sold her to the English for sixteen thousand francs. She was imprisoned and suffered many insults. She was tried as a witch and a heretic and burned at the stake in 1431, all because she claimed inspiration.<br><br>Another example, drawn from sacred history, is the prophet Samuel. As a boy, he had retired to sleep in the temple, where the ark of God was. He heard the voice of the Lord calling, and he ran to Eli and said, "Here am I; for thou calledst me." Eli assured him that he had not called him and told him to go back to sleep. The Lord called again to Samuel. Samuel arose and again went to Eli and said, "Here am I; for thou didst call me." Eli again told him, "I called not, my son; lie down again."<br><br>The point I wish to make about this story is in the next verse: "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him" (l Samuel 3:4–7).<br><br>Many of you dear young brothers and sisters do not yet know the Lord, nor is the word of the Lord revealed to you. The Lord called Samuel a third time, and Samuel went to Eli, not recognizing the voice of the Lord. Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child. He instructed Samuel to lie down again, and if the Lord spoke to him another time, he should say, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth." So Samuel went and lay down in his place. "And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth" (1 Samuel 3:8–10).<br><br>My dear young friends, there is a profound lesson in this: we are to come to know the Lord so that when he speaks to us we can answer, "Speak, for thy servant heareth." This is one of the greatest blessings in mortality.<br><h2>Tuning In to Inspiration</h2><br>My first radio was a crystal set. It was hard to tune to the frequency of a particular radio station. One had to literally scratch the receiving wire whisker over the top of the rough crystal to find the right pin point, a little valley or peak on the crystal, where the signal was received. Just a millimeter off on one side or the other of that point and you would lose the signal and get scratchy static. Over time, with patience and perseverance, good eyesight, and a steady hand, you could learn to find the signal point on the crystal without too much difficulty.<br><br>So it is in learning to attune ourselves to the inspiration from God and tune out the scratchy static. We have to work at being tuned in. Most of us need a long time to become tuned in most of the time. When I was a young General Authority, President Marion G. Romney, who was in his seventies at the time, told us, "I know when I am working under the Spirit and when I am not." To be able to recognize when one is being guided by the Spirit is a supernal gift.<br><br>President Wilford Woodruff had a remarkable experience of being moved upon by the Spirit. He recounted:<br><br><i>When I got back to Winter Quarters from the pioneer journey [1847], President Young said to me, "Brother Woodruff, I want you to take your wife and children and go to Boston and stay there until you can gather every Saint of God in New England and Canada and send them up to Zion."</i><br><br><i>I did as he told me. It took me two years to gather up everybody, and I brought up the rear with a company (there were about one hundred of them). We arrived at Pittsburgh one day at sundown. We did not want to stay there, so I went to the first steamboat that was going to leave. I saw the captain and engaged passage for us on that steamer. I had only just done so when the spirit said to me, and that, too, very strongly, "Don't go aboard that steamer, nor your company." Of course, I went and spoke to the captain, and told him I had made up my mind to wait.</i><br><br><i>Well, that ship started, and had only got five miles down the river when it took fire, and three hundred persons were burned to death or drowned. If I had not obeyed that spirit, and had gone on that steamer with the rest of the company, you can see what the result would have been.</i>[<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), pp. 294–95]<br><br>Many of us remember <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-b-brown_god-gardener/">President Hugh B. Brown telling of a personal epiphany that he had in World War I.</a></span> At that time he owned a farm in Canada. One morning he went out to prune a currant bush that had grown all to wood and no longer blossomed or produced currants. So he got his pruning shears and cut it and pruned it and clipped it back until there was nothing left but the stumps.<br><br>President Brown said he imagined that if the currant bush could speak, it would say, "How could you do this to me? I was making such wonderful growth. I was almost as big as the shade tree and the fruit tree that are inside the fence, and now you have cut me down."<br><br>President Brown answered, "Look, little currant bush, I am the gardener here, and I know what I want you to be. I didn't intend you to be a fruit tree or a shade tree. I want you to be a currant bush, and some day, little currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, 'Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to cut me down, for caring enough about me to hurt me. Thank you, Mr. Gardener.'"<br><br>President Brown then explained that when World War I came, he was in England in command of a cavalry unit in the Canadian army. He was a field officer and was being considered for promotion to general in the British army. He was ordered to appear one morning in the office of the commanding general of the Canadian forces. His uniform was pressed and his buttons polished and his boots shining. President Brown recalled: "I walked smartly into the office of the general and I saluted him smartly, and he gave me the same kind of salute a senior officer usually gives--a sort of "Get out of the way, worm!" He then advised President Brown that he was not going to be appointed a general even though he had passed examinations and had the seniority and was a good officer.<br><br>He was being sent back to Canada to become a training officer and a transport officer. As the general slipped out of the room to answer a telephone, President Brown noticed on the general's desk his personal history sheet. Across the bottom, in bold block-type letters, was written "THIS MAN IS A MORMON."<br><br>The general came back, dismissed President Brown, and President Brown went away with a broken heart, bitterness in his soul, and a feeling of failure and disappointment. When he got back to his tent, he clenched his fists, shook them at heaven, and said:<br><br><i>"How could you do this to me, God? I have done everything I could to measure up. There is nothing that I could have done--that I should have done--that I haven't done. How could you do this to me?" I was as bitter as gall.</i><br><br><i>And then I heard a voice, and I recognized the tone of this voice. It was my own voice, and the voice said, "I am the gardener here. I know what I want you to do." The bitterness went out of my soul, and I fell on my knees by the cot to ask forgiveness for my ungratefulness and my bitterness.</i><br><br>President Brown would have been the senior military officer in all western Canada, with security and a good income, and he would have had to raise his daughters and two sons in army barracks. He commented that they probably would have married out of the Church and not amounted to anything.<br><br>President Brown concluded this remarkable story by saying that when we are overcome with disappointment and heartbreak and defeat, we should remember that<br><br><i>"God is the gardener here. He knows what he wants you to be." Submit yourselves to his will. Be worthy of his blessings, and you will get his blessings.</i>[See Hugh B. Brown, <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a style="color: #33cccc;" href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1973/01/the-currant-bush?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Currant Bush,"</a></span><i>New Era,</i>January 1973, pp. 14–15]<br><br>I'm sure most of us feel like the currant bush at some time or another, but as we look back on some of the bumps of life, we can see how they have shaped us and helped us to develop.<br><br>I have been privileged to live in a time of the greatest accumulation of knowledge in the world's history. I remember as a boy on the farm when we lit the coal-oil lamps after dark to light the house. Wood was the only source of heat for all of our cooking and warmth. When I was about eight years old I learned to drive a team of horses. That is much more difficult than driving a car. Sometimes one horse will not pull.<br><br>You all missed a lot not living in the time of the Model T Fords. If the Model T got hot enough, it would just keep going with spontaneous combustion when you turned off the ignition key. If the hill was too steep for the car to go up frontward, you turned around and backed up because it seemed to have more power in reverse. The first ones had to be hand-cranked in the summer and the winter because they had no starters. The medical doctors fixed a lot of broken arms because the Model T would backfire when men and women tried to start it with the hand crank. Looking back, it doesn't seem like there was much mechanical inspiration in a Model T Ford. But then, they only cost $290 when mass produced.<br><br>You are the beneficiaries of all of the advances in science, medicine, travel, space, technology, communication, agriculture, entertainment, and all the other fields of knowledge God has revealed to mankind. All of this knowledge ought to be used for the blessing of mankind. It permits the work of the Lord to advance. For instance, jet airplanes permit General Authorities, area authorities, and auxiliary leaders to visit stakes all over the world for teaching and training.<br><br>I learned at a young age that inspiration can come to any of us. When I was in junior high school, I was taking a difficult class. Most of what was being taught went over my head. Perhaps I was not trying hard enough. The teacher asked me something. I didn't understand the question, let alone the answer. Right out of nowhere a response came into my mind that I repeated to the teacher. To my surprise, it was the right answer, but I knew it had not come from me.<br><br>So how can we recognize inspiration when it comes? Enos stated, "While I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind" (Enos 1:10).<br><br>The voice is not necessarily audible. The spirit of revelation comes by divine confirmation. "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2).<br><br>How did the voice of the Lord sound to Elijah the Tishbite? It was not the "strong wind [which] rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks," nor was it "an earthquake," nor "a fire." Elijah described it as a "still small voice" (1 Kings 19:11–12).<br><br>It is that inner voice, the Spirit, that has the power to whisper through and pierce all things.<br><br>In the words of Helaman,<br><br><i>It was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul.</i>[Helaman 5:30]<br><h2>Inspiration and the Gift of the Holy Ghost</h2><br>We believe that all righteous people have the potential to receive inspiration from God. The many great masterpieces of music, art, poetry, and other creations of beauty testify to this. Handel's glorious oratorio<i>Messiah</i>is proof of this.<br><br>Michelangelo's statues of the Pietà, Moses, and David also testify of this. Surely the poet William Wordsworth was inspired when he wrote "Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood."<br><br>The same is true of the inventors who have been inspired to bring us all of the marvelous inventions of our time.<br><br>We believe the Spirit of God can come to all men and women. This is in distinction to the gift of the Holy Ghost. Administrations of the Holy Ghost are limited without receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "there is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 199).<br><br>Many outside the Church have received revelation from the Holy Ghost, convincing them of the truth of the gospel. It is through this power that sincere investigators after the truth acquire a testimony of the Book of Mormon and the principles of the gospel before baptism.<br><br>However, those possessing the gift of the Holy Ghost can come to greater light and testimony. The Holy Ghost bears witness of the truth and impresses upon the soul the reality of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, so deeply that no earthly power can separate one from that knowledge. Indeed, not having the gift of the Holy Ghost is somewhat like having a body without a spiritual immune system.<br><br>The First Vision of Joseph Smith is the most remarkable epiphany in the history of the world. We are all familiar with the Prophet Joseph's story. He retired to the Sacred Grove to inquire of the Lord as to which religion was correct. He was seized by a power that completely overcame him and bound his tongue so that he could not speak. He wrote, "Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction."<br><br>Then, calling forth all of the spiritual power he had, he asked God to deliver him from this power of darkness.<br><br><i>Just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound.</i><br><br>Now here is the significant account:<br><br><i>When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS--H 1:15–17]<br><br>In the history of mankind, few indeed have been privileged to see God or hear Him directly. Yet the gifts of the Spirit since the restoration of the gospel have been rich in the Church and exist today among the faithful members of the Church.<br><br>My dear young friends, as Samuel was told, for those of you who do not yet know the Lord, to whom the word of the Lord has yet to be revealed, please open your spiritual ears and eyes. Tune your hearts and souls, as I had to do on my old crystal radio. Set your receiver to the exact spot in your soul where the spiritual signals are coming through. In so doing you will be able to perceive the simple, ordinary things of life in a marvelous new light. You will have remarkable spiritual insight.<br><br>To do this you will have to pray fervently, with a clean mind and a humble heart. You will need to earnestly try to keep all of the commandments. You will need to be in harmony with the leadership of the Church, from your bishop and stake president to the First Presidency.<br><br>If you can learn to hear the whispering of the Spirit and be guided by your spiritual leaders, you will avoid many of the pitfalls and heartaches of the world. You will have a comforting feeling of your great worth as a choice son or daughter of God. To this end I bless you.<br><br>Mine is the sure witness that God lives, and that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. Of this I testify with all my soul, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E. Faust was second counselor of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 January 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

It is January 1996. It is the beginning of a new year and a new semester at BYU. The old year, 1995, will not be forgotten, but it is never to be relived again except in our memories. Events of the past year came and went. They were special, they were hard, they were sad, they were joyous.<br><br>In retrospect, the past year has flown by. All we have left of it are the memories. The events and the memories of our lives are a composite of who we are--of what makes us tick. But it is interesting when you think about it--our memories can play tricks on us. Consequently, it behooves us to be positive in our approach to life; otherwise our store of memories will have a negative balance rather than a positive balance of happy memories.<i>Good</i>memories become sanctified in our minds!<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell made the statement in a mission presidents' seminar in Japan during my husband's assignment in the Asia North Area Presidency that the "ultimate emancipation" will be "one day to live in the presence of God with the past, present, and future, which have become an eternal now." When that day comes, we will see things as they really are. We won't see through a glass darkly. My guess is that we will be overcome with joy and gratitude for our beautiful lives. We will be grateful for the challenges that we have had and will have in our "past, present, and future" existence. We will praise God for his goodness to us.<br><br>Make happy memories. Make each day a happy one. Goethe said, "Happiness is a choice." Choose to make this year and this semester a happy experience--a happy memory.<br><br>The beginning of a new year is traditionally when we make our resolves for the months ahead. Many of you have already made a list of New Year's resolutions. May I suggest that all of you consider two resolutions from my list. These are not the usual ones like losing five pounds (or gaining five depending on your circumstance), reading the scriptures every day, and staying on top of your homework, etc. Although these things are important and may be on your lists, I would like to make two suggestions that are not quite so ordinary.<br><br>Here is the first resolution: I encourage you to keep a record of the little miracles that happen in your lives. These things are often so seemingly insignificant that we may not see them for what they are. We must call upon the Spirit to help us recognize the touch of the Master's hand in our lives. As you come to recognize and record these little miracles, they will become fixed in your mind and you will be surprised how very blessed you are and how aware God is of you.<br><br>The second resolution is that you look for an opportunity to render a kind act of service each day, and do it consciously. There are many things possible that you might do. Most won't take a lot of time. To offer some suggestions, I would like to mention a few points from President Howard W. Hunter's 1994 Christmas message. He suggests we might mend a quarrel; dismiss suspicion and replace it with trust; write a letter (please write to your parents); encourage a friend; forego a grudge; apologize; express your gratitude; see the beauty of the earth; speak your love and speak it again. (See "The Gifts of Christmas," First Presidency Christmas Devotional, 4 December 1994.)<br><br>As we look outside ourselves in offering service and extending love to others, our own lives become fuller and richer. Life seems to fall into place better. We are choosing the good life, the happy life.<br><br>President Bateman and I are so pleased to be here at BYU. This is our school of choice--our family's school of choice. It always has been--we are true-blue. BYU is a very special place; you make it that way. We feel of your vitality and your strength. We admire you for your preparation and your choice to come here to get your education and to strengthen your spiritual roots. We resolve to do all we can to help you realize your potential. As the Savior called his disciples "friends," we are your friends.<br><br>Jesus Christ is our Savior. He extends his grace and all that he has to us. He bids us accept his offering. I am thankful to him. I am thankful for the special witness that can come to us through the Holy Ghost of the reality of God's purposes. May you be blessed in your honest efforts to know his will for you. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 9 January 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>niversity - Merrill J. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
For many years I have been observing the great miracle the Lord is performing on this earth as he builds a Zion people in country after country. In July 1956 I traveled by train and ship from Salt Lake City to London, England, to begin a mission for the Church. Upon arrival I learned that approximately 15,000 members lived in Great Britain in fifteen districts. There were no stakes. In fact, the number of stakes in the entire Church totaled only 239, and all but twelve were in the western United States and Canada. Upon completion of the mission two years later, there were sixteen districts in Great Britain but still no concentration of Saints large enough to organize a stake. In 1971 I returned as an employee of an American company. A few stakes existed in the British Isles by then, but the bulk of the Saints were still scattered and met in small congregations. My family lived in a tiny branch thirty-five miles west of London. The attendance at our first sacrament meeting was fourteen, including my family of seven. We met in a small schoolhouse with many members driving fifteen or more miles to attend. Twenty-three years have passed since our family returned from England, and the small seeds planted by missionaries and others after World War II have turned into a miracle. Two years ago I returned to Britain on Church business and learned that more than forty stakes now exist in the British Isles. Membership exceeds 166,000.<br><br>Since my call as a General Authority in 1992, I have learned that the British experience is not unique. As late as 1966 there was only one stake in Brazil. On a recent trip to São Paulo, the Area Presidency informed us that the 150th stake would be created by the end of 1995, with Brazilian membership exceeding one-half million. The growth in Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico, and the Philippines is similar to that of Brazil. In early 1970 there were no stakes in Japan. Today there are twenty-five. Korea's first stake was created in 1973. Today there are sixteen. In 1978, following the priesthood revelation, I was called by President James E. Faust, then president of the Church's International Mission, to accompany Elder Ted Cannon on a fact-finding mission through West Africa. Although numerous groups of people in Ghana and Nigeria expressed interest in the Church at the time, total membership was less than one hundred. West African membership today totals more than 70,000, and stakes exist throughout the region.<br><br>The prophets Daniel and Isaiah saw this phenomenon happening in the last days. Daniel stated:<br><br><i>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</i>[Daniel 2:44]<br><br>Isaiah likened the Church to a tent and said that in the last days it would stretch forth across the earth by lengthening its cords and strengthening its stakes (see Isaiah 54:2).<br><br>How is this done? How are people's hearts and minds changed so that conviction and commitment exist in their souls? What role does Brigham Young University play in this marvelous venture? With regard to the transformation occurring in the hearts of men and women, I have learned that the great miracle of the Church is based on thousands and thousands of small, quiet miracles. May I illustrate with two examples.<br><br>Four weeks prior to Elder Cannon's and my trip to West Africa in July 1978, fifty letters were sent to members and nonmembers in the various countries apprising them of our visit and asking them to meet us at the airport upon arrival. During a four-week period we visited eight cities in four countries. With the exception of one city, no one received a letter in time to meet us. Toward the end of the trip, we arrived in Calabar, Nigeria, on a Friday afternoon, needing the services of a previously identified member to help us find approximately fifteen congregations in the southeastern part of the country. Each congregation had adopted the name of our Church, and the leaders had written asking for information and missionaries.<br><br>The member, Ime Eduok, was not at the airport or at the hotel. Brother Cannon and I checked in and went to our room not knowing where or how to find Brother Eduok in a city of one million. The next two days were a critical part of the trip, and Brother Eduok was the only one who could help us. We knelt in prayer and asked the Lord to guide us to him. We returned to the lobby and asked the desk clerk if she knew Mr. Eduok. She did not. Within a few minutes a large number of Nigerians had gathered around us discussing our plight but lacking the information needed. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see a large man standing next to me who said: "Did I hear you say Ime Eduok? He is my employee. I just entered the hotel to buy a newspaper on my way home from work. Ime will be leaving the firm in fifteen minutes. I do not know where he lives. If he leaves the office before you arrive, it is unlikely that you will find him before Monday." The man hurriedly put us in a taxi and gave the driver directions. We arrived at the business just as Ime Eduok was locking the door. Brother Eduok guided us to each congregation during the Saturday and Sunday that followed. Many people in those congregations are now members of the Church, and information gleaned from them formed an important part of the report given to the First Presidency upon our return.<br><br>The second incident comes from a story told by Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve.<br><br>[A]<i>beautiful young mother named Svetlana</i>[living in Leningrad, Russia]<i>had importuned the Lord in prayer to make it possible for her to obtain a Bible written in the Russian language. Such a Bible</i>[was]<i>rare, precious, and very expensive. In the fall of 1989, she and her</i>[family]<i>went to Helsinki in quest</i>[of]<i>a Bible. While walking through a park in Helsinki, she stepped upon an object hidden beneath the ground cover of autumn leaves. She picked it up and found it to be the answer to her prayers. It was a Bible written in the Russian language. So excited was she that she joyfully recounted the story of this great discovery to another mother who was also in the park with her youngster. The second mother then</i>[asked]<i>Svetlana, "Would you like to have</i>another<i>book about Jesus Christ, also written in the Russian language?" Svetlana . . . answered in the affirmative.</i>[Russell M. Nelson, "Drama on the European Stage,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1991, p. 15; emphasis in original]<br><br>The Finnish woman, wife of a district president, gave Svetlana a copy of the Book of Mormon and invited her to church. Svetlana took the missionary lessons, joined the Church, and returned to Leningrad with her family. She then invited friends into her home, and many of them responded to the message of the missionaries and were baptized. Svetlana, her friends, and others like them are the pioneer foundation upon which the Church has been built in that part of the world.<br><br>Why was a Nigerian with vital information prompted to deviate from his normal course and stop at a hotel to buy a newspaper? How did a rare, expensive Russian Bible find its way into a Finnish park, coincident with the passage of a Russian woman who had been praying for such a book? How did the wife of a Finnish district president just happen to be in the park to share in the joy of the rare prize? Brothers and sisters, who is guiding the Church? We live in a day when hundreds of thousands of small miracles are quietly occurring as the Lord prepares the honest in heart for entrance into his kingdom and the earth for his return. What role does Brigham Young University play in this process? The answer depends on our testimonies and how we view the university in its relationship to the Church.<br><br>Is the university apart from or a part of the Church? Following the announcement of my appointment as president of Brigham Young University, the<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i>carried an article on what it means to have a General Authority as the school's leader. The major point of the article concerned the university's relationship to the Church. The news reporter suggested that although some might have assumed prior to the announcement that the university was a secular institution distinct from but reporting to the Church, the call clearly indicates that the university is an integral part of the kingdom. The article surprised me in that I had never thought of Brigham Young University separate from the Church. Prophet after prophet has stated clearly that Brigham Young University is a religious institution with a divine mission, even though secular education is a key part of its purpose. Given the organizational structure by which the university is governed, it seems paradoxical that some might think that Brigham Young University is not an integral part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Church itself is an educational institution, and Brigham Young University is one of its key components. Thus, one might say that this institution is not only a university in Zion but is in the process of becoming a "Zion university."<br><br>From the very beginning education has been one of the central missions of the Church. The School of the Prophets established in Kirtland, Ohio, in 1833 foreshadowed the creation of the University of the City of Nauvoo in 1841. The purpose of the Nauvoo school, as stated by the Prophet Joseph Smith and his counselors, was<br><br><i>to teach our children wisdom, to instruct them in all the knowledge and learning, in the arts, sciences, and learned professions. We hope to make this institution one of the great lights of the world, and by and through it to diffuse that kind of knowledge which will be . . . for the public good, and also for private and individual happiness.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:269]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph's dream to build a university that would become a light to the world was cut short by a mob's bullet on June 27, 1844. But the dream burned deeply inside another prophet. Brigham Young taught, "Ours is a religion of improvement" (<i>JD</i>10:290) and "Every art and science known and studied by the children of men is comprised within the Gospel" (<i>JD</i>12:257).<br><br>In February 1850, only two and one-half years after the first wagon train entered the Salt Lake Valley, the Latter-day Saints created the University of Deseret, the first institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi and a testimony to the value placed on education by the Saints. Brigham Young University was founded in 1875 by the prophet whose name it bears. It has become the flagship of the Church's educational system. It is becoming the light to the world that Joseph foresaw and through which knowledge is and will be diffused for public good and personal happiness. Let us now explore what it means for Brigham Young University to be a Church entity, a Zion university.<br><br>As almost everyone here knows, the word<i>Zion</i>in Latter-day Saint literature refers to the "pure in heart" or the "place where the pure in heart dwell." A Zion people are of one heart and one mind--they dwell in righteousness and have no poor among them. "The word<i>university</i>originally meant a community," but it also is used to mean "cosmos" or "totality" (Arthur Henry King, "The Idea of a Mormon University,"<i>BYU Studies</i>13, no. 2 [winter 1973], p. 115). In our context, a Zion university is a community of righteous scholars and students searching for truth for the purpose of educating the whole person. They understand that God's children are more than intellect and body. The intellect is housed in a spirit that must also be educated. Sacred or higher truths relating to the spirit are the foundational truths in a Zion community and center on Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, the sacrificial Lamb who gave his life for the sins of the world, the First Fruits of the Resurrection. Community members also have full faith in the appearance of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph in a vision in a grove of trees, believe that other angelic visitors also appeared to him, and believe that the gospel and the holy priesthood were restored to earth following a long period of apostasy. They know that the Book of Mormon is what it professes to be and that revelation from God to his prophets is the guiding instrument for the Church.<br><br>But we must also remember that as a university there is a prime obligation to teach secular truth. Our goal is to achieve excellence in this sphere. There must be no alibi for failure to achieve a first-class rank within the parameters set by the board of trustees. Continual improvement of faculty qualifications and performance is the key to this objective. Faculty turnover in the next few years will be high, but I am convinced that prospective faculty with the proper credentials have been and are being prepared.<br><br>Because the gospel is the common denominator at this university and since all truth is part of the gospel, every subject must be taught with testimony. Testimony is not to be encased in particular institutions on campus (see King, "The Idea," p. 117). Brigham Young University is not a Harvard of the West or a Stanford of the Rocky Mountains with an institute of religion on the periphery. We have the opportunity to be better at discovering and teaching truth, all truth, because testimony can be everywhere and permeate everything (see King, "The Idea," p. 117). Testimony and the Holy Spirit have as much to do with English and mathematics as with religion if we are diligent in scholarship and obedient to gospel principles. Teachers and students in this community should understand that all truth is spiritual, and thus the so-called secular truths may be discovered by revelation as well as by reason.<br><br>Arthur Henry King was a great Shakespearean scholar at this university. He understood the process of revelation in the discovery of secular truth. In a BYU forum speech in 1972, he related the following:<br><br><i>Niels Bohr,</i>[the]<i>Danish physicist Nobel-Prize winner . . . is reported to have said that he owed his discoveries more than anything else to the reading of Shakespeare. That may seem odd unless we have read that apparently frivolous book called</i>The Double Helix<i>about the discovery of the form of a genetic molecule by a young American in Cambridge: he tells exactly what happened during the days when he progressed towards that discovery. It is worth reading to realize that great discoveries in science like great writing come ultimately from--call it what you like--intuition; I would call it inspiration. The wind apparently "bloweth where it listeth"; but can anything worth-while happen on any university campus with which the Holy Ghost is not involved?</i>[King, "The Idea," pp. 117–18]<br><br>My favorite story illustrating the role of the Holy Ghost and the Light of Christ in the discovery of truth comes from James W. Cannon, a member of our mathematics department, regarding his discovery of how to unknot an infinitely knotted object in high-dimensional space. (He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin at the time.) After pushing the problem around for many months with no success, the solution came in an unexpected manner. He records:<br><br><i>One night at 2:00 A.M., my eyes suddenly popped open. I sat up in bed. . . . I knew how to extend S(breve)tan'ko's techniques. I do not know how the answer came to me. I couldn't sleep. I dressed quietly and went walking on the dark streets of Madison. . . . I checked the ideas for all of their consequences. I checked for absurdities. I couldn't find any. The picture was wonderful.</i>[James W. Cannon, "Mathematical Parables,"<i>BYU Studies</i>34, no. 4 (1994–95): 94]<br><br>Brother Cannon's experience is not unusual. After studying, puzzling, and dreaming about a problem, scientists often find progress stopped. Then, suddenly, as if out of nowhere, a flash of light comes. Secular truth is revealed by the Spirit as well as sacred truth.<br><br>May I now say a few words to the faculty, staff, and administration, although I expect the students to listen as well because it has application in their lives. A Brigham Young University appointment is a sacred trust. More than 27,000 youth of the Church selected on the basis of gospel commitment and scholarship potential are under our stewardship. Consequently, we have a responsibility to nurture their faith and improve their academic skills. The great majority of us are members of the LDS Church, and the prime requisite for employment is a personal testimony of and behavior consistent with the restored gospel. Nonmember faculty and staff are expected to live according to the light within them and standards agreed upon at the time of employment.<br><br>Placing commitment to gospel truths first in the life of a faculty member does not demean the second requirement of academic excellence. If testimony and high personal standards are the foundation, outstanding scholarship that includes teaching ability is the capstone. Both testimony and scholarship are essential for this university to achieve its destiny. They are not competitive but complementary. The new administration is committed to academic excellence. The desire for excellence covers graduate studies and research in selected areas as well as continued improvement of undergraduate teaching. In particular, we believe that teaching quality must be improved in some key areas, and we will be working with the faculty to accomplish this.<br><br>A personal commitment to gospel standards by faculty members will increase, not decrease, academic freedom. If applied, the gospel framework will keep us from gathering like flies hovering over the dead carcasses of secular error. As a close faculty friend pointed out to me recently, the greatest limitation on academic freedom comes when faculty take for granted the assumptions of colleagues at other institutions while developing secular theories. We will be more productive and enjoy more freedom if we examine and test secular assumptions under the lamp of gospel truth. We must not blindly accept the choices made by others. These statements obviously apply more to the social sciences and humanities than to the physical sciences, engineering, and the professions. However, even scholars in these areas would do well to measure the worth of their scholarship in the gospel light.<br><br>A brief illustration is in order. In speaking of the last days, Isaiah and Nephi indicate that people will "call evil good, and good evil; [will] put darkness for light, and light for darkness; [will] put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" (see Isaiah 5:20, 2 Nephi 15:20). Recently, I learned about a movie that was described by a newspaper critic as "wonderful, joyous." It was rated PG-13. The film features seven illicit relationships, including open marriage, fornication, and adultery. The main messages of the film are<i>first,</i>open marriages are acceptable;<i>second,</i>it is appropriate for men to abandon their wives and families if they become stressed;<i>third,</i>illicit relationships relieve grief and do no harm if secrecy is maintained; and<i>fourth,</i>premarital sex is normal. To a committed Latter-day Saint, the film is not wonderful or joyous but depressing and sad as evil is called good again and again. There is a stark contrast between the messages of the film and the recently issued "Proclamation on the Family" by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve.<br><br>There are scholars in this university who study the family. There are classes taught in several disciplines that relate to the family. If scholarship and teaching at this university are based on the proclamation's standards rather than on the world's standards, academic freedom will increase and students will be spiritually strengthened to withstand the onslaught of evil--theories and practices that the world calls good. A society that is in moral decline is also in intellectual decline; for the one surely follows the other and follows fast (see King, "The Idea," p. 119; also 2 Nephi 9:28–40 and Moroni 9:18–20).<br><br>The grass is not greener on the other side of the fence. What may appear to be limits on academic freedom derived from the religious nature of the institution actually provide additional freedoms. It is imperative that we not mimic the research and teaching choices of our colleagues at other universities without first using the measuring rod of the gospel.<br><br>I believe, using the Lord's measuring stick, that we have the finest faculty and staff in the world. It is clearly the strongest faculty and staff ever assembled at Brigham Young University. I firmly believe that the Lord will strengthen the faculty in the process of time.<br><br>Finally, I now speak to the students. May I paraphrase an earlier president of Brigham Young University: "Our reason for<i>being</i>is to be a university. But our reason for<i>being a university</i>is the students." (President Dallin H. Oaks in his inaugural response stated: "Our reason for<i>being</i>is to be a university. But our reason for<i>being a university</i>is to encourage and prepare young men and women to rise to their full spiritual potential as sons and daughters of God" [12 November 1971, p. 18; emphasis in original]). For more than 120 years this campus has had a distinctive character. Strangers who visit are struck by the cleanliness and orderliness of the buildings, the grounds, and especially the people. Although the Dress and Grooming Standards may not seem as important as other parts of the Honor Code, they help us be a distinctive people. I remember visiting other college campuses during the early 1970s while serving as a faculty member at this university. It was the height of the "hippie" period, when long hair, drugs, sloppy clothes, and rebellion were the order of the day. It was so refreshing to return to this campus, to see the clean young people, and to feel the peace that prevails here. This administration is committed to preserving that atmosphere. We ask you to live by your word of honor regarding the Dress and Grooming Standards. A few may be uncomfortable and may not want to abide by them. For those few, please have the intellectual courage and integrity to live the standards or depart peacefully and try another institution.<br><br>Last Sunday evening, as I watched many of you at the CES fireside with President Faust, I could tell you have testimonies. You are not doubters but seekers after truth. You recognize the Spirit. Many of you have experienced an epiphany as described by President Faust in that flashes of insight and testimony have come to you at critical times. Many of you have seen the manifestations of divine power. You have made covenants. You have been able to call heavenly power forth in your own lives. You understand that age is not a prerequisite in communing with the Lord and his Spirit.<br><br>May I share with you a flash of insight given me by the Spirit twenty years ago in which I learned about this university's major role in building the kingdom. It concerns you, the students. The Bateman family had just returned to Provo from the East Coast following my appointment as dean of the School of Management. We had been away for four years with a multinational corporation and had enjoyed ourselves immensely. Although we knew the decision to return to Brigham Young University was correct because prayers had been answered, I was still struggling emotionally with the new assignment.<br><br>In September 1975 we attended the first multistake fireside of the school year, similar to the one held last Sunday evening. We were sitting high up in the Marriott Center near portal C. As the speaker began his sermon for the evening, I looked out across a congregation that must have totaled 18,000, including all of the missionaries from the MTC. They were easy to spot because they were allowed to take off their suit coats! Approximately 2,500 white-shirted missionaries filled the section under portal M, and it was a sea of white. I looked at them and realized that within weeks they would be scattered to the four corners of the globe. It was exciting to contemplate the people they would serve, the change that would occur in the missionaries as they matured spiritually, and the miracles that would bring new members into the Church.<br><br>Then a flash of inspiration opened my mind as to the purpose of Brigham Young University. I realized that 27,000 students were being prepared to enter the world. Every year approximately 6,000 would leave Provo, scattering across North America with some going on to Europe, others to Asia, some to Africa, and a number to South America. Some might even go Down Under. If the university performed its roles well, deepening spiritual roots and providing a first-class education, in the course of time strong Church families would grow up in hundreds and thousands of communities all over the world. These BYU families would be waiting when later missionaries arrived. My earlier experiences in London, Boston, Colorado Springs, High Wycombe, Lancaster, Bedminster, Accra, and Lagos had pointed to the importance of just one or two strong families to form a core around which the Lord could build a branch, then a district, and finally a stake. The BYU families would be good neighbors; have strong relationships with business associates; and, if well-trained, be leaders in their communities. These strong families by example and invitation would open doors for missionaries to enter.<br><br>I then knew why we had returned to Brigham Young University. It provided a satisfying feeling on the journey home that evening. Students leaving the university with a first-rate education combined with spiritual strength based on faith in Christ and his restored gospel have a tremendous advantage in the world. They know who they are. They need not be afraid. Faculty members should know that their teaching and research are building something of great worth. Brigham Young University is a major contributor to the central mission of Christ's kingdom on earth.<br><br>I testify, brothers and sisters, that this institution will not fail. As Daniel prophesied, the kingdom will not be left to other people. Joseph's and Brigham's vision that the spiritual can be combined with the secular without the latter overcoming the former will prove true because of faith and priesthood power. Brigham Young University will be a light to the world, dispensing truth for the public good and for individual happiness. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J.

<h1>Simple, Solid, True - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I stuttered most of the way through school so badly I could scarcely talk. When I dared, I tried to answer the teacher's questions, but seldom successfully. You have seen the grimace a stutterer makes and the flickering eyelids. I remember the strained expressions on people's faces.<br><br>As children often do, I compensated. I became brash, loud, boastful, and competitive--to win the respect I didn't think people would give me otherwise. This put people off, a response that only made me try harder to win their acceptance.<br><br>I made pretty good progress in overcoming my stuttering during my school years. Increasingly, people treated me as if I were a mature person. Yet my feelings still troubled me--often I felt pitted against others, driven to get my fair share, distrustful, and sometimes even scornful of certain people. I caught myself trying to arrange myself in the minds of others, playing a role, posturing. Every year I spoke more smoothly, but I couldn't close the gap between the fabricated image I presented publicly and whoever I really was. This caused me a heartache greater than my stuttering did.<br><br>Perhaps at one time or another you, too, have thought of your life as something of a fabrication. Possibly you also have felt alone, even when you were with others, because of the facade you were hiding behind. This happened to me when I lived in Manhattan at about your age--in my twentieth year. In a solitude that's possible only in a very large city, my false front became starkly unconvincing to me. I was studying acting with Stella Adler at her studio on Central Park West. One warm evening as we were out walking, a classmate for whom I had great respect confronted me with a terrifying question. "Do you love yourself in the theater," she asked, "or the theater in yourself?" In other words, was I in it for me or because I simply loved it? The question convicted me--the theater makes a tempting platform for posturing. I recall wishing that all my pretensions would collapse completely and leave standing only what was really me. It did not matter any longer whether I would impress anyone or not--if<i>only I could be . . . honest, simple, solid, true.</i><br><br>I began a personal quest in that direction, but whatever changes took place in me then were insufficient and impermanent. The same challenge kept coming back in new forms. I recall, a couple of years later--after my mission, after experiences that seemed to strip some of the veneer away--sitting in a BYU classroom where the teacher was speaking of Joseph Smith. I remember agonizing over a question to which I absolutely did not have the answer: "Can I become like that man?" I asked myself, "Can the being I am be transformed to that extent? Can I ever become so honest, simple, solid, and true as he?"<br><br>It troubled me that the question kept returning. I have come to believe this happened because, like a lot of other people of my generation, I had got it wrong. Yes, it takes a lifetime, or longer, to achieve simplicity. But I was not making much progress at all. The problem did not lie in my objectives. My objectives were lofty--never stooping to dishonesty, not compromising my principles, standing forward to defend the right and make corrections when things didn't go as they should. The problem was that pursuing these objectives was a project too much in behalf of myself. I could not see it then, but in a very subtle way my quest continued the very preoccupation with myself I was trying to overcome. And it twisted my goal of being true into the goal of being true<i>to me,</i>and being true to me, for my sake, often came before the interests and needs of others. Perhaps my way of pursuing my quest was like that of the prodigal son's elder brother, outwardly ever faithful in his duty but inwardly resentful when his brother received the public honor he thought should be his. My way showed itself as I responded in a hurried manner to a student's question in the hall--because, after all, I had important things to do; and in a conversation with a colleague, thinking of what I would say next instead of listening appreciatively; and in becoming inwardly indignant about a brother's false doctrine in priesthood meeting. No matter how rigorous, a quest to be true when undertaken on one's own behalf can never put to silence the disquieting voice that says, "You're not honest, simple, solid, and true. You're still in it for yourself. It's your own agenda that you care most about." Stubbornly setting out to be true cannot be glorious if I do not lift my focus higher than myself.<br><br>How then<i>can</i>a person come to be honest, simple, solid, true?<br><br>In Jesus' way. In the splendid testament of Abinadi we learn that God Himself submitted the tendencies of the flesh to the Spirit, which is to say, to the will of the Father. By dwelling in the flesh the Savior made Himself subject to all of these tendencies--for example, our human disposition to be concerned too much about appearance, to take offense, to seek our own interests, to take advantage, to feel wounded, to retaliate. Indeed, He suffered "afflictions and temptations of<i>every</i>kind" (Alma 7:11; emphasis added) and "pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death" (Mosiah 3:7). No one else could have withstood such pressure to react in our typical, oh-so-human ways. He had infinitely more reason than anyone has ever had to focus on His own self-protection and self-improvement and let the foolish and vicious devour each other. But He did none of these. Instead, He suffered without taking any offense whatsoever, without becoming mistrustful, without retaliating or withdrawing or concentrating on Himself. Can you imagine it? Through all this provocation--more than the degradation suffered by the Native Americans and the African Americans, more than the persecution of the Saints in Missouri, more than the sufferings of any victim of the Holocaust--through all of this there entered into His heart no vindictiveness whatsoever; not even momentarily did His love diminish for any whose pains and sins He bore, including those who in life reviled Him or brutalized His children.<br><br>This teaches us that perfect honesty and simplicity consists not in devoting attention to oneself, even when one's aims are lofty, but in forgetting oneself and responding to others in love, according to<i>their</i>needs. We are not oysters or abalones, existing in shells--even though that is how we may feel when we become self-involved. We are members one of another, connected to each other, and especially to God, by spiritual sensitivities and obligations profound as eternity. And just for that reason,<i>we become most ourselves when we are most true to God and to one another.</i>We become most right with ourselves when we are most right with them. Jesus' example demonstrates this.<br><br>It helps to scrutinize a quest for honesty and simplicity such as mine in the light of His perfect example. Even now, looking back, I do not find harmful intentions in my quest. But to the degree that I was seeking to save my life rather than to lose it, my efforts as a husband and father, as a worker in the kingdom, and as a scholar and teacher must have done more harm than good. To that degree, my worries about myself led me to slight others or use them for my purposes. I am sure that they felt this subtle violence from me. When treated so, many of them must have been motivated to view me critically, to struggle against me for attention or opportunity--or else, feeling overwhelmed, to take an unwilling backseat. With much discomfort I recall responding, early in my career, to a paper presented by a fellow philosopher at a conference in the Midwest. Cheerfully but not at all constructively I demolished his argument. "I'm just dealing with his ideas," I recall telling myself. "How else can the truth be served but under the cold light of reason? How else can professionals sharpen their skills? And what kind of contribution would it make to the advancement of my discipline if I were to hang back from stating the truth?" Painfully feeble excuses, these. They did not disguise my self-seeking at the time nor do they allay the heartache I have felt in retrospect.<br><br>In the way I went about my quest, I find resemblances to Lucifer's method of waging the great war he began in heaven against his own brothers and sisters. He had proposed a scheme that he maintained would benefit us all, but it was really for his own glory. So when his self-nomination was rejected, he smarted with disappointment and resentment and set out to make anyone and everyone pay for his defeat. Unwilling, like many of us, to take responsibility for his sin, he sought to shift it elsewhere; as John beheld in vision, he "accused [his righteous brethren] before our God day and night" (Revelation 12:10). He spread his discontent to throngs of others, stoked their indignation, and marshaled them into a coalition sustained by their shared resentment.<br><br>In just this pattern, though seldom as viciously, all self-seeking quests to make things better end up by making them worse. First a conflict within ourselves over our own failure to be as we ought to be--honest, simple, solid, and true--and then the inevitable diminishment or manipulation of others. Does James not say this? "From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?" (James 4:1). Whether it draws blood or wears a civil face, strife among us divides us, takes away our spiritual breath, sweeps us into spirals of retaliation and misery, and gradually addicts us to resentment and revenge. This must be part of what it means to be "encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell" (Alma 5:7).<br><br>How can we ever throw off these bands and chains and make things better in this world? May I suggest again: in Jesus' way. Rather than resisting evil, He suffered. Rather than compromise, He suffered. Rather than rejecting any of us--though every possible provocation to do so was laid upon Him--He suffered. He<i>outlasted</i>all these provocations. He conquered the forcefulness of force. He defeated all the pressures that push humanity toward enmity and discord. He absorbed the terrible poison of vengeance into Himself and metabolized it by His love. He broke the grip of death. "And thus God breaketh the bands of death," Abinadi continued, "having gained the victory over death" (Mosiah 15:8).<br><br>In the words of our hymn, "I scarce can take it in" ("How Great Thou Art,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 86). My wife, Susan, pointed out to me the spot in the Salt Lake Temple where President Lorenzo Snow is said to have met the Savior. I thought about His being, in what is visible to the eye, "a man like ourselves" (D&amp;amp;C 130:1), immune from nothing that makes life hard for us and graced, as Moroni reported from a face-to-face interview, with "plain humility" (Ether 12:39). Upon this single individual and what He did rested all our hopes for happiness--the entire significance of our existence--as He, alone, knelt in Gethsemane, then staggered up the road to Calvary and finally hung upon the cross--not for Himself but because of His "loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men" (1 Nephi 19:9). We see in this what it<i>really</i>means to be honest, simple, solid,and true.<br><br>This long-suffering love changes everything. As the Savior promised, it makes all things new (see Revelation 21:5). No other power calls forth love instead of resistance, changes the heart (see Alma 5:7–9), and actually makes things better rather than worse. Through His gentle example, by the voice of His Spirit, and in the faces of His children, it awakens us to life. For if we heed its invitation, we are stopped short in our arrogance or self-pity or distraction. We are humbled in our pride or anger or selfishness. Simple humility softens pride and may even redeem it.<br><br>It intrigues me that the call to love comes so often through the countenances of others. Several individuals I know were struggling to bring to their teaching the right kind of heart. The challenges they faced were a lot like my challenges: they assumed that teaching meant adopting the role, the posture, the social position, and the mask of the teacher, and this kept them from being real and reaching the hearts of their students. Like many in every walk of life--administrators and performers and counselors and artists and parents--they couldn't quite forget themselves. Given a chance to teach their students, they could only manage to teach their subject. One of them, Brother Douglas, seemed unable to shed his particular burden of self-concern because of an unreconciled conflict with a man in his ward. He had tried for years to resolve their differences but to no avail. "Still there remained between us a tension," he wrote, "a binding yet repelling force that affected not only both of us but our families." Preparing to relocate to another state, Brother Douglas knew he had to make reconciliation, but try as he might he could not discover where he had been at fault. How could he rectify a wrong he could not identify?<br><br>I will give you what happened then in his own words:<br><br><i>I had intended to go over to this man's house between church meetings but was detained. Suddenly I saw this brother walk out of the church and cross the parking lot to his car. I cut short the conversation I was in and almost ran after him. When I caught up with him I put my hand on his shoulder from behind, turned him around, entwined our forearms, then pulled him close to me. When you pounce on someone like that it usually means that you have something important to say. But what was I supposed to say? I still wasn't sure what my offense was. It was not until the very moment I looked directly and deeply into this man's eyes for the first time in years that I could see my sin. At that moment I no longer saw him, I saw myself reflected! Where there had been no words to say, I found myself asking this good man for his forgiveness. "Why?" he asked. I heard myself reply, "Because</i>I have loved you less.<i>That is my sin: I have loved you less." Tears filled our eyes as I told him then that I loved him. He knew that I loved him. Whatever else I said after that really didn't matter much. I left him to return to the church. I glanced back once to see this good brother still standing where I had left him, his head down, and his shoulders gently rolling with his sobs.</i><br><br>What else than love such as this could lift life to another level, change not just a few details but its very quality and character? Hearkening to the call of Christ from His Spirit, or through another's countenance, or both, we become<i>genuinely</i>honest, simple, solid, true--often together with someone we may not have trusted before.<br><br>Whether it is felt in His breast or in ours, the Savior's love can achieve what force cannot because where force calls forth counterforce, love calls forth love. In the human image of His divine sacrifice, we, too, can outlast and conquer vengeance. I received a while ago a letter from a woman whose father had been emotionally neglectful and whose husband turned out to be much the same way. When she tried to talk about why he was distant, he said it was because she was always angry. This angered her more, and she told him she was only angry because of his lack of love, which made him more inclined to withdraw. They had got themselves encircled in the bands of death and the chains of hell. She went to the mountains alone, intent upon reading one of the contemporary self-help books. She wrote later:<br><br><i>As the writer began describing the intense need we each have for love, I began to feel more and more deprived until I felt such a huge longing that I could barely breathe. I decided to write all of this down for my husband to read, and enumerate the many times I had felt emotionally deprived. I began to write furiously, to pour it all out onto the paper. The longer I wrote, the more I began to have a feeling come over me that what I was writing was false. The feeling continued growing until I could no longer squelch it, and I knew intuitively that the feeling was coming from God, that He was telling me that what I was writing was false. "How could it be false?" I asked angrily. "I lived it. I know it was there because I saw and felt it. How could it be false?" But the feeling became so powerful and overwhelming that I could no longer deny it or fight against it. So I tore up the pages I had written, threw myself down on my knees, and began to pray, saying, "If it is false, show me how it could be false." And then a voice spoke to my mind and said, "If you had come unto Me, it all would have been different."</i><br><br><i>I was astounded. I went to church. I read the scriptures often, I prayed pretty regularly, I tried to obey the commandments. "What do you mean, 'Come unto You?'" I wondered. And then into my mind flashed pictures of me wanting to do things my own way, of holding grudges, of not forgiving, of not loving as God had loved us. I had wanted my husband to "pay" for my emotional suffering. I had not let go of the past and had not loved God with all my heart. I loved my own willful self more.</i><br><br><i>I was aghast. I suddenly realized that I was responsible for my own suffering, for if I had really come unto Him, as I outwardly thought I had done, it all would have been different. As that horrible truth settled over me, I realized why the pages I had written of my suffering had been false. I had allowed it to happen by not truly coming unto God. That day I repented of not loving God, of not loving my husband, of blaming, of finding fault, of thinking that others were responsible for my misery.</i><br><br><i>I returned home but did not mention to my husband anything of what had transpired. But I gave up blaming, knowing that I was in large part responsible for the state of our relationship. And I tried to come unto God with full purpose of heart. I prayed more earnestly and listened to His Spirit. I read my scriptures and tried to come to know Him better. Two months passed, and one morning my husband awoke and turned to me in bed and said, "You know, we find fault too much with each other. I am never going to find fault with my wife again." I was flabbergasted, for he had never admitted he had done anything wrong in our relationship. He did stop finding fault, and he began to compliment me and show sweet kindness. It was as if an icy glass wall between us had melted away. Almost overnight our relationship became warm and sweet. Three years have passed, and still it continues warmer and happier. We care deeply about one another and share ideas and thoughts and feelings, something we had not done for the first 16 years of marriage.</i><br><br>The Savior seems to say to us: "Come unto me, and I will give you such assurance and hope and strength that you cannot be taken hostage by anyone who seems to do you harm. I will liberate you into love. And then you will no longer give anyone cause to resent or fear you. Instead, they will respond to the love that I have bestowed upon you. By abiding in me, you will do much good, bear much fruit."<br><br>How then shall we come unto Christ so that everything will be different from what it could possibly be otherwise? By sacrificing all taking of offense. By giving up criticism, impatience, and contempt, for they accuse the sisters and brothers for whom Christ died. By forswearing vulgarity and pornography, which diminish both the user and the used. By putting aside, in short, every practice that bears the image of murder, obliteration of souls, discord, and death. By giving these practices their true name, violence, and abhorring even their first appearance. By renouncing war in every form and proclaiming peace (see D&amp;amp;C 98:16).<br><br>This requires us to look upon interruption and frustration and insubordination and disrespect and scorn and even abuse--all the treatment from others that we must renounce for ourselves--as opportunities for choosing good over evil. Do not love and do good only to those who will reciprocate, the Savior taught; it takes no particular righteousness to do that (see Luke 6:32–33). Listen attentively to the teacher whose lectures may be a little dry. Read with particular care the papers of students who struggle to write. Befriend the one who feels different, lost, or lonely. Embrace the child who seems to resist you. Take seriously the ad vice of parents who have trouble following that advice themselves. Invite to dinner those who lack the graciousness or the means to invite you back. Even "love your enemies, do good to them which hate you" (Luke 6:27). Like the Father, let your warming sun and nourishing rain fall on the just and unjust alike. Jesus intimated that this kind of love is who we<i>really</i>are--the very perfection, completeness, and fullness we came here to attain (see Matthew 5:45–48). And anything less--judging others and withholding our favor from them--capitulates to Satan. After all, it is with us as it was with the Redeemer:<i>Satan does not need to overpower us in order to win the war. He only needs to get us to adopt his way of fighting it.</i><br><br>Sacrificing the tendencies of the flesh in Jesus' pattern matters more than we can imagine. In every moment we are choosing either liberty and eternal life in the Savior's pattern, "according to the will of his Holy Spirit," or "captivity and death," in Satan's pattern, "according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein" (2 Nephi 2:27–29)--and everything depends upon how we choose. I have learned this lesson serving in the priesthood. I have, for example, heard the Spirit express in blessings, through my lips, respect and gratitude for the striving of some who were still struggling to overcome sins that began in their harsh childhood homes. I have heard the Spirit reverence the contribution of a once-robust and successful young man named Joe, made immobile at age thirty-one by a brain infection that led to a series of strokes, scarcely able to follow the simplest conversation and capable of speaking only a few halting words. Joe is the husband of one of our students here, who loves him devoutly. In giving him a blessing as his bishop, I discovered to my wonder that he has received his misfortune in a way consistently pure and valiant--so much so that by his faithfulness he has added substantially to the reserve of righteousness on the earth. This contribution, Joe was told, has helped delay the destructions that are coming, thereby allowing the gospel to be preached to all peoples.<br><br>Where good and evil are concerned, there's no such thing as being sidelined or taking time out. Everything we do, everything we say, everything we think and feel makes a difference, especially considering the season of war in which we live. When war is being waged, wasting time becomes malingering. Selfishness counts as hoarding material needed for the battle. A little casual sin collaborates with the enemy. We must, quite literally,<i>take care,</i>for we can overcome Satan and his angels only in the way we overcame them in heaven, by "the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of [our] testimony," staying true in spite of the cost even "unto the death" (Revelation 12:11).<br><br>Consider the Brethren who lead us. They administer the kingdom in the Savior's pattern--not by policy and impersonal distance, as happens in human organizations that grow very large--though of course the Brethren must meet and plan.<i>They minister.</i>They attend to individuals, putting themselves out as much as it takes, welcoming the interruptions that make many leaders impatient. I have seen it over and over. Five times in the past year or two, that I know of, one or another of these leaders appeared at this home or that in our ward to visit and cheer a widow, a dying widower, a brother debilitated by illness. One of the Twelve came with his wife to give a blessing to my daughter-in-law, and it was learned he had just visited someone in a hospital in Springville and was on his way to give still another blessing. One of us expressed surprise that as an apostle he would have time to be going about the countryside attending to the needs of individuals. Gently he explained that his calling is to be a minister in just this way. The telling blows against evil are struck one act of love at a time.<br><br>We can strike such blows here at BYU. President Bateman last week expressed his conviction that this university is part of the kingdom of God. Perhaps this means that, like Zion itself, it "cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the law of the celestial kingdom"--which requires, among other things, that we be united (D&amp;amp;C 105:4–5). It means devoting our time and energy to one another, rather than concentrating only on our own function and advancing only our own interests. Upon returning from class one day, my daughter shared this experience of one of her classmates. Chris was a young father who, not far into the semester, had become overwhelmed by the pace of the class. His attendance flagged; after a while he did not come at all. My daughter was surprised when he showed up for the midterm exam. When the test was over he told her that a few days before, the professor, one of the most internationally distinguished at this university, knocked on the door of the trailer where Chris lived with his family. Since Chris had no phone, the professor had gone to the school records, located the number of his parents in Pennsylvania, and obtained his address by calling them. At the door he said simply, "I haven't seen you for a while and have worried about you. The midterm exam is coming up and I'd like to know what I can do to help you prepare." Honest, simple, solid, true.<br><br>Except for differences in detail, this same story can be told about many on this campus--about faculty or staff members caring for one another, about administrators making accommodation for individuals' special needs, about students sustaining each other and their teachers through difficult times. One Saturday morning our family was working in the garden when the Jeff Hollands drove up in front with a firm cabbage to give us, singing in unison from their car, "Hooray for the Warners, hooray, hooray, hooray!" I suspect they stopped at other places that morning. He was our president at the time.<br><br>This university has not come this far because we have more time for scholarship than the faculty and students elsewhere or because our IQs are higher or because we're more fiercely competitive. And it will not realize its prophetic destiny for any of these reasons. We have come this far and we will attain that destiny because, in the long term and very often in the short one, people respond more energetically, think more clearly, work more joyfully, and build more wisely when they put one another ahead of self; when they welcome the interruption brought on by another person's need; when they do their work in ways that enhance each other's work; when they forget about getting credit; when they renounce in their hearts all sense of belonging to an elite company, even a company of the brightest or best trained or the most doctrinally pure; when they reach out to and embrace those who are violating all these principles. I am here this day because of those who treated me graciously in spite of my frequently making things worse by trying aggressively to make them better when patience would have been much the wisest way.<br><br>Please do not misunderstand: I offer here no excuse for poor performance or low expectations. Letting one's colleagues or students or teachers or family down is no more caring than it is honest. I am not speaking of lowering our aims but of raising them--precisely by purifying our hearts in Christ and putting each other first for His sake.<br><br>With President Bateman's calling we pass through yet another portal. As we by our choices, moment to moment, determine the future we will have together in our families and here at the university, we would do well to remember: It all will be different, it will all be redeemed and made new, if we come unto Him. Only thus will we become, together, and, in the best way possible, honest, simple, solid, true.<br><br>I close by speaking once again of our great Captain in the war we fight by means of love. In all generations idealists and revolutionaries of many religious and political persuasions have tried to rouse the world to bring an end to violence, to pull down oppression, to oppose every form of domination of one being over another, and many remarkable souls have dedicated all they possessed to making these ideals real. But only one, the model of all peacemaking, entered the wine press alone and actually broke the power of selfishness, enmity, and death. Only one possessed the keys of death and hell. What so many in their shock over wars and suffering have tried in human ways to accomplish, He actually accomplished, and therefore it is because of Him alone that all the highest aspirations of our race will come to pass. "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain" (Revelation 21:4). No wonder the tens of millions of the heavenly host cried aloud when they learned of what He would do: "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain. . . . Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him" (Revelation 5:12–13). No wonder the kingdom He established cannot be counted merely as one among many others but stands alone as the hope of the world.<br><br>We join the choirs that sing His praise by living lives devoted to one another for His sake. And then we will discover afterward, and to our surprise, that what we have given up trying to achieve on our own has come to pass--that He has changed our hearts and made us as He is: honest, simple, solid, and true. That this may be our blessing, I pray, in His holy name. Amen.<br><br><i>C.

<h1>im with Joy&quot; - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a delightful and moving musical presentation! Thank you so very much, choir, for blessing us all so abundantly with your talents. I am grateful, as always, to be privileged to stand at this pulpit.<br><br>Each time I have been anxious about rising to the occasion, as I am now. Even though President and Sister Bateman have been welcomed formally, I add my welcome as they assume their duties.<br><br>I am so grateful, as you will hear me say in the text of this speech, for a part of mortality that we sometimes overlook: the intertwinings of our lives. I acknowledge the Lord's hand in these intersections. Some here have heard me say that one of the reasons we love each other in the kingdom is that our friendships are not friendships of initiation at all but are, instead, friendships of resumption!<br><br>I mention with regard to President and Sister Bateman several intersectings of our lives, beginning in 1975, when President Oaks asked if I would do what I could to influence Dr. Merrill Bateman to take a deanship at Brigham Young University. I found him in Europe, where he was traveling for an international corporation. I told him it was not a Church call, but that we would be blessed if he would accept, which, happily, he did. He has been such a great friend ever since. Later, I was privileged to be with him and Sister Bateman several times in Japan as they presided over the Asia North Area, providing more intersectings of our lives. Then I watched him perform so well as Presiding Bishop of the Church. In the parlance of management, Merrill is a "quick study"; he does things so well, so quickly. He has the capacity to touch people deeply and quickly.<br><br>I am so grateful for these intertwinings of our lives. I could say the same with regard to Elder Eyring. The manner in which our lives have intersected has been such a great blessing to me, and it is likewise so with Bruce Hafen and with so many more. It is a marvelous thing when the Lord gives us these experiences, and, of course, you have them as well.<br><br>It should not surprise us, brothers and sisters, that Heavenly Father brings about these intersectings and intertwinings of our lives. So often (after something is over) we will say, "little did I realize" or "I had no way of knowing" in referring to these intersectings. But why should we be surprised? Each of us has circles of friendships, and within those lie the portion of the human family whom God has given us to love, to serve, and to learn from. Hence I feel so blessed to have learned from the Eyrings, the Batemans, the Hafens, and so many others who are here today--both on the stand and in the audience.<br><br>Within each of our circles of friendship there lie so many unused opportunities to love, to serve, and to be taught. Indeed, one could apply the scriptural phrase about there being "enough and to spare" (D&amp;amp;C 104:17). None of us ever fully utilizes the people-opportunities allocated to us within our circles of friendship. You and I may call these intersectings "coincidence." This word is understandable for mortals to use, but<i>coincidence</i>is not an appropriate word to describe the workings of an omniscient God. He does not do things by "coincidence" but instead by "divine design."<br><br>I am one who likes to know of happy ironies and happy intersectings. There are many intersectings, of course, that are not happy. I will mention an episode to you now of which you probably do not know, nor did I until recently.<br><br>In 1855 Abraham Lincoln, then a lawyer in Illinois, was asked to participate in a patent infringement case involving McCormick, of reaper fame. Lincoln had been given a $400 retainer and was told he might actually argue the case, so he studied and went to Cincinnati for the trial. A lead lawyer in the case was a man named Edwin M. Stanton--a brilliant Pittsburgh lawyer--who said when Lincoln arrived, "Why did you bring that . . . long armed Ape here . . . ; he does not know any thing and can do you no good" (David Herbert Donald,<i>Lincoln</i>[New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995], pp. 185–187). Lincoln stayed at the same hotel as Stanton and the other attorneys, but he was never even asked to eat or to confer with them. Lincoln went home feeling insulted and "roughly handled by that man Stanton" (Donald,<i>Lincoln,</i>p. 187).<br><br>The years tumbled on, and later Stanton was to join the cabinet of the newly elected president, Abraham Lincoln. There were differences of views, of course, but Stanton came to deeply admire Abraham Lincoln. After the shooting of Lincoln, a few, including Stanton, stood mournfully by his bed as Lincoln was in the process of dying. When Lincoln died, Stanton, who had once described Lincoln as "an Ape," paid tribute to his fallen chief:<br><br><i>With a slow and measured movement,</i>[Stanton's]<i>right arm fully extended as if in a salute, he raised his hat and placed it for an instant on his head and then in the same deliberate manner removed it. "Now," he said, "he belongs to the ages."</i>[Donald,<i>Lincoln,</i>p. 599]<br><br>Would that all rough relationships could have that kind of resolution and generous ending.<br><br>Now to my focus today, which will be on the joys and advantages of gospel living, including the place of intertwinings. The focus is on joy, brothers and sisters, because sometimes at your ages we may seem to emphasize the seemingly stern gospel requirements without consistently and helpfully identifying the joys, the blessings, and the advantages of gospel living--both here and now and in the there and then.<br><br>I do not mean to imply that the pursuit of all terrestrial objectives is useless and joyless. We can, in pursuing terrestrial objectives, have "joy for a season." Some of the commandments of men, though lesser commandments, may, at times, be aligned with certain gospel values and principles. But keeping the commandments of men is not going to bring us a fullness of joy. In fact, we cannot expect to have a fullness of joy in this life until, as the scriptures inform us, the body and spirit are "inseparably connected" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33). But we can still have much joy and much happiness in life. In fact, God is delighted when His children keep His commandments because then His children are truly happy! And He wants us to be happy. After all, His plan is called "the plan of happiness." Conversely, on occasion, God weeps over the needless suffering of His children (see Moses 7:28, 32–33, 37).<br><br>The joys that might have been given to ancient Israel, for instance, evoked Jesus' wrenching lamentation "O Jerusalem" (Matthew 23:37). He offered to ancient Israel more than they were prepared to claim; they were content to live far below their privileges.<br><br>As we speak of joy, it is important for us to realize what I recall reading somewhere: "God is serious about joy." Joy is the essence of what He would have us experience.<br><br>I continue by asking you a rhetorical question: "What are you actually and specifically deprived of by serious gospel living?"<br><br>Ponder these several examples. By complying with the revealed Word of Wisdom, you are much more likely to be deprived of lung cancer, and surely deprived of becoming an alcoholic. You are much more likely to miss out on AIDS if you keep the seventh commandment and refuse to use drugs.<br><br>Before you die, my young brothers and sisters, you will thank Heavenly Father many times for the advantages of abstinence! Regarding certain destructive things, abstinence is so much easier than moderation! Meanwhile, you will see those about you who are surfing life's pleasures indulgently. They will eventually crash against the reefs of reality.<br><br>By responding to the strong gospel emphasis on education, you will also be deprived of being ignorant.<br><br>You will be deprived of that large dose of human despair that "cometh because of iniquity" (Moroni 10:22). You will also miss out on the exhausting and finally futile calisthenics of trying to mold a meaningful morality by using the Play-Doh of permissiveness. It just won't work!<br><br>Yes, you will be tested and puzzled, but because of your faith in God's plan of salvation, you will thereby be deprived of cynicism, that corrosive emotion that relentlessly expresses itself in a hundred different ways. By having faith in Heavenly Father's plan of salvation, you will be inspired not only to keep the law of chastity, but you will be able to cope with adversity.<br><br>Obviously, you could easily add many more examples of what may for the moment seem to be deprivations that are actually great benefactions, greater than you can now fully appreciate!<br><br>I depart from my text to give you an example of the blessings that flow from simple faith in the plan of salvation. About three and a half years ago a young mother, Vicki Nichols, came to my office. Something I had written had apparently helped her, and she wondered if she could visit. As the conversation began, she told me that her husband had recently died of a brain tumor, leaving her with four children. I began to bestow expressions of sympathy, but she, being strong, said, "Brother Maxwell, I am handling that, but I just learned that I, too, have cancer, and I wonder what is going to happen to our four precious children." She is a woman of great faith, strong intellectually, strong spiritually! Sister Maxwell and I felt it a great privilege to be in touch with her from time to time in the intervening several years during which the Lord gave Vicki some prolongation of her time for the nurturing and preparation of those four children. Several days before she died, I called her in Spokane. By now her voice was very weak. She said something like, "You will understand how wrenching the prospect is of my leaving the four children," expressing the kind of feelings that only a loving mother could have. However, because she understands the plan of salvation, Vicki said, "Brother Maxwell, can I tell you something? I am so torn at the prospect of prolonged separation from my children, but I want you to know that, nevertheless, I have a sense of anticipation about going through the veil of death." It was a privilege to speak a few days later at Vicki's funeral. The oldest of her children, Traci, is about sixteen, a wonderful daughter. As related to and remembered by me, soon after Vicki died, the oldest daughter gathered together her three siblings and they talked about their mother and the gospel's plan of salvation. What a simple, yet powerful act of faith!<br><br>There is no adversity that can set aside God's plan of salvation. It is an immense blessing to know about the plan, to believe in it, and to have faith in it.<br><br>The advantages of abstention have been referred to already. Consider, however, the devout Jewish rabbi, Harold Kushner, who was once chided because he abstained from eating pork. He turned the tables on his enquirers and said, "Isn't it incredible? There are five billion people on this planet, and God cares what I have for lunch" (Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, "The Human Soul's Quest for God,"<i>Brigham Young Magazine,</i>February 1995, p. 26). With your knowledge of the expansive plan of salvation, you could say, "Yes, the God of 'worlds without number' cares about what each of us on this tiny planet says and does, including how we treat our parents, our friends, and our roommates."<br><br>A major point about joy is that joy is obviously of a higher order than mere pleasure. Pleasure is perishable. It has a short shelf life. Mere pleasure is not lasting because it is constantly feeding on itself. Thus the appetites of the natural man, though frequently fed, are never filled. For instance, even as gluttony digests its latest glob, it begins anticipating its next meal. The same pattern prevails with regard to the praise of men, to lust, and to greed. Strange as it seems, so far as the carnal pleasures are concerned, the very act of their consumption insures the cancellation of their satisfactions. They just do not last!<br><br>Joy, on the other hand, is lasting. It involves the things that really matter, such as being forgiven and forgiving another. One true test of ultimate value has to do with whether or not something is lasting. Of so many human endeavors, even those celebrated with great excitement, the child's question in one of Southey's poems stands as a stark reminder: "But what good came of it at last?" (Robert Southey,<i>The Battle of Blenheim</i>[1798], st. 11). This criterion is not one to which the things of the flesh can successfully respond.<br><br>The carnal pleasures cannot finally deliver. In fact, there is a scripture in the Book of Mormon declaring that the adversary lets his followers down at the last day (see Alma 30:60). He can't finally deliver. It is Jesus who is the Great Deliverer!<br><br>No wonder, therefore, the pleasurable things of the day and the things of the moment--such as having political power and social sway--are so fleeting. They are unrelated to true joy and to the everlasting things. Mere popularity, for instance, is not only transitory, it can also be dangerous. Wise President N. Eldon Tanner cautioned us, "This craving for praise and popularity too often controls actions, and as [people] succumb they find themselves bending their character when they think they are only taking a bow" (N. Eldon Tanner, "For They Loved the Praise of Men More Than the Praise of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1975, p. 76). A wise and special man!<br><br>Sometimes, therefore, it is wrong to belong:<br><br><i>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on</i>[Christ];<i>but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</i><br><br><i>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</i>[John 12:42–43]<br><br>The synagogue, of course, is a metaphor for any lesser, mortal belonging that can divert or dilute our efforts, first of all, to build up the kingdom of God (see JST, Matthew 6:38).<br><br>I like the way Malcolm Muggeridge spoke of his changing perspective:<br><br><i>Now, the prospect of death overshadows all others. I am like a man on a sea voyage nearing his destination. When I embarked I worried about having a cabin with a porthole,</i>[and]<i>whether I should be asked to sit at the captain's table, who were the more attractive and important passengers. All such considerations become pointless</i>[because now]<i>I shall soon be disembarking.</i>[Malcolm Muggeridge,<i>Things Past,</i>ed. Ian Hunter (New York: Morrow, 1979), p. 166]<br><br>One of the great blessings the gospel gives us is the lens through which we can see with proportion. Special perspective comes from the marvelous and overarching principles of the gospel.<br><br>For some reason, the last month or so, my mind has turned to a colleague of many years ago at the University of Utah. Dr. Reed Merrill was a distinguished educational psychologist. He had, for instance, done pioneering work in establishing the process of licensure associated with clinical psychology, as well as important work in educational psychology. However, he had been inactive in the Church and inattentive to spiritual things, though a good person. Then, in the early 1980s he was stirred spiritually by the Lord. I could see it when he came to visit me twice. He wrote two powerful letters regarding the comparative emptiness of his secular discipline with the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. These observations meant a lot because they came from a man of unquestioned intellect and integrity. Other catalytic things were happening, unbeknownst to me, including his daughter's service on a mission, to say nothing of a wonderful wife.<br><br>Reed called me sometime before his daughter's sealing, asking if I would perform her sealing. I said, "I would be delighted." I think I had an intervening trip overseas, but asked, "Reed, will you be there?"<br><br>With his typical integrity, he said, "Neal, you know me well enough to know I won't be there unless I am fully worthy to be there." When the morning came for the sealing in the Salt Lake Temple, I waited with particular anticipation. Then Reed came down the corridor of the temple. We embraced, and he said, "Neal, I made it!" He had come home! Subsequently, he taught in his high priests group and in various classes. It was a spiritual renaissance in his life, a marvelous thing to see. How wonderful it is when anybody comes home!<br><br>Yesterday, when I reviewed my handwritten notes used ten years ago at Reed's funeral, they included words of gratitude for what I called, even back then, "the intersections of our lives"--Reed's and mine. The most important thing to be said about Reed Merrill when he departed from this life was that he exited "in spiritual crescendo." Such things bring joy!<br><br>Some of what has preceded has been related to the natural human desire you and I have to belong and to have people notice and care. My plea is not to downplay that basic fundamental need, because it is there for a reason. Instead, I ask you to distinguish between belonging in a proximate way and belonging in an ultimate way. One can, for instance, belong to a churning, changing group in an airport transit lounge. Yet this is not belonging. One can, instead, begin to sense that he or she belongs to God and that we are part of something that is very, very special and very, very large. This is another great blessing that comes from the gospel that gives us perspective.<br><br>If you and I were left, instead, to draw conclusions or generalizations from our small, personal databases, we would not be very wise. But we can access the divine database through the scriptures and prophetic utterances, acquiring perspective about "things as they really are" (Jacob 4:13). Otherwise, our generalizations won't be worth much more than the one I encountered years ago: "All Indians walk single file, at least the one I saw did!" We can end up being so provincial and so parochial. I love these lines from G. K. Chesterton, the brilliant Catholic writer:<br><br><i>How much larger your life would be if</i>[you]<i>could become smaller in it. . . . You would begin to be interested in</i>[others].<i>You would break out of this tiny . . . theatre in which your own little plot is always being played, and you would find yourself under a freer sky, in a street full of splendid strangers.</i>[G. K. Chesterton,<i>Orthodoxy</i>(Garden City, New York: Image Books, 1959), pp. 20–21]<br><br>The gospel tells us who those "splendid strangers" are. It gives us a sense not only of the immensity and the vastness of God's work, but also of the great personalness of His work as well.<br><br>Since a real sense of belonging does matter, one of the great things you and I can do for family and friends is to contribute regularly to their storehouses of self-esteem by giving deserved and specific commendations and encouragement.<br><br>Another thing we can do when we see the chaff in the lives of friends (as compared with the worthy kernel of their characters) is, "with the breath of kindness," blow the chaff away.<br><br>What is interesting is that joy has a way of renewing itself, and the ripple effects of joy are constant and ever emanating; joy has a momentum of its own.<br><br>Another great advantage of joy, contrasted with pleasure, is that joy overrides routine, which, otherwise, could make us bored. We don't know, for instance, how many times Heavenly Father has been through the plan of salvation before with other of His children elsewhere before our particular sequence on this planet. God even hints at the repetitiveness of His redemption when He says, "[My] course is one eternal round" (see 1 Nephi 10:19; Alma 7:20; D&amp;amp;C 3:2). Yet God is never bored by what might seem mere routine. Why? Because of His perfect love for His children! What He calls "my work and my glory" brings abundant and pure joy! (see Moses 1:39).<br><br>Therefore, because God loves us, He seeks with such vigor and long-suffering to separate us from our sins, which He hates! This process of separation is one reason why much of the pain and suffering must be borne, a necessary thing if we would share in His ultimate joy.<br><br>A fascinating thing about joy and love, with which you are surely familiar, is that when we enlarge our capacity to love, other people become real individuals, not merely functions. Gospel duties cease to be mere routine and become, instead, doors to delight. Every doctrine of the gospel is a door to delight that, when opened, exposes us to a vista of things we have not yet fully comprehended.<br><br>I love Brigham Young and am grateful this university bears his name. Hear what he says about love:<br><br><i>There is one virtue, attribute, or principle, which, if cherished and practised by the Saints, would prove salvation to thousands upon thousands. I allude to charity, or love, from which proceed forgiveness, long-suffering, kindness, and patience.</i>[<i>JD</i>7:133–34]<br><br>A marvelous insight!<br><br>Charity initiates and sustains all the other spiritual qualities in much the same way that courage sustains these qualities at the testing point.<br><br>There was a time, however, in the earlier life of Brigham Young, when he was not so insightful or articulate. Before he joined the Church, being untouched by the restored gospel, Brigham was apparently somewhat discouraged about life. As a young man he disapproved of much of what he saw in the world; he wondered what life held for him. Then his loving brother, Phineas, gave Brigham some prescient counsel: "Hang on, [Brigham], for I know the Lord is agoing to do something for us" (sermon of Heber C. Kimball in minutes, 8 January 1845, Brigham Young Papers, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). Did he ever! The rest is Moses-like history!<br><br>In the process of his personal development, Brigham had to be patient and submissive. As a result, he harvested and then gave to us so many insights, some of which are stunning, including the one I shall now read, as if he were speaking to each of us here today:<br><br><i>When the Latter-day Saints make up their minds to endure, for the kingdom of God's sake, whatsoever shall come, whether poverty or riches, whether sickness or to be driven by mobs, they will say</i>it is all right,<i>and</i>[they]<i>will honor the hand of the Lord in it, and in all things, and serve Him to the end of their lives, according to the best of their ability. . . . If you have not made up your minds for this, the quicker you do so the better.</i>[<i>JD</i>1:338; emphasis added]<br><br>You can see Brigham's soul enlarged "without hypocrisy" and his intellectual and spiritual stretching in the powerful insights he shared so generously with us. Brigham Young's joy was not at the mercy of men or circumstance. Likewise, you and I need to be able to utter those words "it is all right." Even when we are confronted with things we cannot fully understand, we can know that God does understand and that He loves us. Brigham's example helps us to appreciate the need not to be too much at the mercy of our moods or too much at the mercy of circumstances.<br><br>Another thing about joy: Joy not only helps us do our gospel duties but it increases our individuality. It is sinners who reflect such a stale sameness. Righteousness lends itself to individuality. Think, in contrast, of poor Lemuel, who "hearkened unto the words of Laman" (1 Nephi 3:28). He was Laman's satellite. One wonders if poor Lemuel ever had any thoughts of his own.<br><br>As we see righteousness in someone like Brigham Young or Eliza Snow, then we see a flowering of individuality and an immense use of talents and integrity. But we have to be patient and educate our desires. As President Joseph F. Smith counseled:<br><br><i>God's ways of educating our desires are, of course, always the most perfect. . . . And what is God's way? Everywhere in nature we are taught the lessons of patience and waiting. We want things a long time before we get them, and the fact that we wanted them a long time makes them all the more precious when they come. In nature we have our seedtime and harvest; and if children were taught that the desires that they sow may be reaped by and by through patience and labor, they will learn to appreciate whenever a long-looked-for goal has been reached. Nature resists us and keeps admonishing us to wait; indeed, we are compelled to wait.</i>[<i>GD,</i>pp. 297–98]<br><br>Our patience, brothers and sisters, is the flip side of God's long-suffering. The more our desires, therefore, become like the Lord's, the greater will be our joy.<br><br>We will also avoid the problem Paul cited of members who fainted in their minds and who grew weary. We have a special promise concerning how to avoid getting weary intellectually. The Doctrine and Covenants says if we are faithful and if we will share the gospel, we "shall not be weary in mind" (D&amp;amp;C 84:80). What a great blessing! We avoid weariness. We avoid boredom. These are more of the many advantages of the gospel.<br><br>When Nephi was reactivating people, he was commended for his unwearyingness (see Helaman 10:4). But his unwearyingness reflected the joy he had in the significant labor he was performing. As Nephi regenerated others, he renewed himself! Likewise, when you and I extend genuine empathy to someone else, we are emancipated from the full weight of our own cares. Then our souls, too, are enlarged without hypocrisy. Heavenly Father is anxious to give us "all" that He has. He delights to honor His commandment keepers, but He can only give us blessings based upon our obedience to the principles upon which they are predicated.<br><br>One way of looking at the "thou shalt not" commandments, therefore, is that these are prohibitions which help us avoid misery by turning us away from that which is wrong. Once we become settled in terms of the direction in which we face, and once the telestial sins are left behind, the focus then falls upon the sins of omission. Committing these robs us of joy.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father accentuates the development of what are presently neglected taste buds of our souls. Just as important are the taste buds that have been burned over by sin. He desires that we regenerate these, because they will give us joy.<br><br>Another thing God does is emancipate us from our provinciality, as noted earlier. Then, to use the prophetic words of scripture, we come to consider things that we "never considered" before (D&amp;amp;C 101:94). This emancipation gives us perspective.<br><br>I have often tried to describe, though feeling inarticulate, how the gospel creates excitement in us. In that connection may I share this attempt with you?<br><br><i>No wonder, given its intellectual expansiveness, we are still inventorying the harvest basket of the Restoration! Having dashed about the wonder-filled landscape of the Restoration, exclaiming and observing, it should not surprise us if some of our first impressions prove to be more childish than definitive. Brushing against such tall timber, the scent of pine is inevitably upon us. Our pockets are filled with souvenir cones and colorful rocks, and we are filled with childish glee. There is no way to grasp it all. Little wonder some of us mistake a particular tree for the whole of the forest, or that in our exclamations there are some unintended exaggerations. We have seen far too much to describe. Indeed, we "cannot say the smallest part which [we] feel" (Alma 26:16).</i><br><br>Such is my inadequate way of saying to you how I feel about the excitement and the expansiveness of the gospel and the joy that it brings, especially when individuals are becoming the men and women of Christ. You are in that process. Heavenly Father doesn't want us, as His spirit sons and daughters, to be mere automatons, dutifully jumping over what seem to be arbitrary hurdles. Instead, He wants us, His children, being empowered to choose for ourselves, to choose joy instead of misery.<br><br>Joy will come in a thousand ways--when we see a relationship mended or enriched as between spouses and siblings and friends. The apostle John understood all this and wrote, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth" (3 John 1:4). Children who walk in truth can access the Spirit; they can receive personal revelation.<br><br>In closing I tell you of an experience illustrative of the principle just noted, as I recall its being described to me. In 3 Nephi 26:14, meek Jesus, the Resurrected Lord of the Universe, lets children teach their parents greater things than He, Jesus, had taught their parents. This occurred through the process of revelation. It is a verse that I hope you will read.<br><br>Around a year ago, Dan and Nan Barker in Arizona, who had been blessed to adopt four children, had their three-year-old boy say, "Mommy, there's another little girl who is supposed to come to our family."<br><br>The mother said, in effect, "We're already so blessed to have all of you."<br><br>The boy continued, "She has dark hair and dark eyes. And she lives a long way from here."<br><br>The mother asked, "How do you know this?"<br><br>To which the boy replied, "Jesus told me, upstairs."<br><br>To which the mother said, "We don't have any upstairs."<br><br>The parents, being taught by the child, got in touch with an international adoption agency. Several months ago, Sister Maxwell and I were privileged to be in the sealing room of the Salt Lake Temple. There, sealed to Nan and Dan Barker, was a little girl with dark hair and dark eyes from Kazakhstan in the former Soviet Union.<br><br>Revelation is one of the great realities of gospel living, and it is so productive of joy.<br><br>For so many reasons, therefore, I am not surprised that Brigham Young would say, "If you want to enjoy exquisitely, become a Latter-day Saint, and then live the doctrine of Jesus Christ" (<i>JD</i>18:247).<br><br>The phrase "alive in Christ" describes individuals whose aliveness is enhanced by their righteousness. We are the most joyful when we are the most alive. And Jesus, because He was the most empathic, most loving, most forgiving, and the most appreciative individual to ever live on this planet, has a perfect fullness of joy. No wonder He instructs us, "What manner of men [and women] ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). He wants us to have great joy. No wonder, too, His lamentation "O Jerusalem" was so stark and sad.<br><br>When we reach a point of consecration, our afflictions will be swallowed up in the joy of Christ. It does not mean we won't have afflictions, but they will be put in a perspective that permits us to deal with them. With our steady pursuit of joy and with each increasing measure of righteousness, we will experience one more drop of delight--one drop after another--until, in the words of a prophet, our hearts are "brim with joy" (Alma 26:11). At last, the soul's cup finally runs over!<br><br>May you be sufficiently committed to be "alive in Christ," even in the turbulent last days in which you will live. For, indeed, whatsoever afflictions you may have, they can be "swallowed up in the joy of Christ" (Alma 31:38). Then you will be able to say with Brigham Young, even though things perplex and vex you even beyond your capacity to resolve them at times, "It is all right." Thereby you will be acknowledging the hand of God. For His hand is a loving hand, stretched out to love and to lead us, if we will, into a fullness of joy. Of this joy that awaits us, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen!<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>Two Gardens: The Law of Sacrifice - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today I wish to talk about significant events that occurred in the proximity of two gardens: the Garden of Eden and the Garden of Gethsemane. Those events, and the spiritual and doctrinal issues that connect the two gardens, are among the most important we could discuss. I, therefore, title this presentation "Between Two Gardens."<br><br>After Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, they began to till the fields and have dominion over the beasts of the fields. They were directed, as are we, to eat by the sweat of their labor. Among other commandments, they were directed to build an altar and to offer sacrifice unto the Lord. The account reads:<br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying: This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, which is full of grace and truth.</i>[Moses 5:6–7]<br><br>Thus, the law of sacrifice was introduced as an important set of instructions by which Adam and Eve could come to personally understand and know the Lord Jesus Christ. The law of sacrifice was intended as a process to teach Adam and Eve about the great sacrifice of the Son of God.<br><br>Now consider the events of another garden: the Garden of Gethsemane. In a prayer offered just before he entered the garden, Jesus declared that the fundamental requirement of eternal life is for each person to come to know Him after they first come to know the Father. "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>The principles that connect these two important "garden" events are fundamental to our understanding of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Without this understanding, our full participation in the mission of the Church and the development of our personal testimonies are very restricted. For as Alma the prophet taught:<br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i>[Alma 34:14]<br><br>Recently I had a meeting with two very important Jewish rabbis who are responsible for the administration of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Tolerance in Los Angeles, California. They were interested in exploring the possibility of having access to our family history software and database as part of their facility.<br><br>During our visit we enjoyed a long discussion on the subject of the law of sacrifice. I asked my two rabbinical friends about the Jewish belief concerning the doctrine and practice of the law of sacrifice. Both confirmed their deep conviction that the law continues to be a requirement for every Jew. They explained their understanding of the biblical context of the law of sacrifice. Yet, they confessed, "We do not know how to practice sacrifice. We are quite certain that our people would reject the notion of killing animals in our temples and synagogues. We do not dare bring back the practice of sacrifice, but we confirm that it is a requirement for all Jews."<br><br>What do we, as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, know about the law of sacrifice? What do we know about the doctrine and application of the law of sacrifice in our individual lives? In the Book of Mormon we read:<br><br><i>And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings.</i><br><br><i>And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.</i>[3 Nephi 9:19–20]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith made the following declaration:<br><br><i>It is generally supposed that sacrifice was entirely done away when the Great Sacrifice [i.e.,] the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus was offered up, and that there will be no necessity for the ordinance of sacrifice in</i>[the]<i>future; but those who assert this are certainly not acquainted with the duties, privileges and authority of the Priesthood, or with the Prophets.</i><br><br><i>The offering of sacrifice has ever been connected and forms a part of the duties of the Priesthood.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 172]<br><br>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe that the law of sacrifice is an important element in each of our lives. Our doctrine is that the very purpose of life is to come unto Christ and to live His commandments. The prophets have taught clearly that a knowledge of God and His Son are the essence of this mortal life and of life eternal. All of us, along with my Jewish friends, would question the slaughtering of an animal in one of our sacred meetings. Since the great sacrifice of the Son of God ended sacrifice by the shedding of the blood of animals, how have we been taught to live the law of sacrifice? Let us examine only a part of that which we have been taught by living prophets on this important subject.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of a Broken Heart and a Contrite Spirit</b></h2><br>What is the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit that the Lord has commanded? Qualities such as humble, teachable, sensitive, submissive, obedient, considerate, polite, respectful, repentant, and prayerful would be part of this great concept.<br><br>What about prayer? Some elements of the law of sacrifice seem almost hidden but, upon examination, clearly have the qualities of sacrifice. For example, Paul taught: "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name" (Hebrews 13:15).<br><br>In this world of macho public figures and the ever-growing importance of winning, it becomes a challenge to ignore the temptation to join the crowd. Many of us, in our desire to win, appear to have lost the grace of appreciation for our opposing contestants. Chivalry as part of the character of mighty men has almost disappeared. "In your face" has replaced the pleasure of an outstanding and well-performed athletic achievement. Taunting and trash talk has replaced the fun and friendly spirit of competition, which is one of the reasons for which sports were designed.<br><br>Many have been shocked by the behavior of spectators at sporting events where opposing players and associates are subjected to vicious verbal abuse and even physical abuse. We develop a sense of disdain for other universities, other cultures, and other people in our desire to defeat them in what we formerly considered just games.<br><br><i>Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:8]<br><br>As we have just read, a broken heart and a contrite spirit is the sacrifice upon which all other elements of the law of sacrifice are based. Indeed, Cain did make his offering (see Genesis 4:5), but he did it without the appropriate attitude of a contrite spirit and a broken heart. Because of his arrogance the Lord rejected his offering, and you know the rest of the story.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Repentance</b></h2><br>Repentance is likewise based upon the sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. While serving on my first mission, my companion and I were privileged to teach the wonderful family of Tony and Norma Johnson. This family lived in Ellesmere Port, England. One of the missionary discussions suggested that a truly repentant person would want to confess all of his wrongdoings to the Lord in prayer. The discussion suggested that a large blanket confession was inadequate because an individual should confess all sins in some detail.<br><br>Three days later, we again visited with the Johnson family. Brother Johnson, then Mr. Johnson, looked terrible. When we asked him what was wrong, he informed us that he had not slept for three nights. He indicated that he would finish one prayer, get into bed, and then remember some other event or thought that he felt should be part of his confession prayer. He then would get out of bed and ask forgiveness for another wrongdoing.<br><br>I left our meeting that evening knowing I had<i>never</i>spent three nights on my knees asking for forgiveness. I had never come to that level of prayer when asking for forgiveness. It was required even of the Prophet Joseph: "Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God" (D&amp;amp;C 132:60).<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Tithes and Offerings</b></h2><br>I now read from D&amp;amp;C 64:23 and the heading to section 119:<br><br><i>Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:23]<br><br><i>The term "tithing" ... just quoted and in previous revelations (64:23; 85:3; 97:11) had meant not just one-tenth, but all free-will offerings, or contributions, to the Church funds.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 119, section heading]<br><br>Sister Brough and I remember a time during our university years when poverty was a regular part of our daily lives. Some of you students may know what I mean. I suggested that we might consider carefully the choice between starvation and paying tithing. She, however, was firm in her commitment to pay tithing, and she prevailed. We continued to make our financial offering. Tithing was a sacrifice, more to me than to her, during that time of financial challenge.<br><br>Since those years, because of the sacrifice of tithing, our testimonies and faith have continued to grow. Why? Because the law of tithing is part of the law of sacrifice. We have learned that even the law of tithing is designed to teach us about the ultimate sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The Sacrifice of Obedience</b></h2><br>In what other ways do we learn from and practice the law of sacrifice? Consider the following text from D&amp;amp;C 132: "Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you" (D&amp;amp;C 132:50; see also 1 Samuel 15:22).<br><br>Obedience is a great and important part of the law of sacrifice. It is the law that governs our wonderful missionary work and is the foundation of the ecclesiastical operation of the Church. Even the Lord learned obedience and, in fact, was obedient to the ultimate degree. How many times did He worry about the "cup" and the consequence of His obedience to the demands that the Atonement would require of Him?<br><br><i>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</i><br><br><i>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</i>[Hebrews 5:8–9]<br><br>We have observed the result of the sacrifice of obedience in the lives of many. When a missionary is obedient, he or she is blessed with a greater ability to communicate with Heavenly Father. Through obedience, the missionary, as with you and I, comes to know the Savior better. That knowledge allows more faithful, and thus more effective, prayer. Even obedience to the rules associated with your attendance at BYU is important. The greater reason, along with those mentioned by President Bateman at this podium last month, is that obedience is a great instructor. You come to know the Lord better as you follow rules set by Him and His servants.<br><br>I recall another time: I had finally graduated from the university and obtained my first real job with the IBM Corporation. The day had arrived when I could fulfill my longtime dream of purchasing a four-wheel-drive Suburban. My family enjoys a love affair with the great outdoors, and I looked forward to owning this wonderful vehicle. Even though it was not new, it was new to me. I was so proud of my new toy that I didn't even park it in the garage. I parked it in the driveway so that all of my neighbors could see it. It was beautiful!<br><br>After only a few days, I answered my door to see guess who? The Scoutmaster. "Oh, Brother Brough, I see that you have a new four-wheel-drive vehicle. We are taking the Scouts on a weeklong outdoors trip, and I am wondering if I might borrow your Suburban." My heart dropped as my mind quickly reviewed the danger this represented to my life's dream. I carefully explained to him my concerns and suggested that he consider borrowing from someone else.<br><br>A day or two later, the bishop called on the phone. "Oh, Brother Brough, I see that you have this new four-wheel-drive vehicle. In a few days we are taking the Scouts on a weeklong outdoors trip, and I am wondering if I can borrow your Suburban?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, you may."<br><br>A couple of weeks after the Scouting event, the Scoutmaster came to my door. He said, "Brother Brough, I thought we were good friends. Is there something wrong between us?"<br><br>I replied, "Of course not. Why would you ask?"<br><br>"Well," he said, "I asked to borrow your four-wheel-drive vehicle, and you refused to lend it to me. The bishop made the same request, and you let him take it. You know I'm a better driver than the bishop."<br><br>I responded with the answer I had been taught from my youth. I said, "I was no more comfortable with the bishop borrowing my four-wheel-drive vehicle than I was with your borrowing it. But he is the bishop, and if I understand the scriptures, he has the right to ask for anything I have."<br><br>Priesthood leaders must be careful because they have the right to place us under conditions where obedience becomes part of the law of sacrifice.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Temple and Family History Service</b></h2><br>On the night that the angel Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith, he quoted from the book of Malachi, among others. In Malachi 3:3 we learn of a special offering from a group of people called the sons of Levi. This group of people would "offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness." What was the offering (sacrifice) of which Malachi prophesied? The Prophet Joseph learned years later, in 1832, that it is the sacrifice of temple and family history service.<br><br><i>For the sons of Moses and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have appointed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:31]<br><br>Temple and family history work is designed to teach us about the Savior and even includes the possibility of being a type of savior ourselves. The Lord was referring to the redemption of the dead when he revealed to the Prophet Joseph that we are "set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors of men" (D&amp;amp;C 103:9). Joseph Smith taught further:<br><br><i>But how are</i>[we]<i>to become saviors on Mount Zion? By building ... temples, erecting ... baptismal fonts, and going forth and receiving all the ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings, ordinations and sealing powers upon</i>[our]<i>heads, in behalf of all</i>[our]<i>progenitors who are dead, and redeem them that they may come forth in the first resurrection and be exalted to thrones of glory with</i>[us]. [<i>Teachings,</i>p. 330]<br><br>This act of being a savior upon Mount Zion is a major part of learning more of the important events that occurred in and near the two gardens. Doing for others what they cannot do for themselves, as much as anything, will help us come to know Christ.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Missionary Service</b></h2><br>The Lord also included missionary service as part of the righteous offering that would be given by the sons of Levi: "And also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my church" (D&amp;amp;C 84:32).<br><br>Missionary work is and should be a sacrifice. Years ago I sold my computer service business and returned to the place of our childhood roots, a cattle ranch in a small town. My family and I moved to Robertson, Wyoming, where we began a new and very wonderful lifestyle. Our fourteen-year-old son, Joseph, owned a couple of black-and-tan hunting dogs. He loved his dogs and they loved him. After school each day he would do his chores, finish his homework, and then spend the rest of the evening with his faithful dogs.<br><br>One wintry day we received a life-changing telephone call from President Spencer W. Kimball. During that call, he extended the invitation for me to serve as mission president and for my wife to serve as my companion.<br><br>I will never forget Joseph's reaction upon learning that we would be leaving the outdoor utopia we had created. "Dad, if we are going on a mission, what are we going to do with my dogs?" I replied that we would not be able to take them with us. A few weeks later, Joseph informed me that he had made arrangements to give his dogs away. I will never forget that day when a man came in a pickup truck to take Joseph's dogs. I watched a young fourteen-year-old boy's sacrifice and great faith as he loaded his dogs into that truck knowing he would never see them again.<br><br>I have always agreed that it is a great sacrifice for nineteen-year-old young men to leave their girlfriends. Likewise, it is a great sacrifice for sixty-five-year-old grandparents to leave their grandchildren. However, it can be an even greater sacrifice for a fourteen-year-old boy to leave his pet dogs.<br><br>Regarding the sacrifice required of those who serve missions, the Lord has said:<br><br><i>And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:80]<br><br>You may notice that I have great reason to appreciate the promise that not a hair of his head shall fall unnoticed. Those who still have all of their hair should be jealous because the promise does not include your hair. I can boast that my hair is not lost--it is translated and gone to another world!<br><br>As a result of the sacrifice of missionary work, we have many tens of thousands, including many of you, who have come to know the Lord in a wonderful, increased dimension. Through this increased knowledge, your faith grows and your lives have much greater promise.<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Families</b></h2><br>Regarding the sacrifice of even our families, we receive the following challenge from the Lord:<br><br><i>He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</i><br><br><i>And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</i>[Matthew 10:37–38]<br><br>Let me tell you of a recent experience that is part of the lives of General Authorities of the Church. As you may know, the Seventies serve in area presidencies and most live away from here in many nations of the earth. Each year the Quorums of the Seventy receive new or extended assignments for the coming year. Some of these assignments may mean that the General Authority and his wife will spend from three to five years away from their homes and families.<br><br>The First Presidency, because of their great love and concern for the Brethren and their wives and children, always have interviewed each Seventy personally before giving him an assignment. During this interview the members of the First Presidency inquire into the many issues that surround the Seventy and his family. These interviews have required great time and effort on the part of the First Presidency.<br><br>Recently all of the General Authorities and their wives were invited to a special meeting with the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve. There President Thomas S. Monson explained that the First Presidency simply had not had the time to conduct their regular interviews. Then he informed all of us to prepare ourselves because he would announce, from the pulpit, our assignments for the coming year.<br><br>The suspense was great as President Monson announced the list of assignments, which would require great sacrifices by those leaving their homes and families. Personally, I have never witnessed a greater demonstration of willing sacrifice. I heard no complaints. I heard not a single negative comment. No one objected to either the method or the nature of the assignment. All of the Seventies and their wives simply returned from that meeting to begin the preparations that would take many from their homes and families for several years.<br><br>Of course, sadness is associated with our absence from our families. Many members of the Seventy have not been able to participate in important family events such as weddings, funerals, blessings, and graduations. They understand the sacrifice of families. Yet in the eternities they will not lose their families because they will receive the promises given to those who obey the law of sacrifice.<br><br>General Authorities are not alone in this demonstration of sacrifice. We remember the 500-600 letters that are sent each week to young people, temple missionaries, and family history missionaries asking them to sacrifice and leave their families.<br><br>More than 300 mission presidents and their families, plus 45 temple presidencies, accept their callings and assignments with the same spirit. These wonderful people accept their special calling as divine and as a manifestation of unique, personal revelation.<br><br>I love the revelation given personally to Brigham Young that is in section 126 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Dear and well-beloved brother, Brigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto you: My servant Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.</i><br><br><i>I have seen your labor and toil in journeyings for my name.</i><br><br><i>I therefore command you to send my word abroad, and take especial care of your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 126:1–3]<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Reputation</b></h2><br>On occasion we can find ourselves in unique, and even awkward, social situations because of our Church membership and commitment. We then face the possibility of a sacrifice of our reputation or a sacrifice of some social comfort. Each of us probably will have the opportunity to be in a situation that will demonstrate our peculiarity. The Word of Wisdom, Sabbath-day observance, R-rated movies, and other elements may separate us from the mainstream.<br><br>Some years ago I became vice president of a large computer services company. The company had an annual executives' retreat with its top-level officers. At my first meeting, held in Sun Valley, Idaho, the company retained a famous professional entertainer, a so-called comedian, at significant expense to the company. We were transported by bus to a lovely restaurant some miles from the main resort. My assigned seat was at the head table with the chairman, president of the organization, and other senior executives. As the program began, I soon realized that the entertainer's idea of humor was vulgarity, profanity, and verbal pornography. I knew I could not remain and participate as a member of the audience that seemed to enjoy the entertainer's style. Yet I was concerned about leaving the head table in full view of the other executives and board members. I felt my leaving could represent a statement of disrespect for their effort to provide a relaxing evening of entertainment.<br><br>After a few more minutes of internal debate, I knew I could remain no longer as the entertainer continued his assault on values, people, and, particularly, women. As I got up and left the room, every eye seemed to be looking at me. Everyone in the room knew of my Church affiliation, and all, I thought, seemed offended by my action. It was a long walk back in the dark to the resort village. My emotions alternated between being worried and angry. I was worried that I had offended the leadership of the company by my action. I was angry that they did not recognize the degrading garbage offered in the form of entertainment.<br><br>The next day I learned that some were contemptuous of my leaving and had felt offended that I rejected their choice of entertainment. To my disappointment, not one person gave any indication of having respected my action, and no one ever commented again about the evening. I must add, however, that the company never arranged for that type of offensive entertainment again for executive retreats.<br><br>Now as I look back on the event, I believe it contributed to my understanding of how Christ might have felt during the humiliation that was heaped upon Him. I received great comfort from the following scripture:<br><br><i>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</i><br><br><i>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</i>[John 15:18–19]<br><br>And also,<br><br><i>For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.</i>[Deuteronomy 14:2]<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Tribulation</b></h2><br>Perhaps the greatest sacrifice we will make is the sacrifice of tribulation resulting from death, sickness, financial and business disasters, loss of a child, or even just the tribulation of old age. Major catastrophes such as earthquakes, windstorms, fires, and wars are examples of tribulation that will be part of our lives. The Prophet Joseph taught: "If thou art called to pass through tribulation; ... know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:5, 7).<br><br>None of us will escape tribulation. The prophets have not been free of a great measure of tribulation. In fact, a rigorous study of the lives of the prophets will reveal that tribulation is a common part of their lives. Our recent experience of watching President Howard W. Hunter's great example of enduring tribulation will forever be a part of our memories, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (2 Corinthians 4:17).<br><h2><b>Sacrifice of Lives</b></h2><br>Some may even sacrifice their lives. We have the example of Joseph and Hyrum Smith's martyrdom; the terrible loss of members' lives during the winter of 1846; and the subsequent loss of life during the early years of the great migration west. We are reminded of the deaths of Elders Ball and Wilson during their missions to Bolivia just a few years ago. The Lord has given a great promise to those who lose their lives as a consequence of their faith: "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39).<br><br>Yet the greater sacrifice may not be that of giving our lives to death but that of living or giving the entirety of our lives to the service of the Lord. "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Romans 12:1).<br><br>President David O. McKay made an important point when he suggested a modest one-word change in the words of the magnificent anthem "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." The original words were "As He died to make men holy, let us<i>die</i>to make men free." The inspired change taught a significant lesson to us all: "As he died to make men holy, let us<i>live</i>to make men free." (See<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 60, and<i>Recreational Songs</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1949], p. 10.)<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Can we possibly escape sacrifice? Joseph Smith, the seer, helped us understand this very significant requirement when he said:<br><br><i>All the saints of whom we have account, in all the revelations of God which are extant, obtained the knowledge which they had of their acceptance in his sight through the sacrifice which they offered unto him; ... through faith, to ... overcome the world, and obtain the end of their faith, even the salvation of their souls.</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith</i>6:11]<br><br>Now listen to the description of those who will inherit the celestial kingdom as revealed to the Prophet Joseph F. Smith prior to the 1918 October general conference.<br><br><i>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality;</i><br><br><i>And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138: 12–13]<br><br>The law of sacrifice connects the profoundly important events of the two gardens: Eden and Gethsemane. This law provides a process that will allow us the greatest blessing of our lives. This process demonstrates our faith in the great plan of happiness. Added to the sacred and eternal ordinances and covenants of the gospel, it becomes our deepest expression of hope and faith in our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. Through this process we may receive the gift of eternal life with those we love most in the celestial kingdom of our eternal God.<br><br>This is my faith and prayer, which I offer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Monte J. Brough was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13 February 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>o Christ Through Your Trials - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It has been more than a few years since I've been invited to participate in a BYU devotional. I recognize what a great blessing this is in my life. Two years ago at this time I was having the good fortune of teaching a couple of classes in religion, and this past fall I enjoyed doing the same in engineering.<br><br>My thanks again to the Brethren for this invitation to be here this morning.<br><br>Recognizing the many and varied challenges that you and I face in today's world, I have sought diligently to be guided by the same Spirit that must edify us all.<br><br>Today we will speak of the most important event that can happen to each of us in our lifetime; or should I say the most important event that<i>must</i>happen to us? I hope I will not offend the faculty and the leaders here when I say it is not getting good grades or landing a great job on graduation; it is not winning a ball game or having a more fulfilling social life. It even comes as a higher priority than the world-renowned matchmaking program for which this institution is noted.<br><br>What I speak of transcends all else. With it in place, everything else will fall appropriately into place. Without it, we are subject to an unusual variety of challenges and disappointments from which we can gain little peace or understanding. Even divine direction may elude us.<br><br>This morning we speak of the process of "Coming unto Christ" and why trials and heartaches, tears, frustrations, and disappointments play such a vital role in that divine process. If you have ever felt that the challenge is too difficult, or that you can't make it, or that it's not worth the effort, maybe this morning is for you.<br><br>Let's first lay some groundwork of common understanding as a preface to the things we will discuss today.<br><br>Simply stated, each one of us was called and elected before the foundations of the earth were laid to come here to prepare to become a joint heir with Christ. In the words of Elder Bruce R. McConkie, "People were called to glory and dignity and honor and reward, . . . people were called to eternal life" ("Making Our Calling and Election Sure,"<i>Brigham Young University Speeches of the Year</i>[Provo, 25 March 1969], p. 6). There are no exceptions. There are no maybes. There are no losers, for Peter said we have all been called "to glory and virtue" (2 Peter 1:3).<br><br>The most significant quest in this life is to gain a personal assurance that we<i>will</i>become what we have been called to become. This effort and this process we refer to as "Coming unto Christ."<br><br>With that as a given, let's look at another eternal truth and a mortal reality.<br><br>Each one of us is different. There are no exact look-alikes and there are no exact act-alikes.<br><br>1. We differ in our<i>physical appearance.</i>Some are tall and some are short. Some are beautiful and some are more beautiful. Some are handsome and some are not so handsome.<br><br>2. We differ in our<i>mental capacity.</i>Some of you seem to sail through with a 4.0 GPA while others of us struggle just to stay in school.<br><br>3. We differ in our<i>gifts</i>and<i>talents</i>and<i>personality traits.</i><br><br>4. We differ in our<i>background.</i>Some of you come from faithful LDS families; some of you have even had ancestors who walked the plains as they came to the valleys. Some of you are converts to the Church, and some of you are the only member of your family who belongs to the Church.<br><br>5. We differ in our<i>self-image.</i>Some of you have high self-esteem and others of us have a poor self-image. We judge ourselves differently, sometimes by a different standard. Sometimes we judge ourselves too harshly--and sometimes not harshly enough.<br><br>6. We differ in our<i>faith</i>and<i>testimony.</i>On the ladder of faith, there are some of you who are nearer the top rung of the ladder. Others are struggling just to get a foothold on the bottom rung. I have come to believe that the rung of the ladder you are on is not nearly as important as the direction you are moving--be it up or down.<br><br>Each one of us came to this earth with our own unique and different package filled with enough positive strengths to overcome the personal challenges that are also a part of our makeup. We must never forget that the number of gifts as well as the challenges we each have does not categorize us as being better or worse than another. How we<i>handle</i>our package is what makes the difference.<br><br>Let me say it in a little different way. A person more gifted than another is not necessarily a better person than another; and, conversely, an individual who has received fewer endowments from the Lord is not less qualified for godhood than another. Remember, the Lord gave the very same commendation to the servant who magnified two talents as to the servant who increased five talents.<br><br>From an eternal perspective, each one has the same promise. Each one of us was called and elected to glory and eternal life.<br><br>We must also remember that no one has a life void of trials and heartaches and severe challenges, and that with each one of these experiences comes a divine promise. Whether you are a student, a professor, or a prophet of God, the process is individualized and serves the same purpose.<br><br>Now, let's talk about trials for a moment. First, where do they come from? What causes them to happen?<br><br>I believe that trials come from many sources and for many reasons. It is true that some of our trials are sent directly from our Father in Heaven in the hope that they will refine us and draw us closer to him. However, some of our trials are self-imposed because of our own poor judgment. These errors are a part of the learning process. They may not necessarily result from an evil act. Whatever the source of the trial, if properly approached and handled, it will draw us closer to God.<br><br>It may be helpful and comforting to refer to some of the promises of the Lord as we struggle through these experiences. We read, as Paul recorded:<br><br><i>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</i>[1 Corinthians 10:13]<br><br>Remember Paul's two points: (1) There will be no trial--there will be no challenge--beyond our ability to handle. (2) As we turn to him, God provides the way for us to escape, or to get through the trial.<br><br>Perhaps some of you or your family members or friends struggle and suffer as Paul did throughout his whole lifetime. Paul called it like it was when he said:<br><br><i>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</i>[Hebrews 12:11]<br><br>"Exercised" by a trial means to turn to God.<br><br>Peter taught us that it is better to suffer in trials for doing right, even if you must take the scoffing and ridicule of friends. He said:<br><br><i>If ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye. . . .</i><br><br><i>For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</i>[1 Peter 3:14, 17]<br><br>And Paul adds to our understanding of this teaching when he spoke of Moses. He said Moses "refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter," followed by these important words, "choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season" (Hebrews 11:24–25).<br><br>It has been my experience that our capacity to handle trials depends on two things:<br><br>1. Our understanding of their purpose and their source.<br><br>2. Whether, with this understanding, we increase in our faith in our Heavenly Father and in his Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Paul helps us understand why we have trials as he tells of the thorn that beset him. Here he speaks of the trials that were a part of his process of "Coming unto Christ":<br><br><i>And lest I should be exalted above measure</i>[my interpretation would be "lest I become prideful"]<i>. . . , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.</i><br><br>He said it was a messenger sent from Satan to buffet him so he wouldn't become exalted above measure. Then he goes on to say (and there's a great message here):<br><br><i>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</i><br><br>Then a peace came to Paul, and he heard a voice that said:<br><br><i>My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</i>[And then Paul said:]<i>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</i>[2 Corinthians 12:7–9]<br><br>Okay, now how do we handle our trials? How do we get through them on a daily basis? We have important insights and counsel from Moroni as he tells us how to keep new converts believing in Christ, how to maintain their faith in Christ.<br><br>You'll remember in those first verses of Moroni 6 that we are told of the qualifications for one who is to be baptized. Then, as we go through the fourth, fifth, and sixth verses, Moroni names four things that, if followed, will keep us faithful in Christ. Moroni was speaking of the new convert, but these things apply to all of us.<br><br>First, he said we must be "nourished by the good word of God." Simply stated, Moroni is saying we must<i>read from the revelations</i>every day.<br><br>Second, we must "keep them continually watchful unto<i>prayer"</i>(emphasis added). We must be on our knees every day.<br><br>Third, we must serve one another. He uses the terms that they met "together oft," and they spoke "one with another concerning the welfare" of each other--which is to say,<i>service.</i><br><br>Last of all, Moroni said they must<i>partake of the sacrament,</i>"in remembrance of the Lord Jesus" (see Moroni 6:4–6).<br><br>Moroni taught us these four simple practices: (1) scripture reading, daily; (2) prayer, daily; (3) service, daily; and (4) the sacrament on Sundays. These will see us through our trials.<br><br>Now, it is also true that we may not feel to express gratitude for our trials until years later. When our daughters were young--one of them was a newborn baby--my wife's life was threatened by lung cancer. It was a time of wrenching our very heartstrings, as the Prophet Joseph said the Lord would do (see<i>JD</i>20:259, 24:197). Perhaps, because of our youth, we were not able to feel thankful for our trials at that time. We just tried to get through them. Now, however, thirty-one years later, we appreciate and are thankful for all that trial taught us, for the strength we've drawn from it that has helped us through many another trial.<br><br>Here is some comforting counsel from the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i><br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:18–19]<br><br>Yes, I believe the Lord meant<i>all</i>things with thankfulness, even trials and sorrows. You understand why it is important to be thankful for all things--it is because all things draw us closer to God.<br><br>As we do these things of which we have spoken, we will increase in our faith, our faith in Christ. There is no other way to effectively handle trial. As faith increases, so does our trust in him for all our needs. With increased faith and hope, we may then be able to do as Peter did. He said:<br><br><i>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</i><br><br><i>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</i>[1 Peter 5:6–7]<br><br>For a few more minutes now, let's speak of how to qualify for his help or, in other words, how to "bind" the Lord to his promises. There is a scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants that, when understood, opens up a whole new world of understanding on how to "bind" the Lord. Remember, he has said that he is bound when we do as he says. In section 88 we read:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, there is in each one of us a measure of light and a measure of darkness. Every time we do the things that we've been speaking of, the light inside of us increases and the darkness decreases. Every time we kneel and pray, the light increases and the darkness decreases. Every time we read from the Book of Mormon, likewise the light increases and the darkness decreases. Light and darkness cannot occupy the same place at the same time.<br><br>There are other things that we do that increase the light inside us. Whenever we're thoughtful and kind and honest, the light inside us increases. Whenever we observe the Sabbath, the light increases and the darkness decreases.<br><br>And then, conversely, if we are not careful, there are those things that we may get involved in that cause the darkness to increase and the light to decrease. There is no way that you and I can involve ourselves in pornography or anything of vulgarity without the darkness inside us increasing. There is no way you and I can look at an indecent scene on television or video, or listen to explicit sexual encounters, or view nudity, without the darkness inside us increasing and the light decreasing. There is no way we can use uncouth language without the darkness increasing inside us, because there is no way that light and darkness can occupy the same place at the same time.<br><br>When I speak of the light and the darkness, brothers and sisters, remember that the darkness that can overcome the light originated with Satan. And the light that we speak of is the light that comes from heaven. This is the light inside that gives you the right to call upon the powers of heaven when you need help. You will make wiser decisions--you will be more comfortable with your decisions because the light inside you has increased and your opportunity to draw on heaven's powers will increase also.<br><br>We must remember that all rewards for doing good do not come in this life. All penalties for doing wrong are not meted out in this life either. In fact, what we receive here is only a shadow of what the future holds for each one of us, be it good or ill. God will not be mocked--that is an eternal truth.<br><br>Now, in conclusion, I'd like to speak of what is at the heart of the process of "Coming unto Christ."<br><br>In southern Arizona there is a prison complex operated by both federal and state agencies. This prison complex has maximum as well as minimum security prisoners in it. Once each year, for several years, the authorities have permitted members of the Church to come in and hold a conference for the inmates. I've had the great blessing of being there a couple of times. The last was a few years ago.<br><br>After our proper clearances, we came to the gates of the prison and were permitted in. The doors clanged behind us. You like the doors at home to close quietly, but the prison doors do not close quietly. We went into a room. It was a good-sized recreation room where we were to meet with fifty or sixty men. Appropriate guards were stationed around. There were men there who had done some very terrible things. Some would be there the rest of their lives.<br><br>As they came in, I shook hands with many of them. One--I had been his bishop many years earlier. Another--I had been his elders quorum president. Another young man reminded me that just a few short years earlier I had visited with him as a missionary as we toured one of the missions in Great Britain. These were men who had lost their priesthood, had lost their membership in the Church. Many had lost their wives and their children. These were men who were there to pay their debt to society for some horrible things.<br><br>We sang the songs of Zion. We used a little Cassio organ. One of them prayed, and then several of them were invited to speak. Each one--I think there were three or four of them who spoke--each one spoke about the Savior. Each one spoke about repentance and forgiveness and the feelings they had about the Savior. As they spoke, I felt an unusual spirit. The content of their talks was unusual, but beyond that, I was feeling stirrings inside that I hadn't experienced very often: good feelings, warm feelings, peaceful feelings. I was confused because I couldn't understand how, in a place like this with men who had done what they had done, I could be having the spiritual experience I was having. The meeting went on. Those of us who were called to speak finished, and the two-hour meeting was concluded.<br><br>As I got on the plane and went home, trying to understand, I turned to 3 Nephi and read the record there of the Beatitudes. Listen carefully to the words of this particular verse. I had not understood what I understand now until I had that experience: "And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost" (3 Nephi 12:6).<br><br>The scripture does not say "blessed are the righteous for they shall be filled." That's obvious. But the scripture says blessed are they who want to be--blessed are they who want more than anything else to be righteous. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness. That's the center focus of coming unto Christ.<br><br>After reading that verse, I began to understand why I was having such an experience in a place like that with men who will pay their debt to society. These were men who were now learning repentance and were participants in the process of "Coming unto Christ."<br><br>Remember when King Benjamin finished his address and asked the people how they felt about it--he'd been teaching them about the Savior and about the beggar and about serving one another. The people said, "The Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent . . . has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil" (Mosiah 5:2). Now let's keep that in focus. These were not perfect people. There are no perfect people on the earth. Only one who has come here was perfect.<br><br>But these are people who want to do better. And it's not just wanting to, it's wanting to with all of your heart--to hunger and to thirst after righteousness.<br><br>Let me conclude with this:<br><br><i>And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.</i>[Moroni 10:30]<br><br>I'm beginning to understand, brothers and sisters, what that means. It means when I have done the best I can, when I've not played games with the counsel, but when I have really, really tried, I still cannot perfect myself, in and of myself. There is no way. But the difference between what I can do and what must be done is accomplished because of the grace of Christ. I pray that the Lord will bless you and me in this magnificent process we call "Coming unto Christ." I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>H.

<h1>Is Right - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I know that most of you who gathered tonight from across the United States and Canada come with a determination to do what is right. You have had those feelings in your heart to live worthily no matter what others may say. I speak also to others present who want to have such feelings. You are of the finest generation that has come to earth. You have prepared yourself well in the premortal existence and have been selected to come forth in this singularly important time in the unfolding of Father in Heaven's plan. I am deeply moved to be in your presence. I realize that the majority of you do not have the slightest idea of how truly capable, noble, and wonderful you are.<br><br>I have prayed about, pondered over, and worked on this message because each one of you is an exceptional daughter or son of our Father in Heaven and I want to help you. Early on, I strongly felt impressed to discuss with you how to make your noble dreams and aspirations a reality. I am sure that each one of you has treasured dreams of what you want your life to be. Having moved down the path of life ahead of you, I have learned that while there are growing challenges along the way, life is most beautiful. As you continue to exercise faith in the Master and are obedient to His commandments, you will receive magnificent blessings. Some of those blessings you will have dreamed about. Other blessings He plans for you are beyond anything you can conceive of now. My earnest desire is to help you live so that your worthy dreams become realities.<br><br>I have wrestled with many different ways to communicate principles that I know--if understood and applied--would greatly help you. As this evening approached, I realized I did not yet have a satisfactory way to express what I know to be true. Then a peace enveloped me. I felt that if I strive the best I can to talk to you, and you listen with an open mind and heart with real intent, having faith in the Lord, then it won't matter too much what I say. You will have impressions come to you that will be individually tailored to your needs. As you write those impressions down and follow them, they will be guidelines for your life and will help you realize your righteous dreams.<br><br>You are at a time of life when there are many critically important decisions to be made, and you are understandably unsure of your capacity to make them. You live in a world where it is increasingly more difficult to assure that your worthy dreams and aspirations will come true by avoiding the allurements and temptations that Satan would put in your path to destroy you. You may have doubts about your own self-worth. You want to be accepted. You have questions about your future and about how to gain true and enduring friendships. You want to find an eternal companion who has the same deep desire to live worthily and to accomplish much of good in this life. For many, you want to know if the person you have growing feelings for is indeed the one to be your eternal companion. But you are not sure of your ability to decide. You are growing in spiritual discipline--that is, your ability to discern the promptings of the Spirit and your capacity to follow them. Over time, that capacity will increase and grow stronger until it becomes easier and easier to automatically do the right things. You have built a shield against temptation. But now, while that spiritual discipline is developing, you must be very careful to avoid choices that would take you from the path of happiness.<br><br>I have learned from personal experience how being helped to make the right decision at a critical time can bless your entire life. I have also seen by working closely with individuals who made wrong decisions how devastating that can be on the rest of their lives. My intent is to give you suggestions on how to be sure you make the right choices. I will share four personal experiences that taught me important lessons, with a sincere desire to help you gain confidence in making the right choices consistently in your life. Then I will try to identify how Satan works so that you will be more prepared to avoid the pitfalls he will place in your path.<br><br>In college I was given the privilege of joining a very elect honorary engineering society. As I attended the initiatory activities, everyone was drinking. I asked for a soft drink and was handed a glass. As I raised it to my lips, I could smell alcohol. I looked around the room. All the eyes were on me. These were professionals who had just given me a great honor. Should I pretend to drink so as not to offend? No. I sat the glass down and then noticed that three other inductees also sat their glasses aside. Do what is right and others will follow your example. Every time you make the right choice in the face of potential criticism, you build strength that makes it easier the next time. The reverse is also true. Satan counts on that.<br><br>One summer, as a teenager, I worked on an oyster boat off the coast of Long Island in New York to earn funds for college. The other members of the crew were seasoned oystermen, hardened by the harsh winter environment in which they spent much of their lives battling the icy ocean and raw wind to secure their catch. I was an enigma to them, easier to distrust than to understand. They shunned me as a company spy, then as a crazy kid who didn't know how to be a man. Later, I became better at my duties and tried to build friendships. They offered to make me "a real man" by joining them on their all-night indulgences. I thanked them but declined, and the tension grew more intense.<br><br>The summer weather was beautiful and the ocean magnificent. We were engaged in relatively simple tasks, such as transferring small oysters to a more distant portion of the sound where the nutrients accelerated their growth and improved their flavor. Except when a dredge full of oysters was dumped onto the deck, signaling a flurry of intense activity, there was much time for contemplation. While my deck mates dozed by their shovels, I read and pondered the content of the Book of Mormon. I cannot adequately express the powerful awakening within me that came from those weeks of study of the Book of Mormon under singularly unusual circumstances.<br><br>We slept in envelope-type bunks sandwiched into the restricted space between the ship's diesel engine and hull. One night at dockside I retired early since some of the crew planned unrighteous activity outside our boat. I was suddenly shaken into consciousness by the powerful hand of a deck mate, Toddy, a giant of a man. He was brandishing a hammer in my face, and his breath reeked of alcohol. Stunned, I realized that there was no way that I could escape him. I thought I had come to the end of the road. Then I heard what he was shouting, "Scotty, get your fins and mask. There's a man overboard, and you can save him."<br><br>That night I learned a lesson I have never forgotten. Publicly the crew members ridiculed me, but privately they respected me for my standards. The confidence that came from that knowledge let me quietly help three of them with some serious personal challenges.<br><br>I know that you will find the same response as you consistently choose to obey your principles. You are establishing a reputation. When you make it clear that you will not vary from your standards, you will be led to individuals like yourself and the criticism from others will become less intense. Often those who publicly deride you for your high standards privately do not want you to violate them. They need your good example. Whether it be turning your back on an off-color joke, refusing to see an R-rated movie or videocassette, or walking out of a party that is moving in the wrong direction, make your standards clear to others by quietly making the right choices when the temptation is first presented. A decisive, correct choice made once and consistently kept thereafter will avoid much heartache. You then can use your energy in keeping your resolve rather than repeatedly wrestling with the same challenge. Also, you will greatly reduce the possibility that you will be overcome by temptation.<br><br>I grew up in a home where my father was not a member of the Church and my mother was less active. That all changed later, and they spent much of their life as temple workers. With that background I didn't know much about the Church, even though I thought I did. When I was about to graduate from the university, the Lord dropped an atomic bomb in my life. Her name was Jeanene Watkins. She was a beautiful girl. It took me a long time to date her because so many others recognized her wonderful qualities. As we began to date, I discovered that she was all I had ever dreamed of finding. I fell completely in love with her. I could tell she had deep feelings for me also. One night, when we were talking about the future, she carefully wove into the conversation an important comment. She said, "When I marry, it will be to a returned missionary in the temple." I don't remember anything else she said. I hadn't thought much about a mission and didn't understand much about temple marriage. I went home and couldn't think of anything else. I was awake all night. I couldn't do anything at the university the next day. Soon I was at the bishop's office, having prayed about the importance of a mission. We both went on missions, and when we returned were sealed in the temple. Much later I came to realize that she would have left me had I not made the right choices. Jeanene's courage in standing up for her dream of a temple marriage to a returned missionary, regardless of her love for me, has made all of the difference in our lives together. I will never be able to thank her adequately for not compromising her righteous dreams.<br><br>Your decisions are like switch points on a railroad system. They determine where you will end up in life. When you consistently make the right choices, you are the happiest, receive the greatest personal growth, and have the most productive life. When you make the wrong choices, you may find yourself at an entirely different destination than you want. While there is the process of repentance to come back, it is often painful and sometimes leaves permanent physical scars that cannot be cured as well as your spirit can.<br><br>At one time I worked on the immediate staff of a very hardworking, demanding, misunderstood man who became the father of the nuclear navy that provided great protection for the United States at a critical time in world conditions. His name is Hyman Rickover. I have great respect for him. After eleven years in that service, I received a call from the First Presidency to preside over a mission. I knew I would have to tell Admiral Rickover immediately. As I explained the call and that it would mean I would have to quit my job, he became rather excited. He said some unrepeatable things, broke the paper tray on his desk, and, in the comments that followed, clearly established two points.<br><br>"Scott, what you are doing in this defense program is so vital that it will take a year to replace you, so you can't go. Second, if you do go, you are a traitor to your country."<br><br>I said, "I can train my replacement in the two remaining months, and there won't be any risk to the country."<br><br>There was more conversation, and he finally said, "I never will talk to you again. I don't want to see you again. You are finished, not only here, but don't ever plan to work in the nuclear field again."<br><br>I responded, "Admiral, you can bar me from the office, but, unless you prevent me, I am going to turn this assignment over to another individual"<br><br>He asked, "What's the name of the man who wants you?"<br><br>I told him, "President David O. McKay."<br><br>He added, "If that's the way Mormons act, I don't want any of them working for me."<br><br>I knew he would try to call President McKay, who was ill, and that conversation would benefit no one. I also knew that in the Idaho Falls area there were many members of the Church whose families depended upon their working in our program. I didn't want to cause them harm. I also knew that I had been called by the Lord. I didn't know what to do. Then, the words of the song we sang tonight began to run through my mind: "Do what is right; let the consequence follow" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 237). While I had never contacted a General Authority in my life, I had been interviewed by Elder Harold B. Lee, so I had a feeling to call him. I explained that the admiral would try to call President McKay and would make some negative comments, but everything was all right and I would be able to accept my call. While doing that, my heart kept saying, "Is this going to turn out all right or will somebody be innocently hurt who depends on our program for livelihood?" The song would come back: "Do what is right; let the consequence follow." True to his word, the admiral ceased to speak to me. When critical decisions had to be made, he would send a messenger or I would communicate through a third party. We accomplished the changeover.<br><br>On my last day in the office I asked for an appointment with him, and his secretary gasped. I went with a copy of the Book of Mormon in my hand. He looked at me and said, "Sit down, Scott. What do you have? I have tried every way I can to force you to change. What is it you have?"<br><br>There followed a very interesting, quiet conversation. There was more listening this time. He said he would read the Book of Mormon. Then something I never thought would occur happened. He added, "When you come back from the mission, I want you to call me. There will be a job for you."<br><br>You will have challenges and hard decisions to make throughout your life. Be determined<i>now</i>to always do what is right and let the consequence follow. The consequence will always be for your best good. You will learn that it is easiest over the long run to stand for what is right and do the difficult thing to begin with. Once you take that position, following through is not too hard. An individual who cuts corners and justifies some departure from true standards, for whatever reason, finds that seeds are planted that produce problems later. Those problems are far more difficult to overcome than taking a correct stand initially.<br><br>Do what is right even though it seems you will be alone in so doing, that you are going to lose friends, that you will be criticized. What you will find is that by doing what is right, after a period of testing, the finest friends will be discovered and you can mutually support each other in your resolve to be obedient to all of the commandments of the Lord. I have never been sorry on any occasion that I stood for what was right even against severe criticism. You will learn that truth. You will also discover that when you have taken a determined stand for right, when you have established personal standards and made covenants to keep them, when temptations come and you act according to your standards, you will be reinforced and given strength beyond your own capacity, if that is needed. Difficulty comes when you enter the battle of temptation without a fixed plan. That is what Satan desires, for then you are ripe for defeat.<br><br>Now I want to deal with sensitive issues that are easier to talk about one on one--so, in my mind, I am going to try as hard as I can to imagine you as an individual seated somewhere in this large broadcast network wanting to know how to make your hopes and dreams for the future come true. I am going to try and block out everything and everybody else so that we can talk privately. You may want to do the same thing.<br><br>At this time of life, it is most important that your thoughts and acts be clean and pure so that the Holy Ghost can guide you. Satan is determined at this critical time of your life to overpower you, not with an onslaught of serious temptation suddenly presented but by carefully placed alluring, but seemingly unimportant infractions of your long-established standards. He would use these temptations to skillfully lead you away from the path of righteousness. Satan knows that as long as you can be led by the Holy Spirit, you can resist him. He has no power over a righteous person. The Lord has made it possible for you to resist the devil's temptations. When obedient, you will be inspired to know what to do and have the capacity to do it.<br><br>So that you will be forewarned, I will try to show you how Satan works. Let us pretend that from the middle of this pulpit to my right, I place all of the good things that can be done in life. The farther from the center of the pulpit, the better they are. And on my left, all of the wrong things that can be done. The farther from the pulpit, the worse they are. Here in the middle it is difficult to discern where something is just a little good or a little bad. This is where Satan works with righteous people. This is the twilight zone where you cannot clearly discern between that which is good and that which is bad. It is easy to become confused here. Live well within the wonderful area of good the Lord has defined and you won't have any problems with temptation. If you are not sure whether something is appropriate to look at, to listen to, to think about, or to do--<i>don't do it.</i>You could be headed for one of Satan's traps.<br><br>Now, observe how Satan works. A righteous returned missionary meets a pure, lovely young woman. They are at an age where they can think seriously about marriage. They begin to date. He develops deep, beautiful feelings of love for her--and she for him. Neither one intends to do anything that is wrong. They have decided not to cross the boundary into Satan's territory. When he is with her he wants to express the feelings he has for her--somehow, after a while, holding her hand doesn't quite communicate what he feels. Each time they are together they do what they did the time before and a little more to physically express their feelings. They move closer and closer to the boundary, but they are determined not to cross it. One day Satan plants the seeds of rationalization in their minds. By that I mean that he tempts them to believe that something that is really wrong can be twisted or justified to be acceptable because of their special circumstances. Rationalization is one of the devil's most effective tools. These thoughts are planted: "You really love one another. You plan to be sealed in the temple. You both are worthy and will be true to each other. You are an exception. You have not reached the limit." The boundary is moved farther to the left. So they continue their physical expressions. They are very much in love. Each time they become a little more intimate. Strong, powerful emotions are aroused, but they are sure they can control them. They are going to be sealed in the temple. Then those emotions become overpowering, and they commit acts that they had determined they would never perform outside of marriage. Their lives are terribly complicated--tragically and unnecessarily.<br><br>Please recognize that you cannot barely cross the boundary and not encounter the high risk of slipping and being led to places you have no intent of ever visiting or experiences you have no desire to ever have. That is how Satan works. He knows that the powerful emotions of sexual transgression are addictive. One act leads to another and to another. Appetites are generated and powerful emotions experienced until the transgressor loses all perspective of reality and is led deeper and deeper into sin, without recognizing how far he has wandered or how rapidly he is being imprisoned. You have seen how others begin with experimentation and then are drawn deeper and deeper into sin apparently without any recognition of how far they have fallen.<br><br>How can two people in love avoid crossing the boundary and falling into temptation? First, let us define love. To love another righteously is to protect, to elevate, to keep pure and undefiled, to sacrifice one's self for the benefit of the other. To love is to hold in reserve sacred, intimate experiences for the sanctity of marriage. There, when they are properly used, they draw a couple together and strengthen them for the growing responsibilities of parenthood. They result in the formation of physical bodies for the spirit children Father in Heaven entrusts to a mother and father. In this sacred setting appropriate intimate expression is beautiful and purposeful.<br><br>Satan's agents speak of love, but it is really lust. It is the increasing gratification of personal appetites at the expense of another. It leads to serious violation of the commandments of God. Why does Satan concentrate so intently on sexual transgression? Because he knows that immorality feeds upon itself. At the same time it numbs spiritual sensitivity and will neutralize the will to resist. There is never any place for Satan's kind of love in your life. If elements of it have found place in a relationship, get rid of them--now.<br><br>Now some specific suggestions to help you keep from crossing the boundary:<br><br>• Choose voluntarily to do what is right. Only willing obedience yields the full blessings that come from obeying the commandments of God.<br><br>• Firmly establish personal standards. Choose a time of deep spiritual reflection, when there is no pressure on you, and you can confirm your decisions by sacred impressions. Decide then what you will do and what you will not do to express feelings. The Spirit will guide you. Then do not vary from those decisions no matter how right it may seem when the temptation comes. Don't take the first step, as innocent as it may seem. The realization of your dreams depends upon your determination to never betray your standards.<br><br>• Recognize that the boundary between good and evil never changes, but you can be tempted to color your perception of that boundary through rationalization. I mean by trying to justify something you suspect or know is wrong as being acceptable in your special case.<br><br>• Surround yourself with good friends by being in the right places doing the right things. None of us are up all of the time. When you are down it is easier to make a serious mistake. Often, when you are down a good friend will be up and can serve as a reminder of your worthy goals. Some are so anxious for friendship and popularity that they compromise their standards. You will not obtain desirable friends that way, but you can lose your worthy dreams.<br><br>• Stay close to the Church. You will have a constant refreshment of your resolve to do what is right and will be strengthened by the example of others doing it.<br><br>• A safe rule to follow is to never do anything alone that you wouldn't do in the presence of parents shortly before marriage.<br><br>• Do not be misled by what the world defines as acceptable. To intentionally excite emotions that are reserved for sacred purposes within the covenant of marriage is seriously wrong. I solemnly witness that it is transgression to touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body except within the bonds of marriage between a man and woman. Satan has spread abroad the idea that much intimacy is permissible short of the final act among consenting individuals. That is a devastating lie. Such activity is a violation of the law of chastity, and it requires repentance. It is not only wise not to be immoral, it is a fundamental commandment of God that He considers to be very important.<br><br>Your spirit body was created by your Heavenly Father. Your physical body is made in His image. He can lead you to happiness beyond what you can imagine now. His purpose is to help you realize your fullest potential in growth, accomplishment, and happiness while you are here on earth. His objective is your eternal happiness.<br><br>There is another who is extremely gifted, powerful, and brilliant--but devilish--whose purpose is to bind you to be his servant. One of the most powerful tools he has to take you from the course of happiness is to tempt you to experiment with intimate acts. Sexual transgression feeds upon itself. It stimulates powerful, physical emotions that become increasingly addictive. At the same time it numbs spiritual sensitivity and neutralizes your will to resist. Immorality is foreign to your nature. Knowing that, Satan will tempt you to begin with small addictive doses rather than tempting you to step from a clean and pure life directly into serious immoral transgression.<br><br>Nephi gave you a powerful way to succeed in overcoming temptation. He said:<br><br><i>Whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i>[1 Nephi 15:24]<br><br>If there is anyone that hears this message that has seriously transgressed, with all of the tenderness of my heart I ask you to decide to repent,<i>now.</i>It is not good to violate the commandments of the Lord. It is tragic to do nothing about it. Sin is like cancer in the body. It will never heal itself. It will become progressively worse unless cured through repentance. You can be made completely whole, new, purified, and clean, every whit, through the miracle of repentance. If you have transgressed, please decide to see your bishop<i>now</i>so that your worthy dreams can be made reality.<br><br>For those who commit a serious mistake, Satan whispers: "Your life is ruined. There is no way back. You might as well continue in the path you are on." That is a lie. The Savior gave His life that even the most serious transgressions can be overcome and an individual can be made new, clean, and pure through repentance and obedience to the Lord's commandments. To believe otherwise would be to deny the efficacy of the Atonement of our Savior.<br><br>In summary, your happiness--now, throughout this life, and on into eternity--depends upon your making correct decisions and holding fast to them. Some make choices based only on their own personal experience and trust little else. Some make choices by blindly following their peer leaders. Others choose what they think will provide the most friends and greatest success. Some wait for a challenge to present itself and then decide what to do. Each of these alternatives can be disastrous.<br><br>With all of the love in my heart, I ask you to resolutely decide to keep the standards of the Lord. Please live so that the Holy Ghost can inspire you to consistently do what is right. I testify that as a result, your worthy dreams or something even better will be yours. Your Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son love you. They want your happiness even more than you can now possibly know. They will help you attain that happiness as you steadfastly do all you can to obey their commandments. I testify They love you and will help you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>ll These Things Be? The Last Days - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
May I speak for everyone of you in extending our love and sympathy to Sister Lee, her children, and grandchildren upon the death of our dear friend and president Rex Lee. Thank you, Janet, for all that Rex and you have done for the Church and this great university. May the Lord bless you and yours now and always.<br><br>Sister Ballard and I are honored that President and Sister Bateman are here. I have learned many things from President Bateman, one of which is never miss a meeting. At the one meeting of the search committee that Bishop Bateman missed, we voted unanimously to submit his name to become president of this great university. You are so blessed to have him as your president.<br><br>I bring you greetings from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles with special greetings from President Gordon B. Hinckley. His feelings for the young people of the Church are deep and profound, almost fatherly. He is vitally interested in your temporal and spiritual welfare, and he cares deeply about your eternal progression.<br><br>It is a sobering thing to prepare something meaningful to say to a congregation of enthusiastic young scholars. I can't help but be reminded of the story President Hinckley has told of the police officer who came upon a man who was kneeling on the ground with his ear to the curb. The officer watched the man for a few minutes and then asked him, "What in the world are you doing?"<br><br>"I'm listening," the man replied.<br><br>So the policeman knelt down and put his ear to the curb. He listened for a couple of minutes, and then he said, "I can't hear anything."<br><br>"I know," the man replied. "It's been that way all day!"<br><br>I sincerely hope that you don't feel that way after I've concluded with my remarks.<br><br>Now, with the Lord's help, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is on a lot of people's minds. My intention is not to alarm or to frighten but to discuss the significant and interesting times in which we are now living, to consider some of the events and circumstances we can anticipate in the future, and to suggest a few things we can all do to fortify ourselves and our families for the challenges and trials that will surely come into all of our lives at one time or another.<br><br>Toward the end of the Savior's ministry, His disciples came to Him with several questions all centered around one key prophetic event: "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" (Matthew 24:3).<br><br>Two thousand years ago, Christ's followers were concerned about that. Every generation of believers since then, I think, has been concerned about the last days to one degree or another. So the Lord's response to His disciples is meaningful to all of us. To the first question--"When shall these things be?"--He said, "Take heed that no man deceive you" (see Matthew 24:3–4). That is very significant.<br><br><i>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</i><br><br><i>And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</i><br><br><i>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</i>[Matthew 24:5–7]<br><br>I want to pause here for a moment and suggest to you, if you haven't been aware, that some of these things seem to be occurring with ever-increasing regularity. If you measured the natural disasters that have occurred in the world during the last ten years and plotted that year by year, you would see an acceleration.<br><br>The earth is rumbling, and earthquakes are occurring in "divers places." Human nature being what it is, we don't normally pay much attention to these natural phenomena until they happen close to where we are living. But when we contemplate what has happened during the past decade, not only with earthquakes but also with regard to hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, and the like, you would see an accelerating pattern.<br><br>So can we use this scientific data to extrapolate that the Second Coming is likely to occur during the next few years, or the next decade, or the next century? Not really. I am called as one of the apostles to be a special witness of Christ in these exciting, trying times, and I do not know when He is going to come again. As far as I know, none of my brethren in the Council of the Twelve or even in the First Presidency know. And I would humbly suggest to you, my young brothers and sisters, that if we do not know, then nobody knows, no matter how compelling their arguments or how reasonable their calculations. The Savior said that "of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only" (Matthew 24:36).<br><br>I believe when the Lord says "no man" knows, it really means that no man knows. You should be extremely wary of anyone who claims to be an exception to divine decree. But while the exact timing of the Second Coming remains in doubt, there is no question that scriptural prophecy relative to that momentous and sacred event is being fulfilled, sometimes in remarkable ways.<br><br>For example, I would draw your attention to Matthew 24:8, where it reads: "All these [the things we have been speaking about so far] are the beginning of sorrows."<br><br>There are times in the Church when there is persecution--even violence on occasion. I have personally worked through the aftermath of violence against the Church and know that to establish the Church requires a great deal of dedication, hard work, and courage.<br><br>Continuing His discussion of His own Second Coming, Jesus said, "And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many" (Matthew 24:10–11).<br><br>You may not be aware of it, but there are "false prophets" rising within and without the Church. They believe they have had revelations, that they know something the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles don't know. You need to be very careful of such people. If you are ever approached by anyone who claims special authority or revelation from God outside the sustained priesthood authority, turn and run from them as fast as you can. The Savior said that in the last days even the very elect could be pulled away from the truth by such false prophets.<br><br>We have had some "false prophets" arise right here in the state of Utah. There are a few groups that have drifted away from the gospel under the direction of those who claim to have received special instruction through personal revelation, and some have declared themselves as prophets. I know of one group that is led by a bright, capable, articulate young man who claimed to receive a revelation that he is the prophet and that he was called of God to establish the true church. Sadly, there are those who have chosen to follow such individuals, who in turn lead them directly away from the principles of truth and righteousness.<br><br>Perhaps that is why it is so interesting to me that when the Master was asked about the signs of His Second Coming and the end of the world, he first responded by warning His listeners to beware of false prophets.<br><br>His next comment, found in verse 12, is similarly interesting: "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold" (Matthew 24:12). Think about what that means. Today we are living in a society in which many men and women see no real purpose in marriage. Common law relationships, in which people just live together without legally and lawfully making a formal commitment to one another through marriage, are escalating at an ever-increasing rate. In the United States the birthrate of children to unwed mothers is at an all-time high, as is the divorce rate.<br><br>In his book<i>The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators,</i>William J. Bennett, former secretary of education, notes:<br><br><i>During the . . . 30-year period</i>[1960–1990]<i>there has been more than a 500 percent increase in violent crime; more than a 400 percent increase in illegitimate births; a tripling of the percentage of children living in single-parent homes; a tripling in the teenage suicide rate; a doubling in the divorce rate; and a drop of almost 75 points in SAT scores. . . .</i><br><br>[Today,]<i>30 percent of all births</i>[are]<i>illegitimate. . . .</i><br><br><i>By 2000, according to some projections, 40 percent of all American births . . . will occur out of wedlock.</i>[<i>The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994), pp. 8, 47]<br><br>With so little of long-lasting, fully committed love in the world today, one would think you could turn to entertainment mediums to find a better, happier, more satisfying model for living. After all, history indicates there have always been storytellers and dramatists who encouraged their audiences with stories of a better world where maidens are fair, where princes are charming, and where everyone always lives happily ever after. Unfortunately, current entertainment forms tend to portray life even uglier and harsher than it really is. Movie critic Michael Medved laments the demise of larger-than-life heroes on film and television programs, claiming that we are now living in an age of "smaller-than-life antiheroes." Sadly, one doesn't have to look far to find all manner of violence, ugliness, and illicit sexuality coming at us over the public airwaves. At the same time, wholesome, clean, uplifting, inspiring programs are few and far between. Hollywood and the television industry must be held accountable for their influence on America's social landscape, and I believe that influence is considerable.<br><br>I believe you cannot watch on film people gunned down in cold blood, in living color, and not have it affect the attitudes and thoughts of some of the people who see it. I believe you cannot continually portray human sexuality as just another physical appetite that has to be satisfied--whenever and with whomever the urge strikes--without diminishing respect for God and His commandments. And I believe that the desensitizing effect of such media abuses on the hearts and souls of those who are exposed to them result in a partial fulfillment of the Savior's statement that "because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold" (Matthew 24:12).<br><br>In order to keep the light and love of Christ burning in our hearts, we have to be careful in our choices of what we will watch and what we will read. Pornography is rampant and is absolutely, totally, completely destructive. Not too long ago I was assigned by the First Presidency to interview a man who had been excommunicated from the Church for adultery. It had required eight years for him to work his way through the long and sometimes painful process of reinstatement in the Church, and now he was sitting before me in an interview to determine his worthiness for a possible restoration of his priesthood and temple blessings. I asked him this simple question: "My dear brother, looking back on this traumatic time in your life, how did it happen?"<br><br>Tears began to flow freely down his cheeks as he tried to respond. At last he was able to speak. "Brother Ballard ," he said, "it all started the day I picked up a pornographic magazine in the barber shop. It was the first time in my life I had ever seen anything like that, and it intrigued me. I wanted to see more and more. And then I wanted to see things that were progressively more explicit. And then it wasn't enough to just look at pictures--I wanted to actually participate in some of the activities I was looking at. Eventually I was untrue to my wife and my family and unfaithful to covenants I had made with my Heavenly Father in His holy house."<br><br>The man continued through his tears: "I'm not trying to shift blame for the choices I made. I knew better than to do what I did, and I alone am responsible for my sins. But there's no question in my mind that exposure to pornography played a significant role in my spiritual decline." And then he asked me: "When you talk to the brethren of the Church, please warn them. Please tell them to be careful about the things they read and watch."<br><br>I'm not only going to tell you brethren that, I'm also going to extend that same warning to you sisters. All of you--please be vigilant in your entertainment choices. Some of the things that are being shown in our theaters and broadcast to our homes via television and videos and over the Internet are insidious and dangerous. Rather than falling within the scriptural admonition to seek after that which is "virtuous, lovely or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13), they are more clearly described in chapter 7 of Moroni, where the prophet Mormon teaches that "whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God . . . is of the devil" (Moroni 7:17).<br><br>Now I'm aware that some of you may think that you know better than I do about this subject. And you will argue your case based on artistic merit or the fact that "everyone is seeing it," or you will insist that you are not one of those people who will be influenced one way or the other by on-screen sex or violence.<br><br>To you I have only one question: Are you going to follow the true and living prophets or not? It really isn't any more complicated than that. The standard of the Church with regard to morality is clearly outlined in the "For the Strength of Youth" pamphlet, which you haven't outgrown, even though many of you are no longer in Young Men and Young Women. If you choose to read anything that contains material that is contrary to the moral standards of the Church, then you are placing yourself and your own wisdom above the counsel of God's prophets--a course of action that would indeed be very unwise. As soon as people begin to think that they know better than God or his oracles, or that counsel given doesn't apply to themselves, they are stepping onto a slippery slope that has claimed far too many victims already. It takes faith--real faith, unequivocable and unreserved--to accept and attempt to live by prophetic counsel even when you don't completely understand it. Such simple faith has the power to guide you safely through every challenge you may face in your life.<br><br>Last month I spoke at the funeral of one of my righteous senior missionaries. As I thought about his life, I realized that he had captured the ability to believe because of his simple faith in the words of the Lord and the words of the Lord's servants. This willingness to believe and live the gospel prepared my friend to meet the Savior as a "good and faithful servant."<br><br>Of course, Lucifer doesn't want us to feel or exhibit that kind of faith, and so he makes us feel uncomfortable with obedience. He plants defiance in our hearts with justification and rationalization, subtly convincing us that it is possible to live the spirit of the law even if we are in violation of its letter. Eventually he can make it seem wrong--or at least politically incorrect--to obey, branding it with derogatory labels like "blind faith." But we must never forget this about Lucifer: He is a liar. He is the father of all lies and has been from the beginning. He was cast out of Heavenly Father's premortal kingdom because of his disobedience, and now he has one goal, one eternal commitment that has never changed from the time of the War in Heaven until the present day. His sole purpose is to make you and me as miserable as he is, and the best way for him to accomplish that is to entice us into disobedience.<br><br>Although there are all kinds of misery in this world, the only kind that is eternal is misery of the soul. And that kind of misery is centered in sin and transgression. Be careful; stay morally clean in mind and body. Do not compromise the standards of chastity.<br><br>When we are not doing what we know we ought to be doing and when we are not living the way we know we ought to live, we have a tendency to be unhappy. And make no mistake about it, we know when we are not doing what we ought to do because every one of us here has a conscience. We are born with the Spirit of Christ, and we know instinctively what is right and what is wrong when it comes to our personal behavior. It offends that spirit when we allow ourselves and our values and standards to be manipulated by aesthetic propaganda in behalf of Satan's lies.<br><br>Consider the following words from the apostle Paul in connection with much of what we see and hear in contemporary media:<br><br><i>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</i><br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</i><br><br><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i><br><br><i>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</i><br><br><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</i>[2 Timothy 3:1–7]<br><br>Now, please don't misunderstand. I'm not trying to say that all of film or television or publishing or music is evil, because you and I both know that that is simply not true. There is much that is good in the media, and it can be a wondrous and marvelous thing and a blessing in our lives. But some of it is evil; there can be no other word to describe it.<br><br>This is the time, brothers and sisters, to make our voices heard. In the media today, as we would look at it from any vantage point, I think we would have to say that Lucifer's influence has a far more dominant influence than has the Lord's. We are in a war. This war is the same war that raged in the premortal world. Lucifer and his followers are committed in their evil direction. Our Heavenly Father and his beloved Son Jesus Christ have given a plan for our Heavenly Father's children, and we have the responsibility as leaders and members of the Church to take this glorious plan of Heavenly Father's to all of His children throughout the world. It is my judgment that much success will come as we become more expert and more able to harness the wonderful technology that our Heavenly Father has given to man to proclaim His message.<br><br>In Shakespeare's time, he was limited generally to the Globe Theatre, but we now have a global theater. As our opportunities widen with modern satellites, computers, fiber optics, and the Internet, the doors to the world are literally opened wide. Upon your shoulders will soon rest the responsibility to teach the world that God's way is the only way to find peace, joy, and happiness. Returning to chapter 24 of Matthew, verses 13–14:<br><br><i>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</i><br><br><i>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</i><br><br>I hope you are all aware of what is happening in terms of missionary work around the world. In the past six years we have carried the gospel to thirty-nine new countries. Did you know that? Are you keeping score, so to speak? This work is moving; it is beginning to cover the earth. While it is true that many of our Heavenly Father's children have never had the opportunity to hear the message of the Restoration, it's also true that the circumstances preventing them from receiving the gospel could quickly change--just as it did in eastern Europe. Who would have dreamed a decade ago that the Iron Curtain would be gone, almost overnight? It was remarkable--even miraculous--and today our missionaries are teaching the gospel where for fifty years we were prohibited from establishing a gospel presence. So it is happening, my brothers and sisters. Christ's gospel is going to all the world. Be alert! Be aware! Stay awake! Now to verses 23 and 24:<br><br><i>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</i><br><br><i>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</i><br><br>Now listen to verse 26:<br><br><i>Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</i>[Matthew 24:23–24, 26]<br><br>The Savior is telling his followers that one of the great signs of the times will be false prophets and false Christs. We've already spoken of this to some extent, but let me add this thought. We all witnessed the terrible tragedy in Waco, Texas, several years ago. Mr. Koresh had convinced those who lived in his compound that he was the Messiah. There are people all around the world who are now making the declaration that they are the Christ. Please be careful.<br><br>You keep your eyes riveted on the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We will not lead you astray. We cannot. Let me tell you why. Every week that I am in town, I attend a meeting of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve on the fourth floor of the Salt Lake Temple. If you could see the process by which decision and direction comes from that meeting, you would have a deep sense of confidence and comfort that the will of the Lord is being taught by the leaders of the Church. So keep your eyes riveted on the leadership of the Church. While individuals may falter, the body of general Church leadership will remain steadfast and true. If someone tells you that they have received revelation that the First Presidency and the Twelve have not received, run away from them.<br><br>Now, I want to talk to you about one other matter before closing. One of my missionaries came to me some time ago. He was a fine missionary. I asked him, "Elder, how can I help you?"<br><br>"President," he said, "I think I'm losing my testimony."<br><br>I couldn't believe it. I asked him how that could be possible.<br><br>"For the first time I have read some anti-Mormon literature," he said. "I have some questions, and nobody will answer them for me. I am confused, and I think I am losing my testimony."<br><br>I asked him what his questions were, and he told me. They were the standard anti-Church issues, but I wanted a little time to gather materials so I could provide meaningful answers. So we set up an appointment ten days later, at which time I told him I would answer everyone of his questions. As he started to leave, I stopped him.<br><br>"Elder, you've asked me several questions here today," I said. "Now I have one for you."<br><br>"Yes, President?"<br><br>"How long has it been since you read from the Book of Mormon?" I asked.<br><br>His eyes dropped. He looked at the floor for a while. Then he looked at me. "It's been a long time, President," he confessed.<br><br>"All right," I said. "You have given me my assignment. It's only fair that I give you yours. I want you to promise me that you will read in the Book of Mormon for at least one hour every day between now and our next appointment." He agreed that he would do that.<br><br>Ten days later he returned to my office, and I was ready. I pulled out my papers to start answering his questions. But he stopped me.<br><br>"President," he said, "that isn't going to be necessary." Then he explained, "I know that the Book of Mormon is true. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God."<br><br>"Well, that's great," I said, "but you're going to get answers to your questions anyway. I worked a long time on this, so you just sit there and listen."<br><br>And so I answered all of those questions, and then asked, "Elder, what have you learned from this?"<br><br>And he said, "Give the Lord equal time."<br><br>Now, my young brothers and sisters, you engrave that thought on your minds and carry it with you as you walk through this process of mortality. Give the Lord equal time. Give Him His due share of your thoughts, your time, your talent, and your attention. I know that you're all very busy with school and work and social responsibilities. This is a critical time in your lives when you are establishing a foundation for your families and your careers. There are many demands for your attention, and your time is limited by a wide variety of constraints. But as you learn to manage your time, be sure that you give the Lord His portion. Establish a time and place to study the scriptures on a daily basis, even if it's only for a few minutes at a time. Pray regularly. Serve faithfully in whatever capacity a call is extended, including home and visiting teaching, which is the very essence of gospel service. Those of you who are beginning your families, start now--even when your children are infants--to hold weekly, meaningful family home evenings where gospel lessons are taught and pleasant family activities are shared. In the great scheme of things, these things take so little time. But the long-term benefits to you and to your families are infinite and eternal, and they will do much to prepare you and your children for the steadily increasing challenges of the future.<br><br>And that's really what we're talking about this morning, my young brothers and sisters. These are the last days. As has been foretold by God's holy prophets since the world began, they are challenging times, and they are going to become even more challenging. So wherein is our safety? Where is our peace? Where is our joy? Where is our inner security?<br><br>My testimony to you is that safety, peace, joy, and security are found only in the life and mission of Jesus Christ, the Son of Almighty God. Bringing people to Him is the sum and substance of our ministry. So we embrace His teachings, we give up all of our sins, we repent, we do all that is in our power to do to come unto Him in a true spirit of discipleship, knowing perfectly well that it is through His grace that we are saved, even after all that we can do. And as we give ourselves to Christ, fully and completely, we find safety, peace, joy, and security in Him.<br><br>Does that mean we will not have turmoil or personal problems or sickness or family challenges or employment difficulties? Not at all. But it does mean that if our faith is anchored securely in our testimonies of Christ, we will be able to cope with whatever adversity comes our way, and we will be able to do so in a positive, faith-promoting manner. If we keep the eye of faith focused on Christ, we gain a broader view and an eternal perspective, and with that we can understand adversity from within the context of Heavenly Father's eternal plan for all of His children. And we can find comfort in this life in the eternal safety, peace, joy, and security that He promises.<br><br>Not too long ago I attended a missionary fireside in Idaho, after which I was introduced to a beautiful eighteen-year-old young woman who was fighting a battle with cancer. I was told that for the third time her cancer had come out of remission, and I was asked if it would be possible for me to give her a blessing. The family were converts to the Church, and her father said, "Brother Ballard, we are aware that our daughter is in the hands of Heavenly Father, and we're not asking you to do anything that would be contrary to His mind and will. We just want to feel that we've done everything we possibly can to appeal to Him for her life."<br><br>Of course I understood. Any parent would understand that feeling. We went into a private room where I was able to visit with this extraordinary young woman for a few minutes. I wish I could communicate to you the sweet and wonderful spirit that I felt from her. This beautiful young woman looked into my eyes and with powerful simplicity said, "Brother Ballard, I'm not afraid to die. I would like to live. There are things that I would still like to accomplish in this life. But I know that Jesus is my Savior and my Redeemer, and during these past few years He has become my best friend. I trust Him, and I trust you as His representative. Whatever He wants for me, I'm prepared."<br><br>We gave her a blessing, during which we pled with God for a miracle, but at her request left the matter with Heavenly Father. My wife Barbara was with me, and as we returned to our car we looked at each other with tears in our eyes as we said to one another, "Oh, thank heavens for the gospel. Thank heavens for a plan that makes it possible for an eighteen-year-old girl to know what it means to come unto Christ. What ever happens, she is going to be fine." She died on June 23, 1995, with the peace of the Lord accompanying her and her family.<br><br>That's the blessed assurance of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is His Church, the only true and living Church upon the face of the whole earth. You stay anchored to it. Don't you let any voice or any wind of doctrine or any secret, so-called revelation or any special information that "the Brethren don't understand" lead you away from what you know to be true. Our safety, brothers and sisters, our peace--our inner peace--the peace that we all seek, lies in striving to live as the Savior would want us to live and in knowing within our hearts and minds that we are doing the best we can to try to keep His commandments.<br><br>Of course, such discipleship comes at a price. It isn't always easy to come to Christ. There are sacrifices that need to be made by all who seek to follow the Savior, and sometimes those sacrifices are quite painful. To be called by God to serve Him in any capacity is the greatest honor a person can have, and we all do it willingly and with all our hearts because we love Him and we love His Son. Let us accept Their teachings, strive to understand Them, and strive to put sin out of our lives through repentance and to honor Them through our own righteous living. Let us always follow the inspired leadership of the Church, which includes the inspired leadership of this university.<br><br>I leave you my witness and my testimony, my beloved young people at this great university. Jesus Christ is the Son of God; He does live; this is His church. May our Heavenly Father bless each and every one of you, fortify your testimonies, and cradle you in the beauties of the gospel that nothing will come into your lives that will take you away from the marvelous truths that we have in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. May this be your blessing. Thank you for who you are, for all that you are doing and will yet do in the building of the kingdom of God. This is my humble prayer and testimony in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>e”—The Power of the One - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Provost Hafen's introduction was generous; however, what he did not tell about in his introduction was the way in which my call to the deanship at this university was announced some years ago. The actual caption for the pictures and the newspaper article was in the upper left-hand corner. But one of my clever friends cut out that corner and made sure the bottom lead line for another article was clearly displayed: "Utah Inmates Serving Shorter Terms Than They Were 10 to 25 Years Ago" (<i>Universe,</i>4 June 1985). That is the way I was called. Then there was the way the announcement was made of the change in my assignment. Next to my picture was the caption for an adjacent article: "Woman in Orbit for Five Months" (<i>Daily Universe,</i>29 March 1996).<br><br>As Provost Hafen has indicated, I once did a little stint for Walt Disney, and I collect cartoons. There is a cartoon on my office wall signed by one of our former<i>Universe</i>artists that says, "To laugh is to live." So we're going to have a little fun today, because this is not the talk that I originally prepared. With the announcement of my assignment change, I would like to say some very different things. My original talk was going to be on the desires of our heart. Those of you who know me or who have shared a Book of Mormon class with me know that is one of my favorite themes. Maybe I'll give that talk someday, but not today, because what I would like to talk about is the fact that I have never been in prison in this position and I have never felt in orbit. I am not stepping down, I am stepping up, because the only way to go in life is up. As my dad was fond of saying, "When you've got something happening in your life, put on your boots and move on." So I am putting on my boots today and moving on.<br><br>One of my favorite traditions here at BYU is sponsored by BYUSA and is called the Last Lecture Series. A professor, an important person, or a good person at the university is invited to address the student body on those remarks they would make if it were their last lecture. Although I don't anticipate that this is going to be my last lecture, it is going to be my last opportunity as the dean of students to speak with you as my friends and colleagues. I would, therefore, like to reflect on what you have meant in my life and on what you mean to this university and to this Church. You see, I get letters--lots of letters. Over the past few days since this announcement, I have been reading them and rereading them. I have selected a few that I would like to share with you today.<br><br>I will begin with an image that has haunted me for years. During my time as a graduate student at Columbia University, I served in the presidency of the New York Stake Young Women organization. One summer I was working on girls' camp. I had a funny little car, bought on a shoestring and dedicated to the Lord's service--it was called a Gremlin. Most of you are probably too young to even remember that model, but it did have four wheels and was put together with spit and glue. One of my assignments for camp was the apples, lots of apples. I headed out to Hunt's Point Market, which was quite a distance, to get the apples. Upon arriving, I simply opened the hatchback and said, "Fill 'er up."<br><br>Heading upstate, I had to travel a number of cloverleafs in order to make a switch in direction. On the side of the highway just to the right as I entered the interstate on-ramp, I caught a glimpse of a young woman hitchhiker standing with a sign. The sign said, "Anywhere." I quickly passed by. While my father was famous for picking up almost any stray and bringing it home, I had never stopped for a hitchhiker before in my life, especially not in New York. At that moment, however, something prompted me to reenter the cloverleaf and come back around. I thought to myself, "If she is still there, I will pick her up." Being honest, I was hoping that she would be gone, but she wasn't. So I stopped. She opened the car door and got in. She was unkempt, odoriferous, and very interesting. I was not sure how old she was. She was young, but clearly old beyond her years. Thinking to break the ensuing silence I said, "Are you hungry?"<br><br>"Yes," she responded.<br><br>I motioned, and reaching to the back of the car she grabbed an apple. It's all I had, a car full of apples. She ate quickly and put the core on the dashboard by wedging it tightly against the windshield. Usually I am pretty good at conversation, but not this time: "Yes," "No," or no answer at all.<br><br>I finally said, "Where are you going?"<br><br>"Anywhere," she said.<br><br>Somewhat stumped, even irritated, I said, "Are you still hungry?"<br><br>She reached for another apple until there were five apple cores lined up against my dashboard, pressed against the window.<br><br>"Two can play this game," I thought, so in silence I paid the tolls and we made our way upstate. As I was about to turn off the freeway onto a little road where our camp was located, I said, "I'm about to turn off the main freeway. Would you like to get out?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Well, I'm going to a camp with some young women, and I'll just have to drop you off there."<br><br>Looking straight ahead, she responded without feeling, "Fine."<br><br>I turned off, and we traveled on. As my car pulled into camp, those young women surrounded us. They were so happy to see us, and I, needless to say, was happy to see them. As my passenger got out, there were some surprised young women. "Who is she?" "Where did she come from?" "What is she doing here?" Talking for a moment, I suggested that she may want to go out to the mailbox by the road. Perhaps somebody would pick her up there and she could be on her way to<i>anywhere.</i>The day passed. We had lunch and went about all the things you do at girls' camp. Just before dinner, one of our young women came to me and said, "Sister Mouritsen, what are we going do with . . . with . . . it?"<br><br>"What do you mean,<i>it?"</i><br><br>Pointing, she said, "What are we going to do with her?"<br><br>"I don't know," I said. "What do you think we should do with her?"<br><br>"I think we should invite her to dinner."<br><br>Wow, I wish I'd thought of that, but I didn't. It took a little Mia Maid to do that.<br><br>"Let's go out together," I said, "and we'll invite her in."<br><br>Hand in hand, we walked to the mailbox by the roadside. She came in and had dinner with us and stayed the entire week. I must admit that I was somewhat anxious, thinking it was a bit of a risk. I didn't know who she was or where she'd come from or what she might have. But those young women embraced her in a most marvelous way. I saw her at the waterfront; I saw her in the craft tent; I saw her around the fireside. I watched her all week long. When camp was over, I said to her, "Can I take you some where?"<br><br>And she said, "Anywhere."<br><br>"Well, I'm headed back to New York City."<br><br>"I don't want to go there," she snapped. "Just let me off on the freeway."<br><br>We got in my car--minus the apples--made our way to the freeway, and I let her off.<br><br>This is the image that haunts me. I watched her disappear in my rearview mirror as she stood on the roadside posting her clumsily written sign, "Anywhere." Over the years, that image has come to mind many, many times.<br><br>Over the years I have also come to understand what a challenging life you live and what a challenging world you live in. I don't need to tell you that--you already know it. Recently I was reading through the American freshman study conducted by Alexander Astin and his colleagues. This is a thirty-year, longitudinal study on the American freshman. BYU has, from time to time, participated in this study. The 1995 data isn't too promising. On almost all of the indexes that have to do with social and political issues, students' attitudes are down. Students are less interested in political affairs and less interested in influencing social values. Students are not only less interested in participating in community action groups but are much more academically disengaged. You study less, visit with teachers less, join fewer clubs, and are generally more bored than you were a few years ago. More important, more and more freshmen students indicate that they have no religious preference and have not attended any kind of a religious meeting or experience during the past year. There are, however, a few things that are up. Support for legalization of marijuana is up. Cheating is up. And illegitimate birthrates are up. It is, indeed, a challenging world.<br><br>Recently I was reflecting on Mormon and Moroni's world, which was really quite similar to ours. As Moroni comes to the end of his life, he talks about what has happened for him. With his very soul on the precipice of eternity, he looks down from his mountain and in the end declares his final testimony. It is a dark and desperate world. Moroni shares his father's words with us, and this is the kind of language Mormon used: "horrible scene" (Moroni 9:20); "without civilization" (Moroni 9:11); "without principle, and past feeling" (Moroni 9:20); "without faith" (Mormon 3:12); "the day of grace was passed with them, both temporally and spiritually" (Mormon 2:15). The book of Moroni is very different from any other in the Book of Mormon. It is but a series of short, choppy chapters. It took me a while to understand why that was so. Moroni and Mormon talk about doctrine, the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, priesthood ordinances, the sacrament, baptism, faith, hope, charity, and the gifts of God. In the end, Moroni bears his testimony. Reflecting, I would like to draw a metaphoric comparison. Please do not take me wrong in thinking that I'm indicating or even implying anything prophetic about my role when it's matched off against Moroni. But I thought about my mountain and your mountain. From my mountain, on the third floor of the Kimball Tower, I have rejoiced as I have watched your lives moving in, out, about, and around this campus. It has been a celebration. Since I do not have children of my own, in some ways you have become my surrogate family. Like any parent, it hasn't all been good. There are the high times and there are the low times. In the end, this is the testimony that Moroni bore, and it's the one I'd like to bear to you today. He talks of four things.<br><br>First, there is the power of the "one." "For there shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God" (Moroni 10:25). This is a hopeful description of not only his world but of our world. In a sense, it is as though our lives have been cast into a giant centrifuge. We are spun to the outside, separated, compartmentalized, and fragmented. Information is abundant yet seldom connected. But in the end, the power of the "one" becomes important in Moroni's testimony.<br><br>Second, Moroni indicates that he will declare the word unto the fulfilling of prophecy (see Moroni 10:28). Specifically, he refers to your role in these latter days. As he looks down from his mountain, he talks about the importance of preparation and of being a witness.<br><br>Next he speaks of coming to Christ and of gifts: "And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift" (Moroni 10:30).<br><br>And, finally, he addresses the importance of cleansing yourself. He says, "Deny yourselves of all ungodliness" (Moroni 10:32) so that, in the end, he might "meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge" (Moroni 10:34). I would like to share with you some thoughts about these four declarations using the language of your letters and lives.<br><h2><b>The Power of the One</b></h2><br>While at the Art Institute of Chicago, I worked as a stock clerk before going to class. Newly appointed to this task, I had to go upstairs to make sure that the rooms were ready where the artists would be working the next day. It is a magnificent building, the Art Institute. Maybe you have seen pictures. It has two gigantic, life-size lions standing guard outside. Immediately upon entering, a magnificent staircase looms, working its way upward to the second floor. I made my way from the basement with one of the guards at my side; there were just the two of us. It was quiet. It was still. Moving upward, our footsteps brought hollow resolution against the marble stairway. Suddenly I looked up. At the top of the stairway landing hung a painting by Georges Seurat,<i>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.</i>Although not my most favorite work, seeing it for the first time was like being struck by lightning. Seurat spent more than two years on this painting that measures some eight by ten feet. A pointillist, he meticulously placed every dot of color on the surface so, when seen from a distance, the entire canvas blended into a singular, luminous presentation. To misplace one color, one direction, one iota, was to change the entire complexion of the masterpiece. Each stroke of light mattered. Where once the artist had stood, there I stood--a little kid from the flats of Arizona. I was stunned. For me, this painting is so much like BYU.<br><br>Let me tell you about "balloon boy." To this day that is what I affectionately call him when we meet. He came rushing into my office one day just after having found a balloon on campus. Attached to the balloon was a sad note from somebody who was terribly, terribly lonely. In a kind of desperation, this young man, a student, was hoping to discover the identity of this person. Together we thought, let's check the floral shops. We did. But no one could recall anybody having bought a helium balloon in the last day or so. What about Campus Craft and Floral in the Wilkinson Center? And sure enough, one of the clerks remembered a young woman having purchased a balloon that was like the one we described. Ironically, it had been paid for with a check. On the check was a name and an address. This young man, in his goodness, took on the challenge of befriending this young woman. I don't know that she ever knew he had found her balloon. But did he make a difference in her life? He certainly did. One stroke of light.<br><br>I'm almost always in my office on Tuesday and Thursday mornings by 6:00 a.m. Those are my Book of Mormon days. I came in, however, a little later on this particular Thursday because it was an exam day. I stopped by Winchell's to get some doughnuts in hopes of sweetening the experience just a little. It was kind of a gray day. As I went into the doughnut shop, there were two lines. In the line to my right was a young man whom I recognized as a participant in our Wright Leadership Seminar program. We chatted: "How are you? How is school going?" You know, the usual conversation. There was an older man standing just in front of this student. I had not paid much attention but did notice the man fumbling through his pocket and counting his change. Looking up at the order board, he changed his order from a drink and a doughnut to a hot drink. I went about my business, ordered my doughnuts, and said goodbye to this young man as he went on his way. Shortly, I saw the clerk come from behind the counter and walk over to the man with his drink. She laid a doughnut on the table and said, "That young man has bought you a doughnut."<br><br>I wish I'd thought of that. But I didn't. It took a BYU student to think of that. I watched the student as he walked down the street toward school, and he never looked back. Not for credit. Not for admiration. He simply walked on, his BYU backpack flung across his shoulder and his physics book under his arm.<br><br>There are so many of you who are part of our BYU masterpiece. I think about Y Group leaders. I think about the Student Alumni Association and the Residence Halls Association and BYUSA. I think about the members of the chorale, who have just sung so beautifully. I think about all the things that are done so willingly and so lovingly on this campus by so many. I could go on. The power of the "one" is real.<br><h2><b>Declaring the Word unto the Fulfilling of Prophecy</b></h2><br>Section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants speaks eloquently of what it is we should be about at a university in Zion. Verse 78 tells us how we should instruct and why:<br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand.</i><br><br>The next verse, verse 79, specifies the length and breadth of the curriculum:<br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth</i>[I wonder if by this instruction God may be referring to subjects like geology, astronomy, and the earth sciences.];<i>things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass</i>[This might reference history, the social sciences, and current events.];<i>things which are at home, things which are abroad</i>[How about civics, politics, family sciences, even health sciences?];<i>the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land</i>[In this context, it seems to me that politics, international affairs, sociology, and even military tactics are not to be ignored.];<i>and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i>[This might suggest the study of geography, diplomacy, and certainly languages.]<br><br>Though a tall order, this is what a university in Zion ought to be about. Why? The why comes in verse 80:<br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i><br><br>We do a lot of things and learn a lot of things on this campus. Let me read from a letter written by a young woman who worked in our area.<br><br><i>I knew from the beginning that I was the best person for the job. . . . I knew that there was no one else at BYU or in the entire world, for that matter, who would be a better person than me for this job. Would you say I lacked a little humility? And, I learned how much humility I lacked once I began my employment. I learned that I didn't know anything. I learned that it takes hard work and determination to work with various types of personalities and to understand them. I learned that I had to juggle priorities--school, family responsibilities, work, personal commitments. I learned a lot. Don't let anyone ever tell you that you are perfect for a job. No one is perfect. No one knows everything at first about a position one acquires. If someone thinks so, that person has been shortchanged.</i><br><br><i>Maybe I wasn't the best person for the job necessarily, but the job was the best one for me. I wouldn't trade my experience of working on this campus for anything. I just hope that others in the future will be able to learn what I learned as quickly as I had to. No sense in delaying knowledge.</i><br><br>A while back, a letter was sent over from the president's office. In part, it read:<br><br><i>President, I don't know who to write to. I don't know who to thank. But, I want to thank somebody, so I'm thanking you.</i><br><br><i>I want to tell you that I got a splendid education at BYU. I've gone on and I'm now gainfully employed, but what I want to tell you is that the finest lessons I learned on this university campus came at the end of a broom from a custodian in the Wilkinson Center who taught me what it was to be honorable at three o'clock in the morning, who taught me what it was to clean the corners and what it meant to care for the university.</i><br><br>This is your time of preparation, my young friends. And section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants will help you understand the "mission" for which you are to be prepared. You will have ample opportunity on this campus to do just that, if you so choose.<br><h2><b>Coming unto Christ</b></h2><br>My files are replete with wonderful letters from Book of Mormon students. One sister missionary writes:<br><br><i>I'm alive and well, learning lots each day and loving the work. It's the work of our Father in Heaven, and he has a greater role in it than I ever thought possible. When I am completely obedient and diligent and working, I am led to the pure in heart--those waiting for the message. I love the Book of Mormon. It's true, and the testimonies of the Atonement of the Lord and my Savior Jesus Christ are undeniable.</i>[The Book of Mormon]<i>is a tool that must be used if we are to have success in our missionary endeavors, and we will have success. There is no way we can have the help of our Lord if we are not willing to sacrifice ourselves, to go "beyond the mark" (Jacob 4:14), to work totally. We must offer a broken heart and a contrite spirit.</i><br><br><i>The secret of missionary work is to work hard, to work hard, and to work hard. If we lack the faith to ask for help, we'll never receive the miracle in our lives. Obedience, work, or faithful prayer alone won't produce the miracle. But all of those together--with me in the middle--make it possible. I love Jesus Christ.</i><br><br>I can't think of a better Easter message. And then there is this from an elder serving in a distant land:<br><br><i>Friday afternoon we visited a family. We had been working with them for some time, but they are not willing to attend church. I was disappointed because I knew that we'd have to move on. I felt great heaviness of heart and internal sorrow. I had come to love them. I cried all the way to our next appointment. I started thinking to myself, "This must be how Christ feels. His sorrow must be a trillion, billion times greater than mine. I've given my time and prayers to help this family, but Christ gave his life." I've been thinking lately about how I can get to know Christ better. It helps to read about his life and the doctrine in the scriptures. But, what is helping even more is the experience of walking the streets.</i><br><br><i>As a representative of Jesus Christ, I have had the opportunity to teach people about God and the plan of salvation just like he did. I see people reject the gospel and accept it. Christ lets us share his work and his glory, and by actively taking part we can come to a greater understanding of our elder brother, Jesus Christ. What will help me be a better missionary is constantly striving to teach and to love and to be like him. I know I'll never be the teacher he was, but I have faith, and in making an honest effort I'll touch somebody's life and grow in the process.</i><br><br>Somehow, someway, it is significant and important that we get outside of ourselves; that we not be so overwhelmingly consumed by our own self-interests. When that happens, you will be willing to deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind, and strength.<br><h2><b>Cleanse Yourself</b></h2><br>I sat one day in my office with a large athlete. Robust and well exercised, he had to turn sideways to get through my door. He was not a member of this Church. Things had gone haywire in his life while at BYU, and he knew it. With his head in his hands and tears streaming down his face, he said to me, "My father's going to kill me. I wasn't raised this way. I've got a lot of work to do." So we rolled up our sleeves and, in the next couple of months and even years, we worked. Now a member of the Church, this young man has served in a bishopric, has married in the temple, and has a precious young family.<br><br>This is a letter from a student who wants to return to BYU after having stubbed a toe:<br><br><i>Last Sunday I was reading my patriarchal blessing. Then that night, when I was saying my prayers, I was thinking that if all these blessings come true then there certainly could be no question that I really am a good person. I know everyone always tried to tell me that, but I had a hard time believing it. Anyway, after my prayers that night, I just seemed to have a whole different outlook on life. I didn't really understand it until the next day when I was writing in my journal about that "good feeling." And all of a sudden, I realized that I'd finally gotten the answer to my prayers. It took a lot of work, but I know it was worth it because I will never forget this time in my life. I was so angry with you when you asked me to leave the university. I now would like to kiss your feet.</i><br><br><i>I still didn't quite understand the importance of this feeling I'd had until late Tuesday night. Then I understood that the new outlook I had on life was . . . I no longer had any desire to be bad. I hope that doesn't sound dumb because that is as clear as I can explain it. I decided--that is, I realized--that . . . I wanted to be different. This might sound kind of confusing, but it's hard for me to say these things because I'm not sure how my life's going to turn out. . . . I know it isn't going to be all roses and wonderful times, but the point is, I'm ready to do whatever it takes. . . . We can give up our cars and pay our tithing, but the hardest thing in the world is to give up our sins. I'm willing to give up my sins to get my life together and find the greatest joys.</i><br><br><i>I wish I could tell you some of my goals, but I don't have a plan right now. But I can tell you some of my hopes. I want to marry in the temple. I want to honor the priesthood. . . . I want to go on a mission. But right now I just want to return to BYU. . . . I also want to be sure and say, if I hadn't already said it, how much I love everyone and appreciate your kindness. . . . I truly regret I didn't recognize how much everyone cared for me until it was nearly too late. I say nearly because fortunately I was given a second chance, so thanks everybody for putting up with me during these hard times. I want to promise you that you haven't wasted your time.</i><br><h2><b>To Meet You Before the Pleasing Bar</b></h2><br>Finally, Moroni talks about us all being in this life together and ultimately facing judgment together as witnesses one for another. He says it in this way:<br><br><i>And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you</i>[Literally, I believe he means you and me!]<i>before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.</i>[Moroni 10:34]<br><br>Over the years I have come to realize that although we owe God everything, he can't do this work without us. In 3 Nephi 27:27, the Savior inquires, "What manner of men ought ye to be?" The resounding response is, "Even as I am." Then come the marvelous verses with which we are all so familiar:<br><br><i>Therefore, ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; for he that asketh, receiveth; and unto him that knocketh it shall be opened.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, my joy is great</i>[remember this is the Savior talking],<i>even unto fulness because of</i>you,<i>and also this generation.</i>[3 Nephi 27:29–30; emphasis added]<br><br>By adding that last phrase, "this generation," it seems clear to me that the Savior is reaching to a distant time, a future generation. He is, I believe, talking to you and to me. The verse continues:<br><br><i>Because of you, and also this generation; yea, and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the holy angels, because of you and this generation; for none of them are lost.</i><br><br>What a promise. Do we have a role? You bet we do. And if you're interested in nobody being lost, then roll up your sleeves and look to your left and look to your right. And you know when we can start? We can start this weekend with Y Days. If every single one of you showed up on Saturday for a service project, we could blow the lid off this city. Just think of it, 27,000 plus of us all serving the community we love. Could we do it? I've already talked to Wesley McDougal, the BYUSA president, and he says he's ready for you. My question is, are you ready for him?<br><br>Returning to my earlier story, one day my secretary rang in and said, "There's a young woman with a baby here to see you. She said it won't do any good to give you her name. You won't know her by name."<br><br>I welcomed her in, and she sat at my table holding a beautiful baby girl.<br><br>"Do you recognize me?" she said.<br><br>"No, I'm sorry, but I don't."<br><br>"I have known you were here, but I haven't quite known what to say. I'm the young woman you picked up on the highway in New York City some years ago. Although angry and hardened, I was touched by what I heard and saw and felt at girls' camp."<br><br>She continued to explain that it had been a horrible life for her, including a long history of abuse at a very young age. Finally, she thought, "There's got to be something better than this out there."<br><br>So she ran. As you might expect, a young woman of her age with no resources ended up in desperate places. That is when I found her and she found me on the New York freeway.<br><br>"When I left girls' camp, I stole a dollar. Now I know that all I had to do was ask and you would have given money to me, or anyone would have given it to me. But I stole a dollar. (By this time we were both in tears.) When you drove off and left me on the freeway, I had time to think, as it was several hours before somebody picked me up. I went to the very next city and found a telephone book. I thumbed through the Yellow Pages until I found The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I rang up the number. I wanted to see if what you folks said was really true. A pleasant woman answered the phone, and I asked for the bishop. I'd heard you use that term,<i>bishop,</i>at camp," she said.<br><br>"He isn't home right now," was the response, "but I'd be happy to have him call you back."<br><br>"I don't have a telephone number. I'll call him back."<br><br>And she did.<br><br>What happened next is a true miracle. This good family took in this waif and made her a member of their family. They cared for her and taught her and loved her. Eventually she joined the Church, she met a returned missionary, and they married. He was now a student at BYU. She came that day with baby in hand, a newly adopted baby, to extend an invitation.<br><br>"I would like to invite you to the blessing of our baby. Can you come?"<br><br>And I said, "Anytime."<br><br>There is much more to this story, but these are my last words for you this day. First, never underestimate the power of the one. Never, please never, take for granted your individual influence in the lives of others. Second, prepare yourself to become a witness as Moroni has admonished. Third, now is the time to come unto Christ, for his grace is sufficient for all of us. And finally, cleanse yourself and just plain be good.<br><br>I ran into a young woman in the elevator the other day, and she said, "What can I do for you as you leave the deanship?"<br><br>"You can do one thing for me, you can live a good life."<br><br>This brings us full cycle to our opening hymn: Shall the youth of Zion falter in defending truth and right? While the enemy assaileth, shall we shrink or shun the fight? While we know the powers of darkness seek to thwart the work of God, shall the children of the promise cease to grasp the iron rod? Will we work out our salvation? Will we cleave unto the truth? Will we watch and pray and labor with a fervent zeal of youth? Will we strive to be found worthy of the kingdom of the Lord, with the faithful ones redeemed who have loved and kept his word? (See "True to the Faith,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 254.)<br><br>It is my conviction, because I know your lives and I have your letters, that we can respond, you and I, to the questions of this hymn in a resounding, affirmative way that will split the heavens and shatter the foundations of hell, and it can start at Y Days. This next week, Y Week, as you think about your lives, I would like for one final time as the dean of students to light the Y for you. I have said that to students as they have come under my stewardship for the past ten years in the opening assembly to new students. But this time, I say it to all of you. Tonight, we will light the Y for you because<i>you</i>light the Y.<br><br>Let me add this from a little boy:<br><br><i>Dear BYU:</i><br><br><i>My name is Matthew. I am four years old, and my mom is writing what I am saying. We came to BYU on Friday and played games in the Game Center. I made me a smashed penny that said "BYU" on it from a machine by the games. I carried it around all day and put it in my pocket. When we got home to Salt Lake, I couldn't find my penny anywhere. I was so sad. Here is a penny and a quarter. Could someone at BYU make me a new penny and send it back to me here at my house? My Mom is putting in a special envelope to send it back. Thank you so much. I love BYU.</i><br><br>Our response:<br><br><i>Matt:</i><br><br><i>We're sending you two pennies. One for you and one for your Mom. Thanks for writing. Your letter was special to us. We love you. We love BYU, too.</i><br><br>So at this moment, I, like Moroni, bid you farewell and remind you that these questions are your questions. Will you falter? Will you be assailed by darkness? Will you work out your salvation and will you strive to be found worthy? I am convinced with every fiber of my being that you will because I have sat with you in happy times as well as in sad times, but never, ever has there been any doubt in my mind that you are the hope of Zion, that in you rest the seeds of the Savior. And without you we cannot--indeed,<i>he</i>cannot--do his work.<br><br>Thank you for these years. They have been renaissance years for me. Through it all I have taken nothing but joy and happiness and good memories. Thank you for being you. I love you. I love BYU. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Maren M. Mouritsen was assistant vice president and dean of students at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 2 April 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e A’s: Atonement, Agency, and Accountability - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This pleasant introduction reminds me of some of the things I've been up to over the vanished years. I heard recently someone say that nostalgia is a wonderful thing, but what good is it if you can't remember anything? We have very happy memories, and some of them relate to these folks sitting behind me for whom I have the highest and most sincere regard. These kind words also reaffirm the feeling that I had when I gave an answer to a bubbly young woman who detached herself from a handsome boyfriend at the entrance of the Salt Lake Temple and walked over to shake my hand.<br><br>"Didn't you used to be Elder Hanks?" she asked.<br><br>I said, "Yes, I used to be, still am, and hope to be in the future Elder Hanks."<br><br>I remember when I came here as a substitute for a General Authority who fell ill at the last moment, and I stood in his place. I recalled an experience of Dr. Hashimoto, a revered and respected professor at the University of Utah, when he faced his class the day after Pearl Harbor. (He was an authentic American with ethnic roots.) He stood before his class that morning and quietly said, "Don't blame me, I'm Irish."<br><br>Well, this young lady's question--though it did in fact amuse me--indicated that, like many others, she probably doesn't really understand what a General Authority emeritus is. She, however, is a step ahead of another bright young person who confronted me after a wedding I had performed, looked up into my face intently, and said, "Who are you?" As to what an emeritus is, I don't really know either, but as one who started obviously very young, some things have happened in this change of status. It has not yet meant quick eradication or annihilation, but it has offered some relief from basketsful of meetings and travel so consistent and relentless that it became less than looked forward to: so many postponed dreams of family associations and participation on occasions like Mother's Day, which I missed consistently through my years of service. These postponed dreams have been revivified and realized. We do still travel together occasionally to various parts of the world on humanitarian projects that have brought us great joy and satisfaction. We are deeply grateful for that.<br><br>In the Pacific Islands just a few weeks ago, Maxine and I listened to the chatter of myna birds in their incessant, four-syllable, two-word message. They speak it constantly, with no variation in melody. At first when I heard them, "Beep-beep, beep-beep ," I said to my wife that America's enterprising commercial entity has reached clear across the world and what they're saying is, "Pizza-pizza, pizza-pizza."<br><br>She said, "No, no. They're further ahead than that. They have the political message of the current time: they're saying, 'Veto-veto, veto-veto.'"<br><br>Well, I'm very grateful for this visit with this student body. A lot of our happiest memories occurred in relationship to this institution, which neither of us was privileged to attend in World War II times. But all of our five children have attended this great school, and all but one of the choice people they're married to--well, nobody's perfect! We did serve on the governing board of BYU for years and had committee assignments that permitted us close association regularly in that time. Our grandchildren will likely have a little different diversity being from other places and parts, but I'm sure most or all would like to be here. Peter, who offered the invocation today, has a sister Kristy who just departed from BYU for a mission in Barcelona, and their cousin Kara--also a student here--is now in the Missionary Training Center preparing to go to the Philippines. Peter and Kristy have a younger brother who left for South America just a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>I want to mention the 50,000 missionaries and the students here and many others elsewhere who have the capacity and, I pray, who will have the wisdom and the will and the courage and the faith and the intelligence to change the course of this country and the societies in which they live across the earth. Things are happening of great promise and encouragement, along with much that is distressing. I never could personally imagine living long enough to see, for instance, the breakdown of the Berlin Wall and the communist monolith behind it. We traveled through checkpoints along that wall many times, and were there as it was being dismantled. I would not have hoped realistically to see an alliance for peace between the United States and Russia or the unification of West and East Germany. We had adventures there that were amazing. But, it has all happened. Maybe even more incredible, in a sense, are the developments in South Africa, which did not seem likely in our time. And you, I hope, bright as you are, will be constant in your attention to current affairs--will be thinking and praying and learning about major developments in the Middle East and the fragile balance there that hour by hour seems in jeopardy. We pray that that will be resolved the way God wants it resolved.<br><br>There have been major developments in the Church also. I will mention one or two of them. In 1976, twenty years ago--and I'll confine these developments to that brief period--the First Quorum of the Seventy was organized, having not been in existence in any effective way since the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph. Now there are no more seventies in wards or stakes, but there are two strong Quorums of the Seventy at Church headquarters that supply major support across the earth. The building of temples worldwide had significant impetus in the same period, and so did the expansion of Church education in the colleges and the seminaries and institutes.<br><br>A new view of financing has been adopted that most of you would not recognize as a major change, but we do who were privileged to build buildings by contribution. Now a different approach is taken. Very important efforts in Christian service have been induced. One day, if God wills it and we are willing, there may in fact be a reunion of the Savior with those who follow him and are able to hear him say, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren [and my sisters], ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). We say that periodically and we love it at Christmas--but we ought to believe it every day. We ought to understand the significance of that special time when the Lord--concluding a magnificent ministry--gave the three parables that ended with the one where the goats were on the left hand and the sheep were on the other. Those represented by the sheep on his right hand were invited to be with him in "eternal life"; those on the left were assigned "eternal damnation."<i>The distinction had to do with the way they had behaved toward their fellowmen.</i><br><br>I'm deeply impressed with this particular parable and offer to you as a testimony and witness that though there are no mentions in that beautiful parable in Matthew 25 of sinfulness of the kind all of us are acquainted with, every sin noted is a sin of omission. So in fact does a major part of the scripture have to do with sins of omission. Please be aware of this and do not resist directions for changes that come from the president of the Church. Change goes on regularly as the inspiration and revelation of the Almighty directs it, so you need not worry about that. You may not understand it all or have the roots to know out of what it came, but it happens. I have watched it long enough to have great confidence in the process and the product of the revelation and inspiration available to those who preside in the Church.<br><br>I want to mention my appreciation for this school, which I think will produce, as it has in the past, people of such quality that, were we not confident in your generation, would make us nervous indeed. Speaking of nervousness, I was thinking as I put these notes together of our only son, who, when he was being ordained a deacon, stood up with the bishop by invitation. By special arrangement I, too, was able to be there--rarely was I able to be with him or with his sisters at good moments during their lives. Our son stood up there and was authorized by the vote of the congregation to become a deacon. His sisters asked him afterward at home during lunch if he was nervous standing up there. He answered that he was nervous standing alone by the bishop until he looked down, saw the voters, and noticed that Dad's hand was higher than all the rest. That, in fact, is true. I held it as high as I could hoist it because that's how I felt--about him and his sisters and their generation and now about another generation.<br><br>It is important that you have some sense of how high the hands are raised in your behalf. Some of you may be disquieted by this regulation or that, but you should be reassured by--if you could hear it--the consistent support given you and your leaders and your staff and faculty by those who provide the authenticity and support of this institution. So I thank you for what you are and for what I hope and pray and believe will be.<br><br>I need to thank you for something else in which you had no part and for which you really aren't responsible. The invitation to spend these few minutes here set me off a few weeks ago in a program of search and ponder. I've been searching and pondering the scriptures, and it's been a blessing and a delight. I've spent concentrated hours, which are not really typical of the schedule we've been trying to keep, that have brought wonderful and sweet feelings--no new or different or theologically innovative things, just the warmth and the spirit that come from searching the scriptures.<br><br>Do you remember in the very first chapter of the Book of Mormon (after the words everybody can cite about Nephi's parentage) that there was a vision reported? One descended "out of the midst of heaven" followed by twelve others, and the first paused before Father Lehi and gave him a book and bade him read. The record says that as he read he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord (see 1 Nephi 1:8–12). I think that's the best way yet--that and on your knees and in the bosom of the family whom you love and whose lives are all tied up with your own.<br><br>So I've surveyed some larger fields, and I could begin to cultivate here, if there were time available, intuitions and inspirations that have been revisited from memory. I've enjoyed enough exaltation of spirit to proclaim as did little Dennis the Menace to his mother something in a cartoon we read in Hawaii recently. Dennis looks up into her face and says, "I've never had so much fun as I'm going to have tomorrow." Think on that--that's how I think.<br><br>Well, the scriptures have provided inspiration again this last little while. A couple of weekends ago, we had a conference where a propitious culmination to my study season was enjoyed. I sat in conference listening and approving and nodding my head and ready to raise my hand as high as I could get it if I had a chance, because I know the men who were on the stand. I know them as well as I know now two of the men who sit on this stand in that circumstance and would raise my hand as high as I could get it for them.<br><br>Each worshipper at the conference could extract their own personally satisfying and needed messages from the talks, but I got mine in three words that took me back to a previous time. A young man whose beginnings in the Church had not been auspicious or helpful and who said he knew nothing about the gospel had been sent to me for help in learning about it. I asked him how he would like to go about learning or where he would like to start. He said that he didn't know enough to know, so how about starting with the alphabet. I said, "Okay, we'll start with the<i>A's."</i>And in the conference this time, those three<i>A's</i>that I talked to him about came immediately to the fore:<i>atonement, agency,</i>and<i>accountability.</i><br><br>Without the Atonement we could not have what we have of assurance, and we could not have the wonderful privilege of responding through our<i>agency,</i>moral agency, which is not only our privilege but our inescapable responsibility to carry and respond to.<br><br>God said he gave agency to his children in the Garden of Eden. And in two magnificent places in the scriptures (in 2 Nephi 2 and Deuteronomy 30), it is written that this agency and our use of it is of such immense consequence that we cannot imagine. It means either life or death, exaltation or damnation. So with that atoning blessing there comes the responsibility that is sacred and serious and inescapable. We may talk about it in academic circles and defend positions vigorously--whether or not it actually exists and how much of it is there when we live in a society of agents--and afterward everybody will leave the meeting and just go on out and continue to make choices. And so we will and so we must.<br><br>I'd like to talk for just a few minutes about what President Hinckley said in a compelling, tender way when he bore powerful testimony of our commitment as a Church and as people to the Savior and his atoning love. He noted the sorrow that comes with every death and the mitigation of the abject sorrow that comes with every death by the certainty of the resurrection of the Son of God that first Easter morning. The pain of death, he said, is swallowed up in the peace of eternal life. Of all the events of human history, none is of such consequence as this. We know that is true individually and personally, and we thank God for the comfort and assurance that all the standard works give us about these sacred subjects.<br><br>Along with the Atonement, which in effect lays out the path and the prescriptions and the safeguards and provides the guides, is the<i>agency</i>that we often exercise by ourselves in the light or in the dark, in a classroom or in a corporation boardroom. And attached to that is<i>accountability.</i>We will not escape the relevancy between these three words no matter what we protest or how loudly we may squeal. We are the subjects and blessed participants, if we choose, in the privileges and promises of the holy Atonement of Jesus Christ and his resurrection and all that implies. We will go on making choices, and we will regret some of them and repent of them and turn around knowing that only he among all who ever lived in this earth was sinless. We all have the need to know the processes by which we recoup what we could be and could have, had we chosen more wisely. So these are the three basics: Atonement, Agency, and Accountability--the three<i>A's,</i>as my young friend said.<br><br>We have quoted over the years a statement that says, "He who picks up one end of the stick, picks up the other. He who chooses the beginning of a road, chooses the place it leads to." That is frightening and sobering, yet there is the magnificent assurance that "the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; ... [and] he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name" (2 Nephi 9:41). Oh, what comfort that brings me personally. Peter at Pentecost bore his testimony in these words:<br><br><i>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man</i>[the man whom they had raised at the gate beautiful]<i>stand here before you whole.</i><br><br><i>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</i><br><br><i>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</i>[Acts 4:10–12]<br><br>Lehi taught his children the marvelous few verses recorded in 2 Nephi 2:6–9 concerning the Savior:<br><br><i>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Behold he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</i><br><br>[And then this great missionary invitation:]<i>Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, he is the first fruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men.</i><br><br>I need to conclude in deference to your classes by sharing a couple of things that have happened recently. Last Friday night a dear, longtime friend toppled over at a dinner we were attending. He was unconscious and dying--it was obvious. There were some physicians in the group, one of whom reached him immediately and quickly did what had to be done to save him from choking to death on regurgitation.<br><br>Before the 911 folks arrived with their professional skills, our friend was regaining consciousness. His first words were to ask for a blessing, and some there who loved him and were qualified knelt around and petitioned the Lord to bless him.<br><br>This sobering incident seemed to me a choice example of the blending of spiritual and temporal help in reaching to supply the needs of those in trouble. It seemed also a clear example of diversity among us in responding to our observation of a need and in our helpfulness in quickly moving to offer assistance. Many present were capable of offering the help urgently needed, but many stood or sat in apparent shock or indecisiveness while a handful moved into action. A life was saved that it seemed certain would be lost.<br><br>The other recent thing was a telephone call from a wonderful man I met years ago. Some of the scriptures I've mentioned today had been used in answer to some questions in a priesthood leadership meeting about the Savior, the keeper of the gate, and the record of his mercy and his love--mercy "which overpowereth justice" for the truly penitent (see Alma 34:15, 42:22–24). There is such rhythm and majestic blessing in the fundamental principles of confidence in God and Christ in the plan of repentance when we have used our agency unwisely, of commitment to ordinances and principles and laws, and of the interest in keeping ourselves fit to walk by the direction of the Spirit. The man who called me said something that I would like to finish with.<br><br>He had been through family tragedies, and he had apparently taken great comfort from the scriptures quoted above and others that were that night pointed out as being helpful.<br><br>He spoke not of the anguish suffered through the problems but of the love that had been showered upon his family by thoughtful people who acted to bring comfort. Difficult as their challenges had been, the caller said, it was one of the sweetest periods of their lives. He spoke of "amazing grace" and said, "There is more<i>grace</i>than<i>works</i>in the Atonement. And that is the most sacred and serious thing that we know."<br><br>I pray that you will think about the vital importance of using agency wisely and the inevitable experience we have ahead of answering, of standing in judgment to respond to our choices. Thank God for the great promise of mercy that "overcometh justice" if we are truly repentant. We love you, pray for you, thank God for you, and hope we are around long enough to see some other changes in this world and in the Church that are brought about because of needs you discover and which you'll help meet. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marion D.

<h1> Technology: A Not-So-Distant View - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Kimball in an address delivered at a Regional Representatives Seminar on April 3, 1975, said:<br><br><i>I believe that the telephone and telegraph and other such conveniences were permitted by the Lord to be developed for the express purpose of building the kingdom. Others may use them for business, professional or other purposes, but basically they are to build the kingdom.</i>[Typescript Copy, BYU Archives, p. 20]<br><br>The explosion of communications technology since 1975 has far exceeded President Kimball's reference to telephones and telegraphs. We now have computers, laser discs, CD-ROMs, and, most recently, the Internet. If we are to "build the kingdom" into a Zion society, surely these and "other such conveniences" will be an integral part of that effort. The dual thrust of President Bateman's inaugural speech--(1) to build a Zion university and (2) to make fuller use of technology to fulfill our mission--has persuaded me to "liken it unto myself" and to share my personal views of the promise of this strange marriage as it bears on my own experiences in the classroom and in the computer lab, my two favorite places to be outside home and temple.<br><h2><b>Zion Among Us</b></h2><br>The scriptures consistently define Zion in terms of three conditions:<i>unity</i>("they were of one heart and one mind," Moses 7:18);<i>equality</i>("they had all things common," 4 Nephi 1:3); and<i>prosperity</i>("there were no poor among them," JST Genesis 7:23; see also Moses 7:18). While no large entity, either in or out of the Church, yet qualifies completely in all three areas, Zion does already exist in miniature in many places: in individual families where righteous parents draw their children to them in love and trust and joy; and in smaller enclaves throughout our society where employees or friends or relatives share common goals in good faith. I feel a distinctly "Zion spirit" when I am among my dear colleagues of the humanities faculty, some of whom I have taught next to for more than twenty years. We are "family" in the truest sense of the word.<br><br>But how might we apply these three conditions to the university community as a whole? How can we be "of one heart and one mind" when universities were originally designed to celebrate intellectual diversity and to pursue new knowledge by means of disputations? We've had some tough times together the past couple of years. There are dissident forces pushing against administrative decisions that divide us and weaken the fabric of our common faith. This wouldn't happen if we could catch the vision of Zion the Lord has offered us in the scriptures. The main reason these earlier Zions were "of one heart and one mind" was because they all chose God first, before selves or society. I firmly believe that nothing should take precedence over our faithfully following the counsel of the Lord's anointed. I know it's difficult to obey in matters where we may feel we have the authority of our disciplines behind us, but that's what the Lord expects of those who have freely chosen to teach at this special university. To the degree that we allow ourselves the luxury of following the traditional university pattern of disputation, we're in trouble, for that is not how the kingdom is built. Nor is it possible to build Zion on that shaky foundation. It is said of Zion "that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people" (4 Nephi 1:15).<br><br>How does the Lord's counsel to the early Twelve apply to our situation? "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). The primary mission of this university, as I understand it, is to provide a first-rate undergraduate education for all our students. I believe that if we would unitedly put our individual efforts to work in achieving this priority, our personal professional dreams and goals would surely come in time. But if we put our personal agendas first and seek to foster our own careers at the expense of our best teaching and mentoring, we will have failed our common dream even while we may have individually succeeded in gaining stature in the world.<br><br>As a professor at BYU, I wear two robes: my black academic gown at graduation and my white robe when I go to the temple. As one drives into the valley from the freeway along the diagonal, the two most prominent landmarks are the temple on the left and the Kimball Tower on the right. They represent the two central citadels of our common culture: a temple of sacred learning and a temple of secular learning. And while they are both vital to our eternal progression, they are clearly not equal in importance; it is appropriate that the temple spire stands at a higher elevation than the Kimball Tower. It is also appropriate that the university began to be built on what was earlier known as Temple Hill, where the Maeser Building now stands. Elder Hafen's statement defines the relationship between the two perfectly: "Our professional credentials may have earned us passports to Athens, but our citizenship must always remain in Jerusalem" (Bruce C. Hafen, "All Those Books, and the Spirit, Too!" Annual University Conference Address [Brigham Young University, 1991], p. 2).<br><br>We are obviously not yet living the law of consecration, but are there ways in which we can "have all things common"? I believe there is. For example, one of the implied goals of general education is to make certain knowledge and skills accessible to all students so that they can carry away with them some common body of a shared cultural heritage. This is not easy to do. C. P. Snow popularized the distance separating the "two cultures" by lamenting the fact that humanists know nothing of the second law of thermodynamics and scientists are unfamiliar with Shakespeare (see C. P. Snow,<i>The Two Cultures: and a Second Look</i>[Cambridge: University Press, 1964], pp. 14–15).<br><br>But a more elemental core of commonality that we share, both as teachers and as students, is our devotion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The opportunity some of us have of teaching a religion class each semester is a rare perk this university offers to its faculty. And this, more than any other single thing, has given me a vision of what Zion could and should be here. For Zion cannot exist without each individual's heart being right with the Lord, and all the faculty at this university are under Brother Brigham's mandate to Karl G. Maeser not to teach even the multiplication tables without the Spirit of the Lord. It wasn't until I began teaching religion classes here that I realized what that really meant, because one simply cannot teach religious truth without the Spirit. After teaching religion, I more consciously bring my humanistic learning to bear on religious issues, which enriches my religion classes; and the Spirit I bring to bear on my humanities teaching acts like a subtle catalyst, igniting interest and trust in my students, directing my thoughts and focusing my energies on the most pertinent things. I wouldn't think of entering a class without a preparatory prayer. In addition, the Spirit sometimes prompts connections between religion and art that are almost breathtaking. As we were discussing Michelangelo's Sistine chapel ceiling one day, I shared some insights about some relationships between the finger of God in<i>The Creation of Adam</i>and the logo for Steven Spielberg's<i>E.T.</i>--suddenly, the connection to the priesthood hit me. I asked: "What do these images have to do with the way we dispense power and authority in the priesthood?" A pregnant silence followed. Where else in the whole world could this shared insight have even been mentioned without legal problems?<br><br>It's one thing for a teacher to bring a class to a "unity of the faith." It's quite another to marshal the spiritual forces of a whole society into a unified whole. As I look at the scriptural precedents of Zion, two conditions always seem to be present: a persuasively spiritual and selfless leader and a critical mass of willing believers that provide the leaven to raise the whole.<br><br>One personal experience with a critical mass of believers under inspired leadership working toward a common spiritual goal has come to me while singing in the Tabernacle Choir. In fact, this experience has convinced me that Zion could really come in a big way to this university. It's difficult to express adequately in words the elevation of spirit that has accompanied my five years in the choir. When people ask me how I like it, I usually say: "I feel like I've died and gone to heaven." Lately I've been trying to put my finger on why I feel this way, aside from the obvious pleasure we all get from singing beautiful music together.<br><br>A month or so ago our new associate director, Craig Jessop, was trying to get us to sing in tune by having the sopranos and tenors sing an F# and the altos and basses sing an E, creating a mild dissonance that forced us to sing in tune. He said that if we were absolutely in tune, the overtones would "kick in" and would greatly magnify our sound and our resonance, like having a whole other ghost choir singing in the air above us. There is a spiritual type in this: As we keep ourselves absolutely in "tune" with his Spirit, the "overtones" of his mercy kick in when we most need them, when we are painfully aware of our own limitations to measure up to the task at hand. The daunting task of building Zion is one of those overwhelming challenges that can be overcome by simply doing our best and trusting in his grace to make up the difference. If we do less than our best, he can't make up the difference without tampering with our agency, which he will never do.<br><br>The prosperity implied by "there were no poor among them" requires some minor modification to make it fit our situation. I occasionally ask my classes: "What is the equivalent of 'no poor among them'?" It doesn't take them long to figure out my drift: "There were no<i>failures</i>among them." Ah, there's the rub. Have you ever taught a class of premed students, all of whom are desperate for an A? It's no fun. But I throw out a possibility to them. What if, instead of hoarding your knowledge to guarantee that you come out on top, you share it with those who are struggling? And what if I promise to give you all A's if you all qualify? What would happen? For one thing, each successful student would nail down his understanding of the material even better by tutoring his less-fortunate peers, and those who were struggling would be raised to a higher level of understanding.<br><br>Nevertheless, it's one thing to have our cultural treasures "on deposit" in the library, or in our minds, but it's quite another to embed it in the minds and hearts of our students so that they can carry it out into the world intact. In his talk entitled "A Zion University," President Bateman described in "a flash of inspiration" his vision of a small army of 6,000 young graduates spreading out from this university into the whole world to establish footholds of goodness everywhere (see Merrill J. Bateman, "A Zion University,"<i>Brigham Young Magazine</i>50, no. 1 [March 1996], p. 33; also, this volume, p. 123). How much of what we gave them will they still have when they finally reach their destinations in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa? My realization that my students will have lost enormous amounts of knowledge precipitated a personal professional crisis about fifteen years ago.<br><h2><b>My Crisis</b></h2><br>After having given the final exam to a spring-term class of Humanities 101, I was sitting in my old office in the JKHB wondering what my students would remember from the class I had just taught. The more I thought, the more distressed I became because I realized that I had remembered virtually nothing from the classes I had taken at the university. I began seriously to question this whole endeavor: spending enormous sums of money and expending years of toil in pursuit of an impossible dream. For if we retain virtually nothing of what we learn here, then why bother? No savvy businessman would ever risk investing in a venture that produced no tangible lasting results. Sure, we have grades printed on transcripts available at the Records Office, but what does my A- in organic chemistry from Dixie College mean if all I can now remember is the formula for water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and the formula for sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)? Nevertheless, I gradually realized that I did remember something about my early schooling. What was striking, however, was not what I remembered, but why I remembered it.<br><br>*I remember the religion course I took from Dean B. West Belnap called "Your Religious Problems" because the students had to present their personal religious problems, and then each student had to provide a written response the next class period to the presenter. I don't remember what the other students' problems were, but I remember mine, because I had to write it down and present it in class.<br><br>*I also remember Chauncey Riddle's beginning philosophy class because he used a modified Socratic method: probing for our answers to philosophical issues rather than loading us with information that we would likely soon forget. The final paper required us to formulate our own philosophy: our own ethics, epistemology, logic, aesthetics, and metaphysics. It was a revelation to me that philosophy involved me in a deeply personal way, that I even had a personal philosophy.<br><br>These remembered moments from my education are convincing evidence that what I retained over the years were the indelible experiences I was directly involved with, whereas the information I read or was told in class evaporated into the wind like disappearing ink. These realities form the basis for my new agenda as a teacher: to find ways to involve my students more directly in interactive learning experiences with the aid of new computer technology, and to help them develop applicable perceptual skills they can use for the rest of their lives and not promptly forget once the class is over. And, in a larger sense, technology can help us create the singular unity that has characterized Zion in every age by helping to break down barriers between us and our students, between the students who get in and those who don't, and between our unique educational values and the world as a whole.<br><h2><b>The Power of the Media to Unify Us</b></h2><br>The most obvious media influence on the growth of the kingdom lies in the greatly expanded range of the prophet's voice made possible by radio, television, videos, and satellite downlinks. At no previous time in the history of the world has the church of God been this large, nor have so many faithful Saints been moved to tears at the same moment by the same speaker, where virtually millions are "of one heart and one mind" throughout the world. And yet, one of the Church's major challenges is to find a way to "export" the BYU experience to those who can't come here because of the enrollment cap. Some form of distance learning is a possible partial answer to this dilemma. Within the past couple of months I have had the opportunity to experiment with distance learning on a small scale, teaching some simple architectural modules to grade-school children around the country. I have discovered how difficult it is to teach to the single eye of a TV camera--and yet how exhilarating it is to hear the excited responses from the various schools on satellite hookup. We have much to learn, but the necessary machinery is already in place to beam up our best. Nevertheless, the more pervasive technology becomes in education, the greater the danger of losing the human ties.<br><h2><b>Media in the Classroom</b></h2><br>I teach large classes of more than 300 students. Anonymity is a real barrier in this teaching situation. So about ten years ago I began using a camcorder to record my students' names and hometowns. Each hour before class I would review my tape so that by midsemester I had most of their names learned. It made a difference to me and to them: I could address them by name in class. The increased rapport was palpable.<br><br>Another problem with large classes of lower division undergraduates is the tendency to reduce the complexity of the material to lists of easily testable facts, which can kill the life of the discipline, the very thing that drew us into the study in the first place: a passionate attachment to our field. I don't think the sequence of this description of Zion is accidental: "of one<i>heart</i>and one mind." For learning to be engaging on the front end and lasting on the back end, it must be passionate. It must be experienced. To guarantee that my students would never have to question my own passion for the humanities, nor wonder whether it was worth their effort to understand, I begin each semester with a first-day "Sneak Preview." I simply line up my favorite video clips of painting, architecture, ballet, opera, music, drama, and film and "blow them away" with stunning moments of high intensity. Wouldn't you think twice about your dislike of opera if you could experience Luciano Pavarotti belt out a high B-natural in Puccini's aria "Nessun Dorma"? Another simple but effective way I have found to bring the heart into contact with the mind in the study of a great artist is to link music familiar to them with visuals unfamiliar to them. At the end of the semester, when I ask my students to recall some of their most memorable moments in the class, they invariably say something like: "That day you talked about van Gogh!" And then I know what they mean. I used to pull slides that related to the lyrics of Don McLean's popular song "Vincent" and project them on the screen while the music was playing. But at the beginning of fall semester last year I took a Quickstart seminar offered by the Instructional Technology Center to learn how to work with a software presentation program called Adobe Premiere. After three or four days of training, I transferred my clunky slide/sound presentation onto videotape with smooth dissolves between the visuals. This four-minute presentation gives them a holistic sense of van Gogh's appeal as an artist and as a human being. Then, at the end of the semester, I repeat my "Sneak Preview" with a "Final Review" of what they've learned. They are always deeply moved by the Thanksgiving 1994 performance by the combined choruses and orchestra of the traditional folk hymn "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing." Spencer Jackson, one of my last semester's 101 students, wrote of his reactions:<br><br><i>I went into the first day of class looking forward ... to the end of April. You could have labeled me an unwilling, unlearned student who was taking this humanities class to simply fulfill his GE requirements. This ignorance quickly left my mind as I walked out of class that day. ... What struck me was not only the beautifully sung melody, but especially how the choir reacted. Tears flowed from their faces, and they manifested unto me that they gave 110% into their beliefs--my beliefs. Their performance went beyond a simple concert ... for their emotions became mine. I shall never forget that experience.</i><br><br>In each of these three class periods throughout the semester, the shared emotion is electric and gives us all a compelling reason for being together in the same room.<br><br>Perhaps the most deadly aspect of a large GE class is the direct result of pure logistics: the teacher must rely almost solely on the lecture mode. We seem to assume that students don't have books to read; otherwise, why do we resort to a verbal barrage of pure information better acquired by careful reading? A woodcut illustration of a lecture given at a German university in the fourteenth century shows the professor seated on an elevated lectern reading from his notes to four rows of students, some of whom are attending to the lecture or taking notes while others are in the act of daydreaming or talking to each other. One is asleep. (See Charles Homer Haskins,<i>The Rise of Universities</i>[Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1957], cover.) If we could compare this to a photograph of a contemporary college classroom, what would be different? Virtually nothing but the attire and the presence of a chalkboard. In fact, we've "morphed" two identical BYU classrooms--one at the turn of the century, the other in the present. As you can see, we haven't come very far in ninety years. In spite of the explosion of communications technology in the last half of this century, most students still learn as their preprint ancestors did: by listening to lectures, taking notes, and passing tests.<br><br>If a picture is worth a thousand words--I just demonstrated that a woodcut is worth several sentences of commentary--how much is a moving picture worth? How much is a moving picture supplemented by a carefully crafted interactive computer format worth? In terms of dollars, here is a telling example of the teaching power of the media. In 1990, approximately 38 million Americans watched Ken Burns' superb PBS special<i>The Civil War,</i>eleven hours of photos, music, letters, conversation, and narration. It cost $3 million, which works out to less than one cent an hour per viewer-learner. One writer has said:<br><br><i>Had Burns wanted to convey the same subject matter to the same number of people through the hoary technology of the college lecture hall, the project would have cost something over $6 billion and would have required the full-time classroom efforts of all the history professors in America.</i>[Lewis J. Perelman,<i>School's Out</i>(New York: Avon Books, 1993), p. 102]<br><h2><b>Media Outside the Classroom</b></h2><br>But what can be achieved inside the traditional classroom by availing ourselves of this new technology is dwarfed by what is already happening outside the classroom. The large size of most of our classes makes it virtually impossible to prepare the students adequately for the kinds of skills learning that characterizes the sounder education we envision. I can greatly expand my tutoring capacities by multiplying myself through an interactive computer tutorial. With the willing and able support of our Humanities Research Center staff in the JKHB, I have developed computer tutorials for all the major fine arts. Students go to the lab to learn how to recognize ballet steps, film techniques, the elements of music, and the styles of painting and architecture. The computer does a much better job than I could do even if I were available, for we have only recently discovered the remarkable patience of a machine to tutor the ignorant: for slow students, a computer can repeat a sequence interminably or wait for an answer until the cows come home; for fast students, a computer enables them to proceed at sometimes breakneck speed without breaking their necks. No more waiting for the lowest common denominator to catch up, a condition that makes many classes deadly boring for the bright students. In a way, we can reverse the traditional student-teacher ratio: instead of having one authority teaching 300 students, we can now have 300 authorities waiting in the wings to teach one student.<br><br>There are serious flaws in our testing and grading procedures on all levels of education that computer technology can help to rectify. "The primary aim of grades in this [norm-referenced] system is not to gauge learning but to sort students," says Richard J. Stiggins, director of the Assessment Training Institute in Portland, Oregon (quoted in Betty Wallace and William Graves,<i>Poisoned Apple</i>[New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995], p. 40). And while student achievement has remained static over the last decade, grade averages continue to climb. Since teachers are reluctant to relegate their students to failure, they lower their standards. However, I have never been concerned with grade inflation, because my goal is to help all of my students get A's. This has never happened, but that is my goal. And now that I can allow them not only to practice their perceptual skills until they're perfect (much like learning how to play a piano), the personnel in our Humanities Research Center have helped me put my multimedia tests on the computer, where the students have the option of taking an exam more than once. We are also collaborating with a local software company to develop a battery of different kinds of testing procedures that will allow a student to take an exam until a certain mastery level is reached, say 80 percent, at which point the student can proceed to the next level of learning.<br><br>One of the most promising recent developments in education is the pursuit of a wider definition of intelligence than standardized testing allows. Virtually all school systems, including our own, have bought into the belief that intelligence is a single entity identified as IQ that can be measured by a single paper-and-pencil instrument, when in reality, according to Howard Gardner, there are at least seven different intelligences that he claims "have equal claim to priority" (Howard Gardner,<i>Multiple Intelligences: The Theory in Practice</i>[New York: BasicBooks, 1993], p. 8). In addition to the traditional measures of intelligence such as verbal! linguistic and logical/mathematical, he identifies other intelligences such as musical! rhythmic, bodily/kinesthetic, visual! spatial, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. In this view, intelligence is not a function of mere mental recall, but "the ability to solve problems, or to fashion products, that are valued in one or more cultural or community settings" (Gardner, p. 7). Thus, a critical ingredient in retaining what we learn is developing perceptual skills that can be used repeatedly in different contexts for the rest of one's life, rather than relying on what Gardner refers to as the "decontextualized facility" of standardized testing procedures.<br><br>In my own field of arts education, one of the most exciting and promising avenues of skill development available through CDROM technology lies in what I would call "creative manipulation." Once students learn the vocabulary of a medium and can recognize techniques and procedures, they can begin to explore the creative dimension of an art by choreographing a dance sequence, designing a building, or editing a film sequence on the screen. With generous financial support from the University Film Committee, the ITC and I have developed a pilot tutorial on film techniques that includes a series of clips that can be edited together in any order. This pilot disc so impressed a national publisher that we are presently negotiating a contract to create two discs on the visual arts.<br><h2><b>The Proof Is in the Pudding</b></h2><br>For years we have been told by media moguls that by introducing computers into the schools we can empower students with a control of the learning process unimaginable even a decade ago. George Gilder has written:<br><br><i>These technologies will give to every person at a workstation the creative power of a factory tycoon of the industrial era</i>[and]<i>the communications power of a broadcast tycoon of the television age.</i>[George Gilder, "Scoping Out the Data Highway: George Gilder on the Impact of Emerging Technologies,"<i>MicroTimes,</i>no. 125 (25 July 1994): 300]<br><br>Notwithstanding the hype and hope for electronic education, however, we are still far from the promised land. The proof simply has not kept pace with the promise, as anyone knows who walks around campus and sticks his head into any classroom. It's all still business as usual. Richard White, technology administrator for Chicago's schools, said it best: "Teachers will have to get as comfortable with computers as blackboards, or it all will be a waste of money" (quoted in David A. Kaplan and Adam Rogers, "The Silicon Classroom,"<i>Newsweek</i>[22 April 1996]: 60).<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, I return to my favorite Zion metaphor, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I've sung in the choir long enough to realize that none of us singers are that good--there are few true soloists in the choir, and I also realize that we are, for the most part, garden variety Latter-day Saints: we're good people, but we all have our personal flaws. So I asked myself, whence comes the incredible spiritual influence that radiates from this organization, the "wall of sound and spirit" that washes over audiences and reduces them to tears? Again, I believe that it's the magnified energies of the critical mass that makes the difference. A telling analogy from the animal kingdom can be found in the remarkable mounds built by the compass termites in northern Australia, which have a north-south orientation to keep the temperature and humidity of its brooding chambers constant. Thus, the flat side of the mound faces the rising sun to cope with the early morning chill, whereas the steep roof deflects the heat when the sun is overhead. But what is most remarkable, according to Michael Talbot in his book<i>Beyond the Quantum,</i><br><br><i>is that no single termite could ever accomplish such a miracle of engineering.</i>...<i>Even three or four termites gathered together are equally helpless. But keep adding termites one by one and sooner or later a sort of critical mass is reached, and as if the truth has suddenly dawned upon them, they gather into work crews and begin cementing grains of sand together with their saliva, building arches and connecting columns until the expertly designed fortress that will ultimately become their home grows like some strange flower around them.</i>[See Michael Talbot,<i>Beyond the Quantum</i>(New York: Bantam Books, 1988), p. 117]<br><br>This is a fascinating biological phenomenon that has some relation to human society, and more especially to the "brotherhood of the Saints." I think Zion could be seen as a critical mass of good individuals who work together to accomplish much more than any individual could ever achieve alone. Elder Maxwell, in his inspiring little booklet<i>Of One Heart,</i>dramatizes a fictional visit to the city of Enoch. He writes:<br><br><i>The subtle and wondrous efficiency of righteous unity is found in the manner in which it moves each man to do more than he ever imagined, or even wanted, to do himself. Seeing others pass a supposed breaking point without breaking, going a second mile with a burden they are only required to carry one mile, witnessing those falsely accused persist in sweet patience--there is a clear contagion in such things. ... One is simply inspired to do more, and his performance is sanctified for the welfare of his soul.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Of One Heart: Look Back at Sodom</i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1990), p. 28]<br><br>Babylon has preempted the media for its satanic purposes long enough. It is time we took back our birthright by learning to use the media to preserve and perpetuate our cultural and religious heritage. It's not easy talking about Zion, because it's still only a theoretical possibility. But I'm convinced it's closer than we think--it could come sooner than we think, if, individually, we are willing to take the leap of faith. While our research projects are diverse and species specific to our own interests and strengths, it is teaching our students truth through the Spirit that poses the clearest and most urgent cause behind which we can marshal our best collective energies in building a Zion society at this university.<br><br>I applaud President Bateman's efforts to verify our spiritual allegiances, to insure that we as professors have as solid an ecclesiastical endorsement as the students we teach. They deserve to be taught by teachers whose testimonies are as fervent as their love of their disciplines. President Hinckley's words at April 1995 general conference should give us pause and hope: "Try a little harder to be a little better" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "We Have a Work to Do,"<i>Ensign</i>[May 1995], p. 88). That is my prayer and urgent plea to us all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jon D.

<h1>ching Mind - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was asked to address myself today to my experiences at the intersection of my studies and my beliefs. I have chosen to consider what I would call the development of the searching mind.<br><br>Because I was asked to speak on some aspect of the integration of faith and reason, it occurred to me that I needed to take a moment and dedicate this talk to my husband. So much of what I think and what I am is due to my relationship, my discussions, and my life with him for the past seventeen years. Our discussions and his insights have helped me shape many of my own opinions about life and about how I<i>do</i>integrate secular knowledge with my religious beliefs and faith. It also occurred to me that this integration was really a process, and that metaphorically it took on, somewhat, the characteristics of a journey. This journey takes us to both gloriously sunny and forebodingly stormy climes. When we reach the former, we take delight in the inspiration received and the insight gained, thus restoring our spiritual and mental health. Stormy episodes along our route will cause us to struggle with the hypotheses, logic, and conclusions presented by the world. The result of such struggles, however, may again be the emergence of a strengthened and enlightened mind, depending on whether or not we bring with us the necessary protective garb.<br><br>It seems to me that one of the greatest protections we can have in the world of reason and knowledge is a carefully cultivated questioning mind--a mind that is not easily swayed by every idea thrust forward at it and one that stops to ponder and thoughtfully examine in the context of gospel principles all that is presented. This carefully cultivated questioning mind is what I would call the searching mind. It is an intellect energized by the challenge of a good problem or a significant task; when so engaged, it is led to probe deeply and ponder carefully all aspects of the problem or task. Easy answers from supposed or self-promoting authorities are not readily adopted. Rather, the searching mind questions deeply to produce genuine, grounded understanding. Such questioning is not, therefore, done randomly, willy-nilly, nor is it performed simply with the intention of questioning everything or undermining all understanding. The searching mind questions, probes, and ponders with direction and purpose. The principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ provide this direction and purpose. Such a foundation keeps the questioning mind focused on those questions and modes of understanding that are most likely to produce fruitful outcomes. More, then, than providing easy answers, such a focused searching mind is led to grow, develop, and expand by paying attention to significant questions and fruitful modes of answering those questions.<br><br>Students frequently come to me in my art history classes and say that they have read two opposing sides of a particular scholarly debate and that they are equally convinced by both positions. I routinely tell them that they have not read carefully enough, nor have they allowed time for their minds to rigorously sift through the evidence and draw their own conclusions. One episode of neglectful reasoning over an art historical debate will certainly not produce dire results for the student's life (except perhaps for an art history grade), but if the individual never learns how to exercise the ability to judiciously question, probe, and evaluate ideas presented, the long-term consequences on a lifetime journey may indeed be harmful, perhaps endangering its entire course. I would suggest, therefore, that developing a thoughtfully questioning and evaluative mind--right now, while so many of you have such great opportunities as students at this university--is vital to your capacity to weather storms along your own journey. Each journey of lifetime encounters is unique and personal, but I hope that my discussion today of a few of my own experiences will not be without some relevance to all of us.<br><br>Reflecting on my own life, I am certain that Heavenly Father was helping me develop at a relatively young age those characteristics that would later benefit my understanding of how the gospel provides valuable insights into secular learning. I had the privilege of being raised in the Church, and therefore discussions regarding such questions were a frequent occurrence in my youth. And since debates were, and continue to be, a favorite part of all my family's get-togethers, there was ample opportunity to express opinions. One very significant episode in my journey, however, came when I was a senior in high school. I was taking a sociology class, and because we had to complete a final group project and presentation on personal and social roles, I proudly volunteered my dad, then a psychology professor at BYU, to come speak to the class.<br><br>When the day arrived for his presentation, I was very excited that friends and classmates were going to see what an intelligent father I had. Because it was a rather unique experience at the high school, we all listened intently to everything he had to say. He addressed the several roles of high school students--including child, sibling, friend, etc.--but he particularly focused on our role as student. He told the class that he had always encouraged his own children from a very young age to challenge and question the ideas that were dispensed at school. He asserted that such interaction would bring about a fuller understanding of the topic at hand, and real learning could thus take place. This assertion in his talk, in particular, greatly astounded the students, and I remember one of the rather bold boys in the class asking in amazement, "You mean you really tell your kids to question what the teacher says?"<br><br>My father looked over at me for confirmation and said, "Yes, I do. Don't I, Martha?" I rather timidly nodded yes, even as I realized that I certainly had not significantly lived up to my father's dictum to that point in my education. I also committed to myself at that moment that I would no longer accept as truth what every seeming authority had to say on a subject, and I would more thoroughly, albeit respectfully, question the ideas put forward and search out answers for myself.<br><br>As an undergraduate, I, like you, attended BYU. It was a time of strong examples--a time during which I could observe ways that scholars had dealt with important eternal questions in relationship to their faith and their specific disciplines. I am grateful to Dr. Mark Hamilton, who gave the prayer today, because he was one of those teachers who helped me develop the ability to question the scholarship and ideas of others in order to reach a more profound understanding of the topic and related issues. I would like to thank him for that training and for his example. I am convinced that this firm foundation prepared me in significant ways to face the more daunting pursuit of specialized knowledge in graduate school.<br><br>The year before I entered graduate school, however, Heavenly Father provided me with one of the most significant experiences on my journey thus far, an experience that I was to call to mind many times during my graduate studies. One day I was reading the scriptures just for enjoyment--those always seem to be the times when the Spirit is most able to work on one's mind--and I felt greatly inspired by what I read. It seemed to me that the passage I had been reading related very directly to some rather discouraging public criticism the Church had recently been put through in the media. This story in the Book of Mormon seemed to put everything in proper perspective for me. The episode had to do with Korihor, the Anti-Christ, and his attempts to sway people with his declarations against a belief in Christ. One gets a vivid image of Korihor's wily ways in the account given by Alma.<br><br>Korihor had much success in leading people into wickedness by convincing them that there was no Atonement and that<br><br><i>every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.</i>[Alma 30:17]<br><br>Later, when the high priest Giddonah questioned why he condemned the teachings of the prophets, Korihor responded by saying:<br><br><i>Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.</i><br><br><i>Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage.</i>[Alma 30:23–24]<br><br>How modern this all must have sounded to a culture that had a long tradition of faith and belief in the Lord. How convincing it must have seemed to those who already felt such religious devotion was old-fashioned and naïve. Korihor became more emboldened with each failed attempt to quell his evil influence. Finally, by the time he was brought before Alma, Korihor had become an extremely pompous individual enamored of the cleverness of his own rhetoric. Alma records:<br><br><i>And he</i>[Korihor]<i>did rise up in great swelling words . . . and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.</i>[Alma 30:31]<br><br>We all know that after this Korihor came to a very miserable end, but we should ask ourselves, "Why were so many people persuaded by his ideas? Why did many individuals not question the truth or spirit of his logic?" I think it likely that many were simply influenced by the novelty and persuasiveness of his arguments. Furthermore, Korihor's accusation that the faithful were both mindless and blindly obedient must have provoked a vehement desire among some to separate themselves from such a categorization. Ironically, after vociferously proclaiming their independence from their fathers' traditions, these individuals then blindly followed Korihor's lead without stopping to question his motives or the assumptions underlying his pronouncements.<br><br>This passage of scripture came to my mind many times when I returned to my studies. Graduate school was an exciting experience. I was fortunate to have the unusual experience of going to graduate school at the same time as my husband. Even though this brought about certain stresses--like juggling class schedules with the demands of raising our two sons, who are now teenagers--I mostly remember both of us frequently coming home to breathlessly tell each other of some stimulating class we had just attended or some fascinating research we had been working on that was generating new and original ideas.<br><br>There were other times, however, when I landed in those stormy locales where my beliefs and faith were questioned and even ridiculed. In particular, I remember an important learning experience I had in a history class at Ohio State University. The professor for the course was a world-renowned scholar on Martin Luther and the Reformation. We were in the midst of discussing Luther's reading of the Bible one day when this professor laughingly recounted, "Those Mormons just don't get it. I just walked through the student union and saw a couple of Mormon missionaries sitting at a table, and they just don't understand Christ." Well, I am certain that he did not expect that there would be a Mormon sitting in the class, and he must have thought everyone would join in on the humor. I challenged him, however, on his comments, and he replied that if the Mormons had understood Christ, they would have realized that Christ had forgiven murderers in his statement "forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). We then had a lengthy discussion as to who was actually responsible for Christ's death. In the end, I doubt that anyone was greatly affected by the discussion except me. I more firmly grasped something I had known all along and should have been more vigorously applying in my schooling: Do not automatically validate the knowledge dispensed by so-called authorities, whatever their worldly reputation.<br><br>I returned to BYU as a professor, anticipating the opportunity of now dispensing my own accumulated knowledge. Now, however, as my first decade back at BYU is coming to a close, I realize that I still have much questioning to do concerning the education I received. Now that I am here where one feels a greater ease in discussing the eternal aspects of an issue in class, I find that there are modes of perception I had not known existed during my graduate school days. As I was hurtling through the demands of doing research, writing papers, and taking exams, there were questions I never thought of asking. Recently, I heard that Stan Taylor, a BYU professor of political science whose wisdom I admire, said it takes about seven years here before one really gets to know what BYU is all about. I heartily concur. It takes about that long before one stops worrying about accumulating knowledge--a built-in habit acquired during student days--and starts thinking more about evaluating the knowledge one has in relationship to the gospel.<br><br>I thought I would turn now to some of those specific experiences in relation to my own field of study, the history of art. I feel profoundly that our beliefs provide experiences and reasoning that frequently enlighten our appreciation and understanding of the art of the past. In regard to much recent scholarship in art history and other disciplines, I find the insights of the author Tom Wolfe enlightening. He criticizes both scholarship and creativity at American universities during the latter half of this century for admiringly and uncritically adopting the voguish methods of twentieth-century Europe. Instead of relating their work to the optimism of and issues facing America, Wolfe asserts that these individuals, in embarrassed homage, prostrated themselves at the feet of elitist and pessimistic modern European philosophies. In his book<i>From Bauhaus to Our House,</i>Wolfe describes the comic chaos that has resulted from such methods:<br><br><i>The twentieth century, the American century, was now two-thirds over. . . . Young philosophers in the universities were completely bowled over by the French vogue for so-called analytical approaches to philosophy, such as Structuralism and Deconstructivism. The idea was that the old "idealistic" concerns of nineteenth-century philosophy--God, Freedom, Immortality, man's fate--were hopelessly naïve and bourgeois. The proper concern of philosophy . . . was the arcana of the philosophical clerisy itself. . . . What was the overriding concern of American philosophers? Why, it was the same as that of the French philosophers whom they idolized. By day, Structuralists constructed the structure of meaning and pondered the meaning of structure. By night, Deconstructivists pulled the cortical edifice down. And the next day the Structuralists started in again. . . .</i>[Tom Wolfe,<i>From Bauhaus to Our House</i>(New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1981), pp. 100–101]<br><br>Many of you will be familiar with the philosophies with which Wolfe is concerned here. Some of you will not have encountered them. There is not time to explain in detail, but such perspectives as Marxism, Freudian psychoanalytic method, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstructivism, feminism, and the like have come to dominate the discussion of the history of art, just as they have become influential in many intellectual realms. Although each approach is described in terms peculiar to itself, most of these ways of seeing humankind and the world take the position that oppression of some kind is at work in the living and understanding experienced by humans. Social, political, economic, artistic, even scientific relations between humans are all characterized by some mode of dominance reinforced by violence either physical, verbal, psychological, or the like. Such approaches are ahistorical and indeed critical of past traditions and values; the only grounding that remains for such perspectives is the self and the exercise of complete autonomy by the self.<br><br>Although I would allow that some value has resulted from discussions by individuals espousing these views, many have taken these and other philosophies to the extreme, leaving us in a world of utter chaos where there is no meaning and no truth. Furthermore, many scholarly evaluations take rather bleak and sardonic views of human motivation, allowing for very little appreciation of the cultural products of the past. Our knowledge of God's eternal plan and our optimistic embracement of hope for humankind leads us to very different conclusions. It is in this fashion that the searching mind is led to understandings that in turn produce growth, development, and enlargement of the person.<br><br>The interpretation of much religious art produced by Western civilization has suffered severely under the application of modern theoretical approaches. During the latter part of the twentieth century, scholars unable to relate to the simplistic faith and hope of earlier generations have deconstructed these works and assigned them meaning and intent that is both extremely convoluted as well as alien to these cultures of the past. Moreover, as you will witness today, they do not seem at all consistent with the mood evoked by the images for most of us as modern viewers. Twentieth-century scholars, however, are anxious to dig up every piece of historical dirt on artists to demonstrate their impure motives or their deviant imagery. Works that had traditionally been considered inspiring and poignant are now ruined for many viewers who listen to rather contrived arguments as to the "real" meaning of such works.<br><br>Even the art of the late medieval era has suffered under these new approaches as motivations of greed, dissension, and bigotry are assigned to everything from the humblest of prints to the grandest of cathedrals. One must allow for the likelihood of human frailty in every era, but it should not distract us from what the work must have conveyed for the viewers of that time or, indeed, what it still conveys to us today.<br><br><i>[Slide 1]</i>For most of us, the viewing of a magnificent stained-glass window, such as this rose window from Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, has a truly inspiring effect. Even though the planners and constructors of these works of art were not of our faith, most of us can still understand the desire of this medieval culture to create a heavenly atmosphere within their cathedrals. As with our own temples, these cathedrals were an attempt to create an environment removed from worldly cares and temptations. The mysterious colored light entering into the dark cathedral through these beautifully decorated windows had the effect of transporting believers to a celestial realm where they could more intently commune with God. In addition, these windows were for most of the illiterate poor the only scripture they had or could understand. Therefore, the didactic message of these windows needed to be presented in a straightforward, yet artistically moving form.<br><br><i>[Slide 2]</i>An inspiring example of this is the<i>Tree of Jesse</i>window from Chartres cathedral in France. The anonymous artist ingeniously presents the lineage of Christ in the form of a branching tree. From the side of Jesse extends the trunk, and he is succeeded by his various descendants until we reach the top of the plant that is crowned by images of Mary and Christ. For those of us who still appreciate the import of this artistic scripture, the window continues to speak with great clarity and beauty.<br><br><i>[Slide 3]</i>When I speak of Rogier van der Weyden's<i>Deposition</i>in class, it is exciting to be able to call on the students' own religious experiences to understand its effect in the fifteenth century. As students recall their own attempts to contemplate the suffering and sacrifice of Christ during our own sacramental service, they understand the value of such images that were meant to inspire the meditation of those attending religious services in times past. Christ is presented to us not as a convincing corpse but as a poignant portrayal of a cruelly broken and tortured body. We are also touched and inspired by the grief, sorrow, and shock of those gathered around him. The swooning figure of Mary parallels that of Christ's as an indication that her mental anguish and suffering brought her into close connection with Christ's physical pain.<br><br><i>[Slide 4]</i>The thoughtful sorrow on the face of Joseph of Arimathaea and<i>[Slide 5]</i>the poignant tears of this female mourner in turn inspire our own contemplation of the tragedy and lead us to a similar reverential gratitude.<br><br>For many of us, some of the most dramatic and awe-inspiring religious images ever created were produced by Baroque artists such as Caravaggio, Zurbarán, La Tour, and especially Rembrandt. Thus, attempts of modern scholarship to psychoanalyze and impugn these artists' motives becomes particularly disturbing. As we return to the images and what they convey, I reiterate that our own spiritual experiences lead us to a clearer sense of what these images must have inspired during a time of great religious upheaval and turmoil in Europe.<br><br>Caravaggio, an Italian painter of the Counter-Reformation era, perhaps best exemplifies the desire of many at this time to return to a simpler and more devout form of worship.<i>[Slide 6]</i>His naturalistic yet dramatic paintings appealed to and frequently depicted commoners, as does this painting<i>Doubting Thomas.</i>We can all relate to Thomas' all-too-human frailty of doubt and the drama of this moment when he is finally convinced of Christ's resurrection through the act of plunging his finger into the open wound of Christ's side. Indeed, Caravaggio invites us to take part in the revelatory moment by bringing us up close to the group, whose bodies actually appear to project into our own space. So convincing is the dramatic focus and naturalistic rendering of this episode that we almost cringe at the sight.<br><br><i>[Slide 7]</i>Equally dramatic is Caravaggio's<i>Conversion of Paul,</i>in which Paul is depicted not as a divine or idealized legend but as a convincing man who actually lived and experienced a miraculous witness. For viewers now and in the past who believe that miracles and revelation do occur, we are sincerely moved by Caravaggio's representation of divine intervention. In a most convincing fashion, Paul, having fallen from his horse, lies prostrate on the ground, extending his arms out to the heavenly light descending from above. For the devout viewers of the seventeenth century, the image must have increased their desire to return to the faithfulness and piety of early Christian times.<br><br><i>[Slide 8]</i>The severity of Spanish religious devotion at this time has been frequently discussed in historical literature and is witnessed in Zurbarán's depiction of the prayers and devotion of Francis of Assisi. The dramatic contrasts of light and dark leave most of Francis' figure in darkness. Only his lips caught in the midst of eternal prayer are illuminated. He holds a skull as a reminder of the temporality of worldly concerns and his need for constant spiritual communion. Again, our own attempts at thoughtful and deep moments of prayer help us recognize and relate to the sincerity of this image.<br><br><i>[Slide 9]</i>Another moment of quiet awe is depicted in the French artist Georges de La Tour's depiction of Mary and the newborn Christ child. Here all light seems to emanate from the child as a metaphor for the divine birth itself. Mary's gentle and loving gaze directs our attention to the babe in her arms, and we are brought close into this circle of figures to join in their adoration. Whereas modern scholars frequently view this image as sentimental and stylized, our own awe over the miracle of this event helps us to appreciate the effect the painting must have had on La Tour's contemporaries.<br><br>The religious imagery of the seventeenth-century Dutch artist Rembrandt has continued to inspire countless viewers down to our present century. The penetrating psychological portrayals of his characters are as moving today as they must have been in his own time.<i>[Slide 10]</i>Whether it is his depiction of the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah quietly lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem or<i>[Slide 11]</i>Peter's embarrassed denial and Christ's sorrow at the time of the arrest, Rembrandt creates convincing characters who convey emotions universal to all humankind.<br><br><i>[Slide 12]</i>Perhaps one of Rembrandt's most poignant paintings is his portrayal of the<i>Return of the Prodigal Son.</i>Elevated and separated from the rest of the figures, the illuminated pair of father and son tenderly embrace. The envious brother and other family members look on but are not a part of the father and son's intimate reunion. One deeply feels the emotions of humble repentance and loving forgiveness in the placement of the prodigal's weary head in the surrounding and protective arms of his father.<br><br>It may, perhaps, seem incongruous for us to now jump ahead to the modern era, but I would like to take a look at one final example, where again I believe our own spiritual experiences help us better comprehend the motivations of the artist.<br><br><i>[Slide 13]</i>This work is entitled<i>White on White</i>and is by the twentieth-century Russian artist Kasimir Malevich. BYU students often find a connection with this painting that I think frequently eludes students who cannot relate to an artist's spiritual intent. In my modern art class, we begin our discussion of this work with the question "How would you represent the concepts of<i>eternal</i>and<i>celestial</i>in a manner that transcends anything one would associate with earthly concerns?" I usually get a number of varied and interesting responses as students try to convert their religious sensibilities into visual form. I would challenge all of you to similarly contemplate this question as we view Malevich's solution to the problem. He chose a modern abstract form for his conceptualization because he wanted it to be a religious image for modern times. Although his own background was one of religious orthodoxy, he did not want to use visual symbols from the past. Instead, he wanted to create a truly transcendent, spiritual image that would not relate in any way to nature as it is known on this earth. Thus, he painted a pure white square in pure white space to represent this cosmological nexus. The square is only differentiated by its slightly altered tone of white and the direction of the brushstroke. The square is set at a slight angle to convey the idea of eternal movement through this unending space. The painting, therefore, functions like religious art of the past. It inspires meditation on a realm beyond this world that one can only intuit and cannot know by scientific means.<br><br>I thought I would conclude my art history discussion by turning to some of my own research and by treating subjects of a more secular nature.<br><br><i>[Slide 14]</i>For some time now, I have been intrigued by the many images of women in the household that were produced by artists in the Dutch Republic of the seventeenth century. During this month when we celebrate the domestic and mothering roles of women, it seemed appropriate to take a closer look at these works--how they were viewed then and what they say to us today. Almost all modern scholarship regarding these images sadly disparages them as having primarily had the intent of supporting a patriarchal regime that oppressed women and limited them to roles as servants of their husbands within the domestic realm. We in the Church today are familiar with these criticisms. Such readings, however, while reflecting modern views of women's domestic roles, have little to do with what they meant in the seventeenth century.<br><br>My religious convictions have always instilled in me very positive associations with women's domestic roles, so images of women in the household do not seem to me to primarily reflect these negative views. The love I have for my mother and all her sacrifices in my behalf lead me to hold her role as mother in the highest regard. Because of my own understanding of this role, I feel that to see women as mere slaves in a domineering patriarchal order is to fundamentally misunderstand the lives of women, both now and in the past. Moreover, the images themselves show a great interest in the world of women and present women as strong and competent managers of the household domain. Having these feelings about domestic images leads me to reject prominent scholarly opinion and seek out what the likely intent of these works was in the seventeenth century.<br><br>It is first of all important to realize how popular the subject of women in the home was to this culture. Never before in the history of Western art had so much attention been given to the visual depiction of ordinary women associated with their contemporary domestic surroundings. Furthermore, one of the most popular pieces of literature in this society was Jakob Cats' book entitled<i>Houwelyck</i>(or<i>Marriage</i>)<i>,</i>and it was totally dedicated to the lives of women. In the newly formed Protestant Dutch Republic, women enjoyed under the law many privileges and freedoms that astounded foreigners. Girls were educated from a young age, and women frequently helped to run their husbands' businesses. In the domestic realm, great import was given to mothers as caretakers and rulers of the household. Contemporary moralists encouraged women to supervise the children and servants, and also to control domestic expenses. Husbands were instructed to leave the household to the management of their wives; in fact, discussions of the household describe it as the dominion of women. These are all powerful indicators that women were not oppressed in this society but were accorded respect and value, and their work and the domains in which they primarily moved were likewise valued.<br><br>Turning now to the images, I would like to introduce you to some of the earliest treatments of domestic work in a series of five prints that were created by the female artist Geertruydt Roghman. At first glance, the originality and power of these portrayals may not be obvious. Her own experiences as a woman, however, clearly informed her strikingly unique portrayals of various female tasks, such as<i>[Slide 15] Women Sewing, [Slide 16] The Pancake Baker, [Slide 17] Woman Spinning,</i>and<i>[Slide 18] Woman Scouring Metalware.</i>These figures do not evoke the type of weakness and meek obedience theorized in patriarchalizing analyses of domestic subjects. Rather, these isolated and monumental figures viewed from surprisingly unposed perspectives have strength and integrity. The prints give visibility to, and thereby importance to, the domestic work being performed. One can certainly imagine that the effect for the female viewer was one of familiarity with the task, thereby giving attention and assigning significance to the female viewer's work as well. These prints then influenced the works of many of Roghman's male contemporaries until domestic imagery became one of the most popular subjects in Dutch art during the 1650s and continuing to the 1670s. This plethora of domestic imagery must have contributed significantly to a view of women's roles as important to the success of the society at large. Certainly a credible analysis of these images cannot ignore the visibility and importance such artworks gave to women's domestic roles. I think the significance such works assigned to the depicted women and the strength that they still inspire is best summed up in May Sarton's twentieth-century poem "Dutch Interior." Although it was primarily inspired by the paintings of Pieter de Hooch, I would like to show you a montage of these works by various artists--including Vermeer, Metsu, Leyster, Terborch, and Netscher, as well as de Hooch--as I read the poem.<i>[Slides 19–27]</i><br><br><i>I recognize the quiet and the charm,</i><br><i>This safe enclosed room where a woman sews</i><br><i>And life is tempered, orderly, and calm.</i><br><br><i>Through the Dutch door, half-open, sunlight streams</i><br><i>And throws a pale square down on the red tiles.</i><br><i>The cosy black dog suns himself and dreams.</i><br><br><i>Even the bed is sheltered, it encloses,</i><br><i>A cupboard to keep people safe from harm,</i><br><i>Where copper glows with the warm flush of roses.</i><br><br><i>The atmosphere is all domestic, human,</i><br><i>Chaos subdued by the sheer power of need.</i><br><i>This is a room where I have lived as woman,</i><br><br><i>Lived too what the Dutch painter does not tell--</i><br><i>The wild skies overhead, dissolving, breaking,</i><br><i>And how that broken light is never still,</i><br><br><i>And how the roar of waves is always near,</i><br><i>What bitter tumult, treacherous and cold,</i><br><i>Attacks the solemn charm year after year!</i><br><br><i>It must be felt as peace won and maintained</i><br><i>Against those terrible antagonists--</i><br><i>How many from this quiet room have drowned?</i><br><br><i>How many left to go, drunk on the wind,</i><br><i>And take their ships into heartbreaking seas;</i><br><i>How many whom no woman's peace could bind?</i><br><br><i>Bent to her sewing, she looks drenched in calm.</i><br><i>Raw grief is disciplined to the fine thread.</i><br><i>But in her heart this woman is the storm;</i><br><br><i>Alive, deep in herself, holds wind and rain,</i><br><i>Remaking chaos into an intimate order</i><br><i>Where sometimes light flows through a windowpane.</i><br>[May Sarton, "Dutch Interior: Pieter de Hooch (1629–1682)"]<br><br>In conclusion, I end by returning to my original question: "How do my religious beliefs inspire my scholarship?" They are so intertwined that I can scarcely separate them. So much of what I am as a scholar is built upon my faith in an eternal plan. It is this faith and my many opportunities of applying it to art history at this university that give me the strength to critically evaluate the opinions of others in my field. When those opinions do not seem valid or constructive, it is frequently the gospel and the understanding it provides that motivates me to search more deeply and inspires me with the logic to thwart such arguments. I am grateful for the many experiences Heavenly Father has given me to develop a questioning, searching mind. Clad in the protection of a searching mind informed by the gospel of Jesus Christ, our journey will be productive, even though challenging. In the words of the hymn we sang earlier:<br><br><i>Sweet is the peace the gospel brings</i><br><i>To seeking minds and true.</i><br><i>With light refulgent on its wings</i><br><i>It clears the human view.</i><br>["Sweet Is the Peace the Gospel Brings,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 14]<br><br>I hope that all of us will save ourselves from blindly following the Korihors of this world by thoughtfully evaluating the ideas presented to us, both here at the university and throughout our lifetime journeys. And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Martha M.

<h1>d Is Charged with the Grandeur of God: A Mandate for Eternal Education - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear fellow students seeking learning, even by study and also by faith: I salute you in this noble effort. I consider myself doubly blessed to be permitted to serve some of you as a faculty mentor, others as a campus bishop. My life and that of my family is unmeasurably richer because of our associations with BYU students, whom Linda and I (sort of as doting surrogate parents) consider to be the brightest, the sweetest, the most faithful, the most diligent, the most talented, and the most beautiful young people ever assembled in one place in the history of the world. (I admit to a slight bias about this, but only a slight one!)<br><br>Consequently I view the invitation to speak to you today not as a chore or as a chance to make points with the administration, but as a simple opportunity to share with you something I hope will help you in your educational and spiritual endeavors here at BYU and throughout your life.<br><br>And though it sounds a bit simplistic to state it in the following way, I wish to discuss with you for a few minutes today whether the world is good or evil; that is, whether there is some evil in a world that is essentially good (and potentially all good) or whether the world is inherently and essentially (or ontologically) evil, albeit with some good to be found in it. (I've already said<i>you</i>were good!) It's a bit like asking the old question about whether the glass is half full or half empty, or whether zebras are black with white stripes or white with black stripes.<br><br>This question came into focus for me almost exactly one year ago when my son Jeremy and I were traveling from Avignon in the south of France to Rome, and we made the mistake of taking a night train. When we arrived in Rome we realized that an American gentleman with whom we had been sharing a train compartment had stolen several hundred dollars from Jeremy during the night.<br><br>And so as we walked around the Eternal City, viewing the marvels of classical and Renaissance Rome, this issue occupied our thoughts and conversation a bit. For a few days Jeremy strongly suspected that the world and the people in it were essentially evil and that his earlier experiences with good people and good things had just been exceptions that prove the rule. (Of course I don't want to trivialize the problem of evil. After our visits to Mauthausen, the Reichstag in Berlin, and seeing the aftermath of Communism in East Germany, we know there is plenty of real evil in the world, not just petty thievery.)<br><br>Gradually, however, as we encountered more and more wonderful people and more and more evidence of the existence of wonderful people in earlier generations, Jeremy decided--I hope permanently--that the world is essentially good but that there's a whopping amount of evil in it and you have to be just a little bit careful about where you leave your valuables! (Near the end of my talk I will describe one of the high points of our trip, a performance in London of Mozart's opera<i>The Magic Flute,</i>which permanently convinced me, at least, that the glass is half full.)<br><br>But first I wish to explain why this simple theological paradigm--good world with some bad versus bad world with possibly some good--has such important educational-psychological implications. In an Honors history of civilization course that I team-teach with Professor Wilfred Griggs of the Department of Ancient Scripture, we almost never fail to have students raise this issue, though with a slightly different twist.<br><br>This usually occurs after we have been engaged in a study of some texts or artifacts that seem particularly similar to--and yet somehow quite different from--familiar LDS ideas. By their questions, students let us know that they have been moved to the edge of their comfort zone, that the paradigms by which they had been operating do not adequately accept these new ideas.<br><br>The last time I recall this happening, for example, was just last year when we had been discussing ancient myths about the death and dismemberment of the god. From the Greek myths about Ouranos and Orpheus to the Egyptian myths about Isis and Osiris, there seems to be a consistent pattern whereby the creative, life-giving, good god is overcome by his evil antagonist, who represents death, chaos, and destruction. The evil force kills the god, then cuts up his body into little pieces and scatters them all about in the hope that he will remain dead and be utterly destroyed.<br><br>But instead of this having the desired effect, to the surprise and frustration of the evil one, everyone and everything in the places where the pieces of the god are placed become godlike themselves: everyone and everything takes on his life-giving and life-affirming essence. Then the god himself is gathered back into a complete whole--in the case of Osiris with the help of his eternal companion the goddess Isis--and resurrected, whereupon he then gathers his myriad sons and daughters, who have sprung up from each bit of his body, into his eternal presence.<br><br>Our students' instincts to divide things into "this is the gospel, that is the world, hence not the gospel" are at first quite strong (and it does not help when we refer to these stories as myths, which means "falsehood" to most people, though to scholars it means "powerful manner of expressing truth"). But after some hesitation one or another of our students usually gets up the courage to observe that these myths seem similar to our belief in the sacrament, in which the bread representing the body of God is ritualistically broken up, scattered out, and literally planted within members of the kingdom, whereupon they take upon themselves his essence and renew the covenant by which they have become his sons and daughters.<br><br>Eventually, students mention that these myths also seem similar to our belief in a literal resurrection of the broken body of Christ and in the gathering of all those who have become his sons and daughters, all of which thwart the plans of the evil one: rather than destroying goodness, evil has inadvertently helped multiply it.<br><br>At times like these, students often ask questions like the following: "By the way . . . I've been wondering . . . How come these people believed things that are so similar to what we believe?" The unstated concern seems to be that these are texts not contained in our authorized canon, so how can they contain so much truth?<br><br>At least one student, usually a returned missionary, will attempt to solve the problem by stating categorically: "Well, they're just apostate imitations of the truth (probably inspired by the devil!)." This seems to preserve for that student, for the moment at least, the distinction between "us" and the "world." And his attitude is understandable: he has been careful to shun evil and to embrace good, and he has spent two years proclaiming to the "world" that there is a better way.<br><br>Another way of stating this is that we notice not a few of our students, missionaries and non-missionaries, have been quite concerned--sometimes subconsciously--about what things are "safe" to deal with at the university. Many came here with familial warnings ringing in their ears not to let university learning corrupt them. And of course their family members are right: we must learn to distinguish good from evil, joy from misery, bitter from sweet, as Father Lehi taught his son Jacob: "It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). And there is much evil in the world that deserves to be avoided like the plague--that is very true.<br><br>But taken to an extreme, anything can be dangerous, and one of the most damaging things to the educational process is an extreme case of radical dualism, the notion that the world is essentially evil and that one must retreat to a very small island of safety to avoid being contaminated by it. This is not the same thing as being careful about avoiding sin.<br><br>Let me give you a really clear example of what I mean by radical dualism. Manichaeism was a movement originating in Mesopotamia in the third century A.D. that spread thereafter throughout the world as far as China, the Middle East, and Europe. It is a form of Gnosticism, which has become a kind of synonym for radical dualistic thought. Its founder, Mani, taught that the world is "dominated by evil powers," that created matter is itself entirely evil, that our bodies are especially evil because sex is involved in creating them, and that humans should strive to "break the chains holding the divine and luminous principle [the soul] inside the prison of matter and of the body" (<i>The Encyclopedia of Religion,</i>Mircea Eliade, editor in chief [New York: Macmillan, 1987], 9:161). Manichaens view the world as a "burning house" from which we can at best only escape. Needless to say, they do not view the world as a fitting object of study or as a pleasing place to linger and love and enjoy.<br><br>And while there are probably no professed Manichaens among us, the phenomenon I see from time to time among students and colleagues is a milder form of pessimism vis-à-vis the world, which can spontaneously and understandably arise from our struggle against sin and evil. The problem is that it can become a theology and psychology of educational retreat.<br><br>It's really a question of balance, as so many things in life are. As people wanting to avoid evil, and keenly aware of the existence of evil in the world, how do we individually and collectively, as a university, avoid throwing out the baby of eternal learning and curiosity and excitement and delight about the world and about learning with the bathwater of sin and evil? It's not an easy dilemma to deal with.<br><br>For our class, the breakthrough seems to come when we begin to realize that the texts we are dealing with--though unthinkably far removed from us in time, space, culture, language, and theological labeling--nevertheless shed real new light on our own belief system and profoundly deepen our understanding of and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ. But this happens only if we are solidly founded on the gospel in the first place and if we allow its light to illuminate these texts as well.<br><br>We are aided in our task by the scriptures, which contain many admonitions to view the earth positively--whether you are studying ancient civilizations or astrophysics, Zen Buddhism or zoology. Some examples are found in unlikely places, such as in the words of Alma to Korihor, who had asked to be shown a sign that there is a God. After Alma reminds him of the fundamentals of knowledge by invoking "the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets" and saying: "The scriptures are laid before thee," he continues by adding to these fundamental sources of truth the challenge to study God's handiwork:<br><br><i>Yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</i>[Alma 30:44]<br><br>This is not only a fitting rebuke to Korihor, a persecutor of the faithful believers in God, it also constitutes a remarkable invitation to us all to study these things. It sounds, as a matter of fact, for all the world exactly like the Lord's familiar admonition given through Joseph Smith in Doctrine and Covenants 88:77–80:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i><br><br>As in Alma's words, at first there is an admonition here in the Doctrine and Covenants to get the fundamentals right: the scripture says that we should be properly instructed in theory, principle, doctrine, and law of the gospel. Then comes the liberating invitation to fearlessly tackle, on that solid footing, everything else under the sun, no holds barred, to come to grips with all the learning in the world (there is a dash after countries and kingdoms, which I read to mean "etc., etc., etc."). And when we do, applying this scripture to ourselves, I take it to mean we will all be more prepared and useful in magnifying our calling and fulfilling our mission with which the Lord has commissioned us. (And, by the way, I think the word<i>expedient</i>in that scripture tells us that this kind of broad learning is not simply optional: it's expedient!)<br><br>In my opinion, the same spirit that inspired those prophets, Joseph Smith and Alma, to write those scriptural invitations to view the earth and the world as fit subjects of serious study also inspired the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, who wrote:<br><br><i>The world is charged with the grandeur of God.</i><br><i>It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;</i><br><i>It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil</i><br><i>Crushed.</i><br><br>In his next lines, Hopkins laments that men have forgotten God (a bit like Korihor!), and, buying and selling, selling and buying, have come to view the world in mundane terms rather than as God's miraculous handiwork. (I will read the first lines again and then continue a bit.)<br><br><i>The world is charged with the grandeur of God.</i><br><i>It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;</i><br><i>It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil</i><br><i>Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?</i><br><i>Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;</i><br><i>And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;</i><br><i>And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil</i><br><i>Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.</i><br><br>But the poet, who has seen the grandeur of God flame out from the world like "shining from shook foil," gathering to greatness like the ooze of oil crushed in the olive press (a remarkable religious image in its own right), ends his poem with<i>his</i>statement about whether the world is ontologically or only temporarily evil. Even though the earth is bent and plunged into blackness, the morning of a new dawn will soon break:<br><br><i>The world is charged with the grandeur of God.</i><br><i>It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;</i><br><i>It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil</i><br><i>Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?</i><br><i>Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;</i><br><i>And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;</i><br><i>And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil</i><br><i>Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.</i><br><i>And for all this, nature is never spent;</i><br><i>There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;</i><br><i>And though the last lights off the black West went</i><br><i>Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--</i><br><i>Because the Holy Ghost over the bent</i><br><i>World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.</i><br>[Gerard Manley Hopkins,<i>Poems</i>(1918), "God's Grandeur"]<br><br>This stirring image of the dovelike Holy Ghost brooding birdlike over the egglike world with its warm incubating breast recalls to my mind perhaps the most moving (and most often overlooked) scriptural statement about whether the world is essentially good or bad: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" (John 3:16). As Enoch learned when he observed God weeping for his wicked children who would not repent, God does not give up on any of his children, nor has he abandoned the world that he loved so much even though so much of it lies in darkness. I believe the poet was justifiably inspired to write that a new day would soon dawn and new light would drive out the darkness.<br><br>Part of that new light consists in our efforts to follow the invitation of the Doctrine and Covenants and fulfill our mission better. But it's a daunting challenge! Perhaps some of us fall back on the dualistic idea of the world being so corrupt that it doesn't make sense to study it, simply to avoid having to get outside our comfort zones and meet this supreme educational challenge head-on! Some of us no doubt feel safer searing, blearing, and smearing the world with trade and toil, rather than looking for the grandeur of God flaming out from it like shining from shook foil or gathering to greatness like the ooze of oil crushed. Think of the remarkable things we have yet to learn about, individually and collectively: about the human brain, possibly God's greatest creation; about superstrings and mesons and quarks; about the behavior of super-cooled matter and social groups; about rain forests and other complex ecosystems; about chaos theory, metalinguistics and metacognition and metahistory; about things both in heaven and in the earth, etc., etc., etc.<br><br>When I think of this daunting educational challenge and sometimes lose heart, I think of President Hinckley. I have observed with astonishment and admiration how well-read and knowledgeable he is, how well he has risen, over his whole lifetime, to the challenge of learning, and I have observed how eager he seems to be to learn and with what zest for life and learning he plunges into new tasks and new learning environments. I have never detected the slightest sign of fear in him or a dualistic, pessimistic rejection of the "other," that which is outside the narrow circle. His circle seems to be one within which all truth has a place.<br><br>President Hinckley has come to personify for me an openness toward the world and toward all the things that are there for us to learn and to embrace (keeping well away from things that are clearly evil!), but he is not the first Church leader to do so. I happened recently to pick up a handout on religious tolerance prepared by Dr. James Toronto that Linda brought home with her from her very exciting and broadening class on world religions taught by Professor Lanier Britsch. Because I was thinking about this talk when I read the handout, I appropriated (perhaps I<i>mis</i>appropriated) a number of quotes from LDS Church leaders on religious tolerance that also fit, in my view, the theme of my talk today. (I thank Dr. Toronto for his work in compiling these citations.)<br><br>How does this idea strike you, for example, from a statement in 1978 by the First Presidency--President Spencer W. Kimball and his counselors President Marion G. Romney and President N. Eldon Tanner:<br><br><i>The great religious leaders of the world such as Mohammed, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others, received a portion of God's light. Moral truths were given to them by God to enlighten whole nations and to bring a higher level of understanding to individuals.</i>[In Spencer J. Palmer,<i>The Expanding Church</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), frontispiece]<br><br>Or this statement by Orson F. Whitney from 1882:<br><br>[The gospel]<i>embraces all truth, whether known or unknown. It incorporates all intelligence, both past and prospective. No righteous principle will ever be revealed, no truth can possibly be discovered, either in time or in eternity, that does not in some manner, directly or indirectly, pertain to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>["The Gospel of Jesus Christ,"<i>Millennial Star</i>44, no. 36 (4 September 1882): 568; also in<i>Elders' Journal</i>4, no. 2 (15 October 1906): 26]<br><br>How about B. H. Roberts:<br><br><i>While the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is established for the instruction of men; and is</i>one<i>of God's instrumentalities for making known the truth yet he is not limited to that institution for such purposes, neither in time nor place. God raises up wise men and prophets here and there among all the children of men, of their own tongue and nationality, speaking to them through means that they can comprehend; not always giving a fulness of truth such as may be found in the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ; but always giving that measure of truth that the people are prepared to receive. "Mormonism</i>["]<i>holds, then, that all the great teachers are servants of God; among all nations and in all ages. They are inspired men, appointed to instruct God's children according to the conditions in the midst of which he finds them. Hence it is not obnoxious to Mormonism to regard Confucius, the great Chinese philosopher and moralist, as a servant of God, inspired to a certain degree by him to teach those great moral maxims which have governed those millions of God's children for lo! these many centuries. It is willing to regard Gautama, Buddha as an inspired servant of God, teaching a measure of the truth, at least giving to these people that twilight of truth by which they may somewhat see their way. So with the Arabian prophet, that wild spirit that turned the Arabians from worshiping idols to a conception of the Creator of heaven and earth that was more excellent than their previous conception of Deity. . . . Wherever God finds a soul sufficiently enlightened and pure; one with whom his Spirit can communicate, lo! he makes of him a teacher of men.</i>["Revelation and Inspiration,"<i>Defense of the Faith and the Saints,</i>vol. 1 (Salt Lake City: The Deseret News, 1907), pp. 512–13; emphasis added]<br><br>(The only quibble I have with Roberts is that he says "men" when he should have said "men and women.")<br><br>And, of course, there is Joseph Smith, perhaps the greatest and most eager learner, tackling in his brief life Hebrew, Latin, German, philosophy, history, natural science--in a word, probably the most fearless and tolerant non-dualist in our tradition. Here's what he said:<br><br><i>The inquiry is frequently made of me, "Wherein do you differ from others in your religious views?" In reality and essence we do not differ so far in our religious views, but that we could all drink into one principle of love. One of the grand fundamental principles of "Mormonism" is to receive truth, let it come from whence it may.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 313]<br><br>How about this quote from Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true "Mormons."</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 316]<br><br>Just one more:<br><br><i>But while one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other without mercy, the Great Parent of the universe looks upon the whole of the human family with a fatherly care and paternal regard; He views them as His offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence the children of men, causes "His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." He holds the reins of judgment in His hands; He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the narrow, contracted notions of men, but, "according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil," or whether these deeds were done in England, America, Spain, Turkey, or India. He will judge them, "not according to what they have not, but according to what they have." . . . We need not doubt the wisdom and intelligence of the Great Jehovah . . . when the designs of God shall be made manifest, and the curtain of futurity be withdrawn, we shall all of us eventually have to confess that the Judge of all the earth has done right.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 218]<br><br>As I draw to a close, let me tell you the promised anecdote about<i>The Magic Flute.</i>When Jeremy and I arrived in London for the final leg of our trip and had stopped by the BYU London Center for a moment to say hello, Jeremy was reading the bulletin board when he suddenly blurted out: "Dad, you've gotta see this: John Eliot Gardiner is performing<i>The Magic Flute</i>in Queen Elizabeth Hall."<br><br>"Ha," someone standing nearby said, "those performances have been sold out for months!"<br><br>"Never mind," I replied, only half in jest, "it's our destiny to see this performance, and we're going to!"<br><br>I don't know how much I can risk boring you about<i>The Magic Flute</i>and about John Eliot Gardiner, so suffice it to say that Mozart's great opera about eternal marriage and temples and the brotherhood and sisterhood of all humankind is absolutely my favorite work of art in the whole world, bar none. Some of my students know about my interest in it. In what seemed to me--in my fatigued condition, at least--a great cosmic coincidence, I had, during my sojourn in Europe, just definitely decided to write a book about its amazing parallels to Mormon theology. (I won't mention the fact that Isis and Osiris play an important role here as well.)<br><br>And then there is John Eliot Gardiner, who directs the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists, an ensemble of the finest musicians, the latter who play on period instruments. John Eliot Gardiner is absolutely my favorite interpreter of music in this period. I own, I think, nearly every compact disc he has released.<br><br>What I did not know was that he and his musicians had been performing all the Mozart operas and had recorded them in the process.<i>The Magic Flute</i>is the last in the series, and we had arrived just in time for the concert. Obviously, I wouldn't be telling you this story if we hadn't, miraculously, found two tickets, which just HAPPENED to be on the front row, about ten feet away from Gardiner and the orchestra.<br><br>And to make the evening even more magical, through another minor miracle we had been able to help our good friends the Britsches (past academic vice president Todd Britsch and his wife, Dorothy), who also happened to be in London, find tickets for themselves as well (although theirs were not on the front row). I mention this because they are our witnesses about the magic of that performance. The joy that radiated from the performers that night, the celebration of the divine potential of humankind that is unique to this opera, the power of the arts to lend a spiritual confirmation about the goodness of this life and the love and mercy of our Father in Heaven--these all were present in indescribable measure. Even Jeremy, who had patiently stood through many hours of Wagner's<i>Ring of the Nibelungen</i>in Vienna, was swept away, knocked off his feet, by this remarkable experience.<br><br>When the final chords had melted away, we were filled, and I believe everyone in the hall was filled, with the absolute joy that comes from the redemption at the end of the opera. I felt like embracing all humanity, as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony says, and I felt like I was walking some distance off the floor. When we met up with the Britsches, we discovered, not to our surprise, that they had had the same remarkable experience.<br><br>I thank my Heavenly Father that I have had the opportunity to stand with my feet firmly planted on gospel fundamentals and--through the blessing of this and other great universities, through the great example of my Mormon and non-Mormon teachers, colleagues, and students--to have reached out into the world and discovered the grandeur of God, which flamed out at me that night and at other times as well like shining from shook foil, which gathered to greatness like the ooze of oil crushed. I'm grateful that Jeremy and the Britsches were able to be there, too, and I wish for each of you something like that kind of thrill somewhere along the line in the course of your educational endeavors.<br><br>I close with a poem by my dear friend and colleague Professor Leslie Norris. Linda and I and many of our good friends consider this poem a symbol of our commitment to each other in eternal marriage, and thus a symbol of one of the highest of our LDS aspirations. And yet it's just a poem about geese. Or is it?<br><br>When we have heard this poem, rather than asking whether Leslie Norris is a Mormon poet, let us rather ask ourselves if our Mormonism is wide enough to circumscribe his inspiration into our great circle:<br><br><i>Hudson tells us of them,</i><br><i>the two migrating geese,</i><br><i>she hurt in the wing</i><br><i>indomitably walking</i><br><i>the length of a continent,</i><br><i>and he wheeling above,</i><br><i>calling his distress.</i><br><i>They could not have lived.</i><br><i>Already I see her wing</i><br><i>scraped past the bone</i><br><i>as she drags it through rubble.</i><br><i>A fox, maybe, took her</i><br><i>in his snap jaws. And what</i><br><i>would he do, the point</i><br><i>of his circling gone?</i><br><i>The wilderness of his cry</i><br><i>falling through an air</i><br><i>turned instantly to winter</i><br><i>would warn the guns of him.</i><br><i>If a fowler dropped him,</i><br><i>let it have been quick,</i><br><i>pellet hitting brain</i><br><i>and heart so his weight</i><br><i>came down senseless,</i><br><i>and nothing but his body</i><br><i>to enter the dog's mouth.</i><br>[Leslie Norris, "Hudson's Geese,"<i>Collected Poems</i>(Bridgend, Wales: Seran Press [Poetry Wales Press], 1996), p. 174]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Alan F. Keele was a professor in the BYU Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages when this devotional address was given on 4 June 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>rehending Soul: Open Minds and Hearts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
King Benjamin begins his powerful speech to his people with these words:<br><br><i>I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.</i>[Mosiah 2:9]<br><br>I quote that scripture not to set up the expectation that my address today will begin to compare to his, nor to caution you against trifling with my words, but to ask you to consider Benjamin's entreaty for his people to listen not only with ears but also with hearts and minds.<br><br>You know that it is not just King Benjamin who uses these words. Many other prophets throughout scripture make frequent reference to, and coupling of,<i>heart</i>and<i>mind.</i>Often, especially in the Book of Mormon, the reference is a caution against hard hearts and blinded minds, but there are other references, some of which I will quote later, that encourage open minds and soft hearts as we strive to live the gospel.<br><br>The need for coupling minds that think, reason, and evaluate with hearts that perceive, feel, and experience has been on my mind a great deal, especially these last months. In fact, when I was asked to give this devotional address, the issue I wanted to consider was immediately clear to me.<br><br>One month from now the forty members of this past year's edition of Brigham Young University Singers will reunite here for a week of intense rehearsals before departing for Australia, where we will be the United States' representative to the Fourth International Choral Symposium. We will sing three concerts at the symposium, the first of which is to take place in the Sydney Opera House. You can imagine how a sense of intimidation has tried to overwhelm us in this opportunity to bring the name of Brigham Young University to this astute international gathering.<br><br>But we have countered such misgivings with a commitment to prepare ourselves for performances that are full of heart and mind, performances that will not only have the capacity to be aesthetically challenging and satisfying but also to bring the Spirit into the willing hearts and minds of those who listen.<br><br>I am gratified when issues of professional growth relate to an increase in knowledge of--and ability to live--the principles of the gospel. Music and gospel living are both very important to me. And as I speak, in this university community setting, from my expertise in music, I hope you will consider the parallels I attempt to establish between good music-making and gospel living--and then draw your own personal conclusions that will help you integrate, organize, and perhaps even simplify the important facets of your lives.<br><br>Just a moment ago you heard Veronica and Kaarin sing a beautiful American hymn that became much more meaningful to me as I learned its history.<br><br>In 1876 Horatio G. Spafford bid farewell to his wife and four daughters as they departed on a ship to visit relatives in Europe. Some days later their ship collided with another steamship in the mid-Atlantic. Before it sank, Mrs. Spafford prayed with her daughters and committed them to the mercy of the Lord. She never saw her children again in mortality. Mrs. Spafford was rescued and sent this cable to her husband, "SAVED ALONE." While on the Atlantic, on his own voyage to bring his wife home, he wrote the words to this hymn:<br><br><i>When peace like a river, attendeth my way,</i><br><i>When sorrows like sea billows roll;</i><br><i>Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,</i><br><i>It is well, it is well with my soul.</i><br><br>What occurred here? While suffering the tragic loss of his children and undoubtedly knowing his wife's trauma and sorrow, how is it that a man can come to such an expression? Here is a stunning example of heart and mind functioning together for the wellbeing of the soul. In sorrow, disappointment, or frustration, the answer--though seldom, if ever, easy begins with our ability to keep mind and heart connected and working together.<br><br>This issue is a strong example of the analogies that can be drawn between good music-making and gospel living. Music is a felicitous combination of science and art, where laws of physics, something understood at a cognitive level, are manipulated into sounds that express something to be understood at a feeling level. That is the ideal--the summoning of mind and heart, both in composition and in performance of music. But often that ideal is not realized because one or the other is not, for whatever reason, roused or invited to play its full role.<br><br>I am sure you have witnessed the sounds of musical compositions being served up by way of computer technology. For a while the experience is arresting because the musical sounds are perfect--in pitch, dynamics, rhythm, and meter. Perfect. Perfectly boring! The subtle nuance resulting from personal expression of that which is understood only at a feeling level--the heart--is missing. On the other hand, listen to this line from a recent review--not a very nice review--by Bernard Holland, music critic for the<i>New York Times:</i>"The sincerest passions do little good without the thoughtful application of detail" Performances founded only in the emotion of music often become reckless, confusing, or maudlin, whereas performances based only on the science or techniques of music-making are wooden, mechanical, cerebral.<br><br>If we are accustomed to meeting music only on the grounds of its ear-titillating value, experiencing it only at a feeling level, we may balk at the idea of bringing the mind to the experience as well. The peculiar "par excellence" emotionality of music may enthrall to the extent that a mindful consideration of the music's construction or design is seen as superfluous. Music is built by craftsmanship and a sense of order. But there are those who feel that embracing this fact will, in some way, decrease the degree of its inspiration or leave it emotionally sterile. The great American conductor Robert Shaw says, "There is a spiritual quality to pattern itself, the awareness of which may be one of the chief qualifications of the mature artist."<br><br>Or if we are accustomed to meeting music only on the grounds of its construction--its pattern or design--or its value to the eye more than the ear, we may find the process of bringing the heart to the experience highly suspect, even embarrassing.<br><br>It is not difficult to see good reasons for this approach. Our culture is based on excess. Material abundance and the pace, cacophony, and crowdedness of life leave our awareness blunted, our senses dulled. There is a great call today, our own Church leaders being some of the strongest voices, for us to recover the sharpness of our senses, to heighten our awareness, to learn to see more, to hear more, to feel more. And not only just in performance but in composition of music as well, if the music is to be vital. As a moral force, possessing the ability to communicate at any deeper level, it must have heart and mind: feeling or emotion coupled with a sense of reason, substance, and form.<br><br>Be careful when judging music only on how it makes you feel or whether or not it makes you cry. On the other hand, don't dismiss Mozart because there are too many notes or Bach because the walls of sound in his majestic structures are sometimes difficult to penetrate to realize their consummate beauty.<br><br>A few years ago a good sister in my ward asked me to give the outlined Relief Society lesson dealing with one of the church cantatas of Bach. I was grateful for the opportunity to examine with those sisters some of the reasoning and the feeling behind the detail that can be so formidable in his works: the florid melodic decoration of the word<i>Freude</i>or<i>joy;</i>the accidental sharp signs--which at Bach's time were written as crosses--appearing in the music as Bach tells of the Crucifixion; or the brilliant upward flourish of notes composed to the word<i>Auferstehung</i>or "resurrection." I was so pleased that those who had never experienced Bach this way began to share my own affinity for this great preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>As with so much else in life, one has to bring both heart and mind to Bach. You cannot check either at the door if you want to taste the full reward of the experience. Logic does not militate against the expressiveness of art, and feeling is a creation's breath of life.<br><br>An even better description of this issue can be drawn from a review of several years ago that greatly praised a concert given by the American cellist Yo Yo Ma. The program consisted not of one but of all six of the dense, slow-moving Suites for Unaccompanied Cello by Bach.<br><br><i>Just one of the suites</i>[the review states]<i>is usually considered a challenge enough for an artist and a heavy burden for an audience to bear. But the sellout audience in Carnegie Hall was even more enthusiastic at the end of the concert than when the artist first came to the stage.</i><br><br>The review then relates parts of the critic's conversation with Ma, in which the artist speaks of his strenuous preparation process for such a performance.<br><br><i>All of my preparation</i>[he says]<i>was designed to build enough mental and emotional as well as physical stamina to allow me to share something of what the music means. When such preparation works, you are so into the music that you don't control it anymore. You are led by it. Bach takes you to that very quiet place within yourself, to the inner core, a place where you are calm and at peace.</i><br><br>For me, the necessary elements for such an unusual triumph begin with a person's God-given gift, to be sure. But then comes the intellectual and physical preparation that allows the artist to solve the great technical problems and also a preparation involving his heart and mind that allows him to communicate the profound expressions of great music.<br><br>But now let's expand the thought not just to all of the arts but to all of life. Mary Caroline Richards writes that "all the arts we practice are apprenticeship. The big art is our life" (quoted by Julia Cameron,<i>The Artist's Way,</i>[New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1992], p. 83).<br><br>I remember my high school English teacher attempting to inspire us to experience the total beauty of some poetry we were studying. Our questions of "What does it mean?" were countered with a gentle "No, how does it mean?" "Where does the poem take your thinking and your feeling?"<br><br>I remember that teacher often when I have reason to study Isaiah. Perhaps Isaiah has been set to music so often because that book requires the heart, because it needs so much understanding at a feeling level. Yet the true value of reading, studying, and meditating upon any scripture is to be realized only to the extent we bring both open mind and heart to the experience. And the same is true with prayer.<i>The New Jewish Prayer Book</i>says, "Make every effort to pray from the heart. In the eyes of the Lord the effort is precious, even if you do not succeed."<br><br>At the time of the well-publicized explosion of a highly unconventional family, the man, in explanation of his misbehavior, said simply, "The heart wants what the heart wants." But he tragically forgot that the mind does<i>not</i>have to give the heart what it wants, that the ability to feel and think is what lifts us above the rest of the animal kingdom and makes us only "a little lower than the angels" (Psalm 8:5).<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, the elders of the Church at Kirtland are told:<br><br><i>Be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</i><br><br><i>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:33–34]<br><br>Several years ago at the funeral of a man who had served as dean of the College of Fine Arts and Communications, one of the speakers, who had been the deceased man's counselor in a stake presidency, spoke of the man's ability to be "romantic without being a Romantic." I am sure he meant that the man was visionary, able to dream of a better world, able to yearn for the ideal, but all without compromising his sense of fact, his ability to be realistic and practical, his sense of right and wrong.<br><br>Here is the combination of heart and mind, striving to find the best of all possible worlds. The heart, with its power to feel, is disciplined by the mind with its power to reason. The mind, with its power to understand at a cognitive level, can be tempered, appeased, and taught patience by the heart with its power to understand at a feeling level.<br><br>As we are encouraged to study the scriptures, we are sometimes told that "it is one thing to know the gospel is true, and another to know the gospel." We hear and read stirring testimonies of people who knew by spiritual manifestation that the Book of Mormon was true as they first took it into their hands or as they heard someone else bearing testimony of its divine origin. Although that sort of testimony--an understanding at a feeling level--is of greatest importance, it will only grow, strengthen, and endure as one seeks to understand at a thinking level the doctrines recorded in the book.<br><br>And then there are those principles, a testimony of which comes only as we live them. We can be taught a particular principle by leaders we hold to be prophets, seers, and revelators and understand the principle very well at a cognitive level. But the understanding at the feeling level comes only as we strive to incorporate the principle as a consistent part of our lives.<br><br>Left long enough without the mitigation of the heart, the mind becomes cruel, divisive, tactical, hypercritical, vain, obsessive, disillusioned, or cynical. Without a stabilizing mind, the heart becomes impulsive, manipulative, mawkish, insipid, dark, cold.<br><br>It seems to me that if either the mind or heart assumes singular control without the tempering value or the discipline of the other, we are left facing the "natural man," that "enemy to God," which we are told is to be "putteth off' (Mosiah 3:19). Some call this the shadow side of our lives that attempts to block coordination of heart and mind in our behavior so that openness, flexibility, perspective, and progress are thwarted.<br><br>The putting off of the natural man then becomes one of life's greatest challenges and adventures. Robert Shaw writes:<br><br><i>There is no landscaped, easy-approach to beauty and truth. You scratch and scramble around intellectual granites. You try to diffuse or tether your emotional tantrums. You pray for the day when your intellect and your instinct can co-exist, so that the brain need not calcify the heart nor the heart flood and drown all reason. But in that struggle lies the tolerable dignity and a tolerable destiny.</i><br><br>As we proceed with heart and mind together, this putting off of the natural man becomes more of a unifying process as we seek, according to the Savior's charge, to reconcile ourselves to our enemy. With heart and mind working together, passions and appetites can be bridled and brought within the guidelines the Lord has set. By finding appropriate means for their expression, these ambitions or passions can be elevated to high and holy purpose. We come to terms with the shadow side of ourselves without compromising our commitment to gospel living. And as we are taught in 2 Nephi 10:24, we reconcile the natural man to our spiritual selves as we strive to be reconciled to God through his grace.<br><br>The scriptures and Church history are full of dramatic stories involving this reconciliation process. And it is in an analogous reconciliation process that art is often born--where soulful imaginings find expression through the control of form and technique. For example, consider the anguished outcries in the extreme dynamics and dramatic percussive effects in the glorious music of Beethoven as he sought personal reconciliation to growing deaf.<br><br>The natural man wants us to proceed in life's challenges and adventures with only one of the two necessary parts of ourselves in operation. James Hillman was writing about a particular field but could have been writing about the general shifts in educational thought ever since the Enlightenment when he wrote:<br><br><i>Psychology has been unconcerned with myth and imagination, and has shown little care for history, beauty, sensuousness, or eloquence--the Renaissance themes. Its pragmatism, whether in clinic or laboratory, kills fantasy or subverts it into the service of practical goals. Love becomes a sexual problem, religion an ethnic attitude, soul a political badge. No chapters are more barren and trivial in the textbooks of psychological thought than those on imagination, emotion, and the living of life or the dying of death.</i><br><br>On the other hand, there are those of us who lose ourselves so much in a particular passion or become so absorbed in a specific search that we lose a sense of equilibrium or perspective in our lives. My own passion for music, for example, would take every bit of time and attention I possess and then still ask for more. As we follow only where the heart or the mind separately might lead, we find ourselves physicians without mercy, scientists without conscience, artists without morals, scholars without scruples.<br><br>In 1 Corinthians 2:14, Paul says, "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."<br><br>With coordination of mind and heart we continue the process of reconciling the natural man to the spiritual man. By working with mind and heart together, we best prepare to understand and assume responsibility for our choices. And with mind and heart both participating in those choices, we can find our way to self-reliance, morality, principles, character, and integrity.<br><br>But what a balancing act! There are endless complications: We will not escape hurt feelings. We<i>will</i>experience loss and disappointment. The gifts we offer, which we may view as the best and most appropriate things within us, may be received with little appreciation, with disdain, or they may be refused altogether. The heart will want to harden or close and leave the mind free to take offense or seek retaliation or retribution, or it will want to rebel against what an otherwise connected heart and mind know to be true.<br><br>By design we are asked to live with the stress of unanswered questions, paradox, incongruity, enigma, and seeming absurdity, which will try our tenacity, patience, and faithfulness. Our thinking will be challenged, our powers of reason will be overwhelmed, leaving the heart free to wander toward an unrealistic world of self-deception.<br><br>I received a call from a student with whom I had worked closely during her undergraduate work here. This anxious telephone call began an exchange of correspondence that was very inspiring to me, especially as it all began as my son lay in a coma as a result of an accident on his mission in Namibia. With her permission I will tell you some of the circumstances of her story to make my point.<br><br>While at BYU this student had distinguished herself as a vocal music major. She sang beautifully, she was very strong academically, and she played the piano very well. After graduation she and her husband moved on for graduate work at a very reputable university, where she was enjoying continued progress and some wonderful and important solo opportunities.<br><br>She anxiously told me in that first telephone conversation that she had been in final rehearsals for a major opera production in which she had been cast in a leading role and that she was preparing for one of her graduate recitals. She said that the realization of how she was being blessed had brought her to a point where she had consciously rededicated her ability and opportunities to sing to the Lord for his glory and the furthering of his work. But then something she hardly expected occurred.<br><br>"I've forgotten how to sing," she said. "My voice, especially my high notes, has been taken away from me!" She was devastated.<br><br>She was a singer who sang not just with beautiful tone but with enormous expressive ability and musical accuracy and security as well. A lot of heart and mind there! This was in large measure the means by which she had been defined in the minds of others, and even to some extent in her own mind. How ironic that at the very time she had purposely and consciously rededicated her ability and hard work to the Lord, it all seemed to be taken away. She was heartsick. So much so that--quite naturally--her heart was running away from her power to think, to reason, and then to trust.<br><br>I asked if her testimony of a loving Father in Heaven and an atoning Savior was still strong. At her positive response, I encouraged her to use that testimony as a means to begin reasoning through her painful circumstance. I asked what she would do if she could never sing again. She had trouble facing that thought. I told her that the situation seemed to me to be one where, because of her preparation, she was well into some advanced study in some of those cardinal virtues of life: faith, love, trust, patience, and knowledge of self--including purposes and potentials.<br><br>I said to her, "You were saying, 'Lord, I am ready,' and he, of course, takes that as a cue to initiate you further along the prickly path of spiritual, emotional, soulful progress."<br><br>In subsequent letters I wrote:<br><br><i>You dedicated to Him what you perhaps saw as the most valuable part, the most meaningful facet of you. And what happens? He throws a wrench in the whole consecrating process--or so it might seem. But He knows us. He loves us more than we can even imagine. He is never far away from us, especially when we are suffering. And we can rely on that love and support to sustain us no matter what. Though all else fails, though our fondest hopes and plans be dashed, though we be rejected or refused by the world or any who inhabit it, He is there. Though we feel devastated, He sees the lovable, beautiful, perfect facet at our core that is worthy of His sustenance and supportive grace. If we can sense His love, His concern, His attentive presence, then we can be at peace just putting one foot in front of another, attempting to walk uprightly before Him, willing to submit to all that He asks, being quick to set our path aright when we come to our senses and realize we have strayed, willing to sacrifice our talents or intentions or desires or position or a friendship or a son or . . . or</i>. . .<i>or, all because we know that everything will work to our best good in the end, that all loose ends will find reconciliation in Him.</i><br><br><i>Perhaps this is not just a two-week or two-year trial period for you. Perhaps you never will sing again, which would be difficult for many of us to understand. But perhaps this is a rough and irritating grain of sand that has been placed into that most tender, sensitive, essential part of you. Perhaps this is a struggle in your life that will continue to cause you a heavy heart and many sorrowful tears. If this all be the case, I would challenge you to use your bright mind, enormous energy, and vivid imagination to make your suffering fruitful. You can seize the opportunity to learn to be very sensitive and receptive to the Comforter and all the ministering angels that Father in Heaven puts into our paths.</i><br><br><i>You can use the experience to discover what the Lord wants you to know about yourself, and the full measure of your creation. Then you can learn to get more outside yourself to a greater appreciation of others, especially their dignity in the face of their own struggles and heartaches. And because of your own suffering, you can be a mortal "ministering angel" to their needs. Because of your suffering, you will know what to do and how to do it. And through such positive fruits of your sorrow, and by the atoning grace of the Savior, that painful, hard grain inside you can be coated again and again by your righteous efforts until the day you can place a beautiful, precious pearl into His sacred hand, all in appreciation for His atoning sacrifice and all He has taught you.</i><br><br>We all have felt, just as did this wonderful young woman, the natural inclination to allow the heart to overbalance or sometimes even exclusively rule our behavior when we are desolate. Or we have felt the opposite, and just as common situation, where our thinking has closed the heart and is in sole control. I think our lives consist mostly of subtle shifts back and forth between these two situations. This is an interesting micro-reflection of the larger, more dramatic swings back and forth from the objective to the subjective in the history of the humanities. But with us as individuals, the Holy Ghost can touch our minds when the heart is in trouble, or our hearts when the mind has misstepped, so that each can again balance, discipline, and complement the other.<br><br>As we live in but not of the world, our growth will require taking risks dealing with difficult issues such as our own passions or yearnings, our preoccupations or fears. But as we strive to employ both heart and mind, keeping them connected--equally yoked--we can remain open to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. And rather than enduring passively or suffering in unproductive silence, we can remain connected to our creativity and our ability to change and repent, to improvise, to be spontaneous, to make the most and do the most with what we have been given.<br><br>I was so heartened and uplifted as President Hinckley spoke in the concluding session of April conference and shared with us some of the anxiety he was feeling about the broadcast of the<i>60 Minutes</i>segment about the Church to be shown later that evening. It was obvious he was still experiencing misgivings about the risk he had taken to advance the Lord's work. His keen knowledge of whom and what he represents was adding to his apprehension in this dangerous situation. Of course I rejoiced as I saw how successfully he met the situation and how favorably he and the Church were depicted. But of even greater significance to me was our mighty leader asking for our understanding while showing us how to successfully meet the anxiety of challenge and risk with heart and mind.<br><br>There are those times when the Holy Ghost speaks with great force to both mind and heart. Oliver Cowdery--whose story, by the way, includes a long and difficult reconciliation process--desired to share the opportunity to translate the plates. The Lord, in preparing him to do so, said: "Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2).<br><br>It is a deep, spiritual experience when such inspiration comes to us--when we are told in both our mind and in our heart. Such an experience is to be treasured up and not spoken of lightly or often. Notwithstanding my strong feelings to the contrary, I have been repeatedly prompted to share with you a personal experience of this nature that is sacred to me but helpful, I trust, to someone else just now.<br><br>In 1991, as the world marked the 150th year since the death of Mozart, the BYU Singers were invited by the Israel Chamber Orchestra to join them for a series of all-Mozart concerts performed throughout their country. We faced enormous opposition as we were preparing for the trip. We thought for a long while that the Kuwaiti-Iranian conflict had finished all plans for the trip. But as that conflict ended, President Lee told us to proceed with faith and confidence.<br><br>We arrived in Israel with great excitement and anticipation and found, much to my chagrin, that the greatest conflict we were to meet was a conflict with the orchestra itself. This is a professional orchestra, made up of sophisticated musicians, most of whom have immigrated to Israel from Western and Eastern Europe, Russia, and the United States. I am sure they were grumbling to themselves as this totally unknown, probably inexperienced choral conductor from a department of music of one of those American universities was introduced at the first of our two rehearsals. To make matters worse, the orchestra had been trained to play with a delayed attack, coming after the ictus of the conductor's beat. That means that rather than playing at the point where my conducting pattern would create the beat, they would slightly delay the sound. I have observed and been puzzled by conductors who work this way and<i>was</i>inexperienced when it came to that sort of music-making.<br><br>Although the attitude of the orchestra changed noticeably as they heard the musical preparation and sound of our choir, the rehearsal was riddled with precision problems that were totally unacceptable in any music, but doubly so in Mozart, where precision of articulation, dynamic shifts, attacks, and releases is elemental to the music's sound and style. Though the music had held together generally, I left that rehearsal sick at heart. What was I going to do?<br><br>We were the orchestra's guests in the country. We knew of the delicate relationship of our Church, particularly the university's Jerusalem Center, and the Israeli government. We were on a mission to build goodwill. We had been told by then Elder Hunter that our mission was not to harvest, probably not even to plant, but to clear away a few more stones. And I did not want to start throwing verbal stones at members of that orchestra and impede our greater purpose for being there.<br><br>We were lodging at the Jerusalem Center because the Gulf War had forced cancellation of the Semester Abroad Program that season. I spent most of that night standing at the window of the room where my wife and I were staying, looking out over the Old City wondering what more I should have done to prepare and praying earnestly for the right way to approach our last rehearsal the following morning.<br><br>Morning came, and when Jan was ready to go up to breakfast, I told her to go without me, that I wanted to fast. After she had left, my heart was increasingly heavy, and I knew I had to speak my anxiety aloud. I walked over to my bed, and as I knelt down, even before I could address Father in Heaven, two words were spoken forcefully and simultaneously to my mind and to my heart: "Be strong."<br><br>"But be courteous," I added of my own accord.<br><br>And then the words came a second time, as forcefully as before: "Be strong."<br><br>I knew then and know now that this was a great blessing, given not so much for me as for the small contribution toward the unfolding of a very large work. On the bus from Jerusalem down to Tel Aviv, Jan squeezed my hand and asked what I was going to do. "Be strong," I answered. As we began that last rehearsal, I stated my expectation as clearly and as firmly as I could. The orchestra understood, and with only the need for small reminders, we found the precision, the musicality, the greater communication we all sought.<br><br>"Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind" (D&amp;amp;C 64:34). Only with heart and mind working together--or, in more common language, only with a broken heart and a contrite spirit--can we come to that state of serenity that Paul calls a peace "which passeth all understanding." But listen to the way Paul communicates this promise: "And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:7).<br><br>Several years ago I encountered an old Shaker hymn that in text and music is a stunning example of the very sort of life made possible as mind and heart are combined in faith and testimony to meet and rise above the clamor and woes of the world. The text evidences a heart and a mind that are meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to the Lord. The text possesses a directness and fervor that invoke a nobility in the pursuit of righteousness. The text is borne to mind and heart by an arresting melody, seemingly shaped or worn by lifetimes of tears and suffering. Yet it is a melody out of whose perfection in design emerges a sense of comfort and peace.<br><br>In closing I offer you an arrangement of this exquisite hymn taped two years ago by the Brigham Young University Singers, together with my testimony, which I bear in the name of Jesus Christ, that priesthood power is real; that Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer; that his gospel is true; and that as we strive to live it with heart and mind, our might and strength will be focused and magnified.<br><br>The music shall be my<i>Amen.</i><br><br><i>"How Can I Keep from Singing"</i><br><i>My life flows on in endless song;</i><br><i>Above earth's lamentation</i><br><i>I hear the real though far-off hymn</i><br><i>That hails a new creation.</i><br><br><i>Through all the tumult and the strife,</i><br><i>I hear that music ringing;</i><br><i>It sounds an echo in my soul:</i><br><i>How can I keep from singing.</i><br><br><i>When tyrants tremble sick with fear</i><br><i>And hear their death-knells ringing,</i><br><i>When friends rejoice both far and near,</i><br><i>How can I keep from singing.</i><br><br><i>In prison cell or dungeon vile</i><br><i>Our thoughts to them are winging,</i><br><i>When friends by shame are undefiled,</i><br><i>How can I keep from singing.</i><br><br><i>What if my joys and comforts die,</i><br><i>I know that Truth is living.</i><br><i>What though the darkness 'round me close?</i><br><i>Still Truth its light is giving.</i><br><br><i>No storm can shake my inmost calm</i><br><i>While to that Rock I'm clinging;</i><br><i>Since Love is Lord of heav'n and earth:</i><br><i>How can I keep from singing.</i><br><br><i>I lift my eyes, the cloud grows thin,</i><br><i>I see the blue above it.</i><br><i>And day by day this pathway smooths,</i><br><i>Since first I learned to love it.</i><br><br><i>The peace from love makes fresh my heart,</i><br><i>A song of hope is springing.</i><br><i>All things are mine since Truth I've found:</i><br><i>How can I keep from singing.</i><br><br><i>Ronald Staheli was a professor of music when this devotional address was given at BYU on 18 June 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> in Adversity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, this is indeed an honor to be back at BYU. It is an honor to be seated next to your president. I have had the opportunity of working with him, not only as he served as Presiding Bishop but also as a member of the Quorums of the Seventy. You are greatly blessed to have President Merrill J. Bateman as the president of this university. I am honored today to have our family here. We are lacking two of our sons, but the rest of the family is here with us. I see in the audience a number of you who were missionaries in Brazil when we served together there. Could I see just how many of you here were serving as missionaries when we were there together? It is good to see you here. I am honored to know that President Helvecio Martins, who served with me in the Brazilian Area Presidency, is seated in the audience. He is a man I have learned to love deeply and respect greatly.<br><br>Sister Hillam and I have great memories of BYU. When I returned from my first mission, we dated here at BYU for a year and were married at the end of the school year. In fact, we were married on a Thursday, and my wife, Carol, graduated on Friday. On Saturday morning I had to report to work on a farm, and so our honeymoon, I guess you could say, was her graduation at BYU. She always reminds me that she has not had a honeymoon yet, and no matter where we go, no matter how lovely a place it is, she always says, "Well, this isn't the honeymoon yet."<br><br>Not too long ago a lady came to my office to explain to me all of the problems that she was having in her life. Basically, she said, "But, why me? Why now? Why so many problems? Why is the Lord chastising me so?"<br><br>I would like to give you my answers to some of those questions. Obviously, I cannot discuss all the details, but I would like you to think with me on this matter. Of course, some of the misfortunes we have we bring on ourselves because of our unwise decisions. Because of things we do not do well, we suffer the consequences. However, we cannot seem to explain some misfortunes; some problems just seem to happen. It is those problems that I would like to talk about today.<br><br>After Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, the Lord spoke to them:<br><br><i>And Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.</i><br><br><i>And he gave unto them commandments, that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him: I know not, save the Lord commanded me.</i><br><br><i>And then the angel spake, saying:</i>This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father,<i>which is full of grace and truth.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.</i>[Moses 5:4–8; emphasis added]<br><br>The phrase that I would like to recall now is "This thing is a similitude." Looking up the word<i>similitude</i>in the dictionary, we see that it means similarity, resemblance, likeness, one closely resembling another, perceptible likeness, like unto. The Lord then told Adam and Eve that this would be something similar to, that there was a resemblance, that there was a likeness unto the sacrifice of the Savior.<br><br>I would like to go now to Abraham and Isaac, to the time when the Lord appeared and gave a commandment to Abraham:<br><br><i>And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham</i>[the word<i>tempt</i>meaning God tested him, he tried him, or put him to proof],<i>and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.</i><br><br><i>And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</i>[Genesis 22:1–2]<br><br>Can you imagine how this must have stricken Abraham in his heart? "The son I love so much, and I am to take him and I am to sacrifice him and then to make of him a burnt offering!" Sometimes we may think of that and say, "Well, that is the way it was." But we must think of it as Abraham and a son that he loved dearly. Some of you may have sons and daughters. You know how that would hurt--to think that you were to offer him or her as a sacrifice. But the next verse tells me something of Abraham:<br><br><i>And Abraham rose up early in the morning ..., and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</i>[Genesis 22:3]<br><br>Abraham was a very obedient, trusting servant of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>As I continue, you might see some of the similarities between Abraham offering his son and our Heavenly Father offering his Son:<br><br><i>Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here ... ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</i><br><br><i>And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood</i>[you see, they had to carry the fire in a bucket or in some container; they didn't have the matches that we are familiar with]:<i>but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</i><br><br><i>And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</i>[Genesis 22:4–8]<br><br>Can you imagine what Abraham was feeling? In the scriptures it almost sounds somewhat mechanical. I can almost imagine that when Abraham answered, he answered with tears in his voice: "God will provide himself a lamb."<br><br><i>And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</i><br><br><i>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</i><br><br><i>And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</i><br><br><i>And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</i>[Genesis 22:9–12]<br><br>If you were to ask the world why the Lord asked Abraham to do that, they probably would say it was to test his obedience. The world would not know that it was in similitude of God and his Son, and we would not know it if it were not for the Book of Mormon. Jacob tells us that Abraham was "obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a<i>similitude</i>of God and his Only Begotten Son" (Jacob 4:5; emphasis added). Abraham had an experience that was almost the same as that of God and his Son, Jesus Christ. Abraham knew perhaps more than any person what God the Father was going through and what was happening to Jesus, his Son.<br><br>I would like to go now to a vision of the Prophet Joseph F. Smith. You recall that section 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants records a vision given to President Smith. He was pondering about the gospel being preached to the people after the Crucifixion of the Savior.<br><br><i>While I was thus engaged, my mind reverted to the writings of the apostle Peter, to the primitive saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the gospel had been preached after the crucifixion of the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138:5]<br><br>President Smith saw the people that lived after the Crucifixion, after the sacrifice of animals was discontinued. Here is what he recorded:<br><br><i>As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.</i><br><br><i>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138:11–12]<br><br>These were they who had lived on this earth after the Crucifixion.<br><br><i>And who had offered sacrifice in the</i>similitude<i>of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138:13; emphasis added]<br><br>We have seen three different references to similitude: Adam and Eve, when they were commanded to offer up animal sacrifice; Abraham, in similitude, being willing to offer up his son Isaac; and the Saints in the primitive Church, who are in a special, blessed condition because of their sacrifice in similitude.<br><br>What are the sacrifices that might be in similitude of the Atonement, the most important event that has ever happened in the history of all the universe? Christ suffered more than we can contemplate. He descended below anything that we know. He took "upon him the pain and the sicknesses of his people." He suffered physically, mentally, and spiritually. There is no suffering that we know of that the Savior did not know, that he did not feel, that he did not pass through during that time (see Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>We will have opportunities to be called upon to suffer. There will be times when we will have feelings of hurt and pain--physical and mental as well as spiritual--and then we will know what adversity is, and we will know a little better what Jesus Christ might have suffered, and we will have done in<i>similitude</i>that which Jesus Christ did.<br><br>What does this mean to us? We will know Jesus better. It also means that when we are called on to suffer, when we have afflictions in our lives, we will know that we are not alone. The Savior has already passed through those times. As we partake of the sacrament, we might be able to understand the sufferings of the Savior as we remember our own challenges, pains, hurts, and adversities. We might be able to understand that in<i>similitude</i>it is somewhat the same as what Abraham, Isaac, Adam and Eve, and Joseph F. Smith understood.<br><br>I had an occasion one time as a stake president to have a man come to me and tell me of some serious things that had happened in his life. He knew that he had not done well. He knew that a disciplinary council should be held. And he knew that it would happen. The discipline was determined, and the man was absolutely faithful. He complied with every condition imposed by that council. As time passed, he came in and we visited. It was not easy for him. The Lord was training him, he was preparing him. This man knew what adversity was. He turned to the scriptures. He found comfort as he read of the Savior and others who had passed through those periods of adversity, and then he knelt in mighty prayer. He went to our Father in Heaven and pled with him during those times of anguish. The day finally came when he was baptized again, and he had his blessings restored. Then came an experience that I will never forget. As we met one more time, he said, with tears in his eyes, "I used to know about the Savior. I used to read about him; now I<i>know</i>him. I<i>know</i>Jesus Christ. He<i>is</i>my Redeemer." I don't know of any person that I have met who knew the Savior better. The only thing I felt bad about is that he had to go through all that to know him. I would pray that in our activities and in our trials we would not have to go that far to get to know the Savior.<br><br>In speaking of adversity, could I just tell you now that it is one of those things that is going to happen in your life and in my life. We are all going to pass through adversity. It is a requirement. I have often asked myself who really is going to be in the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ, to live eternally with them and with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and with Nephi and Alma and Abinadi and Mormon and Moroni, and with Joseph Smith and many of the great Saints who sacrificed as they walked across the plains to these valleys in the West. Who really is going to be with them? I have determined it is not going to be those who sit doing nothing. I guess we get in the habit of calling them "couch potatoes." I don't think it is going to be them. I know it is not. Let me read what the Lord told us:<br><br><i>Yet I will own them, and they shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:3–4]<br><br>The Lord is talking about the members of his church. We will be tried as was Abraham. "For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified" (D&amp;amp;C 101:5).<br><br><i>My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 136:31]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we all will have that opportunity. The Lord is going to tutor us. He is going to train us and he is going to prepare us. Elder Maxwell said, "God, as a loving Father, will stretch our souls at times. The soul is like a violin string: it makes music only when it is stretched. (Eric Hoffer.) God will tutor us by trying us<i>because</i>He loves us, not because of indifference!" (Neal A. Maxwell,<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979], p. 28; emphasis in original). We will know of God's love when we have that tutoring.<br><br>Now, when the trials come, what should we do? First of all, we must resist murmuring. We must not criticize or rise up against our Heavenly Father. We should study the scriptures so that we know the doctrine and receive from it that comfort that only our Heavenly Father can give. As the man I mentioned who knew Jesus Christ, we should pray mightily. We should be on our knees constantly so that we can receive from our Heavenly Father the assurance that this is part of our trial. Then we should seek to recognize our need to be tutored. We do not know what Heavenly Father has in store for us.<br><br>I recall a little story that Sister Hillam used to tell:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace.</i>[George MacDonald, cited in C. S. Lewis,<i>Mere Christianity</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1960), p. 160]<br><br>Elder Hugh B. Brown shared a story that illustrates that God knows best:<br><br><i>I was living up in Canada. I had purchased a farm. It was run-down. I went out one morning and saw a currant bush. It had grown up over six feet high. It was going all to wood. There were no blossoms and no currants. I was raised on a fruit farm in Salt Lake before we went to Canada, and I knew what ought to happen to that currant bush. So I got some pruning shears and went after it, and I cut it down, and pruned it, and clipped it back until there was nothing left but a little clump of stumps. It was just coming daylight, and I thought I saw on top of each of these little stumps what appeared to be a tear, and I thought the currant bush was crying. ... I looked at it, and smiled, and said, "What are you crying about?" You know, I thought I heard that currant bush talk. And I thought I heard it say this: "How could you do this to me? ... I thought you were the gardener here." ... I said, "Look, little currant bush, I</i>am<i>the gardener here, and I know what I want you to be. ... And some day, little currant bush, when you are laden with fruit, you are going to say, 'Thank you, Mr. Gardener, for loving me enough to cut me down, for caring enough about me to hurt me. Thank you, Mr. Gardener."</i>[Hugh B. Brown, "The Currant Bush,"<i>New Era,</i>January 1973, pp. 14–15; emphasis in original]<br><br>I pray that we will think upon the Savior and know we are not alone. He passed that way before, and he will give us that comfort. I pray that we will understand what the Lord taught the Prophet Joseph Smith. You recall that the Prophet had been in Liberty Jail for many months, including cold winter months. Much of the time he was under a part of the jail while passing through this tribulation. We know that the ceiling was not high enough that he could stand erect. He had to walk bent over. There are many other things we could say about the adversities he faced. He was away from the Church, away from the Saints, away from his family, and he was not allowed to have visitors constantly or to be about his Father in Heaven's business. But the Lord had the Prophet where he could speak to him. I think some of the most glorious revelations were given to the Prophet at that time. The revelation on leadership (see D&amp;amp;C 121:34–46) is probably the most priceless document we have on leadership.<br><br>The Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in perils among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</i><br><br><i>If thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</i><br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all.</i>Art thou greater than he? [D&amp;amp;C 122:5–8; emphasis added]<br><br>I pray, brothers and sisters, that when the adversities come--and, as I have mentioned, they will--we might respond to our Father in Heaven, saying, "I am not sure why I am having this adversity at this time or at this intensity. I know I will have something to learn. Help me to endure. Just help me to endure this trial that I have." Then maybe, like the Savior, we will say: "Not my will, but thine" (Luke 22:42). I pray, brothers and sisters, that we might always be able to remember: It is "for thy good. ... Art thou greater than he?"<br><br>I pray that the Lord's blessings will be with us as we are proven, as we are tried, as we go into that crucible of adversity, that we will know there is always going to be the brighter day, and the brightest day will be the day when, if we stay true and faithful and we understand, we can enter into the presence of God the Father and Jesus Christ. How glorious it would be if we could have the Judge who will judge us all, Jesus Christ, stand at our side, being our advocate, our defender, our attorney with our Father in Heaven, and have Jesus Christ say to the Father, "Have mercy on him. He defended my name, he was valiant, he was one of my servants. Have mercy on him, let him live with us throughout the eternities."<br><br>This I pray, and I ask it humbly, in the name of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Harold G.

<br>
The history books record that in the year A.D. 1415 a battle was waged in the field of Agincourt between two great nations--England and France. Historians have argued over the cause of the battle, but our earliest chroniclers record that Henry V, King of England (A.D. 1387–1422), was seeking to regain his title to the land of Salek. Perhaps the most popular piece of literature depicting this war is Shakespeare's play<i>King Henry the Fifth.</i>Therein Henry gathers together a band of men who leave home and family to rally around their king. Their expedition leads them to France, where they meet with some initial success, easily capturing the town of Harfleur. However, the constant forays, the inclement weather, and the lack of proper rest all take their toll on the small army. At a time when they are ready to retreat and recuperate in Calais, the French en masse decide to confront the Englishmen.<br><br>Try and imagine how the Englishmen must have felt. Sick, exhausted, and looking for a dry place to sleep, they were instead being asked to confront a force that outnumbered them five to one! Remember, this wasn't the form of warfare where you sit in a machine and push buttons; this type of warfare required foes to meet each other face-to-face and conquer through human rather than mechanical strength. As the appointed time of dawn approached, Shakespeare describes the anxieties that both camps experienced. The French leaders are depicted (remember that Shakespeare is an Englishman!) as confidently anticipating an easy victory--concerned only that they have had to wait so long for the commencement of hostilities. In contrast, in describing the English camp, Shakespeare shows the young king (in disguise) moving among his men trying to determine his followers' commitment to him. Then, as the night draws to a close, we see the king on his knees in prayer giving an account of his royal stewardship and imploring divine aid to accompany him and his men in the upcoming battle.<br><br>[A video clip from Kenneth Branagh's movie<i>Henry V</i>was shown.]<br><br>The English nobles were concerned about their ability to face the formidable French force, and in this play we see the young king's response to their concerns. I have always been impressed by these events. Henry understood well the enormity of what he was asking of his men. He knew that, in terms of numbers, he needed every one of those Englishmen to follow him into battle; but he also knew that a victory would require much more than physical numbers. The fact that they were already outnumbered meant that each one of his soldiers needed to fight with a will and a strength that only come with a personal sense of commitment, both to him as their king and also to the cause in which they were engaged.<br><br>Henry, therefore, rallies his men together with a stirring speech that even Captain Moroni would have been proud of! As I have contemplated this speech, particularly in relation to the ensuing battle, I have been impressed by the criteria that Henry stipulates for those who want to join him on the battlefield. He wanted committed rather than compelled followers, and there are four lines that, at least for me, grasp the essence of what he expected from his men.<br><br>1. "He which hath no stomach to this fight, Let him depart" (4.3.35–36). Henry expected his followers to be committed to the cause. Later he says that "all things are ready, if our minds be so" (4.3.71).<br><br>2. "We would not die in that man's company / That fears his fellowship to die with us" (4.3.38–39). He also fully expected that each man who entered that battle would be willing to give his life for his king and comrades.<br><br>3. "We are but warriors for the working-day" (4.3.109). Henry recognized that his army consisted of a motley group of ordinary men who had come together from all walks of life, but he also recognized that the cause they were engaged in would transcend such differences and transform them into men of extraordinary abilities.<br><br>4. "And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!" (4.3.132). Most important of all, Henry recognized that after doing all that they could, ultimately they had to place themselves in the hands of God. Now that is not always an easy thing to do, but it is the most important part of being a successful follower.<br><br>Each one of these statements depicts qualities that are timeless in nature. Henry may have required them from a heterogeneous band of Englishmen in A.D. 1415, but in doing so he only articulated qualities that leaders throughout history have expected in their disciples.<br><br>In another time, and in another place, another king--the King of Kings--also invited his fellow countrymen to join with him in a campaign that would have far-reaching effects. Unlike Henry V, however, this king was not motivated by the desire for lands but rather by the desire for souls. Instead of marching through the valleys and fields of France, he roamed through the hills and plains of Galilee and Judaea. Of course, you all know of whom I speak: Jesus of Nazareth. Elder James E. Talmage, in his book<i>Jesus the Christ,</i>wrote:<br><br><i>To the student of history this Man among men stands first, foremost, and alone, as a directing personality in the world's progression. Mankind has never produced a leader to rank with Him. Regarded solely as a historic personage He is unique. Judged by the standard of human estimation, Jesus of Nazareth is supreme among men by reason of the excellence of His personal character, the simplicity, beauty, and genuine worth of His precepts, and the influence of His example and doctrines in the advancement of the race.</i>[James E. Talmage,<i>Jesus the Christ</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1979), p. 2]<br><br>In mortality, Christ lived the perfect life and thus set the example for the rest of us of how life can and should be lived. In doing so, however, Jesus set high expectations for those who would be his followers. Discipleship was never intended to be a "free-ride" affair. He expected his followers to live a life that reflected their commitment to him and to his teachings. Among the Gospels this is particularly evident in Matthew, where the relationship of works to righteousness is one of the central aspects of his writings.<br><br>Today I would like to discuss some of the costs involved in being a disciple of Jesus Christ. Just as Henry V required committed discipleship, so did the Savior. In mortality, Christ absorbed the full brunt of persecution, but he knew that once he was gone, his disciples would have to bear the burden of that opposition. For them to successfully do so, they needed to be committed disciples. You and I need to constantly strive for the same. It was never easy to be such during the early days of the Church, either in the meridian of time or in the last dispensation. But in times of peace and prosperity, it is sometimes easy to fall into the trap of complacency, lulled to sleep by the peaceful thoughts of "She'll be right, mate!" (to use an Australian colloquial expression) or, as Nephi prophesied that many would say in the last days, "All is well in Zion" (2 Nephi 28:21). But can you imagine the outcome of the Battle of Agincourt if Henry V's men had had that attitude? Spiritually speaking, can we expect a different result if we have that type of attitude about our personal discipleship? Just as Henry V required certain characteristics of those who were to follow him into battle, so, too, did Christ expect a similar level of commitment from his disciples in Galilee--and two thousand years later, he still requires it of those who claim discipleship.<br><h2><b>1. "He which hath no stomach to this fight, / Let him depart."</b></h2><br>As I have thought about this requirement, my mind has turned repeatedly to the kind of commitment that Jesus himself displayed to "the cause." I think that it is instructive for us to reflect on that for a moment before addressing his expectation of his disciples. Immediately after Jesus sought out John the Baptist on the banks of the Jordan River, we read that Jesus was "led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil" (see Matthew 4:1–4). Now, the Joseph Smith Translation informs us that the Spirit took Jesus into the wilderness so that he could be with God, not with the devil, but I would suggest that, even so, the interchange between the Lord and Satan was still crucial to Matthew's portrayal of Christ's ministry. Matthew is unique among the authors of the Gospels in that he is the only one who gives the elongated version of the temptation narrative and then follows it almost immediately with the calling of Christ's senior apostles--Peter and Andrew, and James and John.<sup>1</sup>Given the meticulous way that Matthew has constructed the first half of his book, I do not think that the placement of these two events is happenstance. Instead, in the account of Jesus' temptations we see the Savior rejecting the lure of physical appetites, rejecting the desire for authentication by heavenly displays, and rejecting the enticement of power.<sup>2</sup>As Elder Jeffrey Holland has noted:<br><br><i>Denial and restraint are also part of divine preparation. . . . The rewards will come by and by. But even the Son of God must wait. The Redeemer who would never bestow cheap grace on others was not likely to ask for any himself.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "The Inconvenient Messiah,"<i>Brigham Young University 1981–82 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1982), pp. 79–80; also,<i>Ensign,</i>February 1984, p. 70]<br><br>Christ has shown that his first priority in life is his mission. That must come first at all costs, and he will expect no less from those who follow him.<br><br>Therefore, after this temptation scene Matthew has Jesus travel quickly to Galilee, where he says to Peter and Andrew, "Come, follow me" (Matthew 4:19, my translation), and calls John and James. In giving this command, Jesus is not just asking the disciples to leave behind their boats and nets, or their father; these things are symbols for a much greater level of commitment. Zebedee represents the power that gave James and John mortality. The fishing equipment represents the means of sustaining that mortal life. In asking his disciples to leave behind these things, Jesus is asking them to leave behind the cares of mortality and journey with him on another plane of existence. To follow such a command takes more than curiosity on the part of followers--it requires commitment. Notice how Matthew has the two sets of brothers respond "immediately" (the Greek word<i>euthus</i>is the same in both instances); they left what they were doing "and followed him" (Matthew 4:18–22).<br><br>The response of these four disciples is in sharp contrast to the rich young man who came to ask Jesus about gaining eternal life. He had obviously led a good life and had obeyed the commandments from the time of his youth (see Matthew 19:20). But when Jesus instructs him to "sell [all that he has], . . . give to the poor, . . . and come and follow me," his response is very different from that of the Galilean fishermen. Matthew declares that "he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions" (Matthew 19:21–22). This young man apparently wanted to be a disciple, but only up to a point. His possessions were more important than discipleship. For Peter, Andrew, James, and John it was just the opposite. So, in each of our lives there will also come times--probably more than once--when we are confronted with the decision to choose between our discipleship and the things of the world. The circumstances surrounding such decisions will all be unique for each of us. The things that tempt me might not tempt you and vice versa, but that does not negate the seriousness of each of the temptations, and each of us will need to make a choice. "He which hath no stomach to this fight, Let him depart."<br><br>The Savior and his church may not formally ask us to leave the kingdom because we make choices similar to those of the rich young man, but let's not forget that he was the one who went away, not the Savior. The reality is that far more people drift away into inactivity and hence distance themselves from the blessings of the Church than those who formally lose the blessings of their membership. It is the little choices that you and I make on a daily basis that will determine our response to Christ's invitation to "Come, follow me."<br><h2><b>2. "We would not die in that man's company / That fears his fellowship to die with us."</b></h2><br>Clearly, point two is an extension of the first. History tells us, and the sacrament reminds us each week, that the Son of God was not afraid to make that sacrifice. All four of the Gospels reinforce that Jesus knew his mission would ultimately lead to the cross. Just after Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi, Jesus tells his disciples that "he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day" (Matthew 16:21). Peter, in his characteristic exuberance, "rebukes" the Savior, who in turn replies by saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men" (Matthew 16:23). These are strong words--especially to a man who has just been praised for confessing Jesus' messiahship! But in a sense Peter was acting just as Satan before him had done in trying to turn Jesus away from the fulfillment of his mission. Having reprimanded Peter, Jesus goes on to teach his disciples about the cost of discipleship.<br><br><i>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</i><br><br><i>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</i><br><br><i>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</i>[Matthew 16:24–26]<br><br>What does it mean to "deny oneself"? The Greek verb<i>aparneomai</i>is the reflexive form of the same verb used when Peter later denies Jesus three times (see Matthew 26:69–75). Thus it has to do with "disowning somebody" or "disclaiming any connection with somebody" (see John C. Fenton,<i>The Gospel of St. Matthew</i>[Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1963], p. 273; see also<i>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</i>ed. Gerhard Kittel and trans. and ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993], s.v. by Heinrich Schlier). The condition of discipleship is therefore the breaking of every link that ties a person to their self. It is only when we can totally give ourselves over to Christ that we can truly be his disciples. That means being doers of the word and not just listeners. The eminent New Testament scholar W. D. Davies has noted the following regarding this Matthean passage:<br><br><i>Our text drives home the point that the disciples--and, implicitly, all believers--must not passively observe their Lord and what he does. They are not to be seated spectators watching from the grandstand.</i>. . .<i>Rather must they themselves enter the arena after their Lord. For Matthew, Jesus is not a substitute but a leader. He does not do something for those who do nothing. Instead he commands, "Follow me"</i>(4.18–22; 9.9).<i>This authoritative call leaves no room for considerations of convenience or even self-preservation. Discipleship is a doing of what is right, no matter how irksome the privations, no matter how great the dangers.</i>[W. D. Davies and Dale C. Allison,<i>A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew,</i>vol. 2 of<i>The International Critical Commentary on the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments</i>(Edinburgh: T&amp;amp;T Clark, 1991), p. 681]<br><br>Tradition tells us that Peter, James, Paul, Thomas, Andrew, and many others paid the ultimate price of discipleship. St. Ignatius begged the Roman church not to try and save him from the wild beasts, for it was through the beasts that he could "truly [be] a disciple of Jesus Christ" (Ignatius, Epistle to the Romans 4:2, vol. 1 of<i>The Apostolic Fathers,</i>trans. Kirsopp Lake, in<i>The Loeb Classical Library,</i>ed. G. P. Goold, vol. 9 [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1970], p. 231). But history also tells us that during periods of persecution there were also those who decided to deny their discipleship (see Pliny,<i>Letter to Trajan,</i>3–6). What made the difference between these two groups of people? In both camps it is the same "cause" with the same "cost." It appears that for some the price was just too much to pay. "We would not die in that man's company / That fears his fellowship to die with us."<br><br>Given our present circumstances, the majority of us will not be asked to make the ultimate sacrifice for our discipleship. For the most part, the word<i>martyr</i>is something associated with our history books rather than with our journals. The original Greek meaning of<i>martyr (martus),</i>however, was not someone who "died" for a cause, but someone who was a "witness" for a cause. Under Christian influence it then took on the former meaning, but perhaps the latter is something that we should each consider for our day and age. We need to be a martyr in the sense that we stand up to be counted as witnesses of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the reality of his atoning sacrifice. We need to witness that the Book of Mormon is a second witness of Jesus Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's mouthpiece on earth today. That witness does not need to be made in the Colosseum, but it does need to be made in our testimony meetings and in our homes with our families, our friends, our acquaintances, and with all who enter our sphere of contact.<br><h2><b>3. "We are but warriors for the working-day."</b></h2><br>Jesus was a craftsman. To the people of Nazareth he was the son of a craftsman. He called fishermen and publicans to be his disciples. He ministered to the blind, the lame, the lepers, the demoniacs, the sinners, and all of those who found themselves outcasts from society. The Pharisees just could not understand why he would do such a thing (see Matthew 9:10–11). Sometimes he taught in the synagogues or at the temple, but mostly he taught on a mountain, on the beach, sitting in a boat, or anywhere that he could find people to listen to him. In terms of social, economic, or political status, he was insignificant, but, when we look at the influence that he has had upon the world during the past 2,000 years, nothing is further from the truth. It has been said that<br><br><i>Jesus never wrote a book. Yet many libraries would be required to accommodate the books that have been written about him. He never wrote a song. Yet he has furnished the theme of more songs than all the songwriters combined. He never founded a college. Yet all the schools in the world put together cannot boast the number of students who have studied under him.</i>[author unknown]<br><br>Jesus was indeed a "warrior for the working-day," and his earliest disciples were likewise. Matthew 18 twice compares the Christian community to children by describing them as the "little ones" (verses 10, 14). And yet from this group of "little ones" came the Peters, the Marks, the Johns, and the Marys of the early Church--men and women who dedicated their lives to serving their master, their community, and their neighbors! Jesus never expected any of his followers to be perfect when they first became his disciples. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell once said, "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability!" (Neal A. Maxwell, "It's Service, Not Status, That Counts,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1975, p. 7). Isn't that exactly what happened with Jesus' early disciples? Peter, Andrew, James, and John probably were not qualified to be apostles when the Lord first called them on the Sea of Galilee. In fact, Peter, James, and John all made mistakes that elicited rebukes from the Savior, but the Lord knew of their potential and was willing to work with them. In his hands they became tremendous tools to take the gospel to the world. They did not give up because they made a few mistakes. Instead they learned from them and took counsel from the Lord. As a result, ordinary people with an extraordinary mission accomplished supraordinary feats. So each one of us can, with confidence, declare that "we are but warriors for the working-day" and still make tremendous contributions to the building of the kingdom of God.<br><h2><b>4. "And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!"</b></h2><br>Finally, now, the fourth quote from the St. Crispian speech. I think it is important to note that these were the last words Henry spoke before entering into the battle. Many times, after we have done all that we can, we have to just sit back and have faith that we are in God's hands. This was a difficult concept for the early disciples to grasp. We have already mentioned one instance where Peter found it difficult to accept that it was God's will that Jesus should die. Another example is the incident when the disciples were with Jesus in the storm-tossed boat on the Sea of Galilee (see Günther Bornkamm, "The Stilling of the Storm in Matthew," in Günther Bornkamm, Gerhard Barth, and Heinz Joachim Held,<i>Tradition and Interpretation in Matthew</i>[Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1963], pp. 52–57).<br><br><i>And when he</i>[Jesus]<i>was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</i><br><br><i>And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</i><br><br><i>And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</i><br><br><i>And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</i><br><br><i>But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</i>[Matthew 8:23–27]<br><br>Matthew is using this event with a different emphasis than the other synoptic writers. Both Mark and Luke place the story between a series of parables and a series of miracle stories that were performed in Galilee. In these instances, the event is being used to show the power that Jesus had over the physical elements. However, Matthew has a slightly different agenda. In Matthew, the parables don't precede the events in the boat; instead, they are found in chapter 13. The whole of chapter 8 concerns miracles that Jesus performed. This chapter is part of a larger construction whereby Matthew is showing that Jesus is both the Messiah of word and of deed.<sup>3</sup>The Sermon on the Mount in chapters 5–7 attests that Jesus is a Messiah of word, whereas chapters 8 and 9 confirm that he is also a Messiah of deed.<br><br>Just prior to Jesus' entering into the boat with his disciples, Matthew has inserted two short pericopae on discipleship that are not found in Mark and don't come until a chapter later in Luke.<br><br><i>Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.</i><br><br><i>And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</i><br><br><i>And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</i><br><br><i>But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.</i>[Matthew 8:18–22]<br><br>Notice that both of these conversations have to do with the cost of discipleship. It is never an easy thing to follow Jesus; to do so we must often give up comforts that we take for granted and we must be willing to put the kingdom before societal expectations. Only then can the disciple enter into the boat (i.e., the Church) with Jesus.<br><br>"And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea" (Matthew 8:24). The Greek word here for<i>tempest</i>is<i>seismos,</i>which means "earthquake"! It is not the word used in either the Markan or Lukan accounts, which use<i>lailaps,</i>a word meaning "tempest" or "furious storm." But<i>seismos</i>is regularly used in the New Testament to refer to the trials associated with the last days (e.g., Matthew 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11; Revelation 6:12). Therefore, Matthew's choice of<i>seismos</i>would have reinforced his message that discipleship will not be a smooth ride. Instead it will entail some earth-shattering experiences that each disciple will have to weather. Notice though, that when the seismic activity was at its peak, the disciples in the boat (most of whom were veteran seamen) panicked--another indication of the seriousness of the storm. When they had first embarked, perhaps some of them were expecting a smooth ride across the sea, although as seasoned fishermen many of them must have known of the unpredictability of the Sea of Galilee. The fact that such seasoned veterans turned to the Savior in the midst of the storm confirms its intensity. In pleading for Jesus to save them, Matthew records that the disciples addressing him used the Christological title<i>Lord.</i>This is slightly different from the accounts in Mark and Luke, where the form of address is one of respect but without any Christological overtones (see Mark 4:38, Luke 8:24).<br><br>Mark and Luke both depict Jesus stilling the storm first and then questioning his disciples, but in Matthew, the order is reversed. First he questions their faith, and then he attends to the storm. It is the faith of the disciples that is the center of this event in Matthew. All of this points to the conclusion that, for Matthew, the incident of the stilling of the storm is more than a simple miracle story. Matthew wanted us to see it on another level of interpretation--that of the trials of discipleship. The story shows us that the disciples had not yet fully grasped the power of Jesus' ability to direct earthly events. They certainly had a sense of his ability--otherwise they would not have wakened him--but not quite the faith to say, "And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!" Jesus himself would later say in the Garden of Gethsemane, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39).<br><br>So it must be with each of us. There are often times when the future that we map out for ourselves is not the same as what the Lord has in mind, even though our hopes and dreams may be righteous desires. As a young woman in my twenties, I never anticipated the events that led me down my current path. Studying the scriptures was always something that I enjoyed doing, but I never thought that I would do it formally or that I would come here to America--and I certainly never thought that I would be teaching here at BYU. I thought that by now I would be teaching my own children the gospel of Jesus Christ. Sometimes it is difficult, after having done all in our power, to sit back and say, "And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!" If, however, we are committed in our discipleship to Jesus Christ, then we must be willing to place ourselves in his hands.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, discipleship is not an easy path. It never has been. Elder Holland aptly describes the "inconvenient Messiah" in his devotional about discipleship. Seldom is it convenient to be a disciple. It is seldom convenient to attend and actively participate in all of our Church meetings. It is seldom convenient to fulfill our Church assignments or to study the scriptures. It is almost never convenient to do our home teaching or visiting teaching, to go to the temple, or to love our neighbors as ourselves. And yet these are just some of the costs involved with such discipleship--but, as my mother always told me, "In the end, we find that it was no sacrifice at all!" (author unknown).<br><br>Now, more than ever, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints needs individuals who are committed to dedicated, rather than convenient, discipleship--people who are willing to take upon themselves the Lord's yoke. A yoke by definition entails some restrictions. The yoke forces us to sacrifice some of our individual desires to facilitate a common cause. Even so, it is that very yoke that enables two very individual animals to accomplish tasks greater than either one of them could have achieved individually. Christian discipleship works on the same principle. Discipleship also entails being yoked--therefore sacrificing some of our individual desires--but our yoking partner is Jesus Christ. As a result of that partnership, you and I can accomplish tasks of mortality that would be impossible on our own.<br><br>Today I have tried to remind each of us that it takes commitment to willingly place ourselves in that yoke. As Elder Maxwell so eloquently stated, "The taking of Jesus' yoke upon us constitutes serious [as opposed to "convenient"] discipleship." He then goes on, however, to remind us that "there is no greater calling, no greater challenge, and no greater source of joy--both proximate joy and ultimate joy--than that which is found in the process of discipleship" (Neal A. Maxwell, "Becoming a Disciple,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1996, p. 12). I know that to be true.<br><br>I stand here today and bear to each of you my personal testimony that God lives and that he personally loves each one of us. I have experienced that love in my life, and it has come through most strongly and sweetly when I have been committed in my discipleship, when I have striven to leave behind my 1996 fishing nets and sometimes even my family to come and follow him. May each one of us regularly reevaluate our personal commitment to Jesus Christ and his gospel is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gaye Strathearn was an instructor in the Department of Ancient Scripture at BYU when this devotional address was given on 2 July 1996.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1. Mark simply makes reference to the temptation in passing (Mark 1:12–13). Luke gives a more elongated account but includes a number of narratives such as the preaching in the Nazareth synagogue, casting out an unclean devil, and the healing of Peter's mother-in-law before recounting the calling of Peter, Andrew, James, and John (Luke 4:14–44).<br><br>2. President David O. McKay summarized them in a slightly different way: "(1)<i>a temptation of the appetite;</i>(2)<i>a yielding to the pride and fashion and vanity of those alienated from the things of God;</i>or (3)<i>a gratifying of the passion or a desire for the riches of the world or power among men"</i>("Individual Righteousness, The Strength of the Church,"<i>The Instructor</i>97, no. 9 [September 1962], p. 290; italics in original).<br><br>3. That chapters 5–9 are a literary unit is seen by the nearly identical verses that bracket them. They are introduced by Matthew 4:23: "And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people." The literary unit is then closed with Matthew 9:35: "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."<br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
<br>
Good morning, my brothers and sisters. I am grateful to share my thoughts and testimony with you and thank the administration for this special opportunity.<br><br>I have chosen to speak to you about the powerful influence of families on our lives. President Benson stated that<br><br><i>because of our confidence in the perpetuity of the home and family into the eternities, we build our most elaborate and expensive structures--temples of God--so that man, woman, and their children may be bound together . . . in an everlasting union. . . . There is no other institution that can take the place of the family or fulfill its essential function.</i>[<i>TETB,</i>p. 492]<br><br>I am particularly sensitive to the power of family relations not only from my personal experiences in my own family, but also because of the many consequences of "familying" I am faced with professionally as I focus on helping children with special needs as well as serving as a marriage and family therapist.<br><br>My purpose this morning is to help motivate each of you to reflect once again on the influence your family has had on your life and to have you consider more carefully what effect you will have on the family you create.<br><h2><b>Preparation</b></h2><br>As I prepared for this presentation, I felt impressed not to preach at you or give you a "how-to" lecture. Rather, I felt impressed to bring to you some "lessons of life" your fellow students have experienced in their families.<br><br>One morning this spring a fellow colleague and I had a prayer and then went about the campus to find different students who would be willing to share their "stories" about their growing-up years. We wanted to get a representative sample of gender, age, and cultural backgrounds. Thirteen wonderful students volunteered to be interviewed and videotaped.<br><br>I asked them to respond to the following questions: What do you remember most about your home life? What were some of the lessons you learned from your family that influence you today? What kind of parent do you want to be?<br><br>They have allowed me to share with you this morning a sampling of their responses to these questions. Listen carefully to some of the lessons they have learned in their families.<br><h2><b>Some Lessons Learned</b></h2><br>Margaret related a familiar, yet poignant, dilemma she faced as a young teenager.<br><br><i>Well, when I was fourteen, I had an interesting experience with dating--or, I guess, not dating. I was in ninth grade, which was not in high school at the time. A guy that I liked was a sophomore in high school, which was sort of big-time, and he was also in my ward and I had had a crush on him forever. He asked me to go to this dance at the high school, and I was absolutely thrilled. This was my big chance, and I was just so thrilled at his invitation. So I went home to my parents, and they had known that I liked this guy and my dad really adores this person because he was in his priests quorum and was just really close with him. And so my parents were kind of in a dilemma because here I was fourteen, not old enough to date by the Church's standards, and yet they knew how important this would be to me and they also really liked him as a person.</i><br><br>What would you expect her parents to do? What would you do as her parents? Margaret's parents decided not to let her go to the dance at that time in her life. Now, consider the effect of this decision on Margaret.<br><br><i>I learned a couple of things from it. The first thing I learned was the importance of setting an example and my role in setting an example to my younger brothers and sisters. And, again, the other thing was always obeying the gospel principles no matter what type of peer pressure or what other things might be more appealing at the moment. When it comes down to it in the end, it's better to just stick with the principle.</i><br><br>Listen to José and a powerful experience he had while growing up.<br><br><i>This was when I was nine years old. I was in a Catholic elementary school. It was run by nuns. They were very, very strict, and I remember one day during recess that I was playing soccer in the yard and I kicked the ball and hit a window and broke the window. It was very scary at the time. One of the nuns came out and she yelled at me--she reprimanded me very harshly and told me to go home and tell my parents what had happened. I remember walking very, very slowly, scared, and trying not to get there. But I was very, very scared, and when I finally got there, my mom opened the door and I think she noticed how scared I was. I was pale and just looking terrible, and I told her what had happened, that I had kicked the ball and broken a window. I was just expecting her to do the same thing that the nun had done to me, just reprimand me.</i><br><br>Note how José's mother reacted to him.<br><br><i>But instead, she told me not to worry about it and she hugged me, and I felt a sense of relief and also of appreciation for having a mother that would understand and put her love for me above my mistakes.</i><br><br>Many of you have had an experience like Ryan with the family car.<br><br><i>One event that happened when I was sixteen I remember very well. I had had my driver's license for three or four months, so I snuck out my window, probably about midnight, took the car, went and picked up some of my buddies, and we just went cruising. We went and picked up some drinks at 7-Eleven and just went driving around the city--nothing major. And even though I know I shouldn't have been out that late, I did it anyways, cause you know when you're sixteen you don't really care. When I came back, however, dropped my friends off, and pulled into my neighborhood, I could see the kitchen lights on in my house. I knew I was caught--I was busted. I was expecting to be grounded for three or four months from the car. That never happened.</i><br><br>Again, note the effect his parents' response had on Ryan.<br><br><i>They just talked to me like a normal person. They asked me, "Why did you want to go out?" And then, "Well, I understand. When I was sixteen, I wanted to go out and hang out with my friends--it's a cool thing to do." Then they asked me, "Do you realize that if you had been caught, you could have been busted for curfew?" They made me realize some things in a way that I hadn't really thought of before. And I respected them because they treated me just normal. They didn't talk down to me, they didn't lash out, they just connected with me.</i><br><br>Other lessons learned by these students dealt with issues of self-perception, interacting with others, problem solving, and decision making. Leonard's father had a lasting influence in how Leonard approaches problems.<br><br><i>He doesn't make any problem really sound big. Though it is big, he kind of narrows it down to something really small and he just comes up with one solution--and it works out really good. I just want to be like him. I want to be like my dad.</i><br><br>Now see how Michelle's family influenced her self-esteem.<br><br><i>When the decision was made for my family to move to California, my dad had the job offer. We came together, had a family council, decided if that would be best for our family, and it made me feel like I was a meaningful part of the family because my opinion was valued.</i><br><br>As Bill and Brian thought of their families, they related the importance of parents being united.<br><br>Bill:<i>One of the things that I always saw, that probably most impressed me and built unity, was that I never remember my mother saying anything negative about my father--never--and I never saw him disrespect her--ever.</i><br><br>Brian:<i>One thing that I learned about my parents is that when you want to teach your children the difference between right and wrong, you need to discuss it between yourselves first and how you're going to do that.</i><br><br>Not all lessons learned in these students' families were positive. Moroni grew up in a family where his father did not treat his mother respectfully. Consequently, Moroni indicated the following:<br><br><i>If I'm going to be a father and a husband, I just want to be the best. I think I'm going to love my wife so much, and probably because my mother didn't have this kind of relationship, I feel like I could probably be a good husband because I know what husbands shouldn't do.</i><br><br>Eun-Suk was raised in circumstances that required both her parents to work and be out of the home for most of her younger years. She remembers a painful experience as a young girl. Following her school performances, it was the custom for parents to present the children with flowers. Her parents never attended any of her performances.<br><br><i>My parents had never been there, so it was the worst in my experience. All the families came, and they gave flowers, but no one ever gave me flowers. It was the most painful experience. I don't want my children to have that kind of experience.</i><br><br>So where did Eun-Suk learn to become such an outstanding women? Where did she learn, as she puts it, her "best lessons"?<br><br><i>I learned a lot of things from family and school, but learned the best things from Church. I honestly say that--in the Church.</i><br><br>Brigham Young stated that<br><br><i>it makes no difference how children are brought up so far as the permanence of the impressions and habits of childhood are concerned. Whether surrounded with error or truth, the web woven around them in childhood's days lasts, and seldom wears threadbare;</i>. . .<i>in many instances it grows brighter and brighter and stronger and stronger.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:243]<br><h2><b>Rituals and Traditions</b></h2><br>It was interesting to note how the patterns of interacting with each other, the family rituals and traditions, made a difference in many of these students' lives. As you watch a sampling of these family experiences, think about your own life and the power of family traditions and rituals.<br><br>Tammi and José related the importance of their families talking together at the dinner table and at family outings.<br><br>Tammi:<i>You have to do things together as a family a lot. It's so important to just have dinner, a meal, together as a family--just something like that, so simple--maybe that's the only time of the day that you can be together as a family, but I think that's very important. Growing up, the dinner table was the main place where we got together and talked.</i><br><br>José:<i>My father always--during dinner or family trips or outings--engaged us in conversation on different subjects. I've realized lately that he was using the Socratic method. He would ask questions and try to elicit from us answers or help us come to the answers--reach the answers by ourselves rather than telling us.</i><br><br>Judy and Tim also remember the importance of just spending time together as families.<br><br>Judy:<i>The most important thing in the family is to have fun together. You have fun together because you love each other, because you enjoy being together, because you're interested in each other's lives. I mean, when I think of my family, it's having fun together. Even when we were cleaning house, planting flowers, going to my grandma's house for the harvest to help her, we were always singing together, having fun even though the job was hard to do--because we worked together, you know, because we enjoyed being together and listening to each other's jokes, we enjoyed it. We were so happy.</i><br><br>Tim:<i>We did everything together--on Christmas, Easter, and everything like that--you know, potlucks, where one person would cook and everybody would bring their own little special dish. We'd just get together like that.</i><br><br>Having a special place to laugh together as a family was influential for Ryan.<br><br><i>The one thing that my parents have done ever since we were little is they have taken us twice a year to Disneyland. I know that's just a vacation--it doesn't mean a lot to some people. But for my family Disneyland kind of represents a solid unity that my family has. It's very special to my family. You know, my family has a laughing place, and twice a year we go there and we bond.</i><br><br>Listen to the effect of holding regular family home evenings and prayers on Margaret and Michelle.<br><br>Margaret:<i>Having family home evening was a really important ritual that we did that was able to pull us together and unify us as a family. We were able to think of ourselves as a unit instead of as ourselves in that type of situation. We would have family home evenings, and our family was a little bit different. We'd get into these, a lot of times, great discussions--intellectual discussions or debates--about different gospel subjects or even politics, or something like that, but it was a really good way for everyone to participate and voice their opinion. We also studied the gospel in the family home evenings and sang our songs and said prayers. But I think just because we were able to talk amongst each other and listen to each other's ideas, we were able to understand each other much better.</i><br><br>Michelle:<i>When I was young, we always had family prayer, and I remember feeling the Spirit.</i><br><br>Bill's family had a tradition that all you future moms would love.<br><br><i>I don't think I ever saw my mother do the dishes. You know, she cooked, and then our job was to do the dishes. And then every Sunday, my father would come in and he would help. The kids always handled the dishes, but Dad got in there, and, you know, we were happy to just pack stuff up and put it in the fridge and then dry stuff off as he cleaned it.</i><br><h2><b>Parent-Child Relationships</b></h2><br>In all the interviews, the relationships these students had with their parents became an important theme. How do you express love in your family? Is it easy to do so? Are you awkward in showing "it"?<br><br>Bill:<i>As a child, I can remember hearing that as he would tell me. But as I grew older, he didn't. I think we grew more into the traditional man role, and we didn't perhaps say it. I mean, it was still expressed. And now, once I got on my mission, then I started thinking that maybe we should just go ahead and say it. You know, we don't have to get all mushy and fall all over each other, but it's there. We agree and so try and just close off conversations like that.</i><br><br>Note the special relationships some of the students have with their mothers.<br><br>Michelle:<i>She was always there. During high school we'd have lots of parties at our house, but it was always all the Church gang that was our age getting together to have a good time. She was there almost like she was one of us, but she was still the chaperone; that's to say, she was part of it, like bringing us together and having fun with our friends.</i><br><br>Margaret:<i>She understands the way that I think, and I can call her up anytime and relate different experiences I've had or problems I'm thinking about or just maybe questions I have about the gospel or just life in general. She always has a good answer, and it's always very much on my level.</i><br><br>Tim:<i>I was real afraid of my mother because I'd seen the damage she could do and she's done it before, so you learn by example and experience. So, therefore, I didn't do the things that I knew not to do.</i><br><br>With this healthy respect for his mother, Tim was quick to express how very much he loved his mother.<br><br><i>Well, I love my mother dearly because she was there for me when my father wasn't. She's raising two kids--you know, myself and a younger brother. She still sends me money.</i><br><br>Relationships with dads were also very meaningful and powerful for many of the students. Michelle knew that her father was always there for her, and Brian's dad showed a sense of humor.<br><br>Michelle:<i>He was always there for you--even if it was some stupid Young Women daddy-daughter party or a project at school that was going to be on display or a school program. He was always there, and you could always count on him being there.</i><br><br>Brian:<i>And I think just having him at home, kind of creating a light atmosphere, a happy atmosphere, really helps out in the stressful times--and people like to be around him. And I want to be the kind of father that people will feel relaxed and comfortable around.</i><br><br>Leonard's father is a guide in his life.<br><br><i>My dad became, like, my "star." When I drift off course I just set my eyes up on him and then I gain my course back.</i><br><br>Contrast these relationships with Eun-Suk's relationship with her parents.<br><br><i>I never have gone on a picnic with my mother, and, . . . I have never been somewhere with my parents.</i><br><br>And yet, in spite of the poor relationship Eun-Suk had with her parents, listen to the compassion and understanding she has for her mother as she looks back on her younger years.<br><br><i>I love my mother . . .</i><br><h2><b>Effect of Relationships</b></h2><br>Solid parent-child relationships produce many benefits, particularly when correction is required.<br><br>Remember Ryan taking the family car? Remember how his parents corrected him?<br><br><i>They made me realize some things, you know, in a way that I hadn't really thought of before. And I respected them because they treated me just normal. They didn't talk down to me. They didn't lash out. They just connected with me.</i><br><br>This was effective for Ryan because his parents had taken the time to bond with him. His parents had made solid deposits in the "emotional bank" from which to draw on.<br><br>How could Judy's mom simply give that "look" and get Judy to do the correct thing? Was the "look" a threat of wrath coming down? Or was it something else?<br><br><i>Just a look and I know I have disappointed her. She is the person that I love the most in this world. She never would hit me or anything, but she would just look at me, and I knew in her eyes that she had been disappointed by me.</i><br><br>Note the effects of Michelle's parents using teaching as their main means of disciplining.<br><br><i>My parents were never ones to ground us. They let us know that they were disappointed in the choices that we had made and tried to help us recognize our mistakes and not do it again. It mattered if my parents were disappointed in the choices I made because I loved them and they showed that they loved me. I didn't want to do anything that would hurt them--nothing.</i><br><br>Neal Maxwell has indicated that "what we learn in the home with regard to our capacity to love, to cope with change, and to be fair and genial affects us profoundly for the balance of our lives" (Neal A. Maxwell,<i>That My Family Should Partake</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1974], p. 13).<br><h2><b>Extended Family</b></h2><br>Families, of course, mean more than just the nuclear family of parents and children. Several of these students spoke of the influence of their extended families. Leonard and Todd recalled how their grandparents influenced their parents' approaches to family management.<br><br>Leonard:<i>He was always making references to my grandparents. Every time he says, "You know, when I was your age, your granddad wouldn't let me do this."</i><br><br>Todd:<i>How my mom grew up and was raised by my grandparents is evident in how she raised me. She took their values and put them into her life to lead me down the road that she knew was the right one; she was able to help me from how they helped her.</i><br><br>When Judy recalls her growing-up years, she thinks of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins who lived close by and regularly influenced her.<br><br><i>When I talk about my family, I'm not talking about my mom, my father, and my brothers and sisters. I talk about my grandma, my cousins, and everybody, because we're very close. You know, when my mom was not able to do my hair to go to school, I went over to my grandma's and she did it for me. And then my cousins are like my sisters and my brothers to me. We're just a big family together.</i><br><br>Joseph F. Smith admonished that<br><br><i>we should begin to realize that every man and woman is an agent, and exercises a certain amount of influence in the sphere in which he or she moves. Parents have an influence over their children; children have an influence over each other; neighbor has an influence with neighbor.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:339]<br><br>Tim remembers how it was more than just Mom who disciplined and taught him.<br><br><i>When interacting with my grandparents, I learned that they weren't no joke. What they say goes, and we had to obey by those rules. And they were more than just my grandparents--it was more like a family thing: mother, auntie, uncles.</i><br><h2><b>Future Parenting</b></h2><br>The last question regarding the kind of parents these students wanted to become provided quite varied and interesting responses. Two of the students indicated how the expression of love will be an important part of their future families.<br><br>Ryan:<i>As a parent, I want to develop the quality of unconditional love. I have seen that so much in my family and how that has helped with situations. Instead of flying off the handle sometimes when they could have, my parents just showed unconditional love and understanding.</i><br><br>Brian:<i>I think the most important thing I learned from my family is that there needs to be love between us, no matter what happens.</i><br><br>Some of their ideas showed how they intend to relate with their future children.<br><br>Eun-Suk:<i>I'm going to give my children a lot of love. I'm going to show them my love all the time.</i><br><br>Ryan:<i>I hope that I will be able to come up to my teenager and say, "Look, I was a teenager. I understand." I hope I can remember being a teenager.</i><br><br>Brian:<i>I want them to be able to come to me with questions and challenges that they face with their peers, with anybody. I want them to feel like they can talk to me and accept my input.</i><br><br>Tammi:<i>When I'm a mom, I hope to be able to stay home with my children. I definitely want to graduate from college and have that, because you never know what can happen, but I think it's so important to be there with your kids when they are young and growing up. I want a husband that wants to spend time with the kids, wants to go to their football games, basketball games, whatever. Growing up, my parents were very supportive of the children. They went to everything. I don't think my parents missed a single event in my life. I want to do that with my husband. I want to go, as a couple, to basketball games, to their plays, or whatever.</i><br><br>How do these prospective parents intend to discipline their future families?<br><br>Bill:<i>I think of some of the things that I'm going to do as a father--my wife and I were just talking about this actually. We have sat down and had some of the discipline talks and those things that are important. I believe 100% in establishing boundaries. I think that children need to understand. Individuals need to understand where they can operate.</i><br><br>Tammi:<i>The essentials of good parenting are that the parents get along and that they don't argue in front of the children at all and that they don't clash on their methods--like if they're punishing a child. They shouldn't conflict about the punishment.</i><br><br>A sample of other important parenting variables included financial stability, remaining together as parents, and being a righteous partner.<br><br>Tim:<i>When I want to deal with my family, I think I will want to be old enough so that I can make the right decisions--you know, be financially stable and everything so that I can provide for my family and everything.</i><br><br>Todd:<i>Having experienced a division in my family between the parents and their roles in raising me has helped me realize how important it is to be a family unit, to have both of them there for the support, for the responsibilities--to not divide up.</i><br><br>Eun-Suk:<i>I want my husband to treat my children as his friends. I'm going to be my children's friend, so he has to be. If he is a righteous man, I don't need to ask that. He's going to do that. We can do that. We can make a real nice and wonderful family.</i><br><br>Because of the positive influence of Leonard's father on his life, he wants to pattern his parenting after his father's example. This example included early morning scripture reading and prayer, putting education as a high priority for all the children, respecting your elders, and having a sense of belonging to a caring and involved extended family.<br><br><i>When I become a parent, I'll want to be just like my dad. I just want to be like him. I want to be like my dad.</i><br><br>George Q. Cannon indicated that<br><br><i>there is one thing that every parent can do. He can endeavor to make his sons and daughters better qualified, better equipped for the great struggle of life and better able to perform their part in this glorious work that God has established, than himself; that is one thing the parents of the rising generation . . . can do.</i>[<i>JD</i>20:197]<br><br>Bill:<i>First and foremost is living lives in accordance with the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i><br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In conclusion, let me share two summary thoughts about families provided by two of our modern-day prophets.<br><br>First, listen to the words of Neal A. Maxwell:<br><br><i>So often in human affairs, individuals and groups have been guilty of "looking beyond the mark"--of looking at, or for, something that was neither a realistic hope nor a solution for their problems. Such defective farsightedness neglected the remedy that is nearer at hand all the time. . . . It is so with the family today, for looking beyond the family to other institutions, programs, or activities--which may be good and helpful in their spheres--can be disastrous. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The human family is potentially much more efficient in producing the social and spiritual outcomes we desire than are our political, educational, economic, and other institutions. . . . It is the home we must rescue and sustain.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>That My Family Should Partake,</i>p. 7]<br><br>And finally, I would like to close with a familiar statement given by our beloved prophet David O. McKay.<br><br><i>The home is the first and most effective place for children to learn the lessons of life: truth, honor, virtue, self-control; the value of education, honest work, and the purpose and privilege of life. Nothing can take the place of home in rearing and teaching children, and no other success can compensate for failure in the home.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>Family Home Evening Manual,</i>1968–69 (Salt Lake City: Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1968), p. iii]<br><br>May each of us carefully make sense of our lives and take the good from our past and rise to the sacred task of making the future even brighter for our children is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James R. Young was an associate professor of educational psychology at BYU when this devotional address was given on 9 July 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Our Potential in the Lord’s Way - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As to my strength I am weak; . . . but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things" (Alma 26:12). I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. I pray that we can both speak and listen by the Spirit, that we may all be edified. I love being part of BYU, and I really believe that we have the potential to bless our fellowman and build the kingdom of God if we can learn to accomplish our duties in the Lord's way.<br><br>Although computers are in their technological infancy, they are improving at an astonishing rate. The world's fastest computers can currently accomplish 300,000,000,000 operations every second. In my research area of neural networks and machine learning, we are seeking mechanisms whereby computers can learn on their own without the need of a programmer. This often leads to the question "Can a computer have human intelligence?"<br><br>Let us explore a specific case to help discuss this question. Could we build a machine that would appear and act in every way just like LaVell Edwards? We would like it to be sufficiently convincing so that, without the aid of inspiration, a person would not be able to tell the two apart by observing them over time. I suggest that we will eventually be able to do so. Current technology is much too primitive, but we could eventually build a robot that would have the same physical appearance. However, could we make it act like Coach Edwards? That would require that we observe how he reacts to many types of situations and then train the robot to do the same. Of course, he does not always react the same way each time he is placed in a similar situation. For example, we might observe that while coaching BYU football games he remains relatively calm for the first five or six questionable calls made by the referees. However, on occasion he tends to respond with unusual vigor after an especially creative call. The robot would learn to mimic this behavior by appearing calm the majority of the time, reacting more vigorously on occasion, with the robot's decision being based on a random statistical process. While Sister Edwards might find the creation of many copies of LaVell Edwards somewhat disconcerting, they could at least solve the problem of filling all the seats during games at the stadium.<br><br>But we have not yet answered the original question of whether the machine could have human intelligence. Although I believe a machine could mimic human behavior, I do not believe a machine can attain to full human intelligence. This claim requires us to examine the meaning of intelligence. Although only partially revealed, the scriptures give important insights on the attributes of intelligence. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches, "Intelligence . . .was not created or made, neither indeed can be" (D&amp;amp;C 93:29). Quoted less often are the following verses, which state, "All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence. Behold, here is the agency of man" (D&amp;amp;C 93:30–31). Thus, another of the attributes of intelligence is agency. The concept that there is no existence without the ability to act independently suggests that agency is a necessary attribute of any living intelligent being.<br><br>We do not understand how it is that intelligence can actually make independent decisions. Although we can make machines unpredictable and appear to make choices, all machine decisions are ultimately programmed or controlled by an outside source. It would appear that agency is at the root of some important human attributes that can only be mimicked by a machine--in particular, human emotions, such as love, hate, happiness, and sorrow. Our loving Father has placed us in an environment of many choices, allowing us to exercise our agency, which gives us the opportunity to progress in godly attributes and attain true happiness. As Lehi taught, "Men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>Machine learning is based on capturing, analyzing, and generalizing facts and examples. This is also a common method in human learning. How might the Lord's methods of learning include agency and go beyond these techniques? Let us examine one of Nephi's great learning experiences and liken it unto ourselves.<br><br>After Nephi was taught by his father Lehi concerning Lehi's dream about the tree of life (see 1 Nephi 8), Nephi was not content to have only the explanation from his father. He said, "I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost" (1 Nephi 10:17; see 1 Nephi 10:17–19). As he sat pondering, he was caught away and experienced a wonderful vision (see 1 Nephi 11–14).<br><br>Now contrast the reaction of Laman and Lemuel after hearing their father's same words. We tend to mercilessly pick on Laman and Lemuel, usually forgetting that our own reactions to situations are often more similar to theirs than to Nephi's. The scripture states that Laman and Lemuel "were disputing one with another concerning the things which [their] father had spoken unto them" (1 Nephi 15:2). This is a common and highly regarded approach to learning. They were arguing, discussing, and analyzing the words of Lehi, perhaps much like we do when studying a written work.<br><br>This is the situation Nephi finds his brothers in as he returns from his vision. His brothers then tell Nephi, "Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive-tree, and also concerning the Gentiles" (1 Nephi 15:7). These are legitimate and interesting questions. Having just seen the whole vision, Nephi is a top expert on the subject. Surely this would be a prime moment for Nephi to pull out his chalkboard and give a stirring and detailed treatise on the topic. Instead, his initial response to their question is, "Have ye inquired of the Lord?" (1 Nephi 15:8).<br><br>Why does Nephi take this approach? Nephi states that Lehi spoke "many . . . things . . . which were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord" (1 Nephi 15:3). Nephi knew that spiritual knowledge can only be fully understood and believed with conviction when taught by the Spirit (see D&amp;amp;C 50:17–24).<br><br>May I suggest another reason for Nephi's approach. Assume that Laman and Lemuel had taken Nephi's advice and sought understanding by inquiring of the Lord. Think what it would take for you to learn a doctrine by "inquiring of the Lord." This would require diligent study combined with prayer and faith. Prayer coupled with faith always leads to self-examination and repentance. Could we pray with real faith for the Lord to teach us a principle if we were not striving to keep the commandments? We would first need to get our lives in order. The Lord does not require perfection in order to enjoy his Spirit, but we must be striving to keep his commandments. If Laman and Lemuel had truly sought to learn from the Lord, they first would have had to humble themselves, repent, and sincerely follow his commandments. Then the Spirit could aid them in understanding their questions--but of much greater value would be the change in their lives and characters brought on by the obedience and effort put forth to prepare themselves to learn by the Spirit.<br><br>Sadly, the response of Laman and Lemuel is one often heard from members of the Church. To Nephi's question "Have ye inquired of the Lord ," they respond, "We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us" (1 Nephi 15:9). Nephi's response is frank and to the point:<br><br><i>How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you.</i>[1 Nephi 15:10–11]<br><br>I remember the first time that I really recognized the Spirit teaching me a principle. I was on my mission and had been trying to understand a particular passage in the epistle to the Hebrews. I had been pondering it for a few days. While reading before going to sleep one night, I suddenly felt knowledge and intelligence flowing into me. It lasted about twenty seconds, and I was filled with joy. I remember getting up afterward and dancing around the room for a few minutes. Although the knowledge of the particular doctrine was nice, the real joy of the experience was feeling the love and the Spirit of the Lord with me. Each time we feel the Spirit in our lives, we are changed somewhat for the better. The Holy Ghost is not only a revelator but is also a sanctifier (see Alma 13:12). As Paul taught the Galatians, "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness" (Galatians 5:22). Each time the Spirit is with us, we become a little more like the Savior as we increase in the attributes of godliness. We become a little kinder, a little more patient and forgiving, a little more willing to bless our fellowman, a little happier. To me, this is the greatest blessing that comes from seeking to learn in the Lord's way.<br><br>This might also help us to understand the Savior's commandment for us to search and diligently study the words of Isaiah. This is not yet a favorite pastime for most people. It is possible for us to read some parts of the scriptures while not exercising faith to have the Spirit aid our learning and really think that we understand the passage. This does not happen with Isaiah. The only way to understand his words is to have the Spirit reveal their true meanings. I like to think of reading Isaiah as a type of "spiritual aerobics." To understand Isaiah we must be striving to keep the commandments, we must humbly pray for the Lord's inspiration while reading, and we must then be guided by the Holy Ghost in our understanding. This type of experience causes one to love reading Isaiah. Although there are wonderful doctrinal insights that can be gained through the reading, the greatest joy and benefit is in the faithful effort itself, followed by the opportunity to feel the Spirit of the Lord bless you and change you in those moments of inspired insight. Proper reading of Isaiah teaches us how all scripture should be studied. This approach to reading scripture is harder than a purely intellectual study. It still requires the same intellectual effort while also requiring us to exercise faith and keep the commandments--but the results are so much better.<br><br>Should similar methods of spiritual growth be part of our normal day-to-day activities? Alma commanded:<br><br><i>Cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord. . . .</i><br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good.</i>[Alma 37:36–37]<br><br>Amulek taught, "Cry unto [the Lord] over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase" (Alma 34:24–25). I testify that the Lord does bless us in all that we put our hands to, to the extent that we obey and humbly seek his guidance and support.<br><br>However, we must examine carefully the expectations in these promises, lest we fall into shallow and false assumptions. To better understand how to progress in the Lord's way in our daily activities, let us explore an example that many of us are deeply involved in--that of being students, faculty, and employees of Brigham Young University. Although I will use some examples concerning BYU, we can incorporate the concepts we discuss into situations that we all face in daily life.<br><br>The Lord, through the prophets, has given tremendous prophecies about the potential and destiny of BYU. President Harold B. Lee stated:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University . . . must never forget its role in bringing to reality the ancient prophecy--to build the mountain of the Lord's house in the tops of the mountains, so great and so glorious that all nations may come to this place and be constrained to say "show us your way that we may walk therein." (See Isaiah 2:3.)</i>[Harold B. Lee, "Installation and Charge to the President,"<i>Inaugural Addresses,</i>Brigham Young University, 12 November 1971, p. 12]<br><br>These prophecies can be heady stuff, causing some to falsely assume that just by being here we will fulfill BYU's destiny as an "educational Everest" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, p. 1).<br><br>The Lord has promised blessings whenever we follow his commandments. A common mistake we make is to assume that we know best what those blessings should be and when they should come. We must remember the Lord's words:<br><br><i>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i>[Isaiah 55:8–9]<br><br>I am thankful that the blessings we receive for obedience come from a Father who knows us completely and loves us perfectly. Our Father knows our needs and will bless us with that which will bring the greatest growth and happiness.<br><br>We must also examine our motives. For example, as one portion of their stewardship, BYU faculty should want to do quality research and be respected and influential in their fields. However, if our primary motives for desiring success are to obtain worldly goods or the honors of men, then we would expect a wise and loving Father to withhold his aid in these endeavors and perhaps bless us with opportunities that could increase our humility and reliance. On the other hand, if our real intent is to use whatever influence the Lord blesses us with to build the kingdom and bless our fellowman, then we might expect the Lord to pour out a greater portion of his blessings on our efforts. The light that we hold up must be the light of the Savior, not our own (see 3 Nephi 18:16, 24).<br><br>Assuming our motives are appropriate, how could BYU help fulfill John Taylor's prophecy that "Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are to-day in regard to religious matters" (<i>JD</i>21:100)? One might suggest that we could accomplish this by using the same methods used by the world and just working at it harder. However, depending solely on our own intellectual prowess, why would we expect to be more effective than anyone else? Do we have more hours in the day? In fact, we may have somewhat less. On average, BYU students and faculty have time-consuming Church responsibilities, do not pursue secular activities on the Sabbath, and have larger families at a younger age than comparable colleagues at other institutions. I believe if our complete pattern is that of the world, we will be hard-pressed to even be on par with the best universities, much less become a light to them. Fulfillment of these prophecies will require the blessings of the Lord that only come when we do things the Lord's way.<br><br>Yet we often put so much trust in man's ways and have such a desire to be accepted by the world that we are reticent to make any attempts that do not fall in exact step with the wisdom of the world. If we would only realize how little we really know. As a scientist, it never ceases to amaze me how much credence people put in the latest scientific theories. For thousands of years we have put forth scientific theories, assuming they were correct, only later to find out we were wrong. You would think we would start to see the pattern and put less confidence in man's postulations. Yet we seem to put uncanny faith in each new theory, whether it regards the latest fad diet or the creation of the universe.<br><br>Martin Harris desperately desired to ratify the truth of the Book of Mormon to others by obtaining the world's stamp of approval on Joseph Smith's translation. After the loss of the manuscript, the Lord chastised Joseph, saying:<br><br><i>How oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men.</i><br><br><i>For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words--</i><br><br><i>Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 3:6–8]<br><br>The Savior stated, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). All of our efforts must first be founded in a diligent striving to follow the Redeemer. I spoke earlier about Nephi's teachings on the Lord's way of learning. It requires obedience and revelation to obtain learning, with the greatest benefit coming in the change of character during the process rather than in the specific facts learned. Think of the school courses you took previous to the last few years. How much of the detail do you remember now? Do you still remember all the dates from your history classes or the formulas from your math and science courses? If you are like most of us, you have forgotten the majority of these details. So was your effort a waste of time? No. First, you did gain a better perspective of the area you studied even after forgetting most of the details. More important, your character improved as you learned important traits and skills such as concentration, self-discipline, and the need to work hard in order to understand.<br><br>By learning in the Lord's way, we not only gain these types of learning traits but we grow in all essential character attributes including those of greatest importance--such as faith, hope, and charity. To be a positive influence in the world, we must know the secular facts, but the most important influence we will have on others will be a result of the type of people we are. If we follow the Lord's way, growth in character and knowledge will not only happen in the university classroom but throughout our lives in the classrooms of work, social interaction, church and community service, and, to its greatest extent, in the classroom of raising a family.<br><br>One might conjecture that even if we did all of our learning in the way of the world, given sufficient time we would eventually converge on the truth. However, in many important areas the world is actually diverging from the truth. The importance of learning character in our educational process is an example of this. In the past it was well accepted that learning character was a critical, if not the most important, part of education. Plato stated 2,400 years ago, "Education in virtue is the only education which deserves the name" (Plato,<i>Laws,</i>643–44). David O. McKay said, "Character is the aim of true education; and science, history, and literature are but means used to accomplish [this] desired end"<i>(GI,</i>pp. 440–41). Yet as the world denies God and the existence of absolute moral truths, it educates in an ever more sterile way, concentrating on abstract and often false knowledge, leaving character and morals as relative issues to be considered elsewhere. The world's model comes ever closer to the machine learning model--data devoid of growth and character. Although the secular knowledge you learn here is useful and interesting, it is transient. We will not discover truths here that are not already well-known in heaven, and the actual experience of learning and growing in character will have greater import to you in this life and will continue with you in eternity.<br><br>Let us explore an example of what can happen when we obtain knowledge without morals. Assume that every person in the world was given a small black box with a single red button on it. If anyone pushes their button, the world is destroyed. How long do you think the world would last? A few minutes? A few seconds? A button would soon be pushed due to many possibilities: accident, fanaticism, ignorance, hate, etc. Throughout the world's history there have been many who would have liked to destroy the world, but they never had the power or capacity to do so. As technology increases at a tremendous pace, the ability for a single person to destroy the world gets closer. Today's technological weaponry is still trivial, yet even now the ability to destroy the world as we know it does rest in the hands of a few. As breakthroughs continue in such sciences as genetics, nuclear power, and bacterial toxins, the ability for a single motivated person to destroy the world increases. Preventive measures to dangerous technology always lag far behind initial discovery and production due to economic and scientific factors. In other words, technological advances are placing the little black box in each person's hands. It is difficult for me to see how, without divine intervention, the world as we know it could continue, given another 50 years of the current technology explosion.<br><br>Is this problem due to inherent evil in the technology? The prophets have taught that technology breakthroughs have been inspired by the Light of Christ to aid in the restoration of the gospel and in the coming millennial work. The problem is that our technological power is growing faster than our moral righteousness. Only a Zion society can handle great power and knowledge. Of course we know that the Lord will come and that only those living a higher law will be permitted to remain on this earth and participate in greater powers, knowledge, and blessings during the millennial era. Speaking of us, the Lord revealed:<br><br><i>Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men,</i>. . .<i>they do not learn this one lesson--</i><br><br><i>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:35–36]<br><br>Seeking greater power and knowledge without a foundation of righteousness must ultimately fail. Might I suggest then that the proper relationship between secular and spiritual learning is not coequal, but that secular education must sit atop the broad shoulders of spiritual education. Without a spiritual and moral foundation, secular learning might be likened unto "a great and spacious building [standing] in the air, high above the earth" (1 Nephi 8:26). And as the angel said concerning it, "Behold the world and the wisdom thereof," and with no foundation under it, "the fall thereof [will be] exceedingly great" (1 Nephi 11:35, 36). Spencer W. Kimball stated, "The secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow" (<i>TSWK,</i>p. 390).<br><br>But what is the right balance between our own efforts and the Lord's blessings and help in our efforts? First, I suggest that "balance" may not be the appropriate word here. For example, we should never try to find a "balance" between obedience to our covenants and success in the world. We should never try to find a "balance" between following the Spirit and following our own directions. The Lord, in his wisdom, or because of our lack of faith and diligence, may withhold his guiding Spirit, leaving us to use our best judgment--but we should always seek to have his Spirit with us and follow all guidance received. However, concern arises when one seeks to excuse lack of work and effort on the basis that the Lord will provide, when that person "took no thought save it [were] to ask" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). The Spirit of the Lord leads us into every good thing. It will not influence us to be idle or lazy. The Spirit will motivate us to work hard at all our righteous endeavors. We will not be able to approach the Lord in faith to bless us in our temporal or spiritual affairs if we are not doing our part. But if we are striving to obey the commandments, while working hard to achieve our goals, "then shall [our] confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>Perhaps of even greater concern is the other end of the spectrum--when one depends only on one's own strength. Some may even use their goal of success as an excuse to rationalize lack of faith and obedience. Just as "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26), works without faith can never bring us to a fullness. The Lord's way is truly more demanding, as it requires faith and diligence combined with hard work. And yet it is the most joyous, leading to an outpouring of the Lord's blessings.<br><br>Let us return to the BYU example to explore this concept more carefully. Assume the case of a student or professor trying to assimilate or discover new knowledge. Joseph Smith said, "The best way to obtain truth and wisdom is not to ask it from books, but to go to God in prayer, and obtain divine teaching"<i>(Teachings,</i>p. 191). Does he suggest then, that we should not read? Certainly not. The Lord commanded through Joseph, "Seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Although the best way to learn is through revelation, we will not receive inspiration if we have not studied it out in our minds (see D&amp;amp;C 9:8). The Lord promises knowledge to those who obey. This obedience includes our diligent study and thought--which is a necessary condition, although by itself it is not sufficient, for learning by the Spirit. The Lord stated, "Those who fear me, and . . .serve me in righteousness . . .to them will I reveal all mysteries, . . . even the wonders of eternity. . . . Their understanding [shall] reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish. . . . For by my Spirit will I enlighten them" (D&amp;amp;C 76:5–10). The scriptures also promise, "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he . . . knoweth all things" (D&amp;amp;C 93:28). The Lord has given us his formula for learning. If we leave out either study or faith from that formula, we will not succeed. In my scientific research I have had the opportunity to feel the peaceful Spirit of the Comforter enlighten my mind with ideas and approaches. These moments bring the same joy and growth as do similar experiences when studying gospel knowledge from the scriptures.<br><br>Joseph Fielding Smith stated:<br><br><i>There has never been a step taken . . . in discovery or invention, where the Spirit of the Lord (that is, . . . the Light of Christ . . .</i>)<i>was not the prevailing force, resting upon the individual, which caused him to make the discovery or the invention. . . .</i>[The Lord]<i>uses such minds as are pliable . . . to accomplish his work, whether they believe in him or not.</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, vol. 1 (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954), p. 178]<br><br>We might ask, why doesn't the Lord reveal more of these discoveries to members of the Church? If we have not prepared our minds and are not actively searching at the bounds of our current limited knowledge, then our minds will not be open to assimilate new truths. Could the Lord inspire us with the insight to a dramatic breakthrough in physics if we did not have the mathematical and physics background? We would not be able to understand or appreciate the inspiration, nor be able to communicate it to others. However, if we prepare our minds and have the crucial added blessing of the gift of the Holy Ghost, might not the Lord begin to reveal more of these discoveries meant to benefit the kingdom through those in the kingdom?<br><br>The conclusion of the matter then is to keep the commandments of God. Obedience is the "whole duty of man" (Ecclesiastes 12:13). Perhaps we feel that we are already obeying sufficiently. Joseph Smith taught that Satan seeks to "retard the human mind, and hinder our progress, by filling us with self-righteousness" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 241).<br><br>Let us liken unto ourselves the story of the 2,000 sons of Helaman. Remember the miracle that not a single one of these young Lamanites was killed in their battles. However, think about the Nephite armies that battled alongside those sons of Helaman. After the battles Helaman states, "Now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain" (Alma 57:26). Many of these Nephite warriors were also righteous. They prayed for deliverance (see Alma 58:10–11). They courageously defended the families of the 2,000 and were willing to give their own lives to assure the safety of the 2,000 (see Alma 56:37–38, 50–51). Helaman continues, "And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their<i>exceeding</i>faith" (Alma 57:26; emphasis added). Helaman gives insight as to why the faith of the 2,000 may have exceeded that of their Nephite comrades. He states, "They were . . . true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted" (Alma 53:20). "Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness" (Alma 57:21). It appears that the 2,000 had taken their obedience to a higher level and that this obedience and subsequent faith had led to a significant increase in the Lord's blessings in their lives.<br><br>In speaking of attaining excellence in spiritual and scholarly efforts at BYU, Neal A. Maxwell stated, "Such outcomes only occur, . . . when there is commitment bordering on consecration" ("Discipleship and Scholarship,"<i>BYU Studies</i>32, no. 3 [1992], p. 7). It is often our nature to obey in part, but in our pride we hold on to seemingly innocent sins that we do not want to give up. I believe that if we will truly humble ourselves, with our hearts broken and our spirits contrite, and strive to perform every word of command with exactness, we will begin to experience an outpouring of blessings far beyond what we have known. Although we must patiently "wait on the Lord ," blessings at BYU should include power in learning and teaching, inspiration in study and research, the Lord preparing quality students and faculty to come to BYU, the softening of hearts in efforts at funding and collaboration, and, most important, obedient students and faculty attaining to Christlike character and love that will influence and bless all they come in contact with.<br><br>We have another opportunity at BYU to receive blessings that was also part of the experience of Helaman's 2,000 sons--that of unity. The scriptures repeatedly show that hearts unified in a desire to obey and build the kingdom bring down tremendous blessings. Not only were the 2,000 as one in their efforts to obey, but they benefited from the unified prayers of their faithful mothers and families. While the 2,000 were being miraculously blessed, the Book of Mormon explains that the difficulties experienced by the Nephites were brought on because of pride, contention, and dissensions amongst them. To enjoy a full outpouring of God's blessings at BYU, we must be united in our motives to build the kingdom, to love and help one another, and to follow our Savior. We must obey the Lord's command, "Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" (D&amp;amp;C 38:27).<br><br>May I stress the commandment to be humble and rely on the Lord. We know so little. If we could only realize how much we can attain to if we will follow the Savior and not trust in our own strength. Our Father wants us to learn and grow, and yet, sadly, it is our nature to become prideful as soon as we learn a little bit. When I was young, I read two teachings of Jacob that struck me forcefully and that continue to do so. First:<br><br><i>The wise, and the learned, . . . who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom,</i>. . .<i>they are they whom</i>[the Lord]<i>despiseth; and save they shall . . . consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.</i>[2 Nephi 9:42]<br><br>And second:<br><br><i>O . . . the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–29]<br><br>As we humble ourselves before God, he will make our weaknesses known to us and give us strength to overcome them (see Ether 12:27). We must acknowledge "his hand in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21) and give thanks for all of his blessings. The Lord promised, "He who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious" (D&amp;amp;C 78:19).<br><br>In the earlier example of trying to build a machine with human intelligence, we saw that agency is a crucial aspect that sets us apart from machines. Our Heavenly Father understands the principles of happiness and desires that we learn them. To help us learn these principles, he asks us to appropriately use our agency and give to him the one thing that is truly ours--our will. When we submit our will to his, putting off the natural man, and live by the creed "not my will, but thine be done," then a miracle occurs in our lives. Our desires and nature begin to change as we begin to understand the truth and experience the happiness that comes from keeping God's commandments. Eventually our nature will become one with God's, and we will no longer need to bend our will to follow his because ours will be one with his.<br><br>I testify to you that God lives and loves all of his children. I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior and that he stands at the head of his earthly kingdom and speaks through his anointed prophet. Jesus said:<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><br><br><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:17–18]<br><br>I pray that we will follow the gentle lead of our Redeemer. I testify that if we humbly submit to the Lord, diligently obeying his will, that we will be blessed in all we do and have "peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23). I leave this witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Tony R.

<h1>That Binds - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate my mother, who represents today the epitome of this topic.<br><br>In listening to the devotional speakers over the past few weeks, I have been struck by the counsel given us and the noticeable theme that threads its way through the messages--the importance of bringing together two concepts that at other times and places have received individual attention: faith and reason, head and heart, parents and children, savings and service, knowledge and righteousness. We have been taken on a spiritual journey of integration, of coming to understand how one concept or principle relates to another; how each is enhanced by the presence and, as it were, companionship of the other; how each exceeds its individual potential through a relationship with the other; and, ultimately, how you and I are enriched, not just by one principle or the other but by their "relatedness." I appreciate the lessons taught, the personal revelation evidenced; they stand as additional witnesses to the strength and value of relatedness or relationship, a very significant subject indeed.<br><br>Over the past few months, this topic--relationship--has caused me much pause and reflection. I wish to share some of my reflective journey with you today and hope that, in at least some small way, it adds clarity, as it has for me, to our identity, our purpose, and the role of relatedness in our destiny. I hope I neither ascribe more importance to "relationship" than it warrants nor less than it merits. The scriptures guiding us this morning are nested within Matthew, 3 Nephi, and Alma. I pray that the Lord's Spirit will grace us today.<br><br>So God created the earth and all therein and<i>pronounced</i>that it was good. But then the<i>question</i>of goodness was posed. And his answer, or judgment, was that it is not good to be alone (see Genesis 2: 18). Why isn't it good to be alone? What goodness does "together" bring? What role does relationship play in the heavens above and on the earth below? Just how essential, expansive, and vital is the role of relatedness?<br><br>His creations, his words, and the very fiber of our covenants with him are convincing testimony to me as to the significance and prominence of relationship that culminate in one whole: be ye one, even as "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30). Three compelling examples illustrate the centrality of relatedness. First,<i>life</i>is grounded in relationship. The fact that life exists and continues is dependent on relationship, on connectedness. Second, the<i>plan of salvation</i>that unites our premortal existence, mortality, and eternity has at its core relationship. In that plan we are assured of the continuity of at least three things: intelligence, agency, and relationships. Of these, relationship is the tie that binds: "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matthew 18:18). And third,<i>gospel principles and truths</i>given to help us comprehend "how we shall live" and "how we shall be saved" are also threaded and saturated with relationship. It is of note that being together is also an ingredient in the Lord's judgment and mercy; it is a designated blessing. We make commitments and covenants that charter the direction and craft the architecture of worthy lives. And if so lived, what is the promised blessing? A perpetuity of relationship: we will be "gathered in," will be "brought in," "will come into the fold," will "no longer be strangers, but fellow citizens," will "live with him." And what happens if we do not keep commandments or do not bring worthy lives? A dissolution of relationship: we become "separated" as in the Tower of Babel incident; "cast out" as in the Garden of Eden; not "permitted in" as with the third of the host of heaven; or we are "unknown" as in his fateful, prophetic pronouncement "I knew you not" and he will "depart" from us. The relationship is severed, and we are left without even its possibility.<br><br>The role of relatedness in life, in the plan of salvation, and in the truths of the gospel is pivotal and significant. And, so, with whom are we to relate? The scriptures designate and detail three: our fellow human beings, other creations of the Lord, and the Lord himself. How then are these relationships to be characterized?<br><br>Let us begin with our fellow human beings. God's word to humankind is instructive as to the characteristics that define how we are to be in relationship with one another. Indeed, the old law, or the Ten Commandments, appears to exist in order to ground, at the very least, the foundation of a relationship (see Exodus 20:2–17). Breaking or not adhering to anyone of the commandments does, in fact, violate or injure a relationship. Encoded within each commandment is a sin against relationship.<br><br>The first four--thou shalt not have other gods before me, make no graven image, do not take the name of the Lord in vain, and keep the Sabbath day holy--all reflect upon and affect our relationship to the Lord. Breaking anyone of these sends a message of how we think about and how we feel toward the Lord--maybe even more important, it shows how we value who he is and our relationship with him. By keeping these four commandments, we are saying that who he is is important and our relationship with him is primary and will not be subservient to falsity or imitation; we will honor and uphold the sanctity of his name, his identity; and we will acknowledge and revere his role and relationship to us through a dedicated seventh of our time.<br><br>The remaining commandments concern our relationships with others. The commandment dealing with mothers and fathers is set apart from all others--due, in large measure, to their unique role and responsibility. We are to<i>honor</i>them, further underscoring the uniqueness of our relationship to them. Coveting, bearing false witness, stealing, committing adultery, killing, and dishonoring are all behaviors that, with their companion attitudes, thwart the establishment of a relationship, contaminate an already existing one, destroy a previously valued one, and, ultimately, negate the concept and value of our connectedness.<br><br>Notwithstanding this reality, Christ came to fulfill the old law and establish a new and complete way of relating to others. His life and way of being in the world set forth new expectations. While the "old" commandments remained necessary, they were not sufficient to fulfill a higher law that could bless our relationships with one another.<br><br>• The shift from the old law to the new one was dramatic. It went from violation to enhancement: "turning the other cheek," "going twice the distance," "praying for," "doing good to them that hate."<br><br>• The shift from old to new was subtle. It went from behavior to attitude: "not opposing the hireling, widow, fatherless, stranger;" giving to "whosoever" asketh; not swearing by<i>any</i>of God's creations; loving and blessing enemies; not even thinking or considering adultery; not turning away from the borrower.<br><br>• The shift from old to new was compelling. It was to make resolution<i>before</i>worship: to "go and take care"<i>and then</i>bring our gift to God; to<i>first</i>be reconciled to our brother, and then come; to become<i>as one,</i>even as the Father and he are one.<br><br>These imperatives, coming by way of counsel and example, extend a "hand" to us. They help us connect to one another. They help us be like him in our relationships with others: congruent in thought and action, in mind and heart, in intent and effort. These all point toward the fulfillment of a higher law and the blessing of a<i>new</i>commandment that he gave unto us, to all humankind: "Love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34). This commandment makes crystal clear the value of our relatedness to one another and its important role--its fundamental and intrinsic role--in the plan of salvation. This new commandment then answers our question "How shall we live?" We shall live as he lived; and the reality of his plan is that we live in relationship to others.<br><br>Christ's words and example are instructive as to how we can be like him in our relationships. His interaction with us--with all creation--is a literal demonstration of the qualities that lace together enduring relationships. The scriptures are replete with descriptions of these behaviors and attitudes and reveal the way of being with others that he set for us: patient, virtuous, humble, kind, temperate, contrite, meek, compassionate, merciful, charitable, and with attitudes instrumental to sacrifice and consecration. The scriptures also deal with exclusive behavior: do not judge or contend with others, do not exalt self over another or be prideful or selfish. These are qualities that contribute to being "godlike." In one sense, these qualities form the laws or principles that govern how we live with one another. If we were to follow his example and admonition, we would have less dependence on our social norms or "civil" laws to define how we are to "live together."<br><br>These expected qualities or ways of being have a creative power: they form the seedbed that gives birth to and nourishes a relationship. They have a cohesive power: they link and strengthen our bonds across varied conditions and predicaments. They have a predictive power: they determine the quality of the relationship we create and they become the "way we are," a profound portion of our identity.<br><br>In truth, these qualities and attitudes voiced repeatedly throughout the scriptures have little meaning outside the context of a relationship--further testament as to its important role in the gospel plan, a role intricately woven into the gospel fabric. In truth, they are the substance that forms the<i>bond</i>of charity, or love. In truth, they are the artist's tools that will sculpt us such that we will be<i>like</i>him. These relational qualities that the Lord consistently displayed, that he encouraged us to live by, that are embedded in "love one another"--these behaviors carry a recognizable signature that gives a name to<i>how</i>we<i>think about</i>ourselves and others. Close scrutiny reveals the presence of an attitude innate to their definition, value, and success. It is an attitude favorable to<i>equality,</i>of being equal with one another, of valuing the welfare of another as much as one's own.<br><br>From the reservoir of scriptures describing this attitude of equality, let's dip into but a few:<br><br>"Should impart of their substance. ... Should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God. ... Walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants" (Mosiah 18:27–29). "Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you" (Jacob 2:17–18). "Go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor" (Matthew 19:21). Have "all things common" (3 Nephi 26:19).<br><br>Certainly these create an equalizing of health, knowledge, riches, and talents.<br><br>"Love one another, and ... serve one another. ... Succor those that stand in need of ... succor; ... administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; [do] not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain" (Mosiah 4:15–16). "Willing to bear one another's burdens" (Mosiah 18:8).<br><br>Certainly these are an equalizing of hardship and handicap, of strength and light.<br><br>"Exalt not yourselves" (D&amp;amp;C 112:15). "Judge not" (Matthew 7:1). "Acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done" (Alma 39:13). "A soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming" (Alma 39:17). "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12).<br><br>Certainly these are an equalizing of influence and humility.<br><br>What does considering others in equal terms do? Can it steer our behavior, guide our interactions with others? Does it affect our pride, our generosity, our humility? Our bearing of others' burdens, our sharing of others' joy? Our loving? Does it help us be as he is regardless of "whosoever" asketh or "whatsoever" is done? Yes, our feeling about equality moves as a lubricant throughout the way the Lord would have us be with one another. And no wonder, for inherently, equality<br><br>acknowledges rather than ignores,<br>accepts rather than rejects,<br>grants rather than denies,<br>respects rather than disdains,<br>compensates rather than collects,<br>harmonizes rather than clashes,<br>joins rather than separates.<br><br>All are features that enhance relationship. It is not surprising then that the way we are in relationship to others occupies such a prominent and pivotal position in the eternal plan. Nor is it difficult to understand why it is that relationship has such a binding quality and why it is a central feature in our becoming one with him.<br><br>Regarding specific fellow human beings, are we to be like him in our interactions with "whomever"? How about those who oppose us, put us "down," or criticize us? Or those who have a different perspective, don't see things the way we do, or are of a different political persuasion? Or those who wrong us--take my irrigation turn, run me off the road, overcharge me, misrepresent me, bring suit against me? How about those who don't realize that I am always right or who really don't understand me? Or those I live with, or next to, or far from? To just what extent does being like him "with one another" go? And what is the level of our sacrifice to be? Just how much sacrifice is involved in not taking offense? Perhaps a sacrifice of pride for humility. How much sacrifice is involved in doing as we would have done to us? Perhaps a sacrifice of guile and effort for virtue or purity of intent. How much of all that we have is needed for our good? Perhaps less than half. How does our own need and want relate to the bearing of another's burden? Perhaps more than we think. One illustration:<br><br><i>The sun blazes down; heat rises; moisture is drawn from the earth; temperatures soar. Resources are limited: food is scant; water is scarce, health is minimal. Sunbaked earth frames huts; hardened earth forms beds; twigs become toothbrushes. Children are born, get sick, die. Women work, bear children, become weary and worn. Men try, fight futility, grow old, and despair. Land once flourished, now it is austere and yields less than needed. Wind blows, sand travels, then settles--a death knell to nutrient-rich earth. Porous rocks, once reservoirs of moisture, become conveyers of air and silt. This setting: a poverty of life, of hope--for children, for men, for women, for the earth.</i><br><br>What is equality in this setting? What is required if we are to live as equals--equals in what?<br><br>And now, the same setting:<br><br><i>These weary bodies exude an abundance of soul. These worn bodies are vessels of nobility and strength of soul. And these little malnourished bodies, fountains of eagerness and warmth. A sense of community flourishes among young and old; outsiders are drawn in. Generosity marks their gratitude. Strangers, coming to give, leave--full and friends. Wisdom, a harvest gathered from experience, is shared through rich metaphors of creatures and earth. And the result? Poverty's influence is halted, stopped at the border between body and soul; hope is rekindled.</i><br><br>In this vignette, who then has extended equality, long-suffering, charity, love? Who then has lived as he lived?<br><br>The interrelatedness of all things is even more deeply and intricately evident in our relationships with others and our relationship with the Lord. Abundant counsel exists describing the basis on which the Lord relates to us<i>as</i>we relate to others. As we forgive, so will we be forgiven; as we judge, so will we be judged; as we give, so will we be given to; as we love, so shall we be loved. As we extend mercy, deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually, then we shall have mercy, justice, and righteous judgment restored unto us. "For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored" (Alma 41:15).<br><br>These then are the lines drawn in the sand that clarify our effort and set the expectation and touchstone for our investment and involvement with others. The Lord is defining how we are to be with one another and intimating that it is to be qualitatively similar to how we are with him. These then are the ways of being with one another that will help us be one and bring each other home.<br><br>[A video clip of<i>For Their Future</i>(Ouelesse-bougou-Utah Alliance) was shown]<br><br>Let us consider now how we are to be in relationship to God's other creations apart from humanity. How are we to relate to the wilderness that served as a sanctuary for the Lord and the prophets; the desert that provided a haven for his people; the rock that stood as an altar to the Most High; the lamb that served as a sacrifice to him; the soil that nourishes and the water that quenches; the tree that shelters his children; and the flower that lifts their souls? What is our relationship to them? One illustration:<br><br>The setting is a rocky valley. The young anthropologist, Loren Eiseley, considers his two duties: one, "to capture the past," and, two, "to lay hands on the present"--in this case, to trap animals to be sent to zoos. In the dark of the night, previously having discovered the nesting place of some birds in an old abandoned cabin, he quietly and quickly opened the door, shone a spotlight into the dark, and grabbed with his two hands whatever was blinded by his cohort, the light. Two sparrow hawks, a male and a female, were there. What he hadn't planned on was that the male would protect the female. When the light went on, the male gave a cry and began to peck and claw the young man's hand. The light was knocked over, and the female regained her sight and flew out through a hole in the roof. But he had the male in his possession. A fine sparrow hawk in the prime of life who had saved his mate by diverting the young "assassin's" attention. The hawk was placed in a box to await the morning, the trip to civilization, and a cage where he would spend the rest of his life. The next morning the young man brought the box in which the little hawk was imprisoned out onto the grass where he was building a cage. But then he paused; he could see no sign of the female. He opened the box, paused again, and then took the bird in his hands. It lay limp in his grasp, but he could feel the heart pound under the feathers. He then laid the bird on the ground. The hawk looked beyond the man and into the sky. "He lay there a long minute without hope, unmoving ," his little breast against the grass, his eyes still fixed on the sky above. Then he was gone, soaring into the sky. The young man watched and listened--silence, then a cry ringing from somewhere high overhead. His heart turned over, for it was not the cry of the hawk he had captured but the cry of its mate from where she had been soaring restlessly above for hours. He saw them both whirling together--then, once more, there was another cry of such "unutterable and ecstatic joy" that for the young man it sounded in his heart throughout his years (See Loren Eiseley, "The Bird and the Machine,"<i>The Star Thrower</i>[New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978], pp. 83–91).<br><br>Embedded within this narrative is Loren Eiseley's response to his responsibility, his relationship to the others of God's creations, and the agency that would direct his response. And what of our response? How will we relate to them?<br><br>The earth and all therein preceded us in their physical creation; they were already there when Adam and Eve were placed in Eden. Connectedness or relationship as an integral notion in their realm is strikingly apparent. We are well aware of the interactive nature of all living things: pollination, habitation, conception. We are also aware of the interactive nature of the earth--the winds, the tides, the elements: erosion, germination, translocation. The vitality of these living things is nourished in the rich humus of an interactive, connected relationship--as is even our own. We are dependent on these other living things for our temporal welfare, perhaps our spiritual as well. The nature or essence of our world was<i>not</i>designed to be an isolated, linear experience; by design it was to be responsive, interactive, and interrelated.<br><br>So what guides us in our relationship with the Lord's other creations? The Lord was clear about our part and our responsibility: to have dominion over and to assure the attainment of the<i>full</i>measure of their creation that they might have joy therein. The importance that God placed on these creations is equally apparent, particularly in relationship to him. For example, we are not to swear by them as they are his "throne" and his "footstool." Our role with other creations is more reflective of a parental role; that is to say, we have responsibility<i>for</i>them. "Replenishing," "multiplying," and "filling" irrefutably have a more enriching ring to them than does "not killing or stealing." In light of where "much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3), and being aware that, as sons and daughters of God, we are inherently blessed with gifts of intelligence, conscience, and agency, I would guess that the expectations for how we relate to his other creations are very high indeed! And, perchance, this opportunity to be involved in the fulfillment of their creation may well be an excellent exercise in the management of the worlds to come.<br><br>At the time of the Fall and Adam and Eve's departure from Eden, the nature of our relationship to God's creations alterably changed; but our responsibility for and to them did not! Nevertheless, the new conditions and circumstances made it more difficult for us to fulfill our responsibility. Adversity entered the scene and changed the conditions, thus hindering our progress in the fulfillment of our responsibility. We now had to work hard by the sweat of our brow to overcome obstacles, both physical and attitudinal, in order to guarantee success in the fulfillment of our duty and calling to God's creations. Subduing<i>and</i>replenishing became a more difficult balancing endeavor. Just how much would be "needed" for our good? How much then would need to be removed? How does<i>our</i>need relate to<i>their</i>fulfillment?<br><br>Visualize, if you will, our friends Babe, the pig, and Mr. Hoggett from the film<i>Babe.</i>Babe is sick and dehydrated almost to the point of death--despondent to the point of hopelessness. And Mr. Hoggett, at the point of helplessness, knows that unless he can get Babe to drink and eat, he will lose him. And what turns the tide in that hopeless and helpless moment? A change of heart and purpose. Mr. Hoggett holds Babe and begins to sing:<br><br><i>If I had words to make a day for you</i><br><i>I'd sing you a morning golden and true.</i><br><i>I would make this day last for all time, then</i><br><i>Fill the night deep in moon shine.</i><br><i>If I had words to make a day for you,</i><br><i>I'd give you a morning golden and true.</i><br>["If I Had Words," lyrics by Johnathan Hodge,<i>Babe: A Little Pig Goes a Long Way,</i>Universal City Studios, Inc., 1995]<br><br>"I'd give you; I'd make this day last." In what ways do our decisions regarding the other creations change our relationship to and with them? And, finally, what role does our relationship with the earth and the other species play in the realization of paradisiacal glory for the earth? Hopefully, our relationship with them, with its accompanying role of responsibility, is a significant element, or at least a moving force, in bringing to pass the full measure of their creation and, along with others, bringing them home.<br><br>Finally, is our first and foremost relationship--our relationship with the Lord. He underscored this relationship's importance; he said that we are to be called by his name--a distinct definition of who we are and to whom we belong by lineage, association, and affinity. It is this relationship that captivates our attention, affection, and attachment. And if the relationship corresponds to our familial brother and sister relationship, then our relationship with him is, indeed, the closest in life. The importance of a relationship with the Lord is registered in his blessing: great will be our joy if we bring one soul unto him. Priceless is a relationship to him. It is from our relationship with the Lord that all others should flow.<br><br>He is our link with God, making an additional connectedness with our Father. If we learn of him, we learn of the Father. If we know one, we know the other. How much stronger, unified, or more trustful can a relationship be than if when you know one you know the other? Through our relationship with Christ we become a party to their relationship and are brought into the features and investment that mark that holy bond.<br><br>Three gifts offered to us by the Lord in our relationship with him almost eclipse understanding. First, an<i>atonement</i>for our sins--sins whose weight and entanglement could have kept us forever strangers to him. What a merciful and equalizing act. What an invitation to and sacrifice for an enduring relationship. This act is the only one that ensures the continuation of our relationships with the Lord and those with one another--then, now, and forever. Second, the gift of<i>agency,</i>the freedom that puts within our control the way we are with others. Unconstrained by trait or talent, we are free to choose how we will be and how we will live. And third, his own<i>example,</i>the way he lived, day by day, among all people.<br><br>And what is our part? What is our offering or gift to the relationship? It is a receptive heart, hope in who he is, time spent with him, a living endorsement of his gospel, a sacrifice and consecration of self, and living lives with others wherein we have been<i>like</i>him.<br><br>The path we take in relationship to other human beings and others of God's creations does portray who we are and what we believe. The defining features we etch upon that trail may well trace and define the boundaries we place on our relationship with him. His parameter is expansive: Inasmuch as ye have done it unto them, ye have done it unto me. No wonder he<i>knows</i>his sheep. There is something recognizable about the way they are with one another: they are with others as he would have them be, and they would do with others as he would have them do.<br><br>[A video clip of<i>To This End Was I Born</i>(LDS Church Educational System) was shown]<br><br>We are to be with others as he would have us be; we are to do with others as he would have us do; in fact, as we would do and be with him. The link with him through our relationships carries an identifiable inscription once again: Whatsoever ye do unto the least, ye do it unto him (see Matthew 25:40).<br><br><i>Love one another, love one another,</i><br><i>As I have loved you.</i><br><i>And bear one another's burdens,</i><br><i>And share one another's joys.</i><br><i>And bring each other home.</i><br><br>May "as I have loved you" be emblazoned on our hearts--no, emblazoned on our relationships--is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Addie Fuhriman was dean of Graduate Studies and a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 30 July 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>f Preparation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, may I begin my remarks by thanking those who are responsible for extending the kindness of inviting me to occupy this podium this morning. I have sought and again ask for the blessing of the Lord that the things I have prepared will be edifying and beneficial to at least some persons who shall hear.<br><br>We should all be humbly grateful to the Lord for our having been permitted to come to the earth in this time. He has blessed this century with an incomparable number of comforts and conveniences and a knowledge and technological explosion of mind-boggling proportions. There have been, and there also are, some great spirits among us. Who knows the potential of anyone in my hearing?<br><br>Earlier in this phenomenal century, the historian and philosopher Will Durant produced a great series of volumes under the general title<i>The Story of Civilization.</i>Some of those volumes bear the individual title<i>The Age of,</i>etc., such as<i>The Age of Faith</i>and<i>The Age of Reason Begins.</i>From the perspective of the gospel and the Church, one might call this period the Age of Expansion, Growth, and Optimism. As one considers the many reports of our society and much that comes from the media, this period might be called the Age of Skepticism or the Age of Greed or the Age of Crime and Violence or the Age of Filth or the Age of Ingratitude or, simply, the Age of Disrespect. Disrespect and irreverence lie at the root of so many, if not all, of this world's ills.<br><br>Fortunately there are some people--all over the world, no doubt--who live in such a way that none of those names are applicable to them, although they are surrounded by many others to whom the terms do apply.<br><br>Although we live in a world seemingly filled with such influences, encouraged and fostered by many powerful forces, you at this great university are about something infinitely better. As the prophet Isaiah recorded in the first chapter of his book, "Come now, and let us reason together" (Isaiah 1:18). On the surface one might think my inquiry has little relevance to the things I have said thus far, but upon deeper reflection the relevance should become apparent. I ask you, as I asked a former generation, "Why get what we call an education?"<br><br>Perhaps more often than not, if one asked himself that question, his answer would consist of some vocational reason. Doubtless many others would justify their pursuits on cultural grounds. The first would see education principally as an economic instrument or as a means to an end; that is, as a means to some kind of job for making a living, as we say. The second would see education principally as an end in itself. They would seek knowledge or art or whatever for its own sake. Needless to say, experience justifies both of these reasons for pursuing an education; however, the instrumental and intrinsic values in these reasons for pursuing an education can hardly be adequate for the Latter-day Saint, whose perspective is not limited to this mortal scheme of things.<br><br>As I understand the gospel, which is our guide, there are two fundamental reasons for seeking an education: first, as a means of improving the self, the person; and second, as a means of preparing the self or person to be able to render greater service than he could otherwise render. One might pursue any academic discipline in the alphabetic gamut from accounting to zoology and find satisfaction in its instrumental and/or intrinsic value; but if somehow in the process he or she does not become a better person--not merely a better accountant or better zoologist, or whatever, but a better person--and become motivated to serve others, the so-called education has failed to generate its most important product. One might think of himself as an accountant or zoologist or anything in between, but he is first and foremost a self or person, and if he is to really succeed, the self or person or other persons must not be sacrificed for the sake of the accountant or the zoologist. Or, to approach the matter a little differently, in examining the question "Why get an education?" one might ask himself the larger question, "What is the purpose of life?" Certainly the answer to that question has significance for the subordinate question "Why get an education?"<br><br>It seems to me that the answer to the question of the purpose of life for mortals was suggested most succinctly by the Lord when he described his own work, wherein he declared, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Inasmuch as the Lord has performed his great atoning sacrifice to redeem mankind from the grave and from sin, no matter how inadequate or unworthy we might feel, it is now our work and glory to personally accept his gifts and do all we can for our posterity, our progenitors, and our fellowmen generally to help them accept the Lord's beneficent gifts.<br><br>In that great declaration of the Lord regarding his work, he spoke both quantitatively and qualitatively.<i>Immortality</i>is a quantitative term, indicating that life will go on endlessly.<i>Eternal life</i>is a qualitative phrase, indicating the quality of life that the Lord makes available to those who will fully accept him and his gospel and endure faithfully to the end. There is nothing we can do, nor need to do, relative to the gift of immortality. The Lord has done all that needed to be done, and thus immortality or endless life is a free gift from him to all mankind. On the contrary, our work lies in the area of eternal life--that quality of life he has made available to mankind. But it is our work to accept it ourselves and do all we can to help our posterity, progenitors, and fellowmen prepare themselves to accept it also. So when we ask ourselves the question "What is the purpose of life?" we get an answer something like "the purpose of life is to prepare myself and to help my companion, our posterity, our progenitors, and fellowmen prepare themselves for eternal life, even exaltation."<br><br>When the Lord was asked the question "Which is the great commandment in the law?" he responded by naming what we now know as the first and second great commandments, after which he said, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (see Matthew 22:34–40).<br><br>As the Lord simplified the decalogue, or Ten Commandments--those upon which all of the law and the prophets hang--to the two great commandments, analogously I would like to suggest that our preparation for eternal life, to which education must be contributory, may be reduced to two great endeavors to which all others are instrumental. Those two endeavors in the scriptures are identified by the terms<i>intelligence</i>and<i>stewardship.</i>Therefore, irrespective of how much formal schooling one receives--consciously or unconsciously--whether he acknowledges it or fails to acknowledge it, he is engaged in these two comprehensive endeavors called in the scriptures intelligence and stewardship.<br><br>There is a natural tendency to associate the word<i>intelligence</i>with intellect. Therefore, one might assume that the endeavor suggested here by the term<i>intelligence</i>has to do with what we might call intellectual acumen, skill, or brilliance; or perhaps the acquisition of encyclopedic knowledge; or perhaps great artistic, scientific, or scholarly learning. Certainly there are revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants that exhort mankind to acquire these things, but not merely for the sake of themselves. The Lord is explicit in those revelations that the purpose of one's acquiring those things is that he or she might be better prepared to build the kingdom of God. If the acquisition of those things we ordinarily think of as intellectual is not the principal intention of the word<i>intelligence,</i>as one of the two endeavors suggested, what is the principal intention or meaning of intelligence here?<br><br>In that oft-used phrase from the Doctrine and Covenants, "The glory of God is intelligence," intelligence is described as "light and truth," and we are there told that "light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37). Therefore, intelligence is described not only as light and truth but as a disposition to act (also see D&amp;amp;C 93:30). And whatever one's disposition is to act, we conventionally think of as his character. If one's disposition is to act well, or do what we call good things, he or she is what we call a good person--we think of him or her as having good character. If his or her disposition is to act badly, or do bad or evil things, we think of him or her as being a bad person or as having or being a bad character. Therefore,<i>intelligence</i>here seems to be an appropriate synonym for<i>character--</i>righteous character.<br><br>Furthermore, elsewhere in the Doctrine and Covenants we are told:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>It strikes me as significant that the phrase is not "knowledge<i>or</i>intelligence" but "knowledge<i>and</i>intelligence," which suggests that the intention of the word<i>intelligence</i>is something other than "knowledge." In light of our previous observation that intelligence means a disposition to act, or righteous character, we can see in the just-cited passage a larger and more comprehensive meaning than is immediately recognizable otherwise. For if we substitute the word<i>character</i>for the word<i>intelligence,</i>that beautiful scripture will then read, "And if a person gains more knowledge and<i>character</i>in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." Seen in this way, the passage tells us explicitly that it is not only the knowledge that we take with us that is important and will give us an advantage in the eternal worlds, it is also the right disposition to act upon that knowledge or good character or intelligence that will give us an advantage. After all, the devil has more knowledge than anyone who ever walked the earth while he was mortal, other than the Lord, and yet that knowledge is not worth a whit to him toward salvation for he is without intelligence, in its scriptural meaning; that is, he lacks the disposition to act righteously or in light and truth. He has great knowledge but is without good character. The development or acquisition of intelligence, or righteous character, is the first endeavor with which we are charged in our mortal preparation for eternal life.<br><br>King Benjamin of ancient America put it this way:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>This necessarily includes submitting oneself to the reception of all of the sacred ordinances the Lord has prescribed for the blessing of humankind.<br><br>Alma the Younger spoke of this transformation in a person as his being "born again" (Alma 5:49), specifically asking the question of his hearers or readers, "Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" (Alma 5:14).<br><br>Perhaps the supreme attribute that characterizes this endeavor we call character is most clearly identified in the scriptures as charity. In describing this quality, Mormon said, "Charity is the pure love of Christ" (Moroni 7:47) and that it will be well with whoever is possessed of it at the last day. He urged mankind to seek to be filled with this love, so that when the Lord shall appear we "shall be like him . . . ; that we may be purified even as he is pure" (Moroni 7:48).<br><br>Here again the Lord Jesus Christ is our example. It is recorded that when he was in Palestine, he made several such declarations as "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me" (John 6:38). He was the Creator, the mighty Jehovah, and yet his great power was not the product of pride or rebellion but the product of the submission of his own will to the will of Heavenly Father. Because of his having submitted his own will to that of the Father completely, without boasting but in humility and utter honesty, when he asked his disciples of ancient America the question "What manner of men ought ye to be?" he was able to say, "Verily I say unto you, even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). Thus, in following the example of the Lord, by submitting our own wills to his will--the will of the Father--that wonderful transformation called a rebirth will occur in which we will be literally born of the Spirit, spiritually born of God. We will be filled with that divine love called charity--the pure love of Christ--that love which cleaveth unto light and truth, which is intelligence, that disposition to act righteously in all things, even what we might call "celestial character." Thus our first endeavor in our preparation for eternal life is to seek to develop and acquire celestial character.<br><br>Earlier I observed that, as I see it, the second great endeavor to which our preparation for eternal life might be reduced is stewardship. Fundamentally, that means that each person is a steward and has a stewardship. The generic meaning of<i>steward</i>is "one who acts as a supervisor or administrator, as of finances and property, for another or others." Some persons in their pride of self, pride of position, or pride of possessions might resent being thought of as stewards, but nonetheless we are all stewards. If one pauses to consider what he brings into this life with him and what he takes when he leaves, he will be brought to a keen awareness of how temporary his so-called possessions and positions are. Several years ago some wealthy wit declared, "If I can't take it with me, I'm not going." But we are all going, and the material things of this world will not go with us.<br><br>We are stewards of our lives--the years of mortality we have; stewards of our minds--how we use our intellects; stewards of our talents--what we do with them; stewards of our energy--what we do with it; stewards as husbands or wives--what we make of those relationships; stewards over our families--the influence we exercise upon them; stewards in our occupations--responsible for what we do with our opportunities, responsible for whatever influence we may exercise upon others; and stewards over our so-called possessions--what we do with them and the purposes to which we use them. In short, our lives constitute vast complexes of stewardships, opportunities to manage a host of affairs. Doubtless the reason Jesus on several occasions spoke of the difficulty of the rich man's entering the kingdom of heaven is because of the magnitude of his earthly stewardship and his responsibility to use his riches for wise and righteous purposes. But, as I have indicated, it is not only the rich man who is a steward. Every human being is a steward entrusted with what we call his own life and all of the personal, family, social, religious, political, economic, and other relationships in which he finds himself.<br><br>Basically, what is our responsibility as stewards? Earlier we discovered that the answer to the question "What is the purpose of life?" or "What is our work?" was found by examining the Lord's statement concerning his work. Likewise, in this case, in order to determine our responsibility as stewards, let us reverently ask the question "What do gods do?" As we think of Heavenly Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and what they do--as revealed in the revelations they have given mankind--and as we contemplate our prayers and other communications with them, perhaps there is no better way to summarily describe what they do than to say simply, they bless. However else their work might be itemized, detailed, or listed, fundamentally, their great powers are used to bless mankind.<br><br>With the example of our Celestial Sire, our Redeemer, and the Holy Ghost, we are now able to answer the question "What is our responsibility as stewards?" Essentially, as stewards of all the circumstances and things entrusted to us, as previously described, it is our responsibility to so administer, manage, and use these things that we bless the lives of all with whom we associate. Certainly that is the sense of King Benjamin's declaration "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). We should not confuse serving with exploiting, profiteering, preying upon, taking advantage of, etc. We are to serve one another. The Lord said, "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matthew 23:11). He also said, "Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all" (Mark 10:43–44). Obviously, greatness is equated with service.<br><br>In the first 12 verses of Luke 16 is recorded the Lord's parable about the unjust steward. At the end of the parable the Lord gives counsel and asks two penetrating questions. In the first he counsels mankind to use their worldly wealth (earthly possessions) in such a way while they have it here in mortality that when they no longer have it in the eternal worlds they still will be benefited by the wise and righteous use they made of it when they did have it. Or, to put it differently, he counseled mankind to use their earthly riches while they have them in such a way that they will pay dividends in the eternal worlds. After this counsel, he then asked this question: "If . . . ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon [worldly wealth], who will commit to your trust the true riches?" (Luke 16:11). Then he asked the core question: "And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?" (Luke 16:12). That is, if we are not faithful stewards in managing or administering the things that belong to the Lord that are entrusted to us as mortals, surely we should not expect the time to come when the Lord would give us things to be our own. (See D&amp;amp;C 72:3–4 and D&amp;amp;C 104:13.) Therefore, our second endeavor in our preparation for eternal life is to be faithful stewards in managing all of the things entrusted to us as mortals by the Lord.<br><br>In this day the Lord has revealed a singular criterion to assist us in our pursuit of the two great endeavors--character and stewardship--in our preparation for eternal life. Of course, the gospel is called by the Lord in modern revelation the "new and everlasting covenant." In section 45 of the Doctrine and Covenants, he declared, "I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people" (D&amp;amp;C 45:9). In that statement the Lord makes a very significant distinction. The gospel is a light to the world, but to those who have made covenants with the Lord it must be a standard. For the covenant people the gospel is more than a light, as important as that is. It is a standard, and a standard is that which we use to measure other things. Therefore, for the covenant people the gospel is the standard by which all other things are measured. The gospel is not measured by other things, but all things are measured by the gospel--the new and everlasting covenant. That is a fundamental criterion in the effort to develop and acquire celestial character and manage and administer all of our affairs as faithful stewards.<br><br>Now let us return to our original question: "Why get an education?" I hope that the answer now emerges very clearly as similar to the answer to the other question: "What is the purpose of life?" As rich and full as we can make it, I see mortal life as essentially the preparation of ourselves and others for eternal life. And that preparation consists fundamentally of two endeavors: the development and acquisition of celestial character, and faithful stewardship of all things entrusted to us. Analogously, the purpose of an education--the formal kind sought in the school, college, and university, as well as the informal kind that we should pursue throughout our mortal lives–is twofold: to do all we can to make of ourselves better persons, and to continuously do all we can to prepare ourselves to serve others better and to continuously serve them better.<br><br>At the outset we mentioned several of many possible ways in which this period of time might be characterized or described. Obviously, we hope none of the negative ones is applicable to anyone here. As we contemplate the larger question of the purpose of life–and the more immediate but subordinate question "Why get an education?"--it emerges very clearly that, however the age might be described for others, for one who is aware of the thoughts considered here, this for him or her is "My Age of Preparation." May we consciously strive to improve daily in our pursuit of celestial character and be more consciously aware of the great complex of things within the scope of our individual stewardships as we anticipate having to give an account of them, and may we ever be aware that for each of us this is My Age of Preparation, I humbly pray, in the holy name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David H. Yarn, Jr., was a BYU emeritus professor of philosophy when this devotional address was given on 6 August 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Our Fathers - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be with you in this Campus Education Week of the Church Educational System. Most of us in attendance had the chance to read the sixty-six-page class schedule, not counting the covers, before we came. It is worth careful study. It describes an offering that has grown to more than 1000 classes in this seventy-fourth year, with 180 faculty members and more than 600 volunteers. The description of what has been accomplished and will be provided fills our hearts with gratitude for those who have spent more hours than I can imagine to plan this great enterprise, for teachers who have invested lifetimes preparing for their presentations, and for those who will make it so enjoyable, including hundreds of BYU employees. For the Church Educational System and for all of us I ask that President Merrill J. Bateman extend our thanks to the people of BYU who in this Campus Education Week bless our lives and may not be able to be with us to hear our thanks.<br><br>That excellent class schedule also presents our theme: "Faith of Our Fathers," chosen in part because of the centennial of the state of Utah. Here is what it suggests we consider:<br><br><i>Much could be said about the toil and hardship endured by the Saints in their westward migration. Our focus is on their faith, obedience, and steadfastness in the face of immense difficulty and uncertainty. Although their physical circumstances were much different than ours, the personal trials and challenges may, in fact, be very similar.</i><br><br>That set me to thinking about similarities in our lives. If I could visit with each of you and listen to the story of your life and what you know of your ancestors' lives, my guess is that we would discover great differences. Each life is unique. That struck me as I reread journals and histories that have been passed down through the generations, describing lives of people as diverse as that of Mary Bommeli, my great-grandmother, and of Wilford Woodruff, a prophet of God. Yet I see a thread of faith, a particular faith, running in the lives of those heroes of the Restoration whose steadfastness and courage leave us in awe. Perhaps if we examine that thread today, we may find it in our own lives and strengthen it.<br><br>Those histories reveal as much about faith from what people did as from what they declared in words. Different as were their challenges and their responses, I thought I saw a recurring pattern. Here it is.<br><br>They shared a faith that the kingdom of God had been established for the last time, that it would triumph over great opposition and would become glorious in preparation for the day when the Savior would come to accept it, that it would stand forever, and that theirs was a rare privilege to have been called out of the world to build it.<br><br>They were sure that they were establishing Zion, a place of refuge. It is not surprising then that they plead for that Zion and that they expected not only to build it but to enjoy living in it. What is surprising is that their faith increased when they pleaded for Zion to be established even as they saw times of safety turn to times of testing.<br><br>Listen to the Prophet Joseph's pleadings in a letter from Kirtland to the exiled Saints in Missouri, December 10, 1833:<br><br><i>Now hear the prayer of your unworthy brother in the new and everlasting covenant:--O My God! Thou who hast called and chosen a few, through Thy weak instrument, by commandment, and sent them to Missouri, a place which Thou didst call Zion, and commanded Thy servants to consecrate it unto Thyself for a place of refuge and safety for the gathering of Thy Saints, to be built up a holy city unto Thyself; and as Thou hast said that no other place should be appointed like unto this, therefore, I ask Thee in the name of Jesus Christ, to return Thy people unto their houses and their inheritances, to enjoy the fruit of their labors; that all the waste places may be built up; that all the enemies of Thy people, who will not repent and turn unto Thee may be destroyed from off the face of the land; and let a house be built and established unto Thy name; and let all the losses that Thy people have sustained, be rewarded unto them, even more than four-fold, that the borders of Zion may be enlarged forever; and let her be established no more to be thrown down; and let all thy Saints, when they are scattered, as sheep, and are persecuted, flee unto Zion, and be established in the midst of her; and let her be organized according to Thy law; and let this prayer ever be recorded before Thy face. Give Thy Holy Spirit unto my brethren, unto whom I write; send Thine angels to guard them, and deliver them from all evil; and when they turn their faces toward Zion, and bow down before Thee and pray, may their sins never come up before Thy face, neither have place in the book of Thy remembrance; and may they depart from all their iniquities. Provide food for them as Thou doest for the ravens; provide clothing to cover their nakedness, and houses that they may dwell therein; give unto them friends in abundance, and let their names be recorded in the Lamb's book of life, eternally before Thy face. Amen.</i>[<i>HC</i>1:456]<br><br>Now, after such a pleading, listen to the faith in this account, written by the Prophet Joseph on March 1, 1842, after the sorrows of Missouri and in the promise of Nauvoo. See if disappointment has dimmed faith.<br><br><i>We next settled in Caldwell and Daviess counties, where we made large and extensive settlements, thinking to free ourselves from the power of oppression, by settling in new counties, with very few inhabitants in them; but here we were not allowed to live in peace, but in 1838 we were again attacked by mobs, an exterminating order was issued by Governor Boggs, and under the sanction of law, an organized banditti ranged through the country, robbed us of our cattle, sheep, hogs, &amp;amp;c., many of our people were murdered in cold blood, the chastity of our women was violated, and we were forced to sign away our property at the point of the sword; and after enduring every indignity that could be heaped upon us by an inhuman, ungodly band of marauders, from twelve to fifteen thousand souls, men, women, and children were driven from their own firesides, and from lands to which they had warrantee deeds, houseless, friendless, and homeless (in the depths of winter) to wander as exiles on the earth, or to seek an asylum in a more genial clime, and among a less barbarous people. Many sickened and died in consequence of the cold and hardships they had to endure; many wives were left widows, and children, orphans, and destitute.</i><br><br>The statement then goes on to say:<br><br><i>In the situation before alluded to, we arrived in the state of Illinois in 1839, where we found a hospitable people and a friendly home: a people who were willing to be governed by the principles of law and humanity. We have commenced to build a city called "Nauvoo," in Hancock county. We number from six to eight thousand here, besides vast numbers in the county around, and in almost every county of the state. We have a city charter granted us, and charter for a Legion, the troops of which now number 1,500. We have also a charter for a University, for an Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, have our own laws and administrators, and possess all the privileges that other free and enlightened citizens enjoy.</i><br><br><i>Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only added fuel to the flame, it has spread with increasing rapidity. Proud of the cause which they have espoused, and conscious of our innocence, and of the truth of their system, amidst calumny and reproach, have the Elders of this Church gone forth, and planted the Gospel in almost every state in the Union; it has penetrated our cities, it has spread over our villages, and has caused thousands of our intelligent, noble, and patriotic citizens to obey its divine mandates, and be governed by its sacred truths. It has also spread into England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, where, in the year 1840, a few of our missionaries were sent, and over five thousand joined the Standard of Truth; there are numbers now joining in every land.</i><br><br><i>Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in Germany, Palestine, New Holland, Australia, the East Indies, and other places, the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.</i>["The Wentworth Letter,"<i>HC</i>4:539–40]<br><br>The Prophet and the faithful Saints expected trials. They knew the Lord would deliver them. They believed what Nephi taught:<br><br><i>But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.</i>[1 Nephi 1:20]<br><br>And they knew they would need such deliverance time and time again, as opposition would rise. They knew that the times of peace would be temporary, and so made of them times of gratitude and of boldness to go forward with the work.<br><br>As the leaders grew in faith through the cycles of opposition and deliverance followed by more opposition, so did the people. One was my great-grandmother, Mary Bommeli, a little black-eyed, teenage convert from Switzerland when she crossed the plains. I recently stood in the area of her childhood. I had always pictured it as on the side of an alp, but I was wrong. It is in the green rolling hills of northern Switzerland, with rich farmland and productive vineyards. I wish we had been able to find the house where the missionaries taught her and her family and where they all came to know that the gospel of Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God had been restored and where they chose to give their lives to the kingdom--the older boys to go on missions and the rest to gather to America to build Zion. They left a beautiful place of safety for the unknown.<br><br>Mary chose to let the others go first without her. She knew she could make the money for passage with her weaving but that the others could not. She chose to let them go on missions and to America using all the money they could get from selling all they owned. She went alone from city to city weaving cloth for women, trusting in God. She also got herself arrested for preaching the gospel where it was illegal in Germany because she could not contain the good news within her.<br><br>She got to America, joined a pioneer company, and walked across the plains. She described that crossing on foot as one of the happiest times of her life. On that walk she met a returning missionary, Henry Eyring. They went in front of the wagon train to be clear of the dust. They described that trek not as a trial but as a time of joy as they told each other what a remarkable chance was theirs to have been found by the servants of God and to be allowed to help build the kingdom of God in the last days. They fell in love. For them, that passage was not a trial but a time of refreshing, of refuge. They chose to see in it a respite, he from his five-year mission and she from working her way alone from Switzerland. It was their youthful faith that made it a romantic stroll.<br><br>For Mary and for Henry, the trials began in the promised land. After their marriage, only Mary's weaving kept them from starvation. Henry was university-trained in Germany but ignorant of the skills needed to pioneer in the wilderness. They built a small home. Neither of them knew how to make adobe bricks. When the rains came, the roof leaked and then a wall collapsed. It fell on Mary, who was pregnant with their first child. Only the remarkable fact that her loom protected her from the falling bricks saved her from greater harm. But the child she was carrying was injured. He was born with physical handicaps from which he was delivered only by death.<br><br>With ceaseless labor and prayers they began to rise from poverty, in Davis County and in Salt Lake City. But that time of peace was cut short. President Brigham Young suggested that they move to St. George. They went to the unknown again, built homes, planted gardens, and served in the kingdom. Henry became the mayor of St. George for a time, a counselor in the stake presidency, and manager of the cooperative store. They helped build the St. George Temple, and Mary found joy in officiating there for twelve years. She wrote of that service as if she had felt the peace the Lord promised when he commanded that a temple be built long before. This is the promise from the book of Haggai in the Old Testament:<br><br><i>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.</i>[Haggai 2:9]<br><br>But Mary heard what she considered a call from an apostle to move on from that time of peace. It was suggested that they join in the establishment of the Mormon colonies in northern Mexico. They went believing that the Lord would sustain them in his service. As nearly as I can sense from what they wrote about the move, they trusted that this promise applied to them:<br><br><i>There I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:88]<br><br>They saw more safety going forward to unknown service in the kingdom than in staying with the known and the comfortable. They left what had become for them a Zion to help the Lord build another--not out of blind obedience, since they were invited and not called, but in faith that the wisest course for them was to go where they might best build the kingdom.<br><br>In Mexico the pattern of deliverance repeated itself for them. In time they were blessed with homes and gardens. Henry went away on a mission to the south in Mexico, as he had previously done from Utah to Germany, and he built up the cooperative store in Colonia Juarez as he had in St. George. Mary again gave tireless service in Relief Society. Their work and their faith again brought a taste of the peace that will be in the city of Zion. And then Henry died. The Mexican Revolution came. Mary and her family walked away from all they had built as they made their exodus to the United States. She died a widow, a refugee from that idyllic time in Mexico, yet full of faith in the destiny of the kingdom of God and in its head, Jesus Christ, as her deliverer.<br><br>Mary's story is worth telling not because it is exceptional but because it isn't. The growth in her faith seemed as constant in times of deliverance as it was in times of trial. That seems to have been true for each pioneer whose story I read. It seems to me that was true because their faith was based on an understanding of why God allows us to pass into such close places and how he delivers us. The "how" springs from the "why." The why is that our loving Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, wish for us to be sanctified that we may have eternal life with them. That requires our being cleansed through faith in Jesus Christ, repenting because of that faith, and proving ourselves faithful to the covenants they offer us only through their mortal servants in the kingdom of God. Knowing their loving purpose makes it easier to understand both why they allow trials and how they deliver us.<br><br>They could make all the rough places smooth in building the kingdom and in our lives. They allow trials to come even when we are faithful because they love us. There are some scriptures that now seem clearer to me after reading those pioneer journals.<br><br>This one is from D&amp;amp;C 105:19:<br><br><i>I have heard their prayers, and will accept their offering; and it is expedient in me that they should be brought thus far for a trial of their faith.</i><br><br>Here is another we have heard often, from Ether 12:6:<br><br><i>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i><br><br>But for me, the greatest comfort comes from this one in D&amp;amp;C 95:1:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have loved you.</i><br><br>I have come to understand that to try our faith is not simply to test it but to strengthen it, that the witness which comes after the testing strengthens that faith, and that God's preparation includes in the plan for deliverance the timing that will best strengthen our faith.<br><br>It is clear that the quickest deliverance does not always go to those with the most faith. A remarkable example of immediate deliverance is the preservation of the children of Israel not when they were full of faith but when they murmured. You remember their complaint and the Lord's answer through Moses:<br><br><i>Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</i>[Exodus 14:12–13]<br><br>A loving father may have given speedy deliverance to help their wavering faith, but those with greater faith may gain more from delay. At least that seems to be the lot of some of the best and most faithful people. It is for such faithful Saints that the Lord may be giving reassurance in the words of D&amp;amp;C 58:3–4:<br><br><i>Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation.</i><br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings. Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand.</i><br><br>The Lord's "nigh at hand" is often not as nigh as we would choose. But he sometimes honors the most faithful by offering the chance to share his view of time. And we stand in awe of those who patiently bow to the Lord's longer view, in the process becoming more like him, beginning to see as he sees.<br><br>Some of our trials do not end in this life. For that, our Lord promises us strength to endure this way:<br><br><i>And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.</i>[Alma 36:3]<br><br>The Savior himself chose troubles and afflictions so that he could make us that promise of perfect understanding. All who trust him for strength to endure to the end of life treasure these words:<br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><br><br><i>Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</i>[Alma 7:12–13]<br><br>Those words, "That he might blot out their transgressions," remind us of the sweetest and the surest deliverance of all. Of all the tests we face, none hurts more than the death of a loved one or the misery of sin. Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ all are delivered from death, and all will rise in the Resurrection, regardless of their transgressions. And by the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all may gain peace in this life washed clean from the sorrows of sin and have hope of a glorious resurrection with the just.<br><br>I listened to a man describe what it meant to his family to be built on the foundation of Jesus Christ. For them it was to know that their son would rise in the Resurrection; there he could finish the training of his infant son from whom he had been parted by death. Through their faith in the Savior, the family was delivered from sorrow and lifted to a place of peace. Gratitude for such deliverance appears often in the histories of pioneers, partly because death struck so often so early.<br><br>We find less mention of the deliverance from sin, since that is so private a matter. But it was there as surely as it is in our lives. Each of us has in some degree felt the deliverance described in the history of Alma the Younger. You remember his words, which gladden us every time we hear them and bring back floods of gratitude for our own deliverance:<br><br><i>And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.</i><br><br><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i><br><br><i>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</i>[Alma 36:19–22]<br><br>The peace of forgiveness and of hope in the Resurrection can come wherever we are. The peace that passeth understanding does not depend on a geographic place. The place of refuge is finally in our hearts. The Lord had at least two meanings when he said in D&amp;amp;C 97:21, "Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion--the pure in heart." Zion is where the pure in heart are gathered; that gathering creates a Zion. But in one person whose heart is cleansed by the Atonement and filled with the hope of eternal life there is a place of peace and refuge, too.<br><br>So we can choose to make our days here in this Campus Education Week a time of refreshing and this place a refuge. The people I thanked as I began today--the planners, the teachers, the workers--all of them have labored to make this such a time and such a place for us. I thanked them not only because they deserved it, but because we needed to offer the thanks. Our gratitude for them can turn our thoughts to gratitude to the Savior, for whom they did this more than they did it for us. And when our thoughts turn to him in gratitude and in faith, the Holy Spirit can bring peace to our hearts.<br><br>With that feeling of peace comes a desire to serve. That is why those who have felt the blessings of baptism and confirmation feel impelled to share the gospel with others. That's why Mary Bommeli went to jail. Now, we can't get to all the activities and classes described in those sixty-six pages of the class schedule. But in whatever class we find ourselves, we can do what one of those hero pioneers might have done. We can remember the Savior and that we are blessed to be in his kingdom, and we can have in our hearts the question "How would the Master have me use something from this hour to serve him?" If we ask that in faith, with determination to follow the promptings that come from the Holy Spirit, those promptings will come. We will hear things we would not have heard and feel things we would not have felt.<br><br>We will go out from this place with plans to help build the kingdom. We will go out refreshed in our hearts and surer that what our pioneers believed was true: the kingdom of God has been restored and we are blessed as the few among our Father's myriad children to build it for the Master for the last time.<br><br>If we do that, another blessing will come from these days. Some words will become as certain to us as they were to those pioneers. Listen to them now, from D&amp;amp;C 45:66–71:<br><br><i>And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God;</i><br><br><i>And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety.</i><br><br><i>And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another.</i><br><br><i>And it shall be said among the wicked: Let us not go up to battle against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy.</i><br><br>I testify that God the Father lives. I testify that Jesus Christ, the Son of God the Father in the flesh, came to the earth in the meridian of time, atoned for our sins, and established his kingdom with apostles and prophets. I know, as surely as if I had been there, that God the Father and the Savior appeared to the boy Joseph Smith; that they sent authorized servants to restore all the keys of the kingdom of God for the last time; and that those keys now are held by President Gordon B. Hinckley and exercised for the benefit of our Heavenly Father's children only in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I testify that this is the kingdom seen by prophets since the beginning and that our Savior is at its head, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B.

<h1>on a Hill: the Mission and Aims of BYU - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for giving me a second opportunity to speak to you. As most of you may remember, I missed this assignment last year because of open-heart surgery. President Boyd K. Packer graciously took my place. You were blessed abundantly to receive his inspired message, "The Snow-White Birds" (BYU Annual University Conference, 29 August 1995). It seems that the message from President Packer, after his 34 years as a member of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees, was destined to be given to you upon his release from this distinguished service. Although all members of the Twelve have a vital interest in the educational affairs of the Church, it is currently the policy of the First Presidency to rotate our service on the Church Board of Education and other assignments. I thank my quorum president publicly for all that he has done for education, and I also thank him for his constant watch care over the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.<br><br>May I share my personal testimony with you that President Merrill J. Bateman was called to serve as president of BYU through the inspiration of heaven. I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the confirmation of the Spirit that came to each member of the search committee (with the possible exception of one--Bishop Bateman, who missed our last meeting). In that meeting, the other committee members had the opportunity to discuss Bishop Bateman as a candidate to be the president of BYU. The search committee was united and pleased to recommend him to the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to fill this most important assignment. Time has already proven the inspiration of his appointment, and the future will reinforce his selection as the right one to lead BYU at this time. You should understand that the direction taken in his administration is not of his own making. He is following carefully the commission given to him by the board of trustees. And he has their full support in what he is doing.<br><h2><b>Mission and Aims of BYU</b></h2><br>I appreciate the work of so many of you in producing this document<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education</i>(Provo: BYU, 1995). I assume all of you have read and accepted its contents. I suppose only at BYU would the main university mission be to "assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" (p. 1). To some academic institutions, this statement may seem to be pure nonsense. To Latter-day Saints, however, it encompasses the very purpose for our life here in mortality. This mission statement applies to all we are attempting to do in the Church. I, along with the other members of the board of trustees, wholeheartedly endorse<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education.</i>I am impressed with the inspired words in this pamphlet. The mission statement dates back to November 1981, and the "aims" were approved by the board of trustees in 1995. This pamphlet deserves careful, periodic reading and a commitment by all of you to fulfill these inspired objectives. The aims document was developed as part of a massive self-study project that many of you participated in. We gratefully acknowledge the tremendous work accomplished by the Self-Study Committee. As a member of the board of trustees, I look forward to reviewing the recommendations of that committee as they are brought forward by your president to be considered by the board of trustees.<br><br>The last paragraph of the mission statement reads:<br><br><i>We believe the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission can have a strong effect on the course of higher education and will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University's</i>influence in a world we wish to improve. [<i>Mission and Aims,</i>p. 2; emphasis added]<br><br>Let's talk for a few minutes about the world that the graduates of Brigham Young University will face, with particular emphasis on the United States of America. From<i>The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators,</i>by William J. Bennett, which is the most comprehensive statistical portrait available of behavioral trends over the last 30 years, I quote several highlights that explain the shocking conditions in the United States.<br><h2><b>Violent Crime</b></h2><br>Since 1960, the increase in violent crime has been more than 500 percent (see William J. Bennett,<i>Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</i>[New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994], p. 22).<br><br>"The fastest growing segment of the criminal population is our nation's children" (p. 30).<br><br>"Twenty percent of high school students now carry a firearm, knife, razor, club, or some other weapon on a regular basis" (p. 31).<br><br>"In 1991, in Los Angeles, there was a greater chance that a citizen would die from a bullet wound than from a traffic accident" (p. 25).<br><br>"Today, 70 percent of the juvenile offenders in long-term correctional facilities grew up without a father in the household" (p. 32).<br><h2><b>Breakdown of the Family</b></h2><br>As President Lyndon B. Johnson said, "The family is the cornerstone of our society. More than any other force it shapes the attitude, the hopes, the ambitions, and the values of the child. And when the family collapses, it is the children that are usually damaged" (p. 45).<br><br>Since 1960, the number of illegitimate births in this country has increased more than 400 percent (see p. 46).<br><br>"In 1961 and 1991, roughly the same number of babies were born (about 4 million)--but in 1991,<i>five times</i>as many of them were born out of wedlock" (p. 47; emphasis added).<br><br>Author Charles Murray said that "illegitimacy is the single most important social problem of our time--more important than crime, drugs, poverty, illiteracy, welfare or homelessness<i>because it drives everything else"</i>(p. 48; emphasis added).<br><br>"Since 1972, there have been more than 28 million abortions in the United States. . . . Eighty-three percent of abortions are performed on white females, and 17 percent on minority women" (pp. 68–69).<br><br>"Approximately 40 percent of teenage pregnancies, about 400,000 a year, end in abortion. Teens account for more than one-quarter of the total number of abortions in the U.S. annually" (p. 75). Even so, "the rate of births to unmarried teenagers has increased almost 200 percent since 1960" (p. 72).<br><br>"The United States has the highest divorce rate in the world" (p. 59).<br><br>"According to some projections, only 6 percent of black children and 30 percent of white children born in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18" (p. 51).<br><br>"Approximately<i>90 percent</i>of single-parent homes are homes without a father" (p. 51; emphasis added).<br><br>"Half the single mothers in the United States live below the poverty line" (p. 52).<br><br>"More than one child in eight is being raised on government welfare through Aid to Families with Dependent Children" (p. 64).<br><br>Government officials say that "the best anti-poverty program for children is a stable, intact family" (p. 63).<br><h2><b>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</b></h2><br>Can you see why these concerns prompted the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to issue a proclamation to the world on the family? Let me read to you the proclamation:<br><br><i>WE, THE FIRST PRESIDENCY and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</i><br><br><i>ALL HUMAN BEINGS--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i><br><br><i>IN THE PREMORTAL REALM, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.</i><br><br><i>THE FIRST COMMANDMENT that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife.</i><br><br><i>WE DECLARE the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.</i><br><br><i>HUSBAND AND WIFE have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. "Children are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalms 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives--mothers and fathers--will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.</i><br><br><i>THE FAMILY is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed.</i><br><br><i>WE WARN that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.</i><br><br><i>WE CALL UPON responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society.</i><br><br>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World--The First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 102]<br><br>It is no small thing for 15 prophets, seers, and revelators to warn the people of the world that "the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets." We must strengthen the basic unit of our society and of the Church, the family. I read the full text of the proclamation to you because the answers to the problems facing the families of the world are found in the doctrine of the Church. I believe that spiritually prepared BYU graduates, along with all of our extensive missionary efforts, can improve the families of the world.<br><br>If, in combination with academic truth, gospel principles are clearly taught by you and received by your students with spiritual confirmation, this university will send into the world men and women of understanding, faith, and integrity--men and women who have a clear vision of the eternal purposes of life for individuals and families. Perhaps over time our combined voices will be heard and the families of the world will find in the teachings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ the real answers to lasting peace and happiness.<br><br>I return now to William F. Bennett's report.<br><h2><b>Suicide</b></h2><br>Since 1960, the teenage suicide rate has tripled, and "for every successful suicide there are at least fifty to one hundred adolescent suicide attempts" (pp. 78–79).<br><h2><b>Sat Scores</b></h2><br>In the last 30 years, SAT scores have dropped almost 75 points (see p. 84).<br><br>"In a 1989<i>National Geographic</i>survey of geographical knowledge, Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 finished last among nine countries, including Mexico" (p. 85).<br><h2><b>Impact of Television</b></h2><br>"In 1960, the average daily television viewing per household was 5:06 hours. By 1992, it had increased to 7:04 hours. . . . The average teenager spends 1.8 hours per week reading, 5.6 hours per week on homework, and an average of 21 hours per week watching television. . . . In contrast to the 3 hours per day they spend watching TV, teenagers spend an average of 5 minutes per day alone with their fathers, and 20 minutes with their mothers. A Carnegie Corporation study found that even the time teenagers spend with their families consists primarily of eating or watching television together" (pp. 102–3).<br><br>"In 1990, more than 98 percent of all households had at least one television set. More American households have televisions than have indoor plumbing" (p. 103).<br><br>"The average child watches up to 8,000 made-for-TV murders and 100,000 acts of violence by the end of grade school" (p. 104).<br><br>Although "more than 85 percent of the country identifies itself as either Protestant or Catholic," "according to one study, only 20 percent of Protestants and 28 percent of Catholics attend church in any given week" (p. 116). And, in the words of Margaret Thatcher, "There is little hope for democracy if the hearts of men and women in democratic societies cannot be touched by a call to something greater than themselves" (p. 117).<br><br>Dr. Bennett goes on:<br><br><i>The social regression of the last 30 years is due in large part to the enfeebled state of our social institutions and their failure to carry out a critical and time-honored task:</i>the moral education of the young. We desperately need to recover a sense of the fundamental purpose of education, which is to engage in the architecture of souls. [p. 12; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Treatises have been written on why this has occurred, on why we have allowed this to occur. The hard truth is that in a free society the ultimate responsibility rests with the people themselves.</i>[p. 10]<br><br>The Bennett report contains much more information, but what I have shared is sufficient to demonstrate the critical need for the mission of BYU and the aims of a BYU education to in fact be accomplished so your graduates will be fortified spiritually to righteously lead others in this ever-crumbling society of ours. With a BYU education that is "(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service," your students can be a great "influence in a world we wish to improve" (<i>Mission and Aims,</i>pp. 3, 2).<br><h2><b>Fulfilling the Mission of BYU</b></h2><br>Although there are many good and wonderful things happening across this campus, as evidenced by the high marks earned last March in the visit by the accreditation team from the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges--a direct result of the good work being done by you--I believe you can still do more. I believe you can be more focused on the central mission of Brigham Young University. As teachers you must be absolutely expert in your academic disciplines--you must then use that expertise to teach your students in a way that feeds them spiritually and anchors them to faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. This must apply not only in the classroom but also in the dorms, in student activities, and in the hundreds of places across this campus where devoted staff people supervise BYU student employees. Whatever our assignment, we must be dedicated to building testimonies and providing appropriate examples by our conduct, our unity, and our support for each other and our love for our students.<br><br>Brigham Young's charge to Brother Maeser--"I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God"--surely applies to each one of you today (in Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1953], p. 26). You have heard this taught here time and time again. However, in these times more than in any others, I believe the youth of the Church need to hear<i>the certain sound of faith</i>in the Lord Jesus Christ and see a<i>united trust</i>in the leaders of his Church. As you know, there are many unusual things happening in and out of the Church that have a tendency to confuse and misguide our youth. Perhaps at no time in the history of this university or of the Church has it been more important for professors and teachers, for staff, and for the administration to be united in the support of the mission and the aims of the university. All the leaders of the Church--including the faculty and staff on this campus and the teachers within the stakes and wards--need to stay anchored to the underlying principles and values espoused by the Church in order to ensure that we prepare strong leadership for the Church in the years that lie ahead. Testimony must be centered in the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it must be deeply rooted in all of us. Perhaps this story of the<i>Queen Mary</i>that I recently read is applicable.<br><br>When the<i>Queen Mary</i>was launched in 1935, she was the largest and most powerful sailing vessel ever to cross the oceans. She enjoyed a distinguished career--her decades of service included significant involvement in World War II. After her retirement, the<i>Queen Mary</i>was anchored in Long Beach, California, and converted into a hotel and museum. Sister Ballard and I spent a night in the captain's cabin as guests of the owner.<br><br>Restoration crews removed three massive smokestacks in order to scrape and paint them. Once detached from their supported location, however, the stacks crumbled. The three-quarter-inch steel plate from which they had been constructed had completely disintegrated. All that remained of the<i>Queen Mary</i>'s stacks were the layers of paint that had been applied during the years. The<i>Queen Mary</i>suffered a condition that is also common to humankind. Polished and attractive exteriors crumble if not supported internally by enduring substance. Personally and professionally, our lives can break down, deteriorate, or even collapse if we lack a solid set of values and standards.<br><br>We believe that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36) and that<br><br><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>And so we follow the scriptural admonition to seek diligently and to "teach one another words of wisdom," to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). But even as the Lord encouraged his people to "study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people" (D&amp;amp;C 90:15), we are also warned to "beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ" (Colossians 2:8). And Nephi said it this way: "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost" (2 Nephi 28:31). Therefore, everything you do, every concept you teach, should have nestled securely in its very core the notion of bringing souls unto Christ and building up the kingdom of God upon the earth.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<br><br><i>BYU exists to build character and faith. This institution [BYU] has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service--men and women who will become stalwarts in the kingdom and bear witness of the restoration and the divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. . . . This institution has been established by a prophet of God for a very specific purpose: to combine spiritual and moral values and secular education.</i>[Edward L. Kimball, ed.,<i>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982), p. 395]<br><br>And just last October, in his general conference address, President Gordon B. Hinckley gave this clarion and upbeat call:<br><br><i>This is an age of pessimism. Ours is a mission of faith. To my brethren and sisters everywhere, I call upon you to reaffirm your faith, to move this work forward across the world. You can make it stronger by the manner in which you live. Let the gospel be your sword and your shield. Each of us is a part of the greatest cause on earth. Its doctrine came of revelation. Its priesthood came of divine bestowal. Another witness has been added to its testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is literally the little stone of Daniel's dream which was "cut out of the mountain without hands [to] roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 65:2). . . .</i><br><br><i>How glorious is the past of this great cause. It is filled with heroism, courage, boldness, and faith. How wondrous is the present as we move forward to bless the lives of people wherever they will hearken to the message of the servants of the Lord. How magnificent will be the future as the Almighty rolls on His glorious work touching for good all who will accept and live His gospel.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Stay the Course--Keep the Faith,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, p. 72]<br><br>In a recent essay entitled "Can Notre Dame Be Saved?" David W. Lutz muses on the unusual challenges faced by his school and by Christian universities the world over (in<i>First Things,</i>no. 19 [January 1992]). Lutz indicates:<br><br><i>The real danger comes from a . . . group of persons who believe that Notre Dame can strive for ever-higher standards of academic excellence--and use the same criteria of excellence by which the best secular universities in the land are judged to be excellent--without forfeiting the Catholic character of the University.</i>[p. 35]<br><br>Lutz states that<br><br><i>our objective should be not merely to teach values, but to teach values radically different from and superior to those taught at secular universities. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Christians should not let civil libertarians and secular humanists decide for us what it means to be free. . . .</i><br><br><i>True academic freedom is not freedom from ecclesiastical authority, but freedom to speak the truth. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . One of the things a</i>[Christian]<i>university should do is introduce students to intellectual positions opposed to Christianity. But to place a higher priority on challenging students' faith than on teaching them how to defend their faith against attack is simply imprudent. . . . To attack faith without first nurturing it is like teaching people to swim by dropping them in the middle of the ocean.</i>[pp. 37–38]<br><br>Lutz concludes:<br><br><i>What every Christian academic institution needs is not merely faculty members who are Christians in some minimal sense, but scholars who take their Christian faith so seriously that they believe it should be integrated with their scholarship.</i>[p. 39]<br><br>I believe, my brothers and sisters, that much of what David Lutz said not only applies to Notre Dame but also applies to BYU. President Bateman shared with the board of trustees in June five strategic priorities for the future. He explained that his administration will focus on:<br><br>1. Building on religious foundations<br><br>2. Blessing students<br><br>3. Strengthening teaching<br><br>4. Improving communication between administration, faculty, and staff<br><br>5. Sharpening institutional focus<br><br>With these strategic priorities, coupled with the mission and the aims of a BYU education unitedly supported by your skills and talents, BYU will produce sound-thinking men and women of faith who will bring into our sick world the healing influence of the teachings of the restored Church of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In closing, brothers and sisters, I believe what the world and the Church need most are men and women of sound judgment with the ability to use their education for the eternal benefit of themselves, their families, and all of our Father's children. On my office wall hangs a small framed statement of the last words of my Grandfather Elder Melvin J. Ballard, "Above all else, . . . let us think straight." May the Lord bless each of you with the gift of "straight thinking."<br><br>My thanks go to each of you in your various assignments for your significant contribution in making BYU a university worthy in every way to be blessed by the Lord. My testimony is unwavering: Jesus is the Christ; he is the Only Begotten Son of our Heavenly Father; he lives and directs this, his Church, the only true and living church upon the face of the earth. May the peace of the Lord bless and guide each one of you--in your personal lives, in your families, and in your special stewardship here at Brigham Young University--now and always.<br><br>I invoke a special blessing upon you, my beloved brothers and sisters, that, with the feeling and the sense of responsibility we all have as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we will stand before the world as a light unto the world, and we will stand united. If there be any of us who have a difference or choose to make correction with one another, may we have the courtesy to do that privately.<br><br>I humbly pray that each one of you will have the Spirit of the Lord in your homes; that your families may be blessed; that you may be watched over and cared for; that your minds may be keen; that you may teach your subjects with power; and that you may have the satisfaction when a student leaves you of knowing you did your part to fortify him or her spiritually to go into a world that we need to improve, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>ion of Brigham Young University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The events of the past two weeks have caused me to reflect deeply on the responsibilities inherent in the presidency of this university. Four years ago I received a charge to be an especial witness for the Lord Jesus Christ. This charge weighs heavily on me and extends to my role as president. In every way I wish to enhance the academic quality of this institution while achieving a balance between the sacred and the secular. In no way do I intend to diminish its quality or reputation. It is my responsibility to be an example of the standards set for Brigham Young University by the board, by the doctrines of the kingdom, and by the Lord himself. I do understand to whom I am accountable. I believe in the divine destiny of Brigham Young University more now than ever before. At the same time, I have become more sensitive to your dreams and aspirations as I have interacted with many of you during the past eight months. If this university is to achieve its potential, the best of every faculty, staff, and administrative member is required.<br><h2><b>Maintaining High Standards</b></h2><br>Before discussing with you the plans for the future, I wish to address the charges levied against me two weeks ago by one or more members of our academic community. The charge of plagiarism is serious in any context but especially in an academic setting. The charge appeared in the media on the day of summer commencement. I learned about it one day earlier. Unfortunately, my schedule for three days did not provide time to address the problem adequately. In the time that elapsed, a number of concerns weighed heavily on me. May I share them with you.<br><br>The first concern was for Ms. Gertrude Himmelfarb, the person innocently drawn into the controversy. It was her intellectual property at the center of the accusation. Reference was not made to her work in the public address, but her article was cited in the printed version. Was the citation adequate? Once I had time to review the printed version of the speech plus Ms. Himmelfarb's article and realize that her work had been cited but an ambiguity existed, I spoke with Ms. Himmelfarb by telephone and sent her a letter containing an apology for the incident and an explanation.<br><br>The second concern was for the reputation of the university and its members. Had I been so careless as to quote from another person's work without due recognition? Even if inadvertent, that is not the standard I wish to live by or the operating standard at this institution. The standard of truthfulness required of all members of this community is of the highest level. Anything short of our best efforts in this regard is not acceptable. In particular, my performance must be exemplary.<br><br>With regard to this second concern, I reflected on the care one must take in referencing the work of others. All departments at the university stress the importance of academic integrity in preparing documents that draw on outside sources. Intellectual property is as real as real property. I know that. In the past I have meticulously tried to give credit where appropriate. My philosophy in preparing talks or articles has been that it is better to buttress one's own arguments with the well-reasoned position of a recognized authority. Consequently, I was shocked by the plagiarism charge.<br><br>The charge was made known to me Wednesday morning, August 14. At the time, I had only a few minutes to examine the material. The sentences from my address were displayed in a table. They were disjointed and appeared to be without attribution. The speech was four months old, and only faint shadows of its construction remained in my memory. As stated earlier, the absence of attribution was unusual because I know the rules and have tried carefully to follow them. In a public address it is sometimes cumbersome to note every attribution, but my printed versions have always included appropriate citations. Unfortunately, the schedule for the next three days left no time to examine my speech or Himmelfarb's article, given the responsibilities associated with commencement and other meetings.<br><br>On Saturday morning I examined the speech and its construction. As I read the address, I immediately realized what had happened. What had been presented in the accusatory article as disjointed sentences without attribution were consecutive sentences in one paragraph plus the first part of a second. At the end of the first paragraph is an appropriate citation. What confused the accusatory author was that the citation directly followed a short phrase placed inside quotation marks. The quotation marks created the ambiguity as the critics assumed that the reference to Ms. Himmelfarb referred only to the short phrase when it referred to the preceding sentences in the paragraph. Two other sentences summarizing Himmelfarb's points begin a new paragraph one sentence later. Initially they were part of the sequence in the preceding paragraph with the appropriate citation. When a Dostoyevsky statement was inserted toward the end of the paragraph, these two sentences were put in the next paragraph. An op. cit. was inadvertently omitted. I am grateful that<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>carefully reviewed the anonymous charge, saw the sequential sentences, and noted that a citation followed. Their comment on this matter is as follows:<br><br><i>After paraphrasing Ms. Himmelfarb in six sentences, Mr. Bateman did cite Ms. Himmelfarb's article. He placed the citation after the last of the paraphrases, "The slogan is 'everything is political.'" Ms. Himmelfarb had written, "'Everything is political,' the popular slogan has it."</i>["Brigham Young's President Accused of Plagiarism in Inaugural Speech,"<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education,</i>News Update for Friday, 16 August 1996, web site]<br><br>The<i>Chronicle</i>published their comments on the web on Friday, August 16. I read their statement the following Monday, two days after the letter for Ms. Himmelfarb was prepared.<br><br>I apologize for the ambiguity and inattention that created the confusion. The attribution could and should have been clearer. I promise to be more careful in the future.<br><br>A third concern was and is for a few members of our community who feel the need to hide behind the cloak of anonymity. This is an open university, and I pledge to maintain that atmosphere. Reasonable men and women will differ in their views, but there are established procedures for resolving differences. Heads of departments, deans, and the administration have an open-door policy. The Faculty and Administrative Advisory Councils are additional forums for discussion. The administration has had brown bags with the faculty and staff in the past and will continue to do so. My door is always open, as many of you know.<br><br>The Savior also provided a formula for resolving differences. He said:<br><br><i>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</i><br><br><i>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</i>[Matthew 18:15–16]<br><br>Within the university, anonymous letters regarding faculty or staff are ignored and returned to the person cited. Signed letters are given to the dean, department head, and appropriate faculty or staff for your information and discussion.<br><br>Five years ago the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve issued a statement counseling members not to participate in symposia where presentations injure the Church or are not appropriate ("Church Leaders Issue Statement Counseling Members," Public Communications Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 23 August 1991). I believe the publication of an anonymous article by a symposia group denigrating members of the Twelve and advocating the transformation of BYU into a secular university supports the wisdom of that statement.<br><h2><b>Balancing the Sacred and the Secular</b></h2><br>May I shift now to a topic that is at the core of this institution's existence. Last December President Faust spoke to a small campus group and stated the following: "Brigham Young University is a continuing experiment in whether a university whose board of trustees comprises prophets, seers, and revelators can remain a first-class university and not become secularized." The last eight months, but especially the last two weeks, have deepened my understanding of his expression. At the time he spoke, my thoughts were: "Of course the test will be successful! The sacred and the secular have coexisted on this campus for more than 120 years. The merging of the two parts will not only continue but will improve." I now see the matter in a different light. The divine mission of BYU is always at risk. The experiment will succeed only as long as the vast majority of the BYU community believes in and is committed to the university's divine mission. Most important, this includes faith in the leadership role of the board of trustees.<br><br>Fortunately, a very large majority of faculty, staff, and students (including nonmembers) are committed to the dual nature of this institution's mission. They support the leadership of the Church. They understand that the use of sacred funds to support<i>secular learning only</i>would be a breach of trust. They also understand that the board wants the curriculum to be as wide and deep as decency allows but hopes the teacher sees the world through eyes of faith. The Brethren's ultimate concern is not the range of topics but the knowledge gained by the student--both secular and sacred. Since the gospel embraces all truth, the breadth and depth of discussion are not at issue. The issue is the Spirit with which subjects are taught. In particular, doctrinally sensitive material must be taught with the aid of the Spirit and paradoxes should be noted. A mature faculty member will keep the students' options open when discussing questions where the sacred and secular appear to be in conflict. There are questions yet unanswered in the sacred realm as well as in the secular. The final test is if the teaching of the subject is both "intellectually enlarging" and "spiritually strengthening" (<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education</i>[Provo: BYU, 1995], p. 3). Since the gospel embraces all truth, I will paraphrase an idea from a recently published cartoon. We have "nothing to fear," not even "fear itself" ("Opinion,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>Tuesday, 20 August 1996, p. A10).<br><br>In contrast, there are many in academia who believe that it is impossible for an institution of higher education to achieve excellence if tied to a religious organization. They point to the secularization of Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Vanderbilt, and others to fortify their claim. Their position is that policies and procedures established by a board of trustees should not influence faculty hiring, establish codes of behavior, or encourage expression consistent with church doctrine. According to this view, the faculty hiring process will not cast a wide enough net, faculty expression will be too narrow; i.e., truth will be excluded. As one analyzes this line of reasoning, policies and procedures are not at the heart of the debate. They are secondary. The defining argument is who establishes policy?Who determines the character and nature of the university? Ultimately, the answer depends on one's faith.<br><br>If one believes in the restored gospel, that it contains important truths not found in the secular world, and that these truths are worthy of study, the case for a dual university can be made. If one believes in prophets, seers, and revelators as both the source of and stewards over sacred truth, then prophets have a legitimate role in defining the nature of any university they wish to establish and support. On the other hand, if one does not believe the restored gospel or Christianity or any other religion has significant truths worthy of study, or if one believes the presence and influence of prophets and sacred truth in an academic setting inhibits the quality and quantity of secular truth transferred, one would opt for a secular institution.<br><br>I am grateful that accrediting agencies, although dominated by academics from secular institutions, still recognize the value of dual-natured universities and allow the sponsors to define the mission. The Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges (NWASC) carefully reviewed<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University and The Aims of a BYU Education</i>and our "Statement on Academic Freedom," along with all other documents provided by the Self-Study Committee. Their final report stated:<br><br><i>Quite simply, the University claims simultaneously both a spiritual and an intellectual mission, and the present evaluators discovered persistent, significant testimony that these two aspirations . . . are consciously lived on campus, and inform virtually every decision that is made from curricular structure to the nature of faculty hiring to the process for promotion in rank and advancement to continuing status.</i>["Evaluation Committee Report," Commission on Colleges, Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges, March 17–20, 1996, p. 6]<br><br>The review committee not only recognized the causal connections between the dual nature of BYU and the hiring and promotion process, but they also confirmed its appropriateness and gave us high marks for our efforts.<br><br>The decision regarding the nature of BYU has been made and reconfirmed annually by prophets. The university has been extraordinarily successful in fulfilling its mission. The reason is you, the faculty and staff. Our tremendous student body also plays a vital role, as have all those who have gone before. You are men and women of faith who believe that the truths of the restored gospel are worthy of study and should be an integral part of the educational process. More than that, history shows that you teach and operate under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Deep inside each of us is a conviction that the sacred can be blended with the secular with neither overcoming the other, because "truth embraceth truth; . . . light cleaveth unto light" (D&amp;amp;C 88:40).<br><h2><b>BYU's Future</b></h2><br>Now, what are the plans for the future? The plan for the next few years is largely based on the Self-Study Report. As all are aware, the BYU family spent more than two years in an extensive internal examination as part of the university's strategic planning process and accreditation review. We are greatly indebted to the Self-Study Committee that operated under the capable direction of Professor James Kearl, with Vice President Alan Wilkins, Elder Bruce Hafen, and other administrative officers providing a university perspective. We are also very much aware that faculty and staff in every department contributed in a major way. The administration is extraordinarily grateful for the information, insights, and recommendations gleaned from the process. The accreditation review team was more than impressed. When Alan Wilkins and I made our final response to the Northwest Commission in June, numerous commission members expressed surprise and admiration regarding the size, complexity, and cooperative nature of the study effort. They had never seen a university review process as thorough and comprehensive. Members of the President's Council, with the aid of others, have been able to compare our self-study process with those at other universities. Council members report that no other university of which they are aware listened to as many stakeholders, was as thorough in its analysis, or was as far-reaching in its conclusions.<br><br>During the past few months we have cataloged all self-study recommendations, together with responses from department chairs, deans, faculty, and staff. The vice presidents and their councils have reviewed the documents and met with appropriate personnel to ensure a basic understanding. Finally, a full day was spent with deans and directors during which proposed priorities and recommendations were reviewed. An overview of the Self-Study Report was presented to the board of trustees in June. Recommendations will be presented to the board beginning in September. Because of the volume and complexity, it will take more than one board meeting to present the proposals adequately. As approval is received, we will visit each major unit to enlist your involvement and support in the implementation process.<br><br>The implementation phase is the most challenging part of the process. It needs to be deliberate and steady. It will take time. In those cases where programs are being modified or eliminated, it will take three or four years. Fortunately, we are not being asked to downsize, like some institutions. The self-study conclusions are concerned with relevancy and efficiency. The administration also believes that some areas mentioned in the report need additional emphasis.<br><h2><b>Accreditation and Outcomes Assessment</b></h2><br>Before outlining key themes that will provide direction for the coming years, a comment on outcomes assessment is in order. One of the recommendations made by the visiting accreditation team is that more be done in the area of outcomes assessment. We must measure more adequately our performance and relate it to our institutional goals. As many know, the assessment recommendation is a common one in today's academic world.<br><br>To address this important area, we have created a new Office of Planning and Assessment. The office mandate is to help departments and colleges develop tools that will assist in the measurement effort. We will rely heavily on the faculty and staff to assist in the design of appropriate instruments. All of us want to know more about our effectiveness in meeting<i>The Aims of a BYU Education.</i>How can we measure our performance as faculty, staff, and administrators? How do the "Aims" apply to specific departments and colleges? What measurement tools are appropriate for the Physics and Astronomy Department? For the Bookstore? Can some measurement tools apply across the entire university? The major purpose for such assessment is to improve the quality of our teaching and research. As our ability to measure improves, the quality of our effort will improve as well.<br><h2><b>Key Goals for the Future</b></h2><br>There are five major goals or themes that will guide our planning and actions during the next few years. The first is to<i>build on the religious foundation</i>already established. The second is to<i>improve the educational opportunity</i>of the students--both in quality and in the number served. With regard to quality, particular attention must be given to the freshman year. The third key strategy is to<i>strengthen teaching</i>while maintaining the upward momentum in research. The fourth goal is to<i>improve communication</i>between faculty, staff, and the administration. Finally, the last goal is to sharpen our<i>institutional focus.</i><br><br>I will comment briefly on each goal, knowing that more will be said on one or more of these subjects by other members of the administration in their sessions of the annual conference. Moreover, discussions on these topics will engage us for some time to come.<br><h2><b>Build on Our Religious Foundation</b></h2><br>The faculty/staff values survey conducted as part of the self-study revealed widespread agreement about the priority of a religious foundation. Strong feedback from the alumni survey pointed out the importance of the "spiritually strengthening" aspects of a BYU education. The questions are: "Can the sacred portion of the educational experience be improved? If so, how?" A faculty friend of mine said to me a few months ago: "I was a faculty member at BYU for 10 years before I appreciated what the university is about. There is more to the university experience than my subject, and I had to learn how to be a part of it." Addie Fuhriman in a recent devotional spoke to this same point. Referring to earlier devotional speakers, she said:<br><br><i>We have been taken on a spiritual journey of integration, of coming to understand how one concept or principle relates to another . . . ; how each exceeds its individual potential through a relationship with the other; and, ultimately, how you and I are enriched, not just by one principle or the other but by their "relatedness."</i>[Addie Fuhriman, "The Tie That Binds" (30 July 1996),<i>BYU 1995–96 Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1996), p. 307]<br><br>With few exceptions, all of us come to BYU from superb graduate programs at secular institutions believing that our subject is the most important one at the university. The zeal for our subject is crucial if we are to succeed. Early in our careers we compartmentalize the search for secular truth versus the quest for spiritual understanding. The search process appears to be different. In the final analysis, however, successful scholars at this institution will learn to integrate sacred and secular principles--a process unknown and not taught at the best graduate schools.<br><br>We believe that an orientation program for new faculty may help. The Faculty Center will be asked to assist departments in this endeavor.<br><h2><b>Improve Educational Opportunities</b></h2><br>There are both qualitative and quantitative aspects to the goal of improving educational opportunities. The data suggests that too many students become lost through lack of faculty contact and weak career advisement during the freshman year. We know that a significant percentage of the 100-level classes are taught by teaching assistants. The percent of freshman-level classes taught by faculty with continuing status is low. When regular faculty teach freshmen, it is generally in very large sections that allow little individual interaction. It is also a fact that student attendance and performance are lower in large classes than in small ones, where more student/faculty interaction occurs.<br><br>To solve this problem, additional faculty resources are needed. Part of the funds obtained in the Lighting the Way capital campaign will be used for this purpose. Also, the self-study streamlining effort will free some faculty. Other proposals are being analyzed that may assist in improving the freshman class experience. For example, if discussions with faculty prove successful, professorships may be established to attract outstanding senior faculty to teach some of the 100-level courses.<br><br>The freshman class is our most vulnerable group. The quality of their educational experience is below that of the sophomore, junior, and senior years. We expect to solve this problem within a five-year period.<br><br>In discussing the quest for academic excellence at BYU, we are very much aware that research is an integral part of the scholarship equation. We view research as complementary to rather than competitive with good teaching. The goal will continue to be that every faculty member be engaged in productive research and renewal. Meaningful research has gathered momentum during the past two decades. This administration expects the research effort to not only continue but become even more productive in the future. The reward system will carry the appropriate weight for faculty research efforts.<br><br>I believe all of us agree that the major purpose of research at this university is to aid the teaching process, although we desire to contribute to the general store of knowledge. The university is primarily an undergraduate teaching institution--it is 90 percent of our mission. We recognize that the best scholarship is a blend of outstanding research combined with strong communication skills. The ideal faculty member at BYU or at any other teaching university is the person who is blazing a trail along the research frontier and is effective in sharing basic principles as well as his or her advanced specialty with undergraduate students. There are two types of faculty members that are expensive at BYU. The first is a teacher who has not kept current with the basic discipline, and the second is a moderately productive researcher who cannot communicate with students. Consequently, the reward formula must also carry an appropriate weight for teaching skills.<br><br>There has been some speculation that the new administration may reduce the emphasis on research. This is not in the university's interests. The upward thrust must continue. It appears that average teaching loads will more than support this goal. We have some concerns, however, with regard to choices at the margin. In the past it appears that decisions have been made in which a moderately strong researcher with low teaching skills was preferred over a strong teacher with moderate research output. If a department has to choose between a strong researcher who is a poor teacher and a strong teacher who does moderate research, the latter should be selected, given the dominance of the undergraduate mission. For this reason, we believe that the decision and reward formulae should carry a higher weight for teaching in such cases.<br><br>May I briefly state the university's desire to bless more students. President Lee was committed to shortening the time to graduation so that more students could have the BYU experience. Some improvement in curriculum planning and student advisement has occurred already, although more can and will be done. In the future, many more students entering BYU will have taken Advanced Placement courses. This will shorten graduation time. Also, we believe it may be possible to more fully utilize BYU's physical plant if certain bottlenecks are removed.<br><h2><b>Strengthen Teaching</b></h2><br>Teaching and teacher education are critical national priorities. Both are integral parts of BYU's historical strengths. During the past few years, student interest in obtaining a teaching certificate has increased dramatically with almost 6,000 students now majoring in elementary or secondary education. University resources allocated to teacher education have not kept pace with the increased demand. Additional resources are needed in this area to service the students. We are also aware of two or three other colleges where shifts in demand have left them short. Resource reviews are underway in these areas as well.<br><br>The accreditation review team recommended formal faculty reviews of teaching, scholarship, and citizenship on a periodic basis following the granting of continuing status. With few exceptions, which can be corrected, most departments conduct thorough annual reviews that will allow the university to schedule formal reviews every six years. In this connection, the Office of Planning and Assessment will work with the departments to develop a peer review system that goes beyond student evaluations with respect to teaching.<br><h2><b>Improve Communications</b></h2><br>The Self-Study Report pointed out the sluggish nature of the decision-making process at the university. Three steps are being taken to improve the process. The first is to streamline decision making by reducing the number of administrative layers through which a question must pass. The second is to clarify the roles of key personnel, push decision-making power to the lowest practical level, and limit the time taken to arrive at decisions for all nonboard items. Finally, the administration intends to spend more time with colleges, departments, and support units discussing concerns.<br><h2><b>Sharpen Institutional Focus</b></h2><br>There are many suggestions in the self-study that, if adopted, will focus and simplify university offerings. They include structurally reorganizing some departments and colleges, consolidating a number of programs, and identifying key scholarship areas that should receive additional emphasis. Each of the above require board approval. To date, discussions have been held with the appropriate colleges and departments regarding the presentation that will be made to the board. Once board approval is received, implementation discussions will be held with the units concerned.<br><h2><b>Campus Construction</b></h2><br>The last item is of major concern to everyone here. It is the campus construction and refurbishment program.<br><br>During the next academic year, BYU will be involved in seven major construction projects. These projects will include much-needed additional space for the university libraries, expanded family housing facilities for students, an upgrade of existing facilities, and the replacement of inefficient mechanical and electrical systems in these buildings.<br><br>I would like to discuss briefly each of these seven projects so that you can anticipate what will be happening during this next academic year. Some of the affected areas are the actual construction sites, and some are staging areas necessary for the contractor. Fences will enclose the entire construction area of each project.<br><br>The first site is Lot 16, directly north of the Jesse Knight Humanities Building and west of the Abraham O. Smoot Administration Building. This is an excavation project for the new sanitary and storm drainage system that is being redirected from the center of campus as a result of the library addition. This excavation project will begin next month.<br><br>The second major project is the underground addition to the Harold B. Lee Library. This project will add 234,000 square feet to the existing library, including two floors underground and a partial third-floor mechanical room. A beautiful ground-level, glass-enclosed entryway will be located on the north side of the existing library. The project also includes a modest renovation of areas in the existing library as departments are relocated. Mechanical and electrical systems for the entire library will be upgraded. The construction fence will be installed this week. BYU will host a groundbreaking on September 20 and anticipates project completion by December 31, 1999. However, the hole in the middle of the quad will be covered after two years.<br><br>The third site, which is located directly east of the Harris Fine Arts Center, is the staging area for the Harold B. Lee Library construction project. Approximately 100 parking spaces will be removed from use and restored at the end of the library project, approximately by December 31, 1999.<br><br>Fourth is the J. Reuben Clark Law School Library addition and remodeling. The addition of 60,000 square feet will more than double the space available for books and study carrels. Computer systems are being improved, and the entire building has been upgraded for seismic purposes. The project is nearly complete and should be finished by November 1.<br><br>Fifth is the renovation of the Wilkinson Center. The project includes renovation of most areas in the building, the upgrade of mechanical and electrical systems, and the rearrangement of existing functions and businesses to serve patrons better. The project will add 90,000 square feet to the facility where the Memorial Lounge used to be. This new office space will allow a consolidation of student-related services now found in the Kimball Tower and the relocation of the Faculty Center. Student Employment and Career Placement Services in the Smoot Building also will move to the Wilkinson Center. Although the project will not be completed until the summer of 1998, some of the consolidation will occur in the summer of 1997, when the new office space is available. You should know that the Cougareat and cafeteria are currently being remodeled, although the Skyroom continues to serve meals. By the summer of 1997, a food court will be available to offer more commercial fast-food outlets in addition to the traditional cafeteria meals.<br><br>Next we have the renovation of the Eyring Science Center. The science building has been gutted of all interior walls and will be rebuilt to house the Geology, Physics and Astronomy, and Food Science and Nutrition Departments. This project is at the halfway point and should be completed by October 1997.<br><br>The last project is located directly west of Cougar Stadium. The Wyview family housing project will replace 150 trailers with 426 two- and three-bedroom apartments. The poultry facility formerly at that site has been relocated to Spanish Fork. The project will be completed in four phases. The last phase will be completed in August 1998.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In closing, the board is grateful for the support of the faculty and staff. Your faithfulness and commitment to the university and the Church are deeply appreciated by President Hinckley and other board members. They know that the vast majority are totally committed to the divine mission of Brigham Young University. May all of us commit to follow the Savior's admonition to the Nephites when he said:<br><br><i>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</i>[3 Nephi 11:29–30]<br><br>If we work together in the spirit of the Savior's counsel, the future of this university is extraordinarily bright. The day will come when John Taylor's prophecy will be fulfilled: "Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are to-day in regard to religious matters" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>21:100). This will be accomplished with divine help for a faculty and staff worthy to receive such blessings. May God bless all of us to this end I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was president of Brigham Young University when this Annual University Conference address was given on 27 August 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>d Course for Brigham Young University - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Yesterday I sat in a living room with a family whose son was to drive to Provo today to begin his freshman year. He will likely park in a lot near Deseret Towers, take his bags through the door of his new dorm, and wear the smile of happy anticipation I saw as he sat near his parents in that living room. I could see his eyes shining with the thought of an exciting beginning. And I thought I saw the eyes of his mom and dad shining, too, but with the moisture that sometimes comes when something precious is about to end. That handsome young man and his parents extend to us remarkable trust. That act will be repeated hundreds and perhaps thousands of times in the next few days.<br><br>You deserve thanks for the preparations you have made for that young man and his colleagues which merit that extension of confidence to us. From the parking lot to the dorm to the financial offices to the library to the classroom, he will pass by with only faint recognition of the care and labor that made his opportunities possible, the blacktop repaired, the how-to-use-the-Internet course prepared, and the syllabus redesigned yet again. I thank you for that--at least as well as I understand it--for him, for his parents, and for the thousands of students and their families that your work blesses.<br><br>There is another preparation, one that will be even harder for him to detect, for which I thank you. And so would he and his parents, from the bottom of their hearts, if they sensed both the magnitude of your effort and the good it will do for years to come, not only for this group of arriving students. Thank you for the labor and the time and the talent so many of you expended in turning what might have been a standard accreditation self-study into a process of making plans to move us toward our destiny as a university.<br><br>Much of the high quality of that effort--from the willingness to gather evidence about the results in the lives of students to openness about possible real changes--seems to me to stem from something we did near the start of the process. We selected some talks and writings from members of the board of trustees--present and past, some still living and some dead--that described visions of the nature of this university and our potential for good. Many of you read those foundation documents carefully. And many who read them have analyzed and made plans using the ideas in them as a guide to a vision of our future.<br><br>I reread those foundation documents again as part of my preparation for the new academic year. What struck me was their consistency across long periods of time and with each other. I was struck with the recurrence of the idea that putting religious faith first will enhance our achievements as a university. What was not said in those documents, perhaps because it was understood by the audiences, was that the religious faith of which they spoke was faith in a revealed religion, one with living prophets and with faith that God reveals his will to his servants. That makes the idea a bold proposition, given the histories of other universities and the prevailing views in much of the academic world. From all that I have seen, I believe that proposition will prove to be true: Putting religious faith first will enhance our development as a great university. Let me tell you why. And from that let me suggest how each of us can help.<br><br>It seems to me that a direct test of the proposition is the effect on the university of the influence of prophets on the university. And one of their principle contacts with it has been through their generous service on its board of trustees. I have now for many years been able to observe the service from close range. The documents themselves mirror what I have seen. First, the consistency of the messages--over the years and from so many personalities with such different experiences in life--is both evidence of the source of the vision they share and an assurance that we are on a charted, steady course.<br><br>I have personal evidence of that and of its value. Many years ago, when I served as the president of Ricks College, then Commissioner Neal A. Maxwell asked me to chair a committee charged with considering the future of higher education in the Church. Some of the faculty of this university made valuable contributions to that committee's work. Between our meetings and on a visit to Salt Lake City, I was allowed a few minutes to seek help from President Spencer W. Kimball, one of the authors in our series of foundation documents and then a member of the board of trustees.<br><br>As we talked about the plans we should make for the future, I made what I thought was the logical suggestion that conditions during the Millennium would surely allow such educational innovation that we should assume our universities should be planned with the expectation that they would be replaced with some more effective institutions in that time when the Savior would be among us.<br><br>There was what seemed to me a lengthy silence, and then he made the quiet statement that over the centuries universities had proved to be the most effective institutions we had developed to find, conserve, and transmit knowledge across numerous fields of inquiry, so why not expect that they would serve as well in the Millennium. That immediately seemed sensible to me.<br><br>That little incident is representative of all I have seen: Even in times of turbulence there is a steady, shared confidence in the value of this university. That confidence is rooted in a sense of the history of universities and of education--and the facts of their present condition--and in a shared reliance on common sense.<br><br>I emphasize the word<i>shared.</i>My introduction to the board of trustees came as I left the faculty at Stanford to be the president of Ricks College. I attended my first board meeting soon thereafter. My work at Stanford and elsewhere had exposed me to the ways boards of directors and groups of people in business made decisions. But nothing I had seen prepared me for what I saw in that meeting.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee, also one of the authors of our foundation documents, was serving as chair. I have now forgotten the issue, but the discussion was lively. I had never seen such frankness without rancor before, but neither had I seen people listen to each other as carefully. In a few minutes, what had seemed to me widely divergent views began to move--I thought so rapidly as to be miraculous--toward a consensus. Just as I began to think I had seen an example of joint revelation beyond what I thought possible among strong leaders, I was surprised by a statement from the chair, President Lee. He said something like this: "I sense that there is someone here still not settled on this matter. I suggest that we hold it for further thought. We can discuss it again in a later meeting." President Lee had seen or felt, I don't know which, that there was not yet complete unity. And so an important matter was held off.<br><br>That story is not about one day but represents a pattern. Not only does the board of trustees give consistent direction, based on a deep understanding of universities as they have been and of this one as it is, but it gives direction out of unity far beyond a product of counting votes and far above a process of coalition bargaining.<br><br>Those patterns of leadership from the board, so valuable to this university, will never be lost because of their source. The consistency of view, the grasp of things as they really are, and the unity are not dependent on any individual or even on a cluster of individuals. The view stays consistent and facts are made clear and the unity comes because the inspiration of God is the source. He really calls his servants. He knows the past, the present, and the future. He knows what is best for his children. And he inspires his servants. Members of the board of trustees will leave and others will come. But there will be consistency and steady purpose. The patterns of such value to the university will continue because they are independent of the people involved. Religious faith, faith in a revealed religion, does not require some sacrifice in the effectiveness of a university; it allows enhancement. Only for someone who believed that the mark of a great university is the lack of wise and consistent leadership would such a board be anything but a treasure.<br><br>There are some practical things we could do to help. One is to invest some of our scarce time in reading those foundation documents again. From them we will sense where the university is headed and in what specific ways we could help now. We will feel impressions about innovations to suggest that will move the university more rapidly along, and we will find that those ideas are shared by others. We already have evidence of that, it seems to me, in the surprising degree of agreement that has been reached about some major changes suggested in our recent planning.<br><br>Another way to help us along the way is to show confidence in the capacity of our students. When we declare to them faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ, we express confidence in their divine potential. And then when we treat them as if that potential for learning and creating is real, we express our faith again in tangible form. To act as if every soul is capable of improvement, with the upper limit beyond our human measure, is to mix revealed religion with education. And since that possibility is true, our acting as if we believed it will be part of what allowed President Kimball in one of his talks to say: "In all the world, the Brigham Young University is the greatest institution of learning" (Spencer W. Kimball, "Education for Eternity," Preschool Address to Faculty and Staff, 12 September 1967, p. 1).<br><br>Finally, you could simply share the confidence of the board in this university and with it its optimism about the future. You can share the board's confidence in President Bateman, in his capacity to lead you in achieving the vision of the university that they have articulated so clearly. And you can share the board's confidence in your capacity to teach and to learn and to serve. You deserve the trust of the students and their parents. And you will be blessed with powers to lift them beyond even what they and their parents dare hope. I know you have been given that blessing, because students and their parents have told me about what you have done and what it meant to them. And because God loves both you and them, I know you will be blessed to do that again and again.<br><br>May our Heavenly Father continue to watch over you, your families, and the students you serve. And may the Lord continue to prosper this university. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B. Eyring was commissioner of education for the Church Educational System and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this BYU Annual University Conference address was given on 27 August 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> the Heights Prophets Have Envisioned for Us - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
For some reason, in spite of my fear and trembling about being in your presence with this responsibility, I have looked forward to the opportunity to address you for some time now. I have always felt, but now have a firm conviction, that this is the best faculty in the world. I feel your goodness and, even though I feel inadequate in my current appointment, I have felt sustained by the Spirit of the Lord and feel the evidence of the Lord's hand more than I ever have at BYU. I believe that this has something to do with our moment in history. It may also have something to do with my vantage point, where I have the opportunity to observe the dealings of the board of trustees with BYU and to watch the myriad little miracles of collegiality, of inspired teaching, of unselfish counseling of students, and of uplifting and thoughtful research. In addition, the opportunity to work with colleagues beyond my own department and college and to interview all candidates for faculty positions in the last three years has been enlightening and uplifting. I have felt a confirmation in many specific instances that the Lord has inspired and prepared you to be here and that you have divinely appointed missions to perform.<br><br>I have felt a conviction, born of the Spirit, that President Bateman has been called of God by a prophet, by "pure revelation," as President Hinckley put it, to be in this new assignment. I have sat enthralled as Elder Eyring has come to meet with us on a regular basis and has taught us with brilliance and insight. I have felt the inspiration of the Lord directing me about whom to appoint as associate academic vice presidents, and I deeply appreciate the willingness of Cheryl Brown, Gary Hooper, Jim Gordon, and John Tanner to serve in these important ways the interests of the university as they sacrifice their own personal desires to teach and work in their areas of specialization.<br><br>Recently President Bateman and I had the opportunity to meet with the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and discuss with them the visiting team's report. Many of them came up after our presentation spontaneously to congratulate us and to share their admiration for what the university has accomplished and is trying to do. For example, they marvel at the clarity of our mission and purpose and the degree to which people on campus share that mission. They were particularly impressed with the willingness of people across campus to collaborate, to sacrifice some rather good programs to achieve focus, and to work at developing greater excellence and service to students. They also noted the relatively unusual degree of stability that we enjoy at BYU because of the Church's financial support of our efforts.<br><br>I have also seen how you have responded in the self-study to very difficult and challenging requests for information and analysis from the Self-Study Committee and, subsequent to that time, from the administration. I have read your self-study reports and have admired the degree of self-sacrifice and effort that is demonstrated in these reports. I have watched the College of Education, for example, go through a very difficult but careful process of coming up with proposals for a true transformation of their college to better serve teachers who are preparing for assignments in public education. I have been inspired by faculty members who have been willing to put the interests of the students ahead of their own self-interest. The School of Management has gone through a similar process of deliberation to develop proposals for significant departmental and college reorganization to improve their ability to collaborate across departments and provide better service to students. Not all of the faculty in these two colleges have agreed with every proposal, but they have contributed their concerns and suggestions with goodwill and are now ready to move ahead and support the new programs if they are approved by the board of trustees.<br><br>These are but a few of the examples I could give of remarkable efforts to improve departments, colleges, and the whole university. I congratulate you for your thoughtful and energetic work over the past two years.<br><br>These remarkable efforts of our community demonstrate the kind of commitment that certainly would be present among some individuals on other campuses but, I am convinced, could not be duplicated to this degree at any other university of this size. In short, I love and admire you and love being able to serve you and work with you to serve the Lord and the choice students he also has inspired to come here. I know that this institution is and will yet be a tool to bless and build the Lord's kingdom here on earth.<br><br>I remember thinking some two and a half years ago, as I began discussions with Jim Kearl and Bruce Hafen about the self-study, that beyond helping departments become more clear about their performance and role in the university, the most important thing we had to do was to work with the board to clarify the university's role in the expanding Church. Specifically, I had questions such as: How could we focus our research and teaching on areas that would be most important to the Church? and How could we expand our influence internationally? It is only recently, as a prophet asked us for proposals about how BYU could increase its ability to influence more students, that I've felt we have been able to bring together much of what has been sometimes frustrating work related to these concerns. I feel more optimistic than ever about BYU and our opportunities to be a part of the kingdom for a long time to come. These are things about which we cannot go into detail at this time. We will know more over the coming months as we and the board work together. If the board approves pursuing any of the ideas we are discussing, we will certainly inform and involve you in planning.<br><br>As I mentioned to you in a memo I wrote this summer reporting that we have been reaccredited, we have made a serious effort to respond to the stimulating and rigorous report of the Self-Study Committee. And, by the way, I express again my deep gratitude to the members of this committee who worked so tirelessly and thoughtfully on a very difficult task. As you recall, we invited your written responses to the committee's recommendations and were gratified by the many thoughtful comments we received. We spent time with deans discussing general university recommendations. We also met with deans and department chairs in each college to share with them where we were leaning as an academic administration before we took our recommendations to the President's Council so that they could give us their feedback. Following the President's Council discussions, we met with deans and directors for a one-day meeting wherein we discussed in some detail our responses and the recommendations we would be taking to the board of trustees. As President Bateman noted yesterday, the recommendations are so voluminous that we will be taking them to the board in what we hope are manageable chunks over the next few months. As we reach board-approved conclusions, we will share the results with you in writing. We also plan to visit each college during the fall semester to discuss our plans, invite your suggestions about implementation, and allow you to address the questions that may be on your minds as we move forward.<br><br>Implementation of many of the self-study conclusions will take several years, and so we hope you will continue to be patient with the pace of our work together. Our intention is to continue in the spirit of candor and involvement that characterized the self-study. We will continue to follow the pattern of inviting relevant faculty groups to study and make recommendations that we will share and discuss. We will share with you data and deliberations regarding overall university direction. We also will seek the inspiration of heaven and clearly work under the direction of the board of trustees, who make the final decisions regarding policy, direction, and major programs at the university. Following such a process of involvement will necessarily take time, but I trust it will improve the quality of our recommendations and the sense you have of understanding and participating in the progress of the university.<br><h2><b>Areas of Greatest Concern</b></h2><br>Recently I traveled with my wife and two of our daughters for a brief vacation in London, England. Riding the subway, the "Tube," as they call it, was an interesting part of the rich experience we enjoyed there, and we became fairly good at making our way around town using this marvelous vehicle. It took us a few rides before we understood the warning broadcast over loudspeakers for all to hear: "Mind the gap!" On many of the subway lines there is a gap between the lower platform and the floor of the subway car. Apparently, people can get a foot or leg lodged in the gap if they aren't careful. The warning became something of a slogan for us as we considered the differences or gaps between us and the British and between where we were and where we wanted to be. As I prepared to address you, I began to think about the gaps that have become more obvious during the self-study between our current situation as an institution and, as President Spencer W. Kimball put it, "the fully anointed University of the Lord" that we have been invited to become ("Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, p. 8).<br><br>I want to focus on two broad areas where we have been concerned about such gaps between our aspirations and our current reality. Our aspirations have been eloquently presented in<i>The Aims of a BYU Education,</i>which all of you will have seen in various forms of development and in the final version that you all should have received in the mail recently along with<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University.</i>(If you have not received a copy, please drop me a note in campus mail or by e-mail, and I will send you one.) We seek to provide educational experiences that will foster spiritual strength, intellectual enlargement, the building of strong moral character, and lifelong learning and service. As I consider our current situation, I worry that (1) we must focus more faculty attention on both our beginning students and our "ending" students to help both groups better prepare for their next steps; and (2) we must continue to build on and improve beyond our current relatively strong performance to foster teaching by the Spirit in every discipline and the integration of the sacred and the secular where appropriate. I want to suggest how these areas are gaps that we must mind, and reduce, if we are to be the university that prophets have invited us to become.<br><br>Our Student Experience Committee, chaired by David Sorenson and Cheryl Brown, found that the principal need for our students was for more contact with faculty. Data supporting this conclusion came from a nationally normed survey (the Pace Survey) that we have used over many years. In that survey we are somewhat lower than the national average in having students visit faculty in their office after class or in spending time informally with faculty over snacks or a soft drink. Consider some other findings: Although our rates of graduation have steadily increased over the last decade, we still have more than 45 percent of our students leave BYU before graduation. When we ask them about why they are leaving, their top academic reasons are (1) BYU is too impersonal, and (2) our classes are too large.<br><br>The perception that we are impersonal and have too many large classes bears further scrutiny. We have created large classes quite intentionally over the past years for a number of reasons. These classes have served us well in some instances and have certainly provided increased opportunity for faculty scholarship. However, we have discovered that there are some important drawbacks to these large classes as well. For example, they have a significantly lower attendance and a higher proportion of D's, E's, and UW's than smaller classes (60 students or less) at BYU, according to research reviewed by the Student Experience Committee.<br><br>In addition to this concern with the size of classes, as President Bateman discussed yesterday, more than 55% of our 100-level classes are taught by student TA's or part-time faculty. Although we acknowledge that many of our part-time faculty and TA's are fine teachers and deserve our support, we believe our freshmen deserve an opportunity to interact with a seasoned full-time faculty member early in their experience here--one who knows them and can help them adjust to this university environment and one who is more likely to be around later as students have additional needs.<br><br>Interestingly, other data considered in the self-study suggested that while on average teaching loads have dropped from 9 credit hours to 6 credit hours per faculty per semester in the past two decades, we haven't seen a commensurate increase in scholarly productivity. Furthermore, teaching loads are unevenly distributed, with the Humanities and Religious Instruction colleges being high (with loads of 9 and 10 credit hours per faculty member in some departments) and a number of departments in other colleges with average loads of 4 credit hours and sometimes even less per faculty member.<br><br>In addition to these concerns about the freshman year, data from our alumni survey suggest to us that students feel that faculty in many of our majors could be more helpful to them in helping them prepare for a career related to that major. That is why I said earlier that we may need to pay more attention to both beginning and ending students. Both need help to make transitions, either into or out of the university.<br><br>The net result of changes over the past decade or so, then, is that we have made moderate increases in our scholarship and have reduced the quality and personal attention that we give to our freshmen and those needing career counseling. The solution to this problem is not straightforward in my mind. We need to have more full-time faculty teaching freshmen, at least some of the time, in smaller classes. We also need to have faculty spend more time helping ending students consider their options and prepare for transitions into their careers. But what will happen to our scholarly renewal and preparation if we invest more time in such efforts? We think we have found some ways to address these student concerns while continuing to honor our commitment to high quality research and creative work. But it won't be easy. To make matters even more difficult, we have a large proportion of our faculty retiring in the next few years, and the younger faculty who replace them will require some years with relatively lower teaching loads so that they can establish themselves in their disciplines. By the way, this is one reason that we may want to consider hiring faculty in a variety of career stages.<br><br>Nevertheless, we will continue to expect that all of our faculty engage in scholarly work principally because we assume that faculty who are alive in their discipline will be better teachers. That, by the way, is an assumption that the Balancing Teaching and Research Committee, chaired by Clayne Pope, suggested we should test. We also care deeply about continuing to foster the upward trend in our scholarly work because we have something to contribute to our disciplines. I see signs across the campus that we are developing the scholarly capacity and gospel maturity as a community that will allow us to contribute an LDS perspective to many disciplines and to give "reason of the hope that is in [us]" (1 Peter 3:15). Finally, we should be good scholars so that our reputation for quality will redound to the benefit of our students as they seek jobs and entrance into graduate schools.<br><br>We have determined to try several approaches to generate more faculty time to devote to our freshman students and to advising students, at the same time continuing to encourage strong scholarly work. Let me list some of the ideas we are preparing to implement with your help.<br><br>1. We believe that we can generate between 25 and 30 new positions from the capital campaign over the next several years.<br><br>2. We believe that there are some courses that carry with fewer than 15 undergraduate students and 5–7 graduate students that we might work with you to eliminate.<br><br>3. As faculty retire, or leave for other reasons, we may reallocate the FTEs to areas of the university where loads are the heaviest.<br><br>4. We want to continue to work with you in providing leaner majors that, in the language of<i>The Aims of a BYU Education,</i>are "targeted at entrance-level, not expert-level, abilities" (p. 7) and that students are able to complete in about four years.<br><br>5. The Self-Study Committee concluded, based on their review, that we are trying to do too many things. We probably have some more program pruning to do that could free up additional faculty time.<br><br>6. We must continue to rely on some number of large classes. These classes, which touch the lives of so many students, must be the best large classes we can offer. We intend to use technology and media to enhance lectures and to foster greater interaction between faculty and students and between students and students. We have some excellent faculty who work very hard to provide wonderful large-class experiences already, and we will do all we can to facilitate and build on their efforts in what is a challenging teaching assignment.<br><br>Except for the first approach of bringing in additional faculty resources, the areas we have identified to tap additional faculty time will require difficult decisions about taking resources from one activity and investing them in another. We will need all of the goodwill we have seen from you thus far in the self-study and even better data for assessment and decision making than we have had heretofore. That is one of the reasons we have accepted the Self-Study Committee recommendation to establish an Office of Planning and Budgeting. As you know, we have asked Ned Hill and Bob Webb to help us develop better assessment tools so that we can work with you to determine how well we are meeting our aims of strengthening students spiritually, enlarging them intellectually, building their character, and fostering in them an orientation to lifelong learning and service. Better information about our successes and failures in achieving these aims should guide us in making necessary improvements. It should also help us make better decisions about where to put new faculty positions and resources to address the highest priority needs or the biggest gaps that we see. We expect that through these means we will be able to better balance loads across departments, for example.<br><br>I want to share with you my conviction that all this effort isn't just an exercise in organizational efficiency. We do need to focus our efforts and become as efficient as we can be, but then we must give our hearts to being the servants and teachers that only we can be. I was touched yesterday by Elder Eyring's description of an enthusiastic freshman and his parents, all anticipating the beginning of a BYU education. I didn't think much about parents and their children and my responsibility to them when I began here as a professor. I was excited about my subject and wanted to make sure my students learned to be rigorous and thoughtful in my area, but I don't think I had a clear vision of what I could be in their lives. I discovered new dimensions to my responsibility as a professor on a number of occasions. Let me share one very simple example: Gene Dalton, a colleague of mine who is now retired, opened my eyes one time when he returned from a trip where he'd had dinner with some Church members living far from here whose daughter was attending BYU. He just happened to see on their refrigerator a big sign, "Remember Susan"--their BYU daughter. He told me with tears in his eyes how it had affected him to think of Susan away from home, with loving parents remembering her and praying she would be taught, loved, helped, and provided with the best we can give her. She must not get lost in a bureaucracy that doesn't know her name and that processes her multiple-choice exams with a machine and that doesn't help her to ask her questions and discover how to answer them. Somehow we must find ways to be a part of Susan's life. We must have some effective small classes, some caring counselors, some willing faculty advisors--real people who have the time and resources to help her. The efforts to measure, to reallocate, and to hold each of us accountable may make it more likely that we can find and connect with Susan. In the end, however, we must determine, ourselves, to open our hearts and to see that the Lord is sending Susans and Johns and others of his children to be blessed and inspired and challenged by you and me. Well, that is the first area--better faculty contact with the students. This is one gap we face, and these are some ideas about how we might reduce and mind it.<br><h2><b>Integrating the Sacred and the Secular</b></h2><br>A second area of concern, another gap if you will, relates to our most important and shared values and is something we have traditionally done well: that is, provide a unique educational experience that integrates the sacred and the secular. My concern is that if we are to reach the heights prophets have envisioned for us, we must be even better than we are currently. For example, we should pay attention when 34% of our alumni tell us that the integration of religious and academic viewpoints was either poor or fair in their major. I should note that alumni varied significantly in this assessment depending on their department, with some departments being rated much higher than others on this dimension. I'm also aware of a few departments that have been engaged in very thoughtful reflection on what alumni were expecting that they missed and what that department might do differently to address those concerns.<br><br>I have heard some faculty suggest that the gospel isn't relevant to their teaching because there is no such thing as a Mormon law of gravity or mathematical formula or chemical solution. (By the way, I didn't hear these statements from those departments. I'm just using them as examples.) But didn't Brigham Young tell Karl G. Maeser "not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God"? (See Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1953], p. 26.) In 1967, Elder Spencer W. Kimball suggested that<br><br><i>it would not be expected that all of the faculty should be categorically teaching religion constantly in their classes, but it is proper that every professor and teacher in this institution would keep his subject matter bathed in the light and color of the restored gospel, and have all his subject matter perfumed lightly with the spirit of the gospel. Always, there would be an essence and the student would feel the presence.</i><br><br><i>Every instructor should grasp the opportunity occasionally to bear formal testimony of the truth. . . . Certainly, a science instructor or a physical education teacher or a math or art teacher could find an opportunity sometimes to mention spiritual experiences or comment on the gospel truths. This would be in harmony with the spirit of Brigham Young's charge to Karl G. Maeser.</i>["Education for Eternity," Preschool Address to BYU Faculty and Staff, 12 September 1967, pp. 11–12]<br><br>I have talked with numerous students who tell me that they have never heard a professor bear his or her testimony in class. Many have also told me that what most surprised them about coming to BYU is that their classes were not particularly different than classes they might have taken at another university. They couldn't recall references to the gospel, to spiritual experience, to faith in or support of prophets. Thus, my own anecdotal evidence, in addition to some data from the alumni survey, suggests to me that we have some improving to do in this area.<br><br>My own experience as a faculty member and as one who interviewed all new faculty for almost three years suggests to me that most of us don't quite know what to do about Brigham Young's charge or President Kimball's suggestions. Most of us come to BYU precisely because we want to be in a place where we can talk freely about things sacred as they integrate with things secular. We simply haven't been taught or experienced thoughtful, appropriate ways of including the gospel and teaching with the Spirit in approaching our secular subjects.<br><br>Nevertheless, we must become much better at teaching with the Spirit. One of the principal reasons for teaching by the Spirit and bathing our subject "in the light and color of the gospel," it seems to me, is that this is the best way to encourage our students to consider their obligations regarding what they are learning. Nothing has a more powerful effect for good on us than hearing the gospel preached by the Spirit (see Alma 4:19 and 31:5). I think the same thing applies to secular subjects. Nothing will so help our students put our subjects in perspective and be motivated to use their learning to bless others, to reject error, to embrace truth, and to conform their lives to it than the presence of the Spirit of God and the linking of our work to the gospel.<br><br>Let me share with you a President McKay quote used in<i>The Aims of a BYU Education:</i><br><br><i>True education seeks to make men and women not only good mathematicians, proficient linguists, profound scientists, or brilliant literary lights, but also honest men</i>[and women]<i>with virtue, temperance, and brotherly love.</i>[David O. McKay, "Why Education?"<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 70, no. 9 (September 1967), p. 3]<br><br>The<i>Aims</i>brochure then goes on to say [pp. 10–11]:<br><br><i>Consequently, a BYU education should bring together the intellectual integrity of fine academic discipline with the spiritual integrity of personal righteousness. The result is competence that reflects the highest professional and academic standards--strengthened and ennobled by Christlike attributes.</i><br><br><i>Thus understood, the development of character is so important that BYU "has no justification for its existence unless it builds character, creates and develops faith, and makes men and women of strength and courage, fortitude, and service--men and women who will become stalwarts in the Kingdom and bear witness of the . . . divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not justified on an academic basis only" (Spencer W. Kimball, "On My Honor," in</i>Speeches of the Year, 1978<i>[Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1979], p. 137). Rather, it fulfills its promise when "the morality of the graduates of this University provide[s] the music of hope for the inhabitants of this planet" (Kimball, "Second Century Address and Dedication of Carillon Tower and Bells," Brigham Young University, 10 October 1975, p. 12).</i><br><br>So how do we preserve and improve our delivery of this most precious gift to the youth of Zion who come here? We plan to foster a number of important initiatives designed to increase our learning and sharing of what we learn in this area. For example, following the recommendations of a faculty group chaired by Jim Gordon, we have decided to develop an intensive two-week new faculty seminar to be held in the spring or summer following a faculty member's first year. We will focus on the profession of university teaching and how it relates to one's scholarship, since most faculty learn how to do research or creative work in their PhD program (or terminal degree) and relatively few prepare themselves thoughtfully to be teachers. We will also focus considerable discussion and reading on what we know about integrating the sacred and the secular and about teaching by the Spirit. We intend to present some of our finest faculty examples of this kind of teaching across a broad array of disciplines and approaches. We hope to develop questions, discussions, and readings that will be worth sharing even more broadly as well.<br><br>We have also asked our Faculty Center to work with a team of faculty members to produce this seminar, and we expect a pilot program this coming spring. Regarding the Faculty Center, permit me a brief aside: We are grateful to Don Jarvis, Bonner Ritchie, and their colleagues in the Faculty Center for the skillful way they have founded the faculty development efforts of the center. They have realized that faculty development is the work of faculty members themselves and of departments and deans, and they developed programs to facilitate our work in this regard. Don left in June to serve as mission president in the Russia Moscow Mission, and Bonner is taking a leave to the Middle East and will be stepping down in December of this year. We will announce the new director and associate director following our meeting with the board of trustees in the middle of September.<br><br>In addition to developing a new faculty seminar, we have asked the Faculty Center to help us provide settings and opportunities for us to reflect on and share our learning about teaching by the Spirit and about how to integrate the sacred and the secular. As I have also mentioned, we have asked the Planning and Budgeting Office to help you--as departments--design measures and means to report your progress and learning regarding achieving the aims of a BYU education and other important goals. Our conversations regarding efforts, outcomes, and learning should also help us to improve as a community in this most important area for BYU.<br><br>I also want to note that although there is a significant amount of agreement among us regarding the goal of integrating the sacred and the secular, we have a diversity of perspectives about<i>how</i>to accomplish that end. Elder Bruce Hafen noted this difference last year as he commented on the same data from the survey of our institutional values conducted as part of the self-study. Some worry that we won't be orthodox enough as we discuss and apply the gospel; others think we will too quickly reject what one can learn from academic endeavor because it doesn't fit neatly into a gospel category. I believe we need both perspectives as we engage in discussions and learn from each other as well as from the Lord's Spirit. We have much good work to do together if we are to achieve the Lord's purposes for us, and we need the best thinking and faithful learning of which we are each capable.<br><br>This line of thinking suggests yet one other way in which we can continue to improve as a community where we seek to live and teach by the Spirit. I speak of the way we treat others whose views are different from our own. As I observe some of our conversations and listen to the stories we tell about one another, I sometimes worry that we forget Paul's lesson about the body of Christ (see 1 Corinthians 12). Particularly in these sensitive times when issues about gender, ethnicity, and even academic paradigms like postmodernism and feminism present different perspectives, we must model for our students and for our colleagues throughout the academic world what it means to work together. The Physics and Astronomy Department should not say to the Elementary Education Department, "We have no need of thee." Male faculty on this campus should not think that we do not need female faculty, nor should female faculty think that the male faculty are all power-hungry chauvinists. We are all impoverished if we do not seek out and hire the best possible faculty regardless of their sex; if we do not listen thoughtfully and honestly to the perspectives of both genders; and if we do not make sure that our discussions and decisions appropriately involve both men and women.<br><br>With respect to feminism, it seems to me that we can too readily embrace or reject ideas based on political or emotional or other motives. My hope is that we can learn to carefully examine such ideas in the light of the gospel and the teachings of modern-day prophets. It seems to me that we can learn a great deal about the reading and interpreting of texts and about alternative perspectives from feminism, for example. However, there are also forms of feminism that would reject priesthood power or revelation through male prophets, or would teach erroneous views about the nature of God and his Christ. BYU should be a place where both the insights and limitations of feminism, or of any other perspective, can be examined thoughtfully and faithfully. As John Tanner has said on many occasions, BYU should not be a feminist university nor a modern or a postmodern or a positivist university. It must be the Lord's university, free to seek truth and reject error in the light of our best thinking and the direction of prophets and the Spirit of God. Well, that's the second gap.<br><h2><b>Strategic themes</b></h2><br>Since President Bateman discussed our five strategic themes with you yesterday and because we plan to discuss them in more detail with you in your colleges and/or in writing to you, I will merely point out the connections between the two general gaps I have been discussing and the themes we will pursue for the next several years. My intent today has been to give you some of the reasons behind the themes we have developed. You may note that, of the five themes, I have been talking principally about (1) building on religious foundations; (2) improving educational opportunity of students; and (5) sharpening institutional focus. We do need to sharpen our focus. We need to reduce, simplify, and clarify what we need to do well so that we can free up time to improve the freshman year and serve as many students as possible. We must also continue to build on our religious foundations if we are to fulfill our reason for being. Improvement of teaching stems largely from our desire to follow President McKay's vision that if you can't get everyone into BYU, you should at least educate teachers who will then go into public schools and be a leaven to influence many more for good. We have drifted in recent years from our original roots in teacher education, and we want to make significant improvements in this area. The College of Education has responded with wonderful efforts, and we'll talk with you after we've shared them with the board. Our students have significant interest in teacher education with almost 20% of each recent graduating class certifying for public education.<br><br>We are also interested in responding to your strong feedback in the values survey, which indicated that you don't think that teaching is evaluated as carefully or rewarded as well as is research. We simply must address these concerns. We believe that good teaching is our most important task. We also believe that good teaching and good scholarship are closely related. We are therefore prepared to accept the recommendations of the Balancing Teaching and Research Committee to revise the teaching evaluation form to make it more adaptive to different teaching situations. We will also encourage more rigorous peer review of teaching to determine the competence and currency of a course, including the possibility of sending syllabi or teaching portfolios to external reviewers for assessment. We will also develop with deans and chairs a process for post–continuing status reviews every six years. Then, based on those reviews and evaluations, we will reward teaching excellence with rigor.<br><br>Finally, President Bateman discussed with you yesterday some ways we plan to respond to another of your concerns and ours from the self-study: that we improve our communication with each other and improve the speed of our decision making. I won't repeat what he said but will merely add that the annual stewardship reviews we plan to have with you and to begin this year will provide increased opportunity for us to come together with data and conversations that will increase the administration's understanding of your programs and efforts and will help us to work through concerns together.<br><br>These themes have as much to do with process as they do with content. That is, they suggest ways for us to move ahead to develop better institutional focus or to build more effectively on our religious foundations. We expect, for example, to learn a great deal about how to improve our service to students through developing measures of our aims and working with you to learn what is most helpful in achieving them.<br><h2><b>"In Process of Time"</b></h2><br>The thought of working through a process together brings me to a final set of observations regarding our destiny and my sense of unfolding and of becoming, my sense of optimism just now. Consider the promises concerning BYU's future implied in what President Bateman discussed yesterday: Remember, for example, John Taylor's prophecy that Zion would one day be "as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>21:100) as it was then in regard to religious matters. And think of President Kimball's vision of BYU becoming an "educational Everest" ("Second Century Address," p. 1), a refining host from which students would leave to accomplish great things to bless the world and strengthen the Church as well--students who would be greater than even Shakespeare or Handel because the Holy Ghost would work through their unique gifts and because their testimony and understanding of the Restoration along with the integrated sacred and secular instruction they would receive here would lift them to unimaginable heights (see "Education for Eternity," pp. 12–19).<br><br><i>BYU certainly must continue to be the greatest university, unique and different. . . . There should be an ever-widening gap between this school and all other schools. The reason is obvious. Our professors . . . should be peers or superiors to those at any other school in natural ability, extended training, plus the Holy Spirit which should bring them light and truth.</i>["Education for Eternity," p. 14]<br><br>What I have reviewed as I began this morning suggests that we are already beginning to accomplish some of these results, though not to the degree envisioned. How do we respond when we receive great promises but have a way to go before they can be accomplished? How do we respond, that is, to the gaps in our lives? My thoughts have turned to Abraham of late as I have felt more and more clear about what our focus for the next several years should be and have considered how we should approach questions like those I have just rehearsed.<br><br>Of course, Abraham faced significantly greater "incongruities," as Larry Dahl calls them, than those we face ("The Abrahamic Test," in Richard D. Draper, ed.,<i>A Witness of Jesus Christ</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1990], p. 55). When the Lord promised Abraham that he would be the father of nations, he was 75 years old. He was 100 years old when Isaac was born to a 90-year-old Sarah! (See Genesis 12:4 and 21:5.) During this 25-year wait, Abraham asked the Lord for an explanation and even proposed that a child born in his house could be his heir. The Lord didn't explain but merely reiterated the promise:<br><br><i>Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . This shall not be thine heir</i>[referring to a child born to a servant in his house];<i>but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</i><br><br><i>And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</i>[Genesis 15:1, 4–5]<br><br>Even though he didn't understand, Abraham "believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness" (Genesis 15:6).<br><br>Abraham was also promised land, and when he and Lot went to possess it, it was filled with Amorites and others. When the shepherds of Abraham and Lot fought over pastureland, Abraham let Lot choose the part he wanted, and Lot picked the most fertile part of the promised land (see Genesis 13). So Abraham continued to wander as a "stranger" in his promised land, never possessing it in his lifetime (Genesis 17:8 and 23:4). Stephen says Abraham received "not so much [of the promised land] as to set his foot on" (Acts 7:5).<br><br>The Lord then asked Abraham to sacrifice his heir, Isaac (see Genesis 22). As Brother Dahl points out, human sacrifice would have been particularly repugnant to Abraham (see Dahl, in<i>A Witness of Jesus Christ,</i>p. 55). As a young man, Abraham had to be saved from being sacrificed by idol worshipers by an angel and was explicitly told to leave the land of his nativity because of these evil practices (see Abraham 1:15–16). How could God ask him to sacrifice the heir through whom God's promises would be fulfilled? Paul says that Abraham believed "God was able to raise him [Isaac] up, even from the dead"--such was the depth and quality of Abraham's faith (see Hebrews 11:19). Abraham presents us with a remarkable model of how to respond along the way when our prophesied goals and our current righteous path don't seem compatible. "Learning by faith," said President Harold B. Lee, "is no task for a lazy man [or woman]. . . . Such [learning] requires the bending of the whole soul." Then only comes "knowledge by faith" (<i>Ye Are the Light of the World</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1974], p. 119). Certainly, Abraham bent his whole soul. He did his best to act on what the Lord asked of him. He sought explanation and proposed solutions and was faithful and believing when the Lord turned them down. He was willing to submit to the Lord's requests, and because of his humility and patience and faithful struggles, the Lord sanctified his soul (see Mosiah 3:19). When the promised blessings seemed distant and even imperiled--as those about BYU may sometimes seem to us--Abraham still persisted and believed, as must we.<br><br>Our struggles will sanctify us as well. They will make us worthy of the promised knowledge and blessings that will fulfill our destiny as a people and as a university. I have wondered at times how we could be part of the fulfillment of John Taylor's prophecy, given our emphasis on undergraduate teaching, because, even though we care deeply about scholarship, we have fewer PhD programs and larger numbers of students to care for than the elite research universities. President Bateman recently showed me a scripture in Doctrine and Covenants 121 that helps me understand how we might achieve our destiny:<br><br><i>God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now; . . .</i><br><br><i>A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many gods, they shall be manifest. . . .</i><br><br><i>And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars--</i><br><br><i>. . . all . . . shall be revealed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:26, 28, 30–31]<br><br>So we can merit the knowledge that can come only from the Holy Ghost if we live worthy of those blessings. I was intrigued by this promise and followed a penciled note in my scriptures to the<i>History of the Church,</i>wherein is recorded the rest of the letter from Joseph Smith from which was excerpted this passage in the Doctrine and Covenants. It gives us the conditions upon which that promise depends.<br><br><i>The things of God are of deep import; and time, and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out. Thy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity--thou must commune with God. How much more dignified and noble are the thoughts of God, than the vain imaginations of the human heart! None but fools will trifle with the souls of men.</i><br><br><i>How vain and trifling have been our spirits, our conferences, our councils, our meetings, our private as well as public conversations--too low, too mean, too vulgar, too condescending for the dignified characters of the called and chosen of God, according to the purposes of His will, from before the foundation of the world! We are called to hold the keys of the mysteries of those things that have been kept hid from the foundation of the world until now. Some have tasted a little of these things, many of which are to be poured down from heaven upon the heads of babes; yea, upon the weak, obscure and despised ones of the earth. Therefore we beseech of you . . . that . . . we exhort one another to a reformation with one and all . . . ; let honesty, and sobriety, and candor, and solemnity, and virtue, and pureness, and meekness, and simplicity crown our heads in every place; and in fine, become as little children, without malice, guile or hypocrisy.</i><br><br><i>And now . . . , after your tribulations, if you do these things, and exercise fervent prayer and faith in the sight of God always, [He shall give unto you knowledge by His Holy Spirit, yea by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world was until now.]</i>[<i>HC</i>3:295–96]<br><br>Here then are the conditions that we must follow if we are to receive the promised blessings of knowledge from the Holy Ghost.<br><br>We are called to become the fully anointed university of promise by prophets. It does not yet fully appear what we shall be or how we shall accomplish what God intends for us, but we can see the next steps, the gaps, and some of the stumbling blocks. We must overcome pride, humble ourselves, and truly be willing to submit to the Lord and his servants--as individuals and as a community. We must speak with candor and sobriety, without malice and guile. We will need to be patient with each other as we learn to stretch our minds "as high as the utmost heavens" to "commune with God" and to not "trifle with the souls of men" but to teach them by and with the Spirit of God.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee was my grandfather. One of his favorite hymns was "Lead, Kindly Light." I remember how often he would say that he was, as Nephi of old, "led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which [he] should do" (1 Nephi 4:6).<br><br>I remember going to him as a young man, just finishing my senior year here at BYU, trying to decide what I would be when I grew up. I took to him my patriarchal blessing and asked him to read it and counsel me. I think in my heart of hearts, though I would not have admitted it at the time, I expected that his counsel would operate something like a crystal ball--that he would help me find my occupation or, even better, my wife, whom I still hadn't found at that time.<br><br>He read the blessing and then paused for a minute and said, "Alan, I think you worry too much about the future." This was not what I had come to hear. He went on to say, "Let me give you a thumbnail sketch of my life." He said, in essence:<br><br><i>I grew up as a boy in Clifton, Idaho. We prayed for the "pillars of the Church"--we meant the Brethren, the General Authorities. I could no more have dreamed of becoming one of them than of flying to the moon, which also seemed impossible in those days. And had I known that would happen, I might have been like Jonah, who ran from Nineveh when he received that assignment. And then I came back from a mission and thought I might be a farmer. But the farm was in real financial difficulty, and I had to go someplace else. I went to the University of Utah and got an education and met my wife. I didn't know what I would be when I grew up, but I was lucky to get a job as a principal in an educational institution following graduation. A few years later there was another opening in a book-distribution company. And then a city commissioner died in midterm, and I was appointed to fill his term. I was called as a very young stake president, and half the members of my stake were out of work during the Great Depression. We had to struggle with how to provide welfare for them. Then I was called to start the welfare program for the whole Church. A few years later I was called as an apostle.</i><br><br>At this time, as he was talking to me, he was a member of the First Presidency. He said, "Looking back, Alan, do you think I could have taken thought and planned any of those steps? Do you think it would have helped me to do so?"<br><br>"Minding the gap" does not mean spending too much time in the future. My grandfather would say to me, "Don't live too far into the future. Live for today." He would say, "Survey large fields and cultivate small ones. Do the good that is right before you." "Live for today, and let the Spirit guide you to do the good you can today. Don't live too far into the future." These were his words to me. He knew that if we would get on the path of obedience and faith, it would lead to the right end, even if we couldn't see which way it was going. It is only human to want to see how to close the gaps in our lives as individuals or as groups. But the Lord often asks us to walk by faith.<br><br>President Kimball, as president of the Church, concluded his "Second Century Address" in 1975 with similar thoughts:<br><br><i>It ought to be obvious to you, as it is to me, that some of the things the Lord would have occur in the second century of the BYU are hidden from our immediate view. Until we have climbed the hill just before us, we are not apt to be given a glimpse of what lies beyond. The hills ahead are higher than we think. This means that accomplishments and further direction must occur in proper order, after we have done our part. We will not be transported from point A to point Z without having to pass through the developmental and demanding experiences of all the points of achievement and all the milestone markers the lie between!</i>[pp. 9–10]<br><br>That we may be willing to so conduct ourselves with patience and faith and consecration to merit the promised blessings and opportunities associated with BYU is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Alan L. Wilkins was academic vice president at Brigham Young University when this Annual University Conference address was given on 27 August 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Gifts and Blessings - Marilyn S. Bateman - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Last February Sister Marjorie Hinckley, wife of our prophet, was chosen by the BYU student leaders to receive the Exemplary Womanhood Award. The award is a special recognition given to a woman whose life exemplifies the teachings of Jesus Christ. Upon receiving the award, Sister Hinckley responded to the honor by saying: "Those who have been active in the Church all their lives have been made by the Church. The Church has made me what I am." Sister Hinckley's life reflects all that the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches. She has always been a believer in the truthfulness of the gospel. She has lived what she believes and she is what she believes.<br><br>As I thought about Sister Hinckley's comments, it brought to mind the words of another great woman who lived what she believed--the French peasant girl Joan of Arc:<i>Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing, nevertheless they give up their lives to that little or nothing. One life is all we have, and we live it as we believe in living it, and then it's gone. But to surrender what you are, and live without belief--that's more terrible than dying--more terrible than dying young.</i>[Maxwell Anderson,<i>Joan of Lorraine,</i>act2]<br><br>I would like to share with you some of my beliefs and feelings about the things that make a difference in my life--that which defines me. First, I know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. It is of the utmost importance to me. The gospel gives us an understanding of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going. The gospel teaches us about our relationship with God. We are his spirit children, and our destiny is to return to our heavenly home if we are true and faithful to his principles and ordinances. I know that the principles and ordinances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are the strait and narrow path back to our eternal home. Jesus Christ is the firstborn of the Father and is his Only Begotten Son. He is our Elder Brother. I believe Christ has extended his grace and love to all of our Father's children through his atoning sacrifice. Our faithfulness will determine the reach of those blessings. He loves all people on the earth, and he expects us to develop the ability to love as he loved. He is our example. I know that Heavenly Father has blessed us--all of us--with every good gift to enable us to find our way back to him.<br><br>I wish to list a few of the great gifts offered to us with the hope that we will all ponder how we accept these gifts in our lives. A gift that is not accepted or appreciated becomes diminished. The first gift is the gift of life. President Joseph Fielding Smith said:<br><br><i>There is no greater blessing that can come than the blessing of birth. One third of the hosts of heaven, because of rebellion, were denied that privilege, and hence they have no bodies of flesh and bones, that great gift of God.</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954), 1:116]<br><br>What a blessing it is to live--to be alive at this time. It is a blessing to live where we live and to be who we are. Do you ever think about this and ask, "Why me? Why am I so blessed?" We are fortunate to know the purpose of our mortal lives. We are blessed to have the challenges that come to us. These trials cause us to grow. As we experience those stretching times, we are preparing to partake of the gift that the Savior so obediently and lovingly gave us--the gift of everlasting life--even eternal life if we endure to the end. We must not waste the days of our probationary time in mortality (see 2 Nephi 9:27).<br><br>In conjunction with the gift of life is the blessing of parenthood--the opportunity to give life. I am thankful for my parents, for the life they gave me. I am thankful for their love and nurturing throughout my life--teaching me how to live. My 80-year-old mother continues to be a wonderful role model for me. I see so many good things in her. She continues to teach me.<br><br>I am grateful for the sacred responsibility of being a parent. As the years have gone by, my role and responsibilities connected with parenthood have changed. But I am constantly renewed and challenged as a mother and as a grandmother. Bored--never! I love our family. I have learned so much throughout the years by being a mother. My children (that includes the grandchildren) continue to teach me.<br><br>I believe in marriage if at all possible. We should all seek for a marriage in the house of the Lord. That is where eternal blessings are found. I am so thankful for my eternal companion. I appreciate that which we share as parents, but even more important are those sacred thoughts and feelings we share together as husband and wife.<br><br>Again, it is a wonderful gift to know that we are children of God with a divine purpose. While in Hong Kong a number of years ago, my mother and I went on a tour of that beautiful city and surrounding area. The young woman tour guide became interested in us and asked about our homeland. We told her we were from the state of Utah. We also volunteered that we were Latter-day Saints and asked her if she had seen any Mormon missionaries there. She replied that she had heard of them, but she had no interest in religion or even in a Supreme Being. She then said: "I believe in only one thing, and that is myself--that is how the young generation feel in this city." She went on to say: "We call it egoism. We believe in doing and accumulating all you can for yourself--no one else matters."<br><br>Many people live their lives this way. It appears that all they care about is themselves. But I had never heard anyone admit to such a philosophy. I was surprised and realized that she was searching for a way to make her life meaningful. I thought of the scripture in Matthew 16:25–26:<br><br><i>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</i><br><br><i>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose hisown soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</i><br><br>The young lady did not understand who she is. She was not able to enjoy the gift of knowing that she is a daughter of a Heavenly Father and that her life has purpose beyond herself.<br><br>We are a blessed people. There are so many gifts that we share in our associations. We enjoy the gifts of love, of friendships--a warm handshake, an arm around the shoulder, a smile, a sincere greeting. We enjoy the gifts of a listening ear, of testimonies shared, and of service rendered in so many ways.<br><br>Do we accept that which has been extended to us with gratitude? Do we see these blessings as gifts from God--as well as gifts from those around us? Most important of all, are we good gift givers? I once heard Elder Neal A. Maxwell give this quote from G. K. Chesterton: "How much larger [our lives] would be if [we] could become smaller in it" (Gilbert K. Chesterton, "The Maniac,"<i>Orthodoxy</i>[New York: John Lane Company, 1909], pp. 34–35). God bless all of us to look outside ourselves and share our great gifts with others, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn S. Bateman, wife of BYU president Merrill J. Bateman, gave this devotional address on 3 September 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ar Treasure: Diligence and the Atonement- BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
On this beautiful September day, the first day of the new school year, we welcome back 21,000 students from summer vacation and almost 6,000 new freshmen and transfer students. It is wonderful to see your bright countenances and the gospel light that enervates your souls. I am reminded of the Israelites' experience when Moses returned from Mount Sinai after spending 40 days and nights with the Lord. During his time on the mount, Moses fasted, neither eating bread nor drinking water as he recorded the Lord's instructions on the tables of stone (see Exodus 34:28). As he descended the mountain and approached the camp, the scriptures record that "the skin of his face shone" and "Aaron and all the children of Israel . . . were afraid to come nigh him" (Exodus 34:29–30). As I look into your faces today, the brightness and freshness reflects your association with the Holy Spirit and the principles by which you live.<br><br>The light emanating from you is reminiscent of the experiences Sister Bateman and I had in Japan and Korea during 1993–94. Shortly after our arrival in Japan, we attended a district conference in northern Honshu. Arrangements were made before the trip for a member of the district presidency, a brother we did not know, to meet us at the train station. As the bullet train sped from Tokyo to Morioka, I wondered how we would recognize the Japanese brother. The train station would be a beehive of activity. It would be easier for him to recognize us than the reverse, but there would be hundreds of people exiting the train. Stepping from the train car onto the platform, I looked into a sea of Japanese faces wondering which one was there to greet us. As we gazed along the platform, I could see an individual at the far end whose countenance radiated the light of the gospel. He was checking each car as he passed along the platform. As we moved toward him, he recognized us, and a peaceful feeling entered our souls. That experience was repeated almost weekly as we met unknown Japanese and Korean brothers and sisters in busy airport terminals and train stations from Sapporo to Fukuoka to Seoul to Pusan. The warmth of the gospel light radiating from these brothers and sisters was the identifying characteristic that brought us together.<br><h2><b>Members of a Covenant Family</b></h2><br>We welcome you as members of a special family--the 2–0 BYU Cougars, also the home of the 19th-ranked women's volleyball team in America! We are grateful for the standards they set. But more important, you are part of another elect family--the Lord's covenant people. You have been blessed with the opportunity to study at this great university. We only wish many others could join us in the intellectual and spiritual renewal that is available here. That day will come as the Lord continues to make the world smaller through improved communications.<br><br>Each person gathered in the Marriott Center today is a rightful heir to the blessings of Abraham, the Old Testament prophet. When Abraham was 99 years old, the Lord appeared to him and said:<br><br><i>I am the Almighty God; walk before me. . . .</i><br><br><i>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee . . . for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</i>[Genesis 17:1, 7]<br><br>In exchange for Abraham's righteousness, the Lord promised him the blessings of the gospel, a land, and a large posterity (see Genesis 12–13, Abraham 1:16–19). In order to fulfill the covenant, the Lord gave Abraham a son through Sarah and a righteous posterity through Isaac's lineage. Abraham received the fullness of the gospel and was told that gospel covenants and blessings would be offered to his children and his children's children (see D&amp;amp;C 132:29–50, Abraham 2:6–11).<br><br>During the course of history there have been a number of occasions when righteous Abrahamic descendants have enjoyed living under the gospel covenant. Whenever the Lord has had a covenant people on earth, a special term has been applied to them. They are called "a peculiar treasure" (Exodus 19:5; see also 1 Peter 2:9). In what ways are righteous people peculiar? There are at least three differentiating characteristics.<br><br>First, they believe in and have a greater knowledge of God and his Son. They not only believe in a supreme being but come to know and trust him.<br><br>Second, the trust in deity helps them live differently from others as they abide gospel principles. Obedience to God's ways produces a clean, happy people. This in turn leads to a special bonding among them. Students on this campus come from more than 100 nations. As you meet, we hope you will find that gospel beliefs shared are stronger than cultural differences that may divide.<br><br>Third, almost everyone in this audience has received a special gift as a result of promises made. A covenant people not only believe in God but are sensitive to spiritual things through the power of the Holy Ghost. I sensed this peculiarity last Thursday when 5,000 freshmen gathered in this hall. One moment they were singing loudly "Rise and Shout" with the Pep Band. The next moment they were listening quietly and intently, feeling the power of the Spirit as Professor Paul Cox explained "The Aims of a BYU Education." One could feel the spiritual depth and commitment of the entering class.<br><br>As covenant children of the Lord and as his peculiar treasure, we must strengthen continually our faith in him and in his atonement. Alma's discourse on faith clearly teaches that it is not enough to turn the seed into a small seedling. That is the first step, but one must continue the nurturing process until the word has become the tree of life within one's soul (see Alma 32:40–43). Also, if covenant children are to take advantage of the educational opportunities provided by this university, they must follow the Lord's counsel to Joseph Smith regarding the learning process. May I discuss these two topics in reverse order--the learning process first, followed by my witness of the Savior's atonement.<br><h2><b>Diligence and Obedience</b></h2><br>The students at this university have broader objectives than most students elsewhere. Many are seeking sacred as well as secular truth. You have chosen Brigham Young University knowing the dual nature of the institution. A few months ago I received a letter from a young woman who expressed her feelings in this regard. She said:<br><br><i>I especially am grateful for the emphasis . . . placed on BYU being a religious institution. I'm from central California and was the valedictorian of my high school class. I felt a lot of pressure from teachers and peers to attend an Ivy League school, Stanford, or one of the more prestigious University of California schools. They could not understand why I would even consider BYU--let alone choose it above the others! But in my mind, I knew the importance of educating my spirit as well as my brain. I wanted a religious education as well as a secular one. I knew that BYU was a place that could provide this type of experience. Since entering here</i>[last]<i>fall, this hope has been confirmed, and I have grown in so many ways that would never have been possible at another university.</i>[Personal correspondence, February 1996]<br><br>Whether sacred or secular, the process of acquiring truth follows the same basic pattern. The Lord said, "All things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law [truth] which was temporal" (D&amp;amp;C 29:34). Whether one attempts to learn by faith or by study, the learning process is similar in at least two respects. First, learning is based on diligence--the energetic application of one's mental powers. Second, the acquisition of knowledge and intelligence is based on one's obedience to basic truths. The scriptures state:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Oliver Cowdery learned this lesson when he was given the opportunity to assist Joseph in translating the plates. He was unable to do so, and the Lord explained why.<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8]<br><br>Whether it is called diligence, hard work, or effort, consistent application of one's energy is required to learn. As an undergraduate student, good grades came easily for me. My diligence was generally confined to class time plus the night before the exam. There were only a few classes that caused me to stretch. Looking back, I now realize how I squandered a major opportunity.<br><br>In contrast, graduate school was a different experience. When I arrived at MIT, I realized that I was not prepared and had shortchanged myself as an undergraduate. I was three years behind in mathematics and not well prepared in my major. It took 18 hours a day, six days a week, of study and class time to compete with the better students. While taking courses in my chosen field, I also studied calculus and difference and differential equations, plus linear algebra--tools required to pass the major exams. During the first year in graduate school I came to understand the meaning of the word<i>diligence.</i>I vowed then to apply my energies in whatever pursuit I was engaged and not waste opportunities.<br><br>Students, take advantage of the BYU educational opportunity by going the extra mile in your homework. In addition to the required materials, read the papers on the suggested list. Ask questions! Take time to become acquainted with your instructors. Establish study groups and use the library.<br><br>Just as the secular learning process requires diligence, so does the search for sacred truths. The Prophet Joseph Smith stated: "When a man works by faith he works by mental exertion instead of physical force" (<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>comp. N. B. Lundwall [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, n.d.], p. 61 [7:3]). In other words, sacred knowledge or a witness of the Spirit comes only after the expenditure of significant mental energy.<br><br>A few years ago, a returned missionary who served in one of the Mexican missions shared with me a classic experience that illustrates the "diligence" principle in the acquisition of faith and sacred knowledge. I had conducted the stake president's interview before his mission and sent his papers to Church headquarters. I remember that interview with him. He was 6 foot 5 inches tall and 255 pounds. He was one of the first two young men recruited from my children's high school to play football at Brigham Young University. He was a fine young man, clean-cut and worthy in every way. I remember being impressed with his potential. I could tell from the answers he gave to the questions I asked that he was honest, but there was one crack in his armor. I knew that his testimony was based on the faith of others rather than on his own witness. However, he related the following story to me during his release interview at the end of his mission.<br><br>As his mission began, Elder Stone worked energetically with his companion. Frequently he was called upon to give the first lesson. In the lesson it was necessary for him to tell the investigators about the appearance of the Father and the Son to the boy Joseph in the Sacred Grove and then bear witness of its truthfulness. After bearing testimony a number of times, his conscience began to bother him. Although he believed the story, he did not know that it actually happened. He had not been there, nor had he received his own witness. How could he tell others that the First Vision really happened? As doubts began to multiply and replace his belief and as the pains of conscience increased, he told his companion that he could no longer be a missionary. He was going home. He could not serve as a witness to something he did not know. His companion responded, "Elder Stone, why don't you follow the counsel given the investigators? You need to study and pray more diligently. Put Moroni's promise to the test. Exercise your faith, and you will receive an answer. Stay with me for a few more weeks."<br><br>Elder Stone agreed to stay and put Moroni's promise to the test. A few weeks passed, the missionary worked harder, prayed more often, was more attentive in his reading, but no witness came. Finally, during an interview with the mission president, Elder Stone expressed his frustrations and indicated his desire to return home. He could not continue. A wise mission president counseled, "Elder, do not give up! You have a desire to believe. If you continue faithful in your calling for a few more weeks, the Lord will answer your prayers. I promise you!"<br><br>Elder Stone agreed to return to his proselyting area for a few more weeks. Again, days and then weeks passed with no change in his feelings. It was difficult. One morning as they were knocking on doors, a woman answered and invited them to return when her husband and children would be home. As they left the small house, Elder Stone said to his companion, "I'm not giving the lesson!"<br><br>His companion responded, "Elder, I'll give the first portion of the discussion, but I want you to tell the Joseph Smith story."<br><br>Finally Elder Stone agreed, even though that was the part that bothered him. From the time they left the woman's house until they returned a day or two later, the missionary used every spare minute to read and pray. He wanted a witness before entering the home. But when the appointed hour came, he still had not received a witness. He had read diligently, he had prayed almost continuously, but there were no special feelings. How could he bear witness when he did not know?<br><br>The father answered the door and ushered the missionaries inside. There on a dirt floor sat nine children, and the father and mother took their places behind them. Elder Stone reported that the size of the home was not much larger than his bedroom in Utah. The humble circumstances only added to his discomfort. The senior companion began the lesson, telling the family that there is a God, that we are his children, and that he loves us. He then explained the mission of the Savior, how God sent his Son to earth to atone for our sins and to make possible our return to our heavenly home. He explained the role of prophets and bore witness that God works through prophets today. He then turned the lesson over to Elder Stone.<br><br>My missionary friend began the story of the 14-year-old Joseph. He told the family about the religious confusion that existed in Palmyra in the 1820s, how Joseph listened to the various ministers proclaiming different versions of Christianity. He told them about Joseph's experience in reading James 1:5, where James states unequivocally: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."<br><br>The missionary related the impact that the passage had on Joseph--that it struck him with more power than had any other scripture, and that this caused him to reflect on it again and again. Finally, Joseph decided to put James to the test. He selected a grove of trees near his father's farm and went there on a beautiful spring day to pray. Being alone, he knelt down and offered up the feelings of his heart. The elder told the family how a dark power came over Joseph, almost choking the life out of the young boy. Exerting all of his powers, Joseph continued to pray, and then, suddenly, a pillar of light descended out of the heavens directly above him. The darkness was dispelled, and in the midst of the light were two personages. One called Joseph by name and, pointing to the other, said: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (See JS--H 1:1–17.)<br><br>At this point in the story, Elder Stone said that a warm feeling began to stir his soul--one he had never felt before. The warmth was deep inside and soon enveloped him. Tears welled up in his eyes. His throat became full, and he could hardly speak. He was embarrassed and ducked his head until he could regain his composure. When he looked up, he noticed tears in the eyes of the parents and the children. They were experiencing the same feelings and warmth of Spirit that he was feeling. He finished the lesson with a conviction born of a spiritual witness that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son. Elder Stone's testimony had shifted from one of belief to a knowledge of the First Vision. As Elder Stone finished sharing his experience with me, he said: "President, I know that Joseph saw the Father and the Son. I did not have a problem in the mission field after that experience. I have my own witness."<br><br>As I listened to the story's conclusion, I thought how efficient God is: he got 12 birds with one Stone! The parents, the nine children, and a missionary were all touched by the Holy Ghost, and a desire to believe was transformed into knowledge. More than that, God is efficient in another way. If a person has a witness of the Father and Son's visit to young Joseph, he or she has a foundation for believing and accepting other gospel principles. The Word of Wisdom, tithing, the law of chastity, and all other principles revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith are true. Once one feels the good seed growing and swelling inside, one has a small amount of knowledge that forms the basis for further growth. In the words of Alma:<br><br><i>And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</i>[Alma 32:34]<br><br>The important aspect of the story for us is the diligence required of Elder Stone. The answer did not come the first time he prayed or the second or the third. Weeks went by as his faith and desires were tested. As Moroni states: "Faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, do not get discouraged in your studies or with respect to your faith. Help will come, and you will master both secular and sacred truths if you are diligent and obedient in your efforts.<br><br>The principle of obedience is important at BYU. The Honor Code is the standard by which we live. The development of character is more important than the development of the intellect. We hope your commitment to the gospel will lead you naturally to abide by the principles of the Honor Code. Those who are diligent in living the behavior standards will be doubly blessed.<br><h2><b>A Witness of Christ</b></h2><br>In closing, may I share with you my witness of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ. His atonement in the meridian of time is the most important event in human history. I know that in a garden Adam and Eve fell that you and I might experience mortality. I also know that in another garden and on the cross, the Lord and Creator of this earth suffered our sins so that we can return home if we will exercise faith in him and repent. There are many scriptures that have helped me understand the personal nature of the Atonement. Two are exceptional. The first is from Alma 7:11–12.<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i><br><br>Alma reveals to us the process by which the Master learned perfect empathy in the flesh. He experienced not only our sins but also our pains, sufferings, temptations of every kind, sicknesses, infirmities, and weaknesses. He also experienced death in order to loose the bands of death for his people. Consequently, if one of us has a special problem, it is not possible for him or her to say, "No one knows what I am experiencing. No one understands my pain or suffering." The Lord knows! He not only knows the depth of your experience, he knows how to succor you because of his suffering.<br><br>The second passage comes from Mosiah, where the prophet Abinadi quotes chapter 53 of Isaiah to the wicked priests of King Noah:<br><br><i>And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed?</i><br><br><i>Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets</i>[and has]<i>hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people . . . are his seed.</i>[Mosiah 15:10–11]<br><br>For many years I envisioned the Garden of Gethsemane and the cross as places where an infinite mass of sin and pain were heaped upon the Savior. Thanks to Alma and Abinadi, it is no longer an infinite mass but an infinite stream of people with whom the Savior became intimately acquainted as he suffered our sins, pains, and afflictions. I testify that he knows each of us, is concerned about our progress, and has the infinite capacity not only to heal our wounds but also to lift us up to the Father as sanctified sons and daughters.<br><br>May this be a wonderful school year for each of you. The BYU faculty and staff are anxious to help and are the best in the world. May our Heavenly Father bless you in your strivings I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 3 September 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ovenants with God - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
All of us can remember times in our lives when we felt a pull to be better than we were, to rise higher. The feeling may have come at about the same time we had the thought "There must be something better in life than this." Sadly, there are also times when we felt like giving up. And then the thought was something like "Maybe this feeling of being miserable is what life is really like. Maybe I need to learn to live with it. It looks as if that's how everyone else feels. Those movies about feeling good and those people who look happy have bought into an illusion." I remember there was even a T-shirt made with a slogan on the front saying, "Life is hard and then its over." And the look on the man's face wearing it made it seem that he was living proof.<br><h2>An Upward Pull</h2><br>But everyone that I have come to know well, even the most discouraged and the most miserable, will tell you that sometime in their lives, maybe just once that they can remember, they felt that upward pull, that thought that there just had to be something better and higher.<br><br>The feeling that you are meant to be better, perhaps in a way you haven't yet discovered, comes from our Heavenly Father. The opposing thought, that the upward pull is an illusion, comes from the adversary, who wants us all to be miserable, as he is.<br><br>Heavenly Father does more than allow you to feel that upward pull. He has provided a way to rise higher, almost beyond our limits of imagination, not by our own powers alone, which would not be nearly enough, but through the power of the atonement of his Son, Jesus Christ. His prophets have described that gift to us in many ways, but this passage teaches both the idea and gives us that feeling again that there is a way to rise above where we are:<br><br><i>I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body--</i><br><br><i>I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</i>[Mosiah 4:6–7]<br><br>That beautifully describes why you are justified in your hope of changing, of being lifted to a higher plane of living. In another place, in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord describes how we can choose to receive his gift and be lifted toward him and our Father in Heaven. Here are the words that describe that process:<br><br><i>These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:69]<br><h2>Making Covenants with our Heavenly Father</h2><br>Our Heavenly Father not only provided a savior and a gospel of Jesus Christ that teaches us the purpose of life and gives us commandments, but he provided covenants we could make with him. And with those covenants he provided ordinances where he could signify what he promised or covenanted to do and we could signify what we promised or covenanted to do. All of those covenants, taken together, are a "new and everlasting covenant" (D&amp;amp;C 132:6–7).<br><br>Our Heavenly Father has at different periods in the history of this earth adjusted what he has asked of his children because of choices they made, but the new and everlasting covenant has endured and will endure. Here it is described by the Lord as the gospel of Jesus Christ was being restored for the last time:<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing; and this is a new and an everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 22:1]<br><br>Heavenly Father has always helped his children by offering them covenants and empowering his servants to offer ordinances. President Marion G. Romney named some of those covenants as he described the kindness of our Father in Heaven and of the Savior:<br><br><i>Traditionally, God's people have been known as a covenant people. The gospel itself is the new and everlasting covenant. The posterity of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob is the covenant race. We come into the Church by covenant, which we enter into when we go into the waters of baptism. The new and everlasting covenant of celestial marriage is the gate to exaltation in the celestial kingdom. Men receive the Melchizedek Priesthood by an oath and covenant.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1962, p. 17]<br><br>My message to you tonight is one of gratitude to our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ for offering to make those covenants with us, and it is one of joy that those covenants are what you have always wanted, are what you yearned for when you felt those stirrings for a better life.<br><br>My concern is that by looking only at the promises we make, the magnitude of them could overwhelm and perhaps even discourage. Sadly, many of us have seen that happen.<br><br>We have taught the gospel to someone who understood it, believed it, but shrank back at the thought of taking on the obligations that come with the ordinance and the covenants of baptism. It just takes issuing the baptismal challenge to a few contacts to have the experience of seeing concern in the eyes of even a believing contact. Perhaps that is why Alma the Elder issued his invitation to accept the obligations of the baptismal covenant in the beautiful way that he did. It is recorded this way:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life--</i><br><br><i>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</i>[Mosiah 18:8–10]<br><br>Alma knew what it takes not only to be willing but also to love to make covenants with God. He didn't minimize the obligations: a lifetime of reaching out to every soul whom God may call us to serve, both with comfort and with fearless declaration of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ as God has revealed it to his authorized servants. The person contemplating such a life can sense what it will take in effort and in courage. Alma knew they would see that, and so he also told them what we need to hear, too. Notice at the end, in only a few words, he told them what God would covenant to do as they kept their part of the covenant: "That he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you." The people he was inviting to the covenant of baptism had already tasted the sweet promptings of the Holy Ghost. Alma gave a promise that is sure: If they would make and keep the covenant in the waters of baptism, they would then be able to receive the ordinance of the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. And then they would not only have an increase in the power and frequency of those sweet promptings of the Comforter, but they could have the promise fulfilled to them of the Holy Ghost as a companion. With every covenant there are great and sure promises from our Heavenly Father. Alma must have known that those people could anticipate and so would want a life where the Holy Ghost could be a companion.<br><br>But he taught more than that. Listen to the words with which he began: "As ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people." Alma knew the covenant was not like a business deal--"you do this for God, and God will do this for you"--but it was an opportunity for them to become his, to become God's people. Every covenant with God is an opportunity to draw closer to him. To anyone who reflects for a moment on what they have already felt of the love of God, to have that bond made stronger and that relationship closer is an irresistible offer. Alma knew the people he taught had felt and recognized the love of God. We may not recognize it, but when our faith lets us see the evidence of God's love in his blessings, we will be as eager to make a covenant to draw closer to him as were the people at the waters of Mormon.<br><br>That upward pull we have felt is far more than a desire for self-improvement. It is a longing for home, to be again with the Heavenly Father we have loved and who loves us and to be able to live again with him, feeling the love we felt there and that we can taste here, if we will. And all of us sense the mighty change that must come in us for us to be able to dwell with him again.<br><br>We can find that same pattern of describing obligations, promises, and the assurance of growing closer to God in the way the Lord offers us other covenants. The Melchizedek Priesthood is offered with an oath and covenant. You can hear words describing both promised blessings and the assurance of drawing closer to God to become more like him, as well as the obligations we assume:<br><br><i>For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.</i><br><br><i>They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.</i><br><br><i>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</i><br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i><br><br><i>And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.</i><br><br><i>But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.</i><br><br><i>And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:33–42]<br><br>The magnitude of the promises available through that covenant make the heart beat a little faster. Here are just a few.<br><br>When we honor that priesthood, we have heavenly hosts and angels who are watching over us. Some of us know how literally that is true. There are some returned missionaries who know that they have walked down some streets and been in some places and faced some anger and opposition where they have felt protection and being watched over by more than human power. Some of us have an absolute assurance that those whom we have known who held the priesthood who are now part of that heavenly host are deeply aware of what we are doing and sometimes deeply concerned for the quality of our service.<br><br>Also, the promise is there that those who receive the servants of God, honoring that priesthood, will have this blessing:<br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:36–38]<br><br>There, again, is the promise that is in all the covenants that God offers to us to make with him: Keeping them will draw us up, closer to him. And even a small recognition of his love makes us want to make covenants with him and to keep them. That love more than wipes out the fear that the magnitude of our promises and the severity of the penalties for failure could create in us.<br><br>The covenant God offers us in marriage contains the crowning promise, the one that most touches our hearts. To be sealed in the temple of God by the sealing power that God has restored to the earth allows God to promise us that we may have all that he has, to live the life that he lives, and to be with him, the Savior, and our faithful family members forever in perfect love and harmony. Our promise is complete, too. We promise to give him all that we have and are and all that we may ever have and ever achieve. So the promise is that we may have all he has by our giving all we have. The almost unimaginable imbalance of that exchange, all we have for all he has, is a measure of his love for us. That ought to increase that upward tug we've felt in the way a prophet long ago described feeling in his heart:<br><br><i>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</i>[Alma 36:22]<br><br>All of us are blessed by these covenants, whatever our circumstances. There were in the central part of Africa people who could not accept the baptismal covenant because those authorized to administer that ordinance were not yet among them. But they studied the scriptures of the Restoration as well as of the Bible, learned all they could, lived what they understood, and waited. The opportunity to be baptized finally came. They had prepared. Each time I go to the temple to perform an ordinance by proxy for a dead ancestor, I pray that somehow the faithful elders in the spirit world have found them, that they have anticipated this day, and that in their hearts they have been prepared to make and keep the covenants.<br><br>The same is true for the oath and covenant of the priesthood and the covenant of marriage in the temple. There might be some young woman listening tonight with the thought "What has that got to do with me?" But then you may go out of this meeting tonight with friends whose lives could be changed forever by how you feel about the oath and covenant of the priesthood and the covenant of marriage in the house of the Lord. You may have more influence than you can imagine on a young man's keeping the oath and covenant of the priesthood and on whether he will know the joy of making covenants in the temple. If you love those covenants, he is more likely to love and honor them.<br><br>All of us need to increase our desire to make covenants with God. A place to begin is to recognize some things that have already happened to each of us. That stirring we have felt to be better, the thought that there must be some higher life and better place, is a gift of faith in covenants with God. We could ask God in prayer to confirm that this is true and that the feeling came from him.<br><br>Another recognition of what is past that will increase our desire to keep covenants is to see more clearly the evidence of God's love for us in what he has done already.<br><br>That can be hard. The world tries to tell us that whatever good happens is from our own efforts. And then, in a quick reversal of logic--from the claim that there is no God to the suggestion that he is heartless--the world will say to us, "How can you believe in a god of justice and mercy when such bad things happen to you and to others?" On top of the world trying to get us to believe God couldn't be the author of our blessings, our natural selfishness can distract us from recognizing and feeling his love. We can focus so much on what we have asked for, which he either hasn't given yet or may never give because it is not good for us, that we ignore the blessings he has already showered upon us. If we would like to increase our desire to make covenants with God by sensing more clearly his love for us, King Benjamin wrote some words we ought to read frequently. You will remember them, since they are familiar, but you might listen this time not for the rebuke that is there but for the invitation to see ourselves as children favored by a loving Father:<br><br><i>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another--</i><br><br><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</i><br><br><i>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</i><br><br><i>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</i><br><br><i>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</i><br><br><i>And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</i><br><br><i>And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</i>[Mosiah 2:20–26]<br><br>You and I could choose to see Heavenly Father and our lives that way. Even as his mortal body was failing, King Benjamin saw that every covenant he had kept had brought the promised blessings. But on top of that he had received the blessings God pours out on all his children, without regard to their station or even their gratitude. If we could just train ourselves to see as King Benjamin saw, it wouldn't be hard to keep what the Savior described once as the first commandment:<br><br><i>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</i>[Mark 12:30]<br><br>We can start down the King Benjamin road tonight by counting our blessings. We could try naming them one by one in prayer tonight, perhaps pausing a moment after each one to let the feelings of gratitude grow. We may not only be surprised by what the Lord has done but by how long we have been kneeling there as the blessings we have not noticed or have forgotten come flooding into our minds. The covenant promise the Lord made that his disciples could remember his words extends to remembering and recognizing his blessings. I know, because I have tried it. Here is the promise as recorded in John:<br><br><i>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</i>[John 14:26]<br><br>That feeling of gratitude and love which will come from that prayer will move us toward wanting to make and keep covenants with God. Those who are not yet members of the Church will be drawn to pray to ask whether the power to baptize was restored through John the Baptist conferring the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and whether the power to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost was returned to the earth by Peter, James, and John. Those of us who have been baptized will review our lives to see what we have done or not done that determines whether the Lord can keep his promise to let the Spirit always be with us. Because we are human still, that reflection usually leads to a desire to repent of things both done and not done.<br><br>If we repeat the process often enough and with enough intent, we will feel some desires to honor the oath and covenant of the priesthood. That oath and covenant has blessings in it for all of us, young and old, whatever our situations. You remember the promise:<br><br><i>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;</i><br><br><i>And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:36–38]<br><br>There is a blessing for us in such a small act as inviting a home teacher to give a blessing or asking a bishop if there is any way we could help him in his service. There is a blessing in the way we speak of the prophet of God and in whether we listen when he speaks. We can receive the Lord's servants during general conference simply by yearning to hear their words or by reading them and pondering when we can. When we receive the Lord's servants, we receive him. In that we are all blessed, or we can be, by the promises in the oath and covenant of the priesthood.<br><br>Within the family there may be for us greater opportunities to welcome the powers promised through the priesthood and thus welcome the Lord. Every person in a family has an effect on the power of the priesthood exercised there. For a solitary member it may be to ask for a home teacher to give a priesthood blessing. For the child of a father growing indifferent to his priesthood covenants it may be the quiet request "Dad, I'd like you to be with me when I go to the temple" or "Dad, it would mean so much to me if you could set me apart." More than one man has started upward again, never to turn back, after hearing and feeling such a plea from his child.<br><br>The covenant of a temple marriage may seem distant, either because it appears unattainable or because the cares of a busy life have eroded the meaning it had when the covenants were made. But every child of God is promised every blessing if they are faithful. And where those covenants were made, the blessings are still available. In just the last few days I heard a young girl report a night of baby-sitting. That doesn't sound very celestial, and it had its challenges for her. But the reports of little kindnesses shown, of patience, of long-suffering, made me think of a passage of scripture that may not have occurred to her that night. It goes this way:<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41]<br><br>This young girl may not have been thinking of marriage and of the home she may someday have, of children, and of a priesthood holder in it as her companion. But she was choosing that night to live in such a way that if someday God gave her such blessings, those children and that husband would experience and expect, simply by her example, the kind of care that is given by the true servants of God. And if she were so blessed, her husband would be drawn upward in his priesthood service just by what that little girl, grown older, would bring to that home and family.<br><br>We can do the things now that will lead us to love, make, and keep covenants. And we can without invading their agency invite others by example to love and want to make and keep covenants. Because of what we do, they can look forward to the peace and the hope that can come from keeping the baptismal covenant, from receiving those who honor the oath and covenant of the priesthood, and from associating in a home where people are living so that they might be sealed to live forever in the presence of our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now I want to tell you what I know. I have not talked to you about theory. I have talked to you about what I know. I know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives. I have felt his patient and enduring love all my life. I know that Jesus is the Christ, that through his sacrifice and love we are cleansed and sanctified as we obey the laws of the gospel. I know that the ordinances and covenants offered through the keys of the priesthood held by President Gordon B. Hinckley are honored by God when we honor them. I promise you that the promises are true. I pray that you will accept them in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B. Eyring was a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 8 September 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> for Truth - Gordon B. Hinckley - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is an honor and a rare privilege to speak to this "stone-cold sober" gathering of university students.<br><br>You have done it again. You have made the national news. I was in Oregon on Sunday participating in a conference and read in the paper the Associated Press story of the<i>Princeton Review'</i>s "Advantage Guide to the Best 310 Colleges."<br><br>Florida State University came out number one as the "party school" of the nation. George Washington University came out number two, and the University of Florida number three.<br><br>On the other side of the coin were the top 10 "stone-cold sober" schools.<br><br>Number one is Deep Springs College in Dyer, Nevada. I know nothing about that school. In fact, I had never before heard of Dyer, Nevada. I took occasion to look it up in my 1965 Rand McNally atlas. The map showed it to be very near the Nevada-California border, some distance from any large community. The population at the time my atlas was printed was 20 people. I am sure it has grown if it has a college.<br><br>I do not know the size of Deep Springs College, but I am confident that it in no way approaches the size of Brigham Young University, which was listed number two. I said to myself, "What a significant honor this is. It says in effect that BYU is judged to be the number one large university in terms of sobriety and a no-nonsense attitude on the part of the student body on why they are going to a university--that is, to gain an education to prepare for constructive careers."<br><br>I followed down the column and discovered that the U.S. Military Academy at West Point followed BYU, and that this was followed by the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. I submit to you that you are in good company, the best the nation has to offer.<br><br>The story indicated that a young female music major at Florida State University, upon hearing of her school's ranking, asked, "Where did we come in, in academics? Number 350?" (See<i>The Register-Guard,</i>Eugene, Oregon, Sunday, 15 September 1996.)<br><br>I do not know how many of you were interviewed for this survey, but to you who responded, I offer my congratulations. You spoke for this whole vast student body, and you spoke in such a way as to make us proud of you. I hope that while others may gain the reputation for being stone-cold inebriated--if that's what "partying" denotes--you will be recognized for being stone-cold sober and alert and on top of things.<br><br>This is truly a unique university. It is a great institution. We have every confidence in its leadership, in President Bateman, in his associates in the administration, and in the faculty. How fortunate you are to be here. I bring you the commendation of the board of trustees and the compliments of the entire Church. I only wish that everyone who wanted to come here might have the opportunity. That very many were turned away is a fact with which you are all familiar.<br><br>I repeat what I have said before, that a vast amount of the tithing funds of the Church is required to make it possible for you to receive an education at this remarkable institution. How great is your responsibility, how compelling your trust, to give your very best effort during the season that you are here.<br><br>We are all concerned about the time required for the average student to earn a bachelor's degree. If you will shorten that time through careful planning and consistent studies, you will make it possible for more worthy young people to come here, thereby blessing their lives and the lives of others they will influence through the years.<br><br>I recently reread a statement given on this campus years ago by Charles H. Malik, then secretary general of the United Nations. He said:<br><br><i>I respect all men, and it is from disrespect for none that I say there are no great leaders in the world today. In fact, greatness itself is laughed to scorn. You should not be great today--you should sink yourself into the herd, you should not be distinguished from the crowd, you should simply be one of the many.</i><br><br><i>The commanding voice is lacking. The voice which speaks little, but which when it speaks, speaks with compelling moral authority--this kind of voice is not congenial to this age. The age flattens and levels down every distinction into drab uniformity. Respect for the high, the noble, the great, the rare, the specimen that appears once every hundred or every thousand years, is gone. Respect at all is gone! If you ask whom and what people do respect, the answer is literally nobody and nothing. This is simply an unrespecting age--it is the age of utter mediocrity. To become a leader today, even a mediocre leader, is a most uphill struggle. You are constantly and in every way and from every side pulled down. One wonders who of those living today will be remembered a thousand years from now--the way we remember with such profound respect Plato, and Aristotle, and Christ, and Paul, and Augustine, and Aquinas.</i><br><br><i>If you believe in prayer, my friends, and I know you do, then pray that God send great leaders, especially great leaders of the spirit.</i>[Charles H. Malik, "Forum Address" (18 November 1975),<i>BYU Studies</i>16, no. 4 (Summer 1976): 543–44]<br><br>It is in harmony with that profound statement that I wish to say a few words to you today. You are good. But it is not enough just to be good. You must be good for something. You must contribute good to the world. The world must be a better place for your presence. And the good that is in you must be spread to others.<br><br>I do not suppose that any of us here this day will be remembered a thousand years from now. I do not suppose that we will be remembered a century from now.<br><br>But in this world so filled with problems, so constantly threatened by dark and evil challenges, you can and must rise above mediocrity, above indifference. You can become involved and speak with a strong voice for that which is right.<br><br>I took these words from General Mark W. Clark, one of the notable officers of the World War II. He said:<br><br><i>All nations seek it constantly, because it is the key to greatness, sometimes to survival ... the electric and the elusive quality known as leadership. Where does juvenile delinquency begin? In leaderless families. Where do slums fester? In leaderless cities. Which armies falter, which political parties fail? Poorly led ones. Contrary to the old saying that leaders are born not made, the art of leading can be taught and it can be mastered.</i>[Quoted in<i>Thomas Jefferson Research Center Bulletin,</i>no. 23, December 1967]<br><br>You are here majoring in math, in chemistry or physics, in law, in English, whatever. This schooling is designed to equip you to earn a living in the society of which you will become a part. But you cannot simply sit in your laboratory or your library and let the world drift along its aimless way. It needs your strength, your courage, your voice in speaking up for those values that can save it.<br><br>If this university meets the purpose for which it is maintained, then you must leave here not alone with secular knowledge but, even more important, with a spiritual and moral foundation that will find expression to improve the family, the community, the nation, even the world of which you will be a part.<br><br>I read to you from 1 Kings 2:<br><br><i>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</i><br><br><i>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</i><br><br><i>And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</i><br><br><i>That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</i>[1 Kings 2:1–4]<br><br>This "stone-cold sober" institution, this, your beloved alma mater, is the place to prepare yourselves, not only for your chosen academic discipline but in a much larger sense, and possibly a much more important sense, to be a man or a woman who will rise above the mediocrity of his or her surroundings and stand up for what is good and decent and right.<br><br>We are involved in the same battle that went on before the earth was created. It is a battle between right and wrong, between truth and error, between the design of the Almighty and his Beloved Son, on the one hand, and Lucifer, the son of the morning, on the other.<br><br>Stand up for truth in a world of sophistry. We are in the midst of a political campaign in this nation. As usual, we are being saturated with claims and counterclaims. Anyone who has lived as long as I have has heard again and again the sweet talk that leads to victory but that seems never to be realized thereafter. It is imperative that good people, men and women of principle, be involved in the political process; otherwise we abdicate power to those whose designs are almost entirely selfish.<br><br>John Engler, governor of Michigan, recently said:<br><br><i>The wisdom of the ages reveals that our moral compass cannot ultimately come from Lansing or from any other state capital, any more than it can come from the nation's capital, or Hollywood, or the United Nations, or some abstract liberal conception of the "Village." It comes from deep within us-- it comes from our character, which is forged in our families and our faith and tempered in the arena of decisionmaking and action.</i>[John Engler, "The Michigan Miracle,"<i>Imprimis</i>25, no. 8 (August 1996): 4]<br><br>I encourage you to speak up for moral standards in a world where filth, sleaze, pornography, and their evil brood are sweeping over us as a flood. In the first place, none of us can afford to be partakers of this rubbish. Not one of<i>us,</i>neither I nor any one of you, can become involved with such things as sleazy videotapes, suggestive television programs, debasing movies, sensual magazines, so-called "900 numbers," or the kind of filth that evidently can be picked up on the Internet. Avoid them like the plague, for they are a serious and deadly disease.<br><br>Lend your strength to the crusade against illegal drugs. They are all about us--right here among us. Their use, particularly among youth, has doubled in the last four years. Think of it! Doubled since 1992. Where are we going? Lives are blighted, careers are destroyed, even the next generation is injured--in many cases beyond repair--when young people take up drugs and develop an addiction.<br><br>You can reach out to prevent a foolhardy decision on the part of a boy or girl. Your interest, your caring attitude, and your voice may make the difference between life and death in a very literal sense.<br><br>Stand up for integrity in your business, in your profession, in your home, in the society of which you are a part.<br><br>Again, it is not enough that you retreat to your private cloister and pursue only your special private interests. Your strong voice is needed. The weight of your stance may be enough to tip the scales in the direction of truth.<br><br>What a dismal picture is so often painted of men of greed, men who violated every canon of honesty to get a little more when they already had more than they knew how to use. There is the whole picture of the failed savings and loan organizations--whose destruction was caused by selfish men, bringing losses to thousands and increased burdens to every taxpayer in the nation. This is an indication of what happens when people will not stand up and speak out against practices that are totally dishonest and that lead only to suffering and regret.<br><br>Stand up for integrity in the home. Many of you are not married, but most of you will be. Again, you cannot pursue your professional and other pursuits and neglect your domestic affairs. Never forget what President McKay taught: "No success in life can compensate for failure in the home" (see<i>CR,</i>April 1935, p. 116; quoting James Edward McCulloch, ed.,<i>Home: The Savior of Civilization</i>[Washington, D.C.: Southern Co-operative League, 1924], p. 42). And President Harold B. Lee said: "Remember always that the most important of the Lord's work you and I will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes" (<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1974], pp. 255–56).<br><br>I deal much with cases of divorce and requests for cancellation of temple sealings. It is the most difficult of all the things with which I have to do. Almost without exception, each case involves deception, dishonesty, broken promises, violated covenants, heartbreak, and tragedy. Begin with your own home to preserve the sanctity of your marriage, the eternity of your covenants, and the happiness that comes where there is love and security and trust in the family. Put the comfort and happiness of your companion and your children ahead of your own and reach out with a helping hand to those whose marriages have become troubled.<br><br>Stand up for loyalty--to your associates, to your heritage, to your good name, to the Church of which you are a part.<br><br>How marvelous a quality is loyalty. There is no substitute for it. It comes of an inner strength. Said Shakespeare: "To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man" (<i>Hamlet,</i>I, iii, 75).<br><br>In this world, almost without exception, we must work together as teams. It is so obvious to all of us that those on the football field or on the basketball court must work together with loyalty one to another if they are to win. It is so in life. We work as teams, and there must be loyalty among us.<br><br>William Manchester, as a young Marine, fought through the terrible battle of Okinawa. He was savagely wounded but lived to return to the hellish fire of the Shuri Line, where thousands on each side perished. Then, years later, as a grown and mature man and an accomplished writer, he returned to Okinawa and walked over its once battle-scarred ridges. On reflection on those earlier brutish days, he wrote:<br><br><i>Men, I now knew, do not fight for flag or country, for the Marine Corps or glory or any other abstraction. They fight for one another. Any man in combat who lacks comrades who will die for him, or for whom he is willing to die, is not a man at all. He is truly damned.</i>[<i>Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War</i>(Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1980), p. 391]<br><br>Be loyal to those with whom you work in the battles of life. "A house divided against itself cannot stand" (see Mark 3:25).<br><br>Stand up for loyalty to your heritage. Each of us represents the latest chapter in a long line of generations. Included in those generations are forebears, many of whom made terrible sacrifices for that which we have today. They have left us good names that have been safeguarded through the generations. The name that you carry is a treasured possession. Keep it unsullied. Pass it to the next generation without stain or embarrassment. Stand up for loyalty to those who have gone before you.<br><br>Be loyal to the Church. Stand tall for it. Defend it. Speak no evil against it. It is the work of God. He who ridicules it or defames it offends him whose church it is. It carries the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>It is as a wonderful mother to you, in whose arms you find shelter, warmth, comfort, and security.<br><br><i>Who's on the Lord's side? Who?</i><br><i>Now is the time to show.</i><br><i>We ask it fearlessly:</i><br><i>Who's on the Lord's side? Who?</i><br>["Who's on the Lord's Side?"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 260]<br><br>You cannot be indifferent to this great cause. You have accepted it. You have entered into sacred covenants. Regardless of what you do in the future with the knowledge you gain from your secular studies, you cannot escape your obligation under the covenant you implicitly made when you were baptized and the covenant that you have renewed each time you have partaken of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.<br><br>You cannot simply take for granted this cause, which is the cause of Christ. You cannot simply stand on the sidelines and watch the play between the forces of good and evil. Said Nephi: "They who are not for me are against me, saith our God" (2 Nephi 10:16). Wrote John the Revelator:<br><br><i>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</i><br><br><i>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</i>[Revelation 3:15–16]<br><br>And so, my beloved brethren and sisters, as you begin this new year in the pursuit of studies to qualify you for your life's work, I urge you with all the capacity that I have to reach out in a duty that stands beyond the requirements of our everyday lives; that is, to stand strong, even to become a leader in speaking up in behalf of those causes that make our civilization shine and that give comfort and peace to our lives. You can be a leader. You must be a leader, as a member of this Church, in those causes for which this Church stands. Do not let fear overcome your efforts, for as Paul wrote to Timothy: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7). The adversary of all truth would put into your heart a reluctance to make an effort. Cast that fear aside and be valiant in the cause of truth and righteousness and faith. If you<i>now</i>decide that this will become the pattern of your life, you will not have to make that decision again. You will put on "the armour of God" and raise your voice in defense of truth whatever the circumstances now and in all the years that lie ahead (see Ephesians 6:11).<br><br>God bless you, my beloved associates, you young men and women for whom the future holds such marvelous promise. May your world, and your children's world, be the better for your presence and your leadership. Please know of our love for you, of our faith and confidence and trust in you. We thank you for your prayers on our behalf. Please know that we pray for you because you mean so very much to us and to the future of the world and to the wonderful Church we have the honor to represent. May the blessings of heaven attend you, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gordon B.

<h1>h to Serve” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am certainly humbled and honored to be here on the beautiful campus of Brigham Young University and to be in the presence of President Bateman, the administrators and faculty, and the many members of the student body assembled here at the Marriott Center.<br><br>I would like to take a moment and express my great love for President Bateman. It has been my privilege for the past several years to sit next to him at general conference, since seating for the Brethren is arranged alphabetically. I'm grateful for the opportunity of becoming acquainted with him and feeling of his great spirit, dedication, love, and leadership.<br><br>My wife and I are also thankful for the influence Brigham Young University has had on our children and for the education they have received here. Perhaps even more important, we're grateful for the continued spiritual guidance and direction the university has provided for them to help fortify the teachings they have received in our family as well as on their missions.<br><br>I received the assignment to participate in this devotional just a little over a week ago. I have to admit this last week has been somewhat hectic and also intimidating. I'll explain the intimidating factor in just a moment. Last week I received a letter from Vice President R. J. Snow extending an official invitation for me to speak at the devotional this morning. President and Sister Snow and Sue and I were called as mission presidents at the same time in 1987--President and Sister Snow to serve in Africa, my wife and I to serve in Scotland. We had the opportunity of becoming well acquainted with each other while attending mission presidents' seminars. It's good to be with the Snows once again.<br><br>I would like to share with you one sentence in the letter I received from him: "We hope you will select a topic important to you, knowing that this will be an important opportunity for the campus community to benefit from your experience and testimony." I have always been impressed upon entering the campus of Brigham Young University with the inscription that greets everyone: "The world is our campus. Enter to learn; go forth to serve." Both Sue and I were raised in Salt Lake City, but we have spent the better part of the last nine years with the world being our home. We spent two years in Scotland as I served as a mission president. Then our service took us from Scotland to the South Pacific, where we lived in Australia and had the blessing and opportunity of serving in Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Cook Islands, and the Kirabati Islands.<br><br>Our most recent service has given us the opportunity to serve in the Philippines/Micronesia area, where we've been for the last four years. We returned home a little more than a month ago and are loving the opportunity of getting reacquainted with our children and grandchildren--our newest grandchild here on the front row being about two weeks old.<br><br>The intimidating part of preparing to be with you this morning is shared in a very brief story of an experience Sister Banks and I had while touring one of the missions in the southern part of the Philippines several years ago. After one of the zone conference meetings, the mission president's wife, who was a local Filipino sister, came to me and with some hesitation said, "I hope I will not offend you, President, but I thought perhaps you would like to know you were using some words we don't use or understand here in the Philippines."<br><br>I assured her that she would not offend me and that I would appreciate her sharing with me what she meant. The Philippines is often referred to as an English-speaking country, but that is true only to a certain extent. The sweet wife of the mission president, Sister Amistad, then proceeded to tell me, "President, you used the word<i>photograph</i>today. In the Philippines, we really don't understand what photograph means. What you really mean is 'picture.'" Then she said, "Another word you used throughout the meeting was<i>bashful."</i>(I had invited the missionaries to participate with me and not be bashful.) She said, "I went home and looked up in the dictionary what<i>bashful</i>meant, and what you really meant is 'shy' and 'timid.'"<br><br>I thanked her for sharing this with me and asked her in our meeting the next day if she would write down all the words I used that would not be understood by the Filipinos. She hesitated at first, but with my encouragement she said she would. The next day she produced another 20 words, and I have tried to adapt my vocabulary accordingly.<br><br>The intimidating factor I mentioned earlier is that I really believe I have lost much of my vocabulary in the many years I have been gone in trying to learn to converse in understandable terms with the wonderful people we have been blessed to live with throughout the world.<br><br>I realize there are many here in this audience this morning who have served missions or have lived in third-world countries. Perhaps there are even those here who have served in the Philippines/Micronesia area. Nevertheless, I felt impressed this morning to share with you for a few minutes what is happening in the Lord's kingdom in the beautiful islands of the Philippines and Micronesia.<br><br>The Lord's directive to "send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off; unto the islands of the sea" (D&amp;amp;C 133:8) has surely come to pass in the Philippines/Micronesia area. Today there are approximately 1,700 missionaries proclaiming the gospel to nearly 70 million people on the 7,100-plus islands that make up the Philippines and on the major Micronesian islands of Majuro, Ebeye, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap, Palau, Saipan, and Guam. In the Micronesia Guam Mission, the missionaries are still mostly Americans, but there are local Micronesians and some Filipino missionaries serving here as well. It is a completely different picture in the Philippines. More than 69 percent of the missionaries are local Filipinos, and many are first-generation converts with only two or three years of Church membership experience.<br><br>We have witnessed with amazement the spectacular growth of the Church in the area. President Hinckley often refers to this as "the miracle of Manila." We have felt the influence of the Holy Spirit distilling over the islands and their peoples. We have watched miracles brought about by the Lord as he has opened the way for the gospel to go forth. Official missionary work really started as a result of President Hinckley's visit to the country in 1961. Calling a special early-morning meeting at the Fort McKinley War Memorial Cemetery, President Hinckley spoke and prayed for the commencement of missionary work in the country. Speaking of that meeting, he said:<br><br><i>I arose at 4:30 a.m. to go out to the American War Memorial Cemetery on the outskirts of Manila. Here are buried 17,168 war-dead, and on the walls are inscribed the names of an additional 36,230 who are missing. At this hour of the morning with the sun rising over the mountains and the sea to the east, and the golden clouds in the sky, it was a marvelous setting. Here we met to invoke the blessings of the Lord upon the missionary work in the Philippines. Surrounded by the reminders of war, we met in the name of the Prince of Peace. I was the final speaker at that early morning meeting. To those present I said, "This is an occasion you will never forget. What we begin here will affect the lives of thousands and thousands of people in this island republic, and its effects will go forth from generation to generation for great and everlasting good."</i><br><br>Today there are more than 375,000 members of the Church in the area. Growth has been stunning. From just 100 members at the end of 1961, the Church in the last decade alone has tripled in size. If this pattern of growth continues, there will be more than one million members in the Philippines by the year 2005. The Church in the Philippines/Micronesia area is in its infancy right now and, just like dealing with infants, needs extra-special care and attention. It is growing quickly and, I believe, will mature into a fully developed entity. The transition to maturity will require lots of resources for many years to come. If we continue to respond to those needs, the results will be a beacon of hope and light for all to see and recognize in all of Asia.<br><br>On a lighter note, Sue and I have battled the traffic, encountered the numerous electrical brownouts, persevered without water, shaken with the earth tremors, and witnessed countless tropical storms and typhoons and the volcanic devastation that continues today from the lahar from Mount Pinatubo. Yes, we would not have missed a minute of it.<br><br>Let me share with you one of those lighter moments I think you can relate to. A couple of years ago, while visiting the southern islands of Mindanao for the purpose of organizing a stake from a district in General Santos, Sue and I had the following experience that I will never forget. On Sunday morning, while showering in preparation for our meetings, the water went off. I called to Sue and said, "Sue, the water has just gone off in the shower. Is there any water in the sink?" She checked and said that there was a slight dribble. I said, "Quick, put the dipper under and get me some water so I can get the soap off of me."<br><br>As she did, she said, "The water has stopped in the sink also."<br><br>So I proceeded to take the towel to wipe off all of the soap. After getting out of the shower, I turned to Sue and said, "What am I going to do? I haven't shaved yet, and I didn't bring my electric razor. I can't go to Church without shaving."<br><br>She looked at me and said, "Well, there's still some water in the toilet. I guess you'll just have to shave in the toilet."<br><br>I said, "You're kidding!"<br><br>She said, "What choice do you have?"<br><br>So there I was kneeling on the floor and shaving in the toilet. Her final remarks to me were, "I wish I had a camera to take a picture of this."<br><br>There were many similar experiences. But the ones we will remember most are the ones demonstrating the faith, commitment, dedication, and the example of love for our Father in Heaven and for living prophets and apostles exemplified by the wonderful people in the Philippines and the Micronesian Islands. The Filipino and Micronesian Saints have been endowed with great faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and gifts of the Spirit are very abundant in their lives. I'd like to share some of those spiritual experiences with you. Some of these experiences I have had personally and some have been related to me by members.<br><br>Story number one:<br><br><i>Malou Ducta shivered in the darkness as she prayed. The typhoon, still raging out of control, was threatening to shatter the small house where she and the others were huddled. The friendly sea had become a violent stranger. Everybody was crying.</i><br><br><i>Hours ago, Malou and her family had evacuated their small house of nipa palms and wood at the edge of the sea near the city of Sorsogon. They had waded through chilling chest-deep water and muddy debris to reach a friend's house higher on the hill.</i><br><br><i>Now, as the tumult outside continued, Malou kept praying. Suddenly she thought of her college notebook! How could she have forgotten it? Tucked inside its cover was the money she had been awarded from a Church scholarship fund. This money would pay for her final exams. With the money, she could take the exams and graduate. Without it, her dreams of graduating--and getting a job to help support her family--would shatter like a tiny nipa hut in a storm.</i><br><br><i>"I was praying as if talking to a friend, and I said to the Lord, 'It's</i>your<i>money, and you know that if I don't have it, I can't graduate from college.' I kept praying, asking Heavenly Father to save the money."</i><br><br><i>At 2:00 a.m., the men ventured outside. "They found out that there were no more houses by the seashore," Malou says. In tears, everyone ran to see for themselves. "All were destroyed. All gone."</i><br><br><i>The shore was littered with debris and with bodies of people and animals that had died in the storm. "We were just thankful that no one in our family had died," she says. "The only things we were able to save were our lives and the clothes that we wore. I felt comforted about losing my tuition money, because it was only money."</i><br><br><i>People started digging in the sand and mud, trying to salvage whatever they could find. "One of my cousins shouted at me: 'Oh, this is your folder!' I ran and got it. It was wet, but the money was all there!"</i><br><br><i>As Malou recalls that moment, she again begins to cry. "Heavenly Father really knows my need."</i><br><br><i>The only other belongings Malou's family recovered were some irreplaceable photos--photos of her parents when they were young, a photo of the family dressed in white on their baptism day, and a photo of the family in white on the day they were sealed in the Manila Temple.</i>[Marvin K. Gardner, "Philippine Saints,"<i>Tambuli,</i>September 1991, pp. 8–11]<br><br>Story number two:<br><br><i>"When I got married," says Consolación Pilobello of Pasay City, "I didn't know how to cook, and I was too superstitious to go to a doctor and get prenatal care. Our first baby died."</i><br><br><i>She begins to cry. "If only I had been a member of the Church then, we could have saved that baby!"</i><br><br><i>After baptism, she learned in Relief Society about water purification, sanitation, nutrition, first aid, and immunizations. "I learned how to take care of my children, myself, and my family," she says. Her next seven babies were healthy.</i>[pp. 11–12]<br><br>The youngest of those babies now serves as a full-time missionary in the Philippines Baguio Mission, which I recently toured before returning to America.<br><br>Story number three:<br><br><i>To get to the Monares family's one-room home in the city of Cebu, you have to walk through a maze of narrow, crowded alleys. When you enter the tiny room, the first thing you see is a</i>New Era<i>poster. . . .</i><br><br><i>One shelf of a small bookcase is filled with new copies of the Book of Mormon to give away. "Our son is on a mission," Santos Monares explains.</i><br><br><i>Brother Monares buys and sells merchandise on the street, hoping to transact enough business to feed his family. When he and his wife, Julieta, first started talking about going to the temple, Julieta didn't want to build up her hopes. She felt it was useless to even try to save enough money for the boat trip. And then Brother Monares was sick for a long time. But somehow, they got enough money together for themselves and four of their children to make the trip.</i><br><br><i>When Sister Monares went to the market to buy food for the journey, someone pickpocketed all her food money. Again she was tempted to give up. But fast-offering funds helped pay for food, and they finally made it to the Manila Temple. . . .</i><br><br><i>"In the temple, we forgot all the problems of the outside world," says Brother Monares.</i>[pp. 14–17]<br><br>The fourth story is told by Gemma Penafiel:<br><br><i>I was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on May 25, 1991. I was visiting my aunt in Laguna, and she encouraged me to let the missionaries teach me about the Church. . . . It is a very funny story how my two aunties joined the Church. They were sitting under a mango tree when two missionaries passed by. My auntie Cita, who is a very funny woman, told the two missionaries, . . . "Hey Jo, give us chocolate Jo." When the two missionaries heard what she said, they stopped by and arranged the first visit with them. . . .</i><br><br><i>My daughter Pinky was two and one-half years old. . . .</i><br><br><i>Our home in Banago was very little, about 6**8* . . . with no furniture, but I was happy with that house because Pinky, my auntie, and I have a place to sleep. . . .</i><br><br><i>I looked for employment and found a job working in a bag factory, where I worked for two and one-half years earning 35 pesos a day</i>[or the equivalent of $1.10].<i>The company I was working for moved to . . . Manila, and I did not want to move there. Pinky was too small for me to make the move. To support my family I began washing clothes for some of my neighbors. I could provide for our food, but if one of us should get sick I did not have enough money to buy the medicine.</i><br><br><i>One day I was invited to a birthday party in our ward, and the bishop introduced me to two missionary couples, the Broadbents and the Blackhams</i>[former professors of chemistry here at Brigham Young University].<i>They knew that I knew how to make scripture cases, bags, wallets, and belts. They asked me to make some covers for the mission office in Bacolod.</i>[They]<i>gave me good advice, and I am grateful that I listened to them. . . .</i><br><br><i>The couples in the mission office helped me a lot, especially . . . Sister Broadbent. . . . You could see all the coin purses that I was making at the top of her table.</i>[They]<i>tried to help me find someone who would buy my products. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . .When I first joined the Church I started paying tithing at five pesos. I was jobless at the time, but now I am paying much more. When I pay my tithing and fast offerings I always pay a little extra because the Lord has been so good to me.</i><br><br><i>When the typhoon came in November 1995, we had much difficulty. Half of the roof blew off our house. In front of our house is my mother's store. It is about 6**8* in size. The only roof that was left was over her store. We stayed inside the store the whole night. Ten persons, seven adults, and three kids and three dogs. . . . Our house was fixed with the help from friends and the Church. I was grateful for that. The Lord blessed me with many friends both American and Filipino. They have been an instrument of the Lord to help me. . . .</i><br><br><i>The scriptures tell us that if we live the commandments as we should, the Lord will bless us. He will provide the way. He is the only one who knows our needs in life and will help us to each reach our goals if we pay our tithes and fast offerings in the Church. . . . I know that the talents he has given to us we must exercise so that he will not take them from us. In all our dealings with others we must deal with honesty so that we can maintain our integrity. It is important that we do these things so that everywhere we go people will trust</i>[us]<i>. . . .</i><br><br><i>Each one of us is blessed with different skills, and it is up to us to improve it and share it with others if it is a good quality. . . .</i><br><br><i>My dream for my family is that we can be sealed in the temple for time and all eternity. . . . I would like to</i>[find]<i>a steady buyer for my products. I would like to send Pinky on a mission some day--that would be a fulfillment of my dreams, that and to let her finish her studies and to have enough food every day of our lives. . . . This is just a dream that I am relying on the Lord to bring to pass, because I believe that "with God all things are possible" (Matt. 19:26). . . .</i><br><br><i>I am very thankful to the Lord for the talent and all the things that he has given to me and to my family.</i><br><br>This next story is by Elder Ruben G. Gapiz, again showing the tremendous faith of these wonderful people.<br><br><i>In October 1975, I was diagnosed with cancer of the naso-pharynx. The doctor told me I had only five years to live. I underwent chemotherapy for the next three years and had to eventually retire from my job three years later. In August 1978, I received my patriarchal blessing from Patriarch F. Briton McConkie. My wife was in the room with me as he pronounced my patriarchal blessing. Patriarch McConkie did not have any prior knowledge of my affliction. Toward the end of the blessing, he pronounced these words which really struck me and brought tears to my eyes and caused me and my wife to sob softly: "You will live your life to the fullest and will be called to serve in many leadership positions." After the blessing was over, Patriarch McConkie asked me the reason for my tears. I told him that I had been diagnosed with cancer and that I only had two years to live and that the blessing he pronounced was almost too good to hope for. He assured me that it was the Lord's blessing and he was only a conduit.</i><br><br><i>Ever since that visit to the doctor's office, I have always had a prayer in my heart. I didn't want my children to grow up without a father. My father was killed in the war, and I had a difficult childhood. I knew that day that the Lord had answered my prayer. It has been 21 years since that day, and I am grateful to the Lord for extending my life.</i><br><br>Brother Ruben Gapiz now serves in a leadership position as one of our area authorities in the Philippines.<br><br>There have been many natural and man-made disasters in the Philippines. Stories often appear on TV news around the world of ferryboats sinking with hundreds losing their lives. You may recall a recent disco fire that killed 160 young people. The frequent typhoons make thousands homeless--all of which serve to remind us that life can be very perilous for many Filipinos.<br><br>During the aftermath of Typhoon Rosing in 1995, I visited some of the members' homes that had been damaged or destroyed. I'd like to share with you two short paragraphs I wrote in my journal on that trip. Here is the first entry:<br><br><i>There was not one home that was not severely damaged. Many were completely leveled to the ground to where it was only a rubble of materials that previously had been their homes. One of the circumstances where children with their mother were having to sleep under tarps would have made you cry had you seen their situation.</i><br><br>And here is the second journal entry:<br><br><i>We took photographs of a building site that had been purchased for a new meetinghouse in Milor. There was a member family staying</i>[there who]<i>had been flooded out of their own home. They are a new convert family. Their home that is flooded and uninhabitable at the present time is located back of the current property where we will build a new chapel. In observing their home this morning, there was a cobra snake swimming around in their home--which they tried to catch, but it got away.</i><br><br>Everywhere I went I was struck by the power of the typhoon. Little homes that had stood one minute were rendered flat the next. Our people had every reason to be despondent. Scores of towns suffered terrible flooding, with a few of our chapels severely damaged. I noticed many palm trees that had been easily blown over because they had not put their roots down far enough into the earth.<br><br>I am reminded that as servants of the Lord it is our duty to make sure that gospel roots are deep and numerous in the developing lands where we serve. Yet despite all these adversities, all the trials and tribulations that the people in the Philippines and Micronesian Islands are subjected to, they maintain faith, commitment, and dedication and the desire to be of service to their fellowmen.<br><br>Recently Sue and I had the opportunity and privilege of accompanying President and Sister Hinckley as they attended a special conference in Manila and Cebu. It was a glorious experience, and one that we will never forget. We were reminded yet again of the love our prophet has for those special humble Saints. I don't think I will ever forget the feeling shown by the 35,000-plus members at the Manila conference and the 9,000-plus members in Cebu toward our prophet.<br><br>Presiding in the Philippines has taught me that some of the things we take for granted here require huge sacrifices from many Latter-day Saints elsewhere. After the Manila conference with President Hinckley was over, I started to hear stories of sacrifices endured willingly so that members and their families could attend. One family spent most of their life savings so they could travel and see the living prophet. Another large group of Saints journeyed in an open bus in the heat for three days and nights to attend. Even so, such was the number of those wanting to be there in the presence of President Hinckley, it was still not possible for all to get into the meetings.<br><br>Let me tell one last story. Recently a husband and wife traveled to a hospital in Manila to collect their young daughter who was dying of cancer and who the doctors could not save. As they traveled home by cab, the child died in her mother's arms. Instead of going home, the parents immediately instructed the cab driver to take them to the temple. As you can imagine, the arrival of the grieving parents with their dead child caused some heartaches for the temple staff. However, it was significant to me that when this family needed comfort and help the most, their thoughts turned to the temple.<br><br>Generally speaking, during times of tragedy, the spirit of the Church membership in the Philippines is not downtrodden. The Filipinos have exceptional resilience and faith in God and an expectation of better things to come.<br><br>Few Filipino Saints will ever have the opportunity for the type of education you wonderful young people are receiving here at Brigham Young University. Few will ever have the opportunity to fully develop the talents the Lord has blessed them with by virtue of the circumstances they live in.<br><br>I hope as I have shared with you what I feel are many heartrending stories of faith, testimony, commitment, and dedication, you will more fully appreciate the opportunities that are yours. As mentioned earlier, obtaining an education from this wonderful institution of learning is not only to prepare you for your chosen vocations but to help you learn how to use the talents the Lord has blessed you with to be of service to others who are less fortunate.<br><br>I remind you again of those inscriptions I referred to earlier: "The world is our campus. Enter to learn; go forth to serve." I encourage you to accept every opportunity that comes to you to develop your talents and to share them with enthusiasm in helping to bless the lives of others. The Lord will certainly make you equal to the task that lies ahead of you when you are called to use the talents you have been blessed with.<br><br>We are all blessed with different talents and different potential. One of the great tragedies of life is when a person classifies himself or herself as someone who has no talents or gifts. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:11–12]<br><br>The late Elder Bruce R. McConkie said:<br><br><i>When we come into mortality, we bring the talents, capacities, and abilities acquired by obedience to law in our prior existence. Mozart composed and published sonatas when but eight years of age because he was born with musical talent. Melchizedek came into this world with such faith and spiritual capacity that "when a child he feared God, and stopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire." (Gen. 14:26. Inspired Version.)</i>["God Foreordains His Prophets and His People,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1974, p. 73]<br><br>I believe each of you young people here today have a responsibility not only after you complete your education but while in the process of completing your education to lose yourself in righteous service to others.<br><br>President Lorenzo Snow said:<br><br><i>When you find yourselves a little gloomy, look around you and find somebody that is in a worse plight than yourself; go to him and find out what the trouble is, then try to remove it with the wisdom which the Lord bestows upon you; and the first thing you know, your gloom is gone, you feel light, the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, and everything seems illuminated.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1899, pp. 2–3]<br><br>Nicholas Murray Butler, the former president of Columbia University, said there are three kinds of people in this world: (1) those that make things happen; (2) those that watch things happen; and (3) those who have no idea of what is happening ("These United States,"<i>Looking Forward: What Will the American People Do About It?</i>[New York, London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932], p. 17). Where do you classify yourself?<br><br>From the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>And section 60 states: "Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known" (D&amp;amp;C 60:13). Maybe you might find yourself some time asking yourself the question "How do I find my talents?" It is not difficult for you young people to sometimes have feelings of inadequacy and failure as you watch the success and acclaim that accompany the performances of some with remarkable talents or gifts. It is understandable how many of us can say to ourselves, "What's the matter with me? I can't do anything really well."<br><br>The following story may help those of you who might question if you have the talents we speak of.<br><br><i>The famed naturalist of the last century, Louis Agassiz, was lecturing in London and had done a marvelous job. An obviously bright little old lady, but one who did not seem to have all the advantages in life, came up and was spiteful. She was resentful and said that she had never had the chances that he had had and she hoped he appreciated it. He took that bit of a lacing very pleasantly and turned to the lady and, when she was through, said, "What do you do?"</i><br><br><i>She said, "I run a boarding house with my sister. I'm unmarried."</i><br><br><i>"What do you do at the boarding house?"</i><br><br><i>"Well, I skin potatoes and chop onions for the stew. We have stew every day."</i><br><br><i>"Where do you sit when you do that interesting but homely task?"</i><br><br><i>"I sit on the bottom step of the kitchen stairs."</i><br><br><i>"Where do your feet rest when you sit there on the bottom step?"</i><br><br><i>"On a glazed brick."</i><br><br><i>"What's a glazed brick?"</i><br><br><i>"I don't know."</i><br><br><i>"How long have you been sitting there?"</i><br><br><i>"Fifteen years."</i><br><br><i>Agassiz concluded, "Here's my card. Would you write me a note when you get a moment about what a glazed brick is?"</i><br><br><i>Well, that made her mad enough to go home and do it. She went home and got the dictionary out and found out that a brick was a piece of baked clay. That didn't seem enough to send to a Harvard professor, so she went to the encyclopedia and found out that a brick was made of vitrified kaolin and hydrous aluminum silicate, which didn't mean a thing to her. She went to work and visited a brick factory and a tile maker. Then she went back in history and studied a little bit about geology and learned something about clay and clay beds and what</i>hydrous<i>meant and what</i>vitrified<i>meant. She began to soar out of the basement of a boarding house on the wings of words like</i>vitrified kaoline<i>and</i>hydrous aluminum silicate.<i>She finally decided that there were about 120 different kinds of glazed bricks and tiles. She could tell Agassiz that, so she wrote him a little note of thirty-six pages and said, "Here's your glazed brick."</i><br><br><i>He wrote back, "This is a fine piece of work. If you change this and that and the other, I'll prepare it for publication and send you that which is due you from the publication." She thought no more of it, made the changes, sent it back, and almost by return mail came a check for 250 dollars. His letter said, "I've published your piece. What was under the brick?"</i><br><br><i>And she said, "Ants."</i><br><br><i>He replied (all of this by mail), "What's an ant?"</i><br><br><i>She went to work and this time she was excited. She found 1,825 different kinds of ants. She found that there were ants that you could put three to the head of a pin and still have standing room left over. She found that there were ants an inch long that moved in armies half a mile wide and destroyed everything in their path. She found that some ants were blind; some ants lost their wings on the afternoon they died; some milked cows and took the milk to the aristocrats up the street. She found more ants than anybody had ever found, so she wrote Mr. Agassiz something of a treatise, numbering 360 pages. He published it and sent her the money and royalties, which continued to come in. She saw the lands and places of her dreams on a little carpet of vitrified kaolin and on the wings of flying ants that may lose their wings on the afternoon they die.</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "Borne upon Eagles' Wings," in<i>Speeches of the Year, 1974</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), pp. 402–3; see also Marion D. Hanks,<i>The Gift of Self</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1974), pp. 151–53]<br><br>Yes, daily unselfish service to others is one of the rudimentary mechanics of a successful life. The Lord counsels us as follows: "The works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me do even that shall ye do" (3 Nephi 27:21).<br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:27–29]<br><br>I believe that each of us have a responsibility to search for good causes in using the talents that the Lord has blessed us with to be of service to others. In his October 1984 conference address, Elder Dallin H. Oaks said:<br><br><i>Service is an imperative for those who worship Jesus Christ. To followers who were vying for prominent positions in his kingdom, the Savior taught, "Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." (Matt. 20:27.)</i>["Why Do We Serve?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1984, p. 12]<br><br>If our service is to be most efficacious, it must be accomplished for the love of God and for the love of his children.<br><br>It has been said, "Service is the rent we pay for our own room on earth." Yes, peace and joy and blessings will follow those who freely give service to others. Service changes people. It refines, purifies, and brings out the best in each one of us as we freely give of ourselves to those in need.<br><br>In a conference address in October 1991, President Monson said:<br><br><i>Should our load seem heavy or the results of our efforts discouraging, we may well recall the words of President Kimball to some who noted his undeviating devotion to his calling even in his advancing years: "My life is like my shoes--to be worn out in service." ("He Is at Peace,"</i>Ensign,<i>Dec. 1985, p. 41.)</i>[Thomas S. Monson, "Called to Serve,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, p. 48]<br><br>In his great farewell address, King Benjamin taught: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). There are few rewards in life that bring greater feelings of satisfaction, joy, and peace than when one gives meaningful service to a fellow being standing in need.<br><br>Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, was the perfect example of the two great commandments:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[Matthew 22:37–40]<br><br>Though your life's journey, my young friends, may never take you to places like the Philippines or Micronesia, I suspect that there is no place upon this earth where there will not be needs for your love and your service in blessing others and touching their lives and helping to bring joy and peace to them.<br><br>Yes, the world will continue to be your campus. As you have learned, learn the most important lesson of all as you go out to serve in giving of your time, talents, and all that the Lord has blessed you with for the building of the kingdom of God. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ certainly gave us the greatest example as he spent his life ministering to other's needs. He taught both through word and deed that "he that is greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matthew 23:11). Doing likewise is the ultimate demonstration of a person's love for God and for others. One's treatment of others is a true manifestation of his or her love of God.<br><br>I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to be with you today. And I pray the Lord's blessings upon you, that his Spirit will touch each of your hearts and souls with a greater commitment to be of service to your fellowmen and to bless their lives with your testimony, your faith, and your example.<br><br>I bear my witness and testimony to you that the church to which you and I belong is the only true church upon the face of the earth today, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I bear my humble witness and testimony to you that I know that Joseph Smith saw what he said he saw. As the Father turned to the Son with those seven words, "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" (JS--H 1:17), the Prophet then became the instrument in the hands of our Father in Heaven to establish his church and kingdom here upon this earth never to be taken from the earth again. I bear my witness and testimony to you that I know that President Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet of God who holds all the priesthood keys of the kingdom that are necessary to prepare for our Lord's eventual millennial reign. I bear witness that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I try to comprehend how one could have such great love, even allow his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, a god himself, to come to earth to offer himself a sacrifice to fulfill the Atonement and Resurrection that you and I might live again. Of these things I bear testimony and pray the Lord's blessings upon you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ben B.

<i>Sinceforgiveness is an absolute requirement in attaining eternal life, man naturally ponders: How can I best secure that forgiveness? One of many basic factors stands out as indispensable immediately: One must forgive to be forgiven.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969), p. 261]<br><br>Thank you, President Bateman, for introducing me and for allowing me the privilege of introducing two Brigham Young University students who will provide an a cappella vocal duet to set the stage for my remarks on forgiving others.<br><br>David and Michael Foutz will sing "Lord, I Would Follow Thee," a hymn that highlights our need to emulate the Savior and, in particular, our need "to refrain from judging unrighteously, to heal and comfort" (Karen Lynn Davidson,<i>Our Latter-day Hymns: The Stories and the Messages</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1988], p. 231). David and Michael are brothers and direct lineal descendants of Bishop Jacob Foutz, who was shot and left for dead at the Haun's Mill Massacre in Missouri in October 1838. According to an account written by Jacob's wife, Margaret Mann Foutz, after the massacre Jacob and another brother survived by drawing dead bodies over themselves and feigning death.<br><br>Margaret records that these two men thus<br><br><i>saved their own lives and heard what some of the mob said. After the firing was over two little boys that were in the</i>[blacksmith]<i>shop begged for their lives, but . . . one of the mob said</i>["Nits will make lice," meaning]<i>'they will make Mormons' and he put the muzzle of his gun to the boys' heads and</i>[ended their lives]. [Grace Foutz Boulter,<i>History of Bishop Jacob Foutz Sr. and Family, Including a Story of the Haun's Mill Massacre</i>(n.p., n.d. [February 1944]), p. 7, BYU Harold B. Lee Library Special Collections; for phrase "Nits will make lice" see Leonard J. Arrington and Davis Bitton,<i>The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints,</i>2nd ed. (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 45]<br><br>After Margaret found Jacob, she got him home and eventually assisted him in removing a bullet from his hip with a kitchen knife. She applied a poultice to his wound and disguised him in women's clothes to trick the murderous mob when it returned to exterminate male survivors.<br><br>Though physically scarred for life, Jacob did survive, and, what is most important, he thrived spiritually. He was called as a bishop in Nauvoo, served a mission in Pennsylvania, and moved west with the Saints in 1847, continuing to serve as a bishop until his premature death the following year. Although Bishop Foutz sought legal redress for the financial losses he suffered at Haun's Mill, he did not allow the poisonous venom of hate and vengeance to destroy his spiritual life. Instead he bequeathed to his posterity a legacy of faith and forgiveness that continues to the present generation. David Foutz serves as first counselor in my bishopric, and the hymn that he and his brother will now perform honors the memory of their progenitor and all the pioneers who forgave their persecutors and moved on, geographically and spiritually, to establish a new life in Zion.<br><br><i>Savior, may I learn to love thee,<br>Walk the path that thou hast shown,<br>Pause to help and lift another,<br>Finding strength beyond my own.<br>Savior, may I learn to love thee--<br>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br><br><i>Who am I to judge another<br>When I walk imperfectly?<br>In the quiet heart is hidden<br>Sorrow that the eye can't see.<br>Who am I to judge another?<br>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br><br><i>I would be my brother's keeper;<br>I would learn the healer's art.<br>To the wounded and the weary<br>I would show a gentle heart.<br>I would be my brother's keeper--<br>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br><br><i>Savior, may I love my brother<br>As I know thou lovest me,<br>Find in thee my strength, my beacon,<br>For thy servant I would be.<br>Savior, may I love my brother--<br>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br>["Lord, I Would Follow Thee,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 220]<br><br>"Savior, may I love my brother / As I know thou lovest me." This was a hard lesson for me to learn.<br><br>Twenty-five years ago I completed my freshman year at BYU. At that time I never dreamed that I would one day address the faculty and student body in a Marriott Center devotional. For one thing, the Marriott Center didn't even exist! For another, I was a Latter-day Saint convert of less than two years and didn't feel overly confident in my ability to expound on Church doctrine. But I did feel prompted to embark on a full-time mission. I had baptized my best friend--also a BYU student--earlier in the year, and I was anxious to share the restored gospel with others.<br><br>Before I could serve, however, I had to submit to the rite of passage familiar to all who would serve missions. I had to have interviews with my bishop and stake president, fill out several forms, undergo medical and dental examinations, make financial arrangements, and attend to a variety of academic concerns. In preparation for my mission, I read or reread LeGrand Richards'<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>and James E. Talmage's<i>Jesus the Christ.</i>I also tackled Talmage's<i>The Articles of Faith.</i>With the zeal of a convert I had previously read Joseph Fielding Smith's three-volume work<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>and much of Bruce R. McConkie's<i>Mormon Doctrine.</i>I had a vivid dream in which I saw myself called to Italy, where centuries before Paul had journeyed to preach to the Romans. When the call came, I was thrilled. The opening sentence of the letter read: "You are hereby called to be a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to labor in the Italy North Mission." My dream had come true.<br><br>Because I came from a non-LDS family, I could not rely on them for financial support. I elected to pay for my mission with funds I had previously set aside for my college education. I looked forward to my mission as one long spiritual feast. Mine was to be the<i>ideal</i>missionary experience. I would love my companions, I would teach the gospel daily by word and deed, and I would baptize regularly.<br><br>After I had been in Italy for only four months, I was called as a senior companion to a brand-new elder, a "greenie" whom I'll call Elder Brown.<i>Proud</i>of the linguistic skills that allowed me to enjoy a senior position after so few months in a foreign land, I looked forward to remaking Elder Brown in my own image--never minding that he was more handsome and more personable than I. Unfortunately, things didn't work out exactly as I had planned. Elder Brown came from LDS pioneer stock and from a much more well-to-do family. His grandfather invariably included a twenty-dollar bill in his letters; I resented the perks that such extra cash allowed, even though my companion invariably shared his bounty with me.<br><br>Elder Brown had belonged to a social fraternity during his freshman year--the type that never would have accepted a nerd such as I--and, unfortunately, his fraternity brothers had exposed him to a number of undesirable things, including risqué magazines.<br><br>Then it happened. One afternoon during scripture study time in our apartment I caught him "reading" (if that's the right word) an unapproved magazine--you know, the kind with a centerfold. It was an Italian edition of<i>Playboy.</i>He had purchased it while on splits with another elder, and I was furious. I felt that Elder Brown had ruined my ideal mission. I seethed in righteous indignation, but, rather than rebuking my companion and then showing forth an increase in love, I chose to become an expert on his every fault, which I cataloged and reviewed with some regularity in my mind. After a few challenging months together, my junior companion was transferred, and it was at that point that I began my revenge in earnest.<br><br>I have always been fond of telling stories (in case you haven't noticed), and I soon captivated not only later missionary companions but entire districts with embroidered tales of my greenie's sinful ways. Even after I returned from my mission, I continued to recount his problems. The one thing that I couldn't understand, however, was the report that I had received from more than one source that Elder Brown, in contrast to me, had become one of the top baptizing elders of our mission and had been called to key leadership positions that had mysteriously eluded me.<br><br>A few years passed. Then one day Elder Brown appeared on my doorstep. He asked to come in. We spoke alone in my living room for over an hour. I asked what he was doing and learned that he was happily married and an extremely successful businessman and entrepreneur. Because of the way I had stereotyped him, I wondered about his activity in the Church. I was surprised to learn that he was not an elder (as was I) but a high priest and serving on a high council. He then stunned me by relating how his favorite high council talk was to share what he had learned from me while we were mission companions. He loved to tell young people preparing for missions how much better prepared doctrinally I--the convert--had been than he--the lifelong member--and how my example of gospel scholarship had inspired him to overcome his own shortcomings.<br><br>I began to feel pretty rotten about all the stories I had told about him. I prayed that he didn't know what I had done, but somehow I sensed that he did know. He then acknowledged that at a family reunion one of his cousins, whom I had known in graduate school, had told him how I had recounted in her presence and in vivid detail an episode Elder Brown had long ago repented of. My former companion did not berate me; instead he asked if I could ever forgive him for his youthful mistakes. I knew then that it was I who needed to ask him for forgiveness. In the pride of my heart I had sinned, and I had sinned in multiple ways--in judging unmercifully, in harboring resentment, in planning and executing revenge, and, perhaps most of all, in not allowing the possibility that a brother could change, improve, and repent.<br><br>"Savior, may I love my brother / As I know thou lovest me." I could not see the mote in my brother's eye because of the beam in my own. I had chosen to ignore the fundamental law of repentance, taught by the Lord and modern-day prophets: We must forgive in order to be forgiven. Of this principle the scriptures are clear.<br><br>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that<br><br><i>if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</i><br><br><i>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</i>[Matthew 6:14–15]<br><br>As a Protestant growing up in the Bible Belt, I recited the Lord's Prayer by memory almost every Sunday. What I failed to realize as a child, as a teenager, and even as a missionary was that the words "forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12) really mean "Father, do not forgive me one iota more than I am willing to forgive others."<br><br>The apostle Peter inquired long ago, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" And Jesus answered, "I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:21–22). Some of us--unwilling to accept that "seventy times seven" does<i>not</i>mean, in this context, a precise number--keep track of grudges, vainly nursing them and hoping that when the magic number of 490 comes along we can stop forgiving altogether. We forget not a hurt, we forget not a grudge, we forget not an offense.<br><br>What we do forget is the fifth beatitude: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (Matthew 5:7). We forget the example of the first Christian martyr, Stephen, who cried as he was stoned, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (Acts 7:60). We disregard the counsel of Paul to "forgiv[e] one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (Ephesians 4:32). We ignore the example of the Savior on the cross, who pleaded, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>When we are speaking of serious sins, the Savior's phrase "they know not what they do" has raised the question in some minds as to whether the injunction to forgive includes forgiving those who know exactly what they do and choose to do evil nonetheless.<br><br>Modern-day revelation boldly proclaims that Saints of the Most High God must forgive in order to be forgiven. The Doctrine and Covenants clearly teaches that we<br><br><i>ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</i><br><br>The passage continues:<br><br><i>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:9–10]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, extending this idea, preached that "unless a person forgives his brother his trespasses<i>with all his heart</i>he is unfit to partake of the sacrament" (Kimball,<i>Miracle,</i>p. 264; emphasis in original).<br><br>What is the Lord asking us to do? What does it mean to forgive another person his or her trespasses?<br><br>The first recorded use of the verb<i>forgive</i>in the King James Bible occurs in Genesis 50:17 and helps answer these questions. There we read that the last words of Jacob to his son Joseph, who had been sold as a slave into Egypt by his brethren, were an acknowledgment of the evil done and a request for mercy: "Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil." Whereafter, the brothers confess their sin to Joseph: "And now, we [thy brethren] pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father." This confession is followed by a description of Joseph's softened heart: "And Joseph wept when they spake unto him." Joseph's reaction is telling of his magnanimous character. Nevertheless, he first reprimands his brothers and then forgives, telling them: "Ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive" (Genesis 50:17, 20).<br><br>"To forgive another" does not imply "to disregard judgment." Certainly forgiving another does not mean that we hold in contempt the law of justice. In fact, Doctrine and Covenants 64:11 affirms that the one who forgives should embrace judgment and hold the transgressor--especially, I would argue, the serious offender--accountable for what he or she has done. Verse 11 states unequivocally: "And ye ought to say in your hearts--let God judge between me [the offended] and thee [the offender], and reward thee according to thy deeds." This latter phrase echoes the words of Paul regarding one who had done him "much evil." The apostle prays that "the Lord reward him according to his works" (2 Timothy 4:14), and this should be our prayer as well. But it must be a prayer uttered not in hatred, not in bitterness, but rather as "moved upon by the Holy Ghost" (D&amp;amp;C 121:43).<br><br>To forgive a serious offense, in other words, is to turn in faith to God, to pray that he will help the offender repent, and to allow God to judge and reward. It means to accept humbly God's righteous judgment with faith, hope, and comfort, with joy and peace. I repeat: The concept of judgment is not jettisoned overboard by the commandment to forgive even serious offenders. Rather, to forgive is to turn over to God the ultimate right to judge and,<i>if</i>the offender refuses to repent, to allow Him to decree the final punishment. As Amulek witnessed to Zeezrom, not even God can save sinners "<i>in</i>their sins" (Alma 11:37; emphasis added).<br><br>But how do we find the courage and inspiration to forgive our brother his trespasses?<br><br>As a young adult ward bishop, I conducted during my first three years of service approximately 3000 personal, tithing settlement, and ecclesiastical endorsement interviews. Long before the 3000th interview I realized that many individuals who had gone through the formal steps of repentance still did not feel forgiven. In many cases the only reason for their not feeling forgiven stemmed from their not having forgiven others their trespasses. Keeping in mind that forgiveness of others is a step in the repentance process helps many to find the strength to forgive. I have also discovered that true stories of forgiveness are a powerful medium for teaching this principle.<br><br>Inspiring stories of mercy can be found in literature, in Church and world history, and in testimonies of living Latter-day Saints. Time limitations have forced me to limit my selections to a handful of examples that I have found particularly meaningful.<br><br>In modern history perhaps no more atrocious crime has been committed than the Holocaust, the systematic murder of millions of Jews, political prisoners, handicapped persons, and others by Hitler's Nazi regime. Corrie ten Boom, a Christian political prisoner, survived the concentration camp at Ravensbruck, but her beloved sister Betsie did not. After the war Corrie traveled the world preaching sermons of reconciliation, peace, and forgiveness. Then it happened. She was called upon to practice what she preached. She records in her autobiography,<i>The Hiding Place,</i>the defining moment of her Christian discipleship:<br><br><i>It was at a church service in Munich that I saw him, the former S.S. man who had stood guard at the shower room door in the processing center at Ravensbruck. He was the first of our actual jailers that I had seen since that time. And suddenly it was all there--the roomful of mocking men, the heaps of clothing, Betsie's pain-blanched face.</i><br><br><i>He came up to me as the church was emptying, beaming and bowing. "How grateful I am for your message, Fraulein," he said. "To think that, as you say, He has washed my sins away!"</i><br><br><i>His hand was thrust out to shake mine. And I, who had preached so often . . . the need to forgive, kept my hand at my side.</i><br><br><i>Even as the angry, vengeful thoughts boiled through me, I saw the sin of them. Jesus Christ had died for this man; was I going to ask for more? Lord Jesus, I prayed, forgive me and help me to forgive him.</i><br><br><i>I tried to smile, I struggled to raise my hand. I could not. I felt nothing, not the slightest spark of warmth or charity. And so again I breathed a silent prayer. Jesus, I cannot forgive him. Give me Your forgiveness.</i><br><br><i>As I took his hand the most incredible thing happened. From my shoulder along my arm and through my hand a current seemed to pass from me to him, while into my heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed me.</i><br><br><i>And so I discovered that it is not on our forgiveness any more than on our goodness that the world's healing hinges, but on His. When He tells us to love our enemies, He gives, along with the command, the love itself.</i>[Corrie ten Boom, with John and Elizabeth Sherrill,<i>The Hiding Place</i>(New York: Bantam Books, 1971), p. 238]<br><br>This story is instructive to Latter-day Saints because it dramatizes that in difficult cases we must call upon Christ to grant us his love and his forgiveness, for we cannot accomplish this act of mercy alone.<br><br>I now desire to share with you three short but poignant accounts of forgiveness, all written at my invitation by BYU faculty members for this devotional. These accounts have never been published. They are highly personal stories of dear friends, colleagues whom I love and admire. When I think of them, I know that Brigham Young University stands on sacred ground because their presence helps to hallow it. I originally intended for these teachers to stand, come to this podium, and narrate their own stories. All declined out of modesty, stating that their reason for agreeing to record their stories arose from a desire to help those who are struggling to forgive another.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I do not wish to offend, but I need to say that from my work on the university's Self-Study Committee, I know firsthand that there are departments on this campus where divisiveness is more common than forgiveness. There are departments where colleagues are quick to judge and slow to forgive. Perhaps a faculty member here today carries a grudge, having been hurt by a careless remark or wrongful act of a colleague. Perhaps you know of someone who has been hurt and refuses to forgive, someone who is allowing a wound to fester. Or perhaps someone here has been offended by a roommate or teammate, brother or sister, mother or father, husband or wife, son or daughter, boyfriend or girlfriend, student or professor, department chair or administrator, ward member or bishop, boss or employee, or even stake president or General Authority. Whether the offense is perceived as intentional or unintentional, willed or not, if it is troubling your mind or cankering your soul, then the faculty accounts I am about to share are meant for you as well as for me.<br><br>My first account has a name attached to it because it treats someone who was the recipient of another's tender mercy, someone who learned how to forgive others by being forgiven himself.<br><br>Larry Dahl is an associate dean of religion on this campus. Several years ago, when he was my bishop, he shared with a group of ward members a stirring lesson from his childhood. This is Larry Dahl's story:<br><br><i>When I was five years old, two friends and I made ourselves a hideout by tunneling into a haystack alongside a new barn in the neighbor's yard, then digging out a spacious room right in the middle of the haystack. We delighted in our secret meeting place.</i><br><br><i>One day we decided to roast some hot dogs. Since our home was right next door, I secured the matches to light a fire. You can imagine the rest of the story. The fire quickly got away from us. We scampered through the tunnel to safety, and all three of us ran to our separate homes. I don't know what the others did, but I immediately went to my upstairs bedroom and climbed into bed, panic-stricken. Within minutes I heard the wail of the town fire truck getting closer and closer. But it was too late. The haystack and the new barn were quickly consumed. Fortunately, however, someone arrived soon enough to get the animals out of the barn.</i><br><br><i>Somehow my parents suspected I may have had something to do with the fire, since they knew of our hideout. Not seeing me anywhere in the neighborhood, they searched the house. As I heard their footsteps on the stairs, I thought my pounding heart would jump right out of my body. When they entered the bedroom and witnessed my fearful and tearful face, their suspicions were confirmed. Mother just sat on the edge of the bed and held me. My father asked me to tell them what had happened. Through broken-hearted sobs I recited the events of the afternoon. He quietly left the room while my mother stayed and cried with me. I learned years later that my father paid our neighbor for the hay and the barn. But from the day it happened to the day of his death forty-five years later, my father never mentioned the event to me. Truly, it was as if he did not remember it.</i><br><br>There is a coda or postscript to Brother Dahl's story, and it treats a role reversal that he experienced when he became a father. He writes:<br><br><i>Many years later when our two oldest boys were five and seven . . . , they broke a window playing ball in the yard. My first impulse was to be upset and scold them. My sweet wife, knowing the story of my own five-year-old ventures, gently intervened. She said simply, "Windows are not nearly as expensive as barns."</i><br><br>The principle that this story illustrates is simple but often ignored by those who need to forgive. True forgiveness implies not mentioning past sins, errors, or mistakes once they have been properly dealt with. In five-year-old Larry's case, he needed to express sorrow and to confess and accept responsibility for his careless and damaging act. But once that was accomplished, he could do little more as a kindergartner to restore the burned-down barn. And so a loving father paid the price for Larry's mistake and mentioned it to him no more.<br><br>The scriptures teach that "he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). Brother Dahl, through his personal account and writings, has helped me see that this principle is best understood in light of what the prophet Ezekiel taught. If a sinner "will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die." Furthermore, "All his transgressions that he hath committed . . . shall not be mentioned unto him" (Ezekiel 18:21–22).<br><br>Although it seems obvious that the Lord can recall to memory anything from our past--in fact, we know from the scriptures that when we repeat our sins, "the former sins return" (D&amp;amp;C 82:7)--it is apparent from Ezekiel that the Lord's promise to remember no more the sins we have repented of means that he will remember them<i>to us</i>no more.<br><br>If the Lord will no longer remember to us the transgressions we repent of, then surely it is incumbent upon us to allow others the same opportunity. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland captured this idea in his recent conference talk when he stated: "Closely related to our own obligation to repent is the generosity of letting others do the same--we are to forgive even as we are forgiven" ("The Peaceable Things of the Kingdom,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, p. 83). President Spencer W. Kimball also captured this principle: "He who will not forgive others breaks down the bridge over which he himself must travel" (Kimball,<i>Miracle,</i>p. 269).<br><br>The next faculty account I share deals with a much more serious act than barn burning. It has to do with forgiving someone who killed a wife and a child. Though the heinous act did not contain the element of intention inherent in the sin we call murder, the result was the same: a loving husband lost his companion and infant daughter, and a four-year-old son was robbed of a mother and baby sister. A colleague who now serves as a campus bishop shared his story in these moving words:<br><br><i>In a late evening of August we were beginning an eleven-hour drive from Cody, Wyoming, to Salt Lake to support our mother who was worried about my father's open-heart surgery; we were close as a family and felt a strong need to be together.</i><br><br><i>My older brother was driving, his wife was sitting next to my youngest brother, who occupied the front window seat. My wife was behind my driving brother, holding our eighteen-month-old daughter, and I was on the opposite side with our four-year-old son stretched out on the seat, his head in my lap.</i><br><br><i>I awoke from a half-sleep to see headlights crossing the road to our side, my brother swerving to avoid head-on contact. Swerving helped, but there was contact, nonetheless, and it changed my life and my son's life forever.</i><br><br><i>The left side of the car had received the most damage, my wife and daughter having absorbed the major portion of the shock. Although my daughter died later that night in the hospital, my wife took an entire week before she could finally go.</i><br><br><i>Everyone was hurt but me. While I was alone and assessing the damage, praying for a saving car to happen by in the loneliness of the Wind River Canyon, and then walking toward the other damaged car, I was immediately offended by an overwhelming stench of alcohol. I briefly checked and found the nineteen-year-old driver of the other car incoherent from drink, but otherwise unharmed. I was later told, after the police finally arrived, that he had tried to find me to fight me, since he thought I would be angered by what he had done. Eventually, he did find me and drunkenly asked me to forgive him for what he had done that night.</i><br><br><i>I certainly had not prepared myself for such a request. My immediate thought was that if I did say that I would forgive him, I would have to do it, since I would not play games with my mind and my heart, given the incomprehensible changes of my newly defined life.</i><br><br><i>I could not say no. I told him flatly that I forgave him, and I meant it. In honesty, I must say that I have never wanted to be his buddy or pal. Indeed, I cannot even remember his name, nor do I know where he is now. But I will be eternally grateful for his asking for forgiveness that Saturday morning before dawn, because in complying I was freed from the thrall of anger and hate that otherwise could have brought even greater sorrow into my life. From this tragedy I think I learned something new: Forgiveness brings true and genuine freedom, often to the forgiven, but always and without exception to the forgiver.</i><br><br>This fine brother shared with me his conviction that he never would have been called as a bishop had he refused the invitation to forgive. How could he speak on behalf of the Lord's church and bear testimony to penitent ward members that they were forgiven if he himself had never been willing to forgive? The drunken driver in this story was, of course, tried in a civil court and will one day stand accountable before God for his actions.<br><br>Remember: Our forgiveness of others does not remove their own need to repent and pay the penalties for their sins. As my dear colleague Professor Glade Hunsaker, inspired by Elder Richard G. Scott's writings on forgiveness, has helped me see--<br><br><i>The sweetness of spirit that follows forgiveness is absolutely essential to our daily growth process, but the requirement to forgive often sends wrong signals to the offender, such as: "You must forgive me, and when you have, my offense no longer exists." Forgiveness on the part of the offended blesses the life of the offender and greatly assists the healing process, but it must never be taken as the resolution to a transgression that has not been given the proper steps of repentance.</i>[O. Glade Hunsaker to Madison U. Sowell, 16 October 1996; see also Richard G. Scott, "Healing the Tragic Scars of Abuse,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, pp. 31–33, and "Finding Forgiveness,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1995, pp. 75–77]<br><br>Although we must forgive all, the Lord will forgive only the truly repentant.<br><br>My third account was written by a female faculty member who is a convert to the Church. It is a story of abuse and, what is more important, recovery from abuse. Abuse comes in many forms, including neglect, improper care, and abandonment, as well as verbal, mental, physical, spiritual, and sexual abuse. If anyone within the sound of my voice has suffered such abuse, I urge you to seek professional help and spiritual consolation. Recovery from abuse is a process that can take considerable time, much emotional energy, and deep faith. Forgiveness must be a goal of that recovery process, for, as one LDS psychologist has written, "Forgiveness is an opportunity to regain the internal peace of which evil has robbed us" (Wendy L. Ulrich, "When Forgiveness Flounders: For Victims of Serious Sin," in<i>Confronting Abuse,</i>ed. Anne L. Horton, B. Kent Harrison, and Barry L. Johnson [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1993], p. 348).<br><br>This is the final faculty story I wish to share with you today. It is one person's story of healing, of finding peace through forgiveness and gospel ordinances.<br><br><i>Alcohol addiction robbed my father of his wife, his four children, his job, his mother, and finally his life. Alcoholism doomed my parent's marriage from the beginning. On their very first Christmas, Daddy got drunk and broke all the lights on the tree. My mother stayed with him for 19 years anyway, hoping to save the marriage for the sake of the children. I left home during my senior year of high school because I could not bear to witness the violence anymore. When Mommy saw that Daddy's problem was destroying her children, she divorced him.</i><br><br><i>We wanted to love our dad, but he was often not himself. Under the bondage of alcohol, he was moody, physically violent, and verbally abusive. One time he kicked my brother with his steel-toed military boots. My brother was so badly bruised that he would not dress-out for his PE class at school. He got in trouble because the teacher did not know about our family background. We lived in terror. We never knew when Daddy would be sober or when he would be drunk. We felt relieved when he was gone.</i><br><br><i>We each suffered the consequences of Daddy's curse in different ways, but we all tried to forgive him. At the age of 18, I found peace and forgiveness in the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel. A year after the death of my father, I arranged for my home teachers to be the proxies for his temple work. Before my mission, I gathered all the family history documents from my grandpa's house. After my mission, I started doing the temple work for my father's family. In 1979, I did the temple work for my grandma and felt her gratitude. The following year, I went to the temple with some of my family home evening brothers and sisters. We were proxies as my father was sealed to his parents. I cried, and the brother who did the sealings said that the spirits of my family members were present. Temple work is the key to family healing and forgiveness. Doing the temple work for my father helped to set him free from bondage, which helped to set his parents free. Doing temple work also sets me free, one name at a time.</i><br><br>This sister knew more hurt in the span of her first two decades of life than many of us will ever know. But through the Atonement of Christ, the plan of salvation, and the act of forgiveness, she has come to know that peace "which passeth all understanding" (Philippians 4:7). This is the peace that living the gospel brings. She understands what it means to sing "Savior, may I love my<i>father</i>/ As I know thou lovest me."<br><br>In the end we must arrive at the point where we can pray sincerely that the offender will repent, for our forgiveness does not insure the Lord's forgiveness. God's forgiveness is conditional; it is based on true, sincere, genuine repentance. As Spencer W. Kimball taught us, "Even the Lord will not forgive a person<i>in his sins</i>" (<i>Miracle,</i>p. 337; emphasis in original).<br><br>I would like to close with a poem composed by Marguerite Stewart. It is entitled "Forgiveness Flour." The poem, written in the first person, features an unnamed wife who answers her door to find a young woman in shame and seeking flour, which symbolizes forgiveness, to make bread. The poem reads:<br><br><i>When I went to the door, at the whisper of knocking,<br>I saw Simeon Gantner's daughter, Kathleen, standing<br>There, in her shawl and her shame, sent to ask<br>"Forgiveness Flour" for her bread. "Forgiveness Flour,"<br>We call it in our corner. If one has erred, one<br>Is sent to ask for flour of his neighbors. If they loan it<br>To him, that means he can stay, but if they refuse, he had<br>Best take himself off. I looked at Kathleen . . .<br>What a jewel of a daughter, though not much like her<br>Father, more's the pity. "I'll give you flour," I<br>Said, and went to measure it. Measuring was the rub.<br>If I gave too much, neighbors would think I made sin<br>Easy, but if I gave too little, they would label me<br>"Close." While I stood measuring, Joel, my husband<br>Came in from the mill, a great bag of flour on his<br>Shoulder, and seeing her there, shrinking in the<br>Doorway, he tossed the bag at her feet. "Here, take<br>All of it." And so she had flour for many loaves,<br>While I stood measuring.</i><br>[Marguerite Stewart, "Forgiveness Flour,"<i>Religious Studies Center Newsletter</i>7, no. 3 (May 1993): 1]<br><br>The phrase "While I stood measuring" characterizes too many of us too much of the time. We metaphorically "measure flour" in an attempt not to be overgenerous in our mercy. At the same time we pray that God will throw a bag of flour at our feet--that is, that he will be boundless in his mercy toward us.<br><br>One month ago the First Presidency issued a letter to Church leaders in Utah County in anticipation of the Mount Timpanogos Temple dedication. President Hinckley and his counselors urged the Saints in this area<br><br><i>to use this occasion as an opportunity to cleanse their lives of anything that is displeasing to the Lord, eliminating from their hearts any ill feelings of envy or enmity, and seeking forgiveness for anything that is amiss in their lives.</i>[First Presidency letter of 19 September 1996 concerning the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple Dedication]<br><br>My prayer is that the forgiveness we seek is large enough to include the forgiveness not only of ourselves but also of others. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Madison U. Sowell was the chair of the BYU Department of French and Italian when this devotional was given on 22 October 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
Democracy is on trial in America. Expert and ordinary opinion converges on a sober recognition: we live in an age of political resentment and withdrawal from civic life. What can be done to revivify American democracy? Some propose electronic solutions--technological means to register instantly the popular will--but others, myself included, see in the proposed solution a deepening of our current troubles. Why? Because democracy is not and has never been primarily a means whereby popular will is tabulated and enacted but, rather, a political world within which citizens deliberate, negotiate, compromise, engage, and hold themselves and those they choose to represent them accountable for actions taken. Have we lost this deliberative and dialogical dimension to democracy? For democracy's enduring promise is that democratic citizens can come to know a good in common that they cannot know alone.<br><br>By any standard of objective evidence, those who point to the rise of civically depleting forms of isolation, boredom, and cynicism; those who point to declining levels of involvement in politics and community, from simple acts like the vote to more demanding participation in political parties and local, civic associations; those who point to the overall weakening of that world known as democratic civil society: these have the better case. Alexis de Tocqueville, in his classic work<i>Democracy in America,</i>argued that one reason the American democracy he surveyed was so sturdy was that citizens took an active part in public affairs. This is important because participating in public affairs means one must move from exclusive and narrowly private interests and occasionally take a look at matters that concern others. In Tocqueville's words,<br><br><i>As soon as common affairs are treated in common, each man notices that he is not as independent of his fellows as he used to suppose and that to get their help he must often offer his aid to them.</i>[Alexis de Tocqueville,<i>Democracy in America,</i>ed. J. P. Mayer, trans. George Lawrence (New York: Harper Perennial, 1988), p. 510]<br><br>In this way civic engagement helped to underscore what Tocqueville called "self-interest properly understood," an interest that was never narrowly focused on the self (p. 526). If Tocqueville were among us today, he would no doubt share the concern of social scientists who have researched the sharp decline in participation. They argue that the evidence points to nothing less than a crisis in "social capital formation," the forging of bonds of social and political trust and competence. The debilitating effects of rising mistrust, privatization, and anomie are many. For example, there is overwhelming empirical support for the popularly held view that where neighborhoods are intact, drugs and alcohol abuse, crime, teenage childbearing, and truancy among the young diminish. Because neighborhoods are less and less likely to be intact, all forms of socially and self-destructive behavior among the young are on the rise. Americans at the end of the 20th century suffer from the effects of a dramatic decline in the formation of social bonds, networks, and trust.<br><br>Children in particular have borne the brunt of these negative social trends. All one need do is look at any American newspaper any day of the week to read yet another story about the devastating effects of current social trends on the young. Widespread family breakdown generates unparented children who attend schools that increasingly resemble detention centers rather than spaces of enduring training, discipline, and education in a safe environment. Family breakdown contributes to out-of-wedlock births and juvenile violence at unprecedented levels. The family, of course, cannot deal with all of these things alone. Looking at troubles for families points us to a wider disintegration of the social ecology within which families are nested.<br><br>If you agree with the great democratic theorists that democracy relies on the formation of civically engaged citizens, trends that point to a deterioration of the web of America's mediating institutions are deeply troubling. By mediating institutions, I refer to those informal and formal civic associations that help to forge a relationship between government and the everyday actions and spirit of a people. That is, democracy requires laws, constitutions, and authoritative institutions but also depends on democratic dispositions, on what Tocqueville called "mores." These include a preparedness to work with others for shared ends--here the issue of trust is key, a combination of often strong convictions coupled with a readiness to compromise in the recognition that one can't always get everything one wants--and a sense of individuality and a commitment to civic goods that are not the possession of one person or one small group alone. The world that nourished and sustained such democratic dispositions was a thickly interwoven social fabric--that web of mediating institutions already noted. Tocqueville, as I have already indicated, saw Americans as civically engaged, arguing that "Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition are forever constantly forming associations" (<i>Democracy in America,</i>p. 513). From this associational enthusiasm, currents of social trust and stewardship flowed. Bonds of social trust, in turn, fueled the penchant for joining and for helping. Other famous visitors to our shores spoke of the "active beneficence" that characterized the American people.<br><br>But this public-spiritedness is in jeopardy. Our social fabric is frayed. Our trust in our neighbors is low. We don't join as much. We give less money, as an overall percentage of our gross national product, to charity. Where once rough-and-tumble yet civil politics pertained, now we see "in your face" and "you just don't get it." Perhaps a few words about the trust data is in order. Listen to this question: "Do you believe most people can be trusted, or can't you be too careful?" The question was first posed in 1960 in a famous civic culture study. It has been repeated since, yearly, from 1971 on. In 1960 in America, trust stood at nearly 60 percent. Social trust waned with some up-and-down fluctuations throughout the 1960s and 1970s, did a bit of bouncing up in the mid-1980s, but now stands at<i>an all-time low--</i>37.5 percent and declining. (The data is for 1993. Recent, similar studies are confirmatory.) When even mainstream social scientists devoted to models of consensus and functional equilibrium grow alarmed, we should perhaps pay attention.<br><br>The general, widely shared consensus now is that overall social trust is far too low to sustain consensual norms, to generate robust communal action, and to build workable coalitions. This is not good news. Interestingly, the ever-pressing Tocqueville had offered his own foreboding thoughts along these lines. He warned of a world different from the robust democracy he surveyed. He urged Americans to take to heart a possible corruption of their way of life. In Tocqueville's worst-case scenario, narrowly self-involved individualists, disarticulated from the saving constraints and nurture of overlapping associations of social life, would move to a bad and isolating egoism. Once that happened, they would require more controls from above in order to muffle the disintegrative effects of egoism. To this end, if you would forestall this moment of democratic despotism, civic spaces between citizens and the state would need to be secured and nourished. Only many small-scale civic bodies would enable citizens to cultivate the democratic virtues and to play an active role in their communities. These civic bodies would be in and of the community--<i>not</i>governmentally derived, not creatures of the state.<br><br>Tocqueville's fear, remember, was not that anarchy would result should the world of associational life weaken but, rather, that new forms of domination would arise. All social webs that once held persons intact having disintegrated, the individual would find himself or herself isolated, exposed, and unprotected. Into this power vacuum would move centralized, top-heavy forces or a top-heavy administrative state--or, in our own time, the organized force of the market might come to mind, especially in its consumerist aspects. This would have the effect of pushing social life to the lowest common denominator.<br><br>Case in point: an article in the<i>New York Times</i>following the 1994 campaign reported that "U.S. Voters Focus on Selves, Poll Says." The article brought into question the long-range effects on the legitimacy and sustainability of liberal democratic institutions if current trends deepen. The<i>Times</i>noted a "turn inward" and a lack of any "clear direction in the public's political thinking other than frustration with the current system and an eager responsiveness to alternative political solutions and appeals" ("U.S. Voters Focus on Selves, Poll Says,"<i>New York Times,</i>21 September 1994, p. A-21). Manifestations of voter frustration included growing disidentification with either of the major parties and massive political rootlessness among the young tethered to historically high rates of pessimism about the future. Most striking was a significant decline in "public support for social welfare programs," although the level of social tolerance for minorities and homosexuals was high, so long as one did not have to bear the burden of financial support or have direct hands-on involvement in the issue.<br><br>Let's speculate further on trends that are traceable to the collapse of America's social ecology or that helped to bring about these negative developments. Remember, these are political trends. They do not exhaust the universe of plausible explanations for why we have arrived at this sorry pass. The first trend is a tendency that became routine over the past three decades of American life to remove political disputation from the political arena into the courts. A second trend, noted in my opening comments, is the emergence of calls for a new form of techno-utopia, including images of an electronic plebiscitary democracy. I will argue that this latter trend reduces voters and legislators to angry instruments articulating the unadorned "people's will," thereby presenting as a cure more of what ails us.<br><br>Let's take up the first trend. Political scientist James Q. Wilson argues that one reason Americans are more cynical and less trusting than they used to be is that government has taken on more and more issues that it is by definition ill-equipped to handle well: volatile moral questions like abortion and family values, for example, or some aspects of race relations that treat white and black Americans as if they were homogeneous groups rather than individual persons themselves divided by regional, religious, class, education, and other lines. These wedge issues, as political strategists call them, were generated in part by courts that made decisions in the 1960s and 1970s on a whole range of cultural questions without due consideration of how public support for juridically mandated outcomes might be created and sustained. Such juridical moves, in turn, deepened a<i>juridical model of politics,</i>a model first pushed by liberal activists and then embraced by their conservative counterparts. Juridical politics are winner take all, built on an adversarial model. I am not here criticizing any particular court decision, but I am pointing to the baneful effects of this as a model for politics. Juridical politics spur direct-mail and other mass membership organizations whose primary goal is to give no quarter in the matter that is of direct interest to them. By guaranteeing that forces on either side of hotly disputed issues need never debate directly with each other through deliberative processes, the juridical preemption of the past decades has only deepened citizen frustration and fueled a politics of resentment. This politics of resentment, in turn, tends to reduce legislators to agents of single-issue lobbies and mass-mail overkill, thereby deepening the social mistrust that helped to give rise to such efforts in the first place. If one were to revisit the most controversial and divisive issues of the past three to four decades, one would probably discover a dynamic not unlike the one that I here describe.<br><br>Now to the second trend. At present, aggrieved citizens say, in effect, let's take things back through direct rather than representative democracy. Indeed, the<i>Times</i>study concluded that the Perot phenomenon, one that speaks to widespread voter anger and resentment, goes deeper and is more persistent than experts initially believed. In the meantime, the Democratic Party is "depleted and dispirited," and the Republican Party is divided on social and cultural issues. So it comes down to this: Juridical fiat displaces democratic debate and compromise, where things can be worked out in a rough-and-ready way over time. In turn, one proclaimed solution to our woes--a plebiscitary or direct democracy--poses a threat of another sort by promoting the illusion that the unmediated will of the people must have final say on all issues. Although we are nowhere close to an official plebiscitary system, the trend is disturbing, for plebiscitarianism is entirely compatible with, indeed often a mainstay of, antidemocratic regimes. And the emergence of a sour populism only feeds the conviction that Americans of different perspectives cannot talk to one another. If to this one adds the terrible paradox that, all too often, in the name of multiculturalism we are promoting instead competing monoculturalisms, as each group plays what political scientists call a zero-sum game--I win, you lose--you have a picture of a society starting to come apart at the seams.<br><br>And yet, recent studies show that Americans without regard for race "cite the same social problems: crime, poor education, stagnating wages, the imperiled sanctity of the home and family" (Gerald F. Seib and Joe Davidson, "Whites, Blacks Agree on Problems; the Issue Is How to Solve Them,"<i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>29 September 1994, pp. A1–6). Not only does this challenge the insistence that black and white Americans are entirely separate groups with competing interests and identities, these studies show that African-Americans are more insistent than any other group that their society faces a crisis in values beginning with the family. There is, to be sure, less agreement on what can be done to put things right, but, sadly, neither white nor black Americans express confidence in the institutions of democratic society. Both groups seem ripe for direct democracy efforts, and both seem equally susceptible to the distortion of democratic debate in the hands of scandalmongers and demagogues.<br><br>This is a situation begging for true democratic debate, courageous leadership, wise legislation, and the rebuilding of a sturdy civil society--a culture of democratic argument. The sociologist Robert Bellah reports that Americans today brighten to tales of community, especially if the talk is soothing and doesn't appear to demand very much from them. But when the discussion turns to institutions and the need to sustain and to support authoritative civic institutions, attention withers and a certain sourness arises. This bodes ill for liberal democratic society--a political order that requires robust yet resilient institutions that embody and reflect, yet mediate and shape the urgencies of democratic passions and interests. As our mediating institutions disappear or are stripped of legitimacy, a political wilderness spreads. People roam the prairie, fixing on objects or policies or persons to excoriate or to celebrate, at least for a time, until some other enthusiasm or scandal sweeps over them. If we have lost the sturdiness and patience necessary to sustain civil society over the long haul, our democracy--as a political system, a social world, and a culture--is in trouble: its trials will continue.<br><br>How did we get to this sad impasse? I have already suggested that the answers are many and that they are complex. Let me lift up one additional item for your consideration. In part this is a critique of my own generation, the generation that came of age in the 1960s. Many important issues got raised in that tumultuous decade, and long-overdue problems were dealt with, most especially the end of de jure segregation. But a tendency manifested itself in the 1960s that now affects our entire culture and makes it difficult to sustain institutional life. I refer to the demand that one go beyond criticizing and challenging the exercise of authority to arguing that authority must be smashed altogether. A dangerous argument flourished that equated coercion and violence on the one hand with authority on the other. This is a terrible mistake. Authority is not tyranny; indeed, authentic politics begin when the power to coerce arbitrarily is rejected. A very common mistake, then, was to presume that one could have community, happiness, and freedom without authority. But authority and community go together. Legitimate authority is required to create and to sustain institutions. And without institutions, community is an empty word, a sentimental greeting, a vague aching of the heart.<br><br>That is why there was always something suspect about a rush to create community without asking how are communities to be sustained? by whom? to what ends? To have community you must have people prepared to shoulder responsibility, to be accountable; otherwise, you have lots of feelings about wanting to do good, but these evaporate like the early morning's dew at the first sign of difficulty. To have community you must have people prepared to accept the discipline necessary to sustain cultural forms. This discipline consists in part in recognition that the world doesn't begin and end at the perimeter of<i>me,</i>as in "me, myself, and I," as my mother was fond of saying. It consists in recognition of the fact that, even as I restrain myself and expect others to restrain themselves in the interest of sustaining a way of life in common, we are all of us beholden to something bigger and beyond, to purposes not reducible to the concatenation of our private passions and interests. And why should we do this? So that, as I noted at the outset, we can come to know a good in common that we cannot know alone.<br><br>There is an old Celtic saying: "We all warm ourselves at fires we did not build, we all drink from wells we did not dig." It is that recognition I would leave you with, that and a reminder from our democratic foremothers and forefathers: By all means, be brutally honest about the troubles we face, but be not afraid. Democracy is an unpredictable enterprise. Our patience with its ups and downs, its debates and compromises, may wane, because we would like life to be simpler. But it is not.<br><br>Do we care enough about our world to stay thus engaged? Your devotion to the task of social life and social service remain engaged, and we are in your debt. The challenge we face now is to urge upon our fellow citizens every day, in every way that we can, that freedom and responsibility go together. The freer you are, the more responsible you must be. You must not be sour nor gloomy. You must become responsible, prepared to enact projects of the democratic political imagination from deep seriousness of purpose yet in a mood of often playful experimentation. That is the American way at its best. For even when equality and justice seem far-off ideals, freedom preserves the human discourse necessary to work toward the realization of both.<br><br><i>Jean Bethke Elshtain was a professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School when this forum address was delivered at Brigham Young University on 29 October 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Jean Bethke Elshtain</i>

<h1> May Be the Children of Light” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Do you remember being afraid of the dark when you were a child? When you became frightened, you probably turned on the lights--all the lights in the house! When your parents came home later in the evening, they would ask, "Why is every light in the house on?" Then they would proceed to lecture you about the family budget and the cost of electricity.<br><br>You had learned, however, that by turning on an electric light or by lighting a candle, there was no more darkness, no more fear. You learned a simple law of nature, which is also a spiritual law: Light and darkness cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Satan and his disciples cannot tolerate the spiritual light of the gospel; they must immediately depart.<br><br>When we live the commandments, our countenance is surrounded by gospel light. With this spiritual light we no longer wander in the strange and darkened paths of the adversary, becoming lost, discouraged, depressed, and fearful. Walking in the light of the gospel, we will not lose sight of our eternal goals.<br><br><i>Teach me to walk in the light of his love;</i><br><i>Teach me to pray to my Father above;</i><br><i>Teach me to know of the things that are right;</i><br><i>Teach me, teach me to walk in the light.</i><br>["Teach Me to Walk in the Light,"<i>Songbook,</i>p. 177]<br><br>Jesus taught that we should be faithful and believing children of light. "Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness" (1 Thessalonians 5:5). "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness" (John 12:46).<br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i>[That perfect day is when we will be able to stand in the presence of God and endure his light.]<br><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it that you may know the truth, that you may chase darkness from among you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:24–25]<br><br>Truth is light that dispels darkness. "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light of the world" (D&amp;amp;C 11:28; see 3 Nephi 9:18).<br><br>While Jesus was teaching the people, they inquired about his death and wondered if they would be left alone when he was gone from their presence in mortality. "Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you," meaning he would soon depart mortality. "Walk while ye have the light [with you]," meaning that he was in their presence.<br><br><i>Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</i><br><br><i>While ye have light,</i>believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.<i>These things spake Jesus, and departed.</i>[John 12:35–36; emphasis added]<br><br>It is important that we understand the significance to each of us when Jesus taught "believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light." We must have faith and know that we are children of light and that through faith in Jesus, our Savior, and obedience to his commandments we may have his Spirit, his light, to be with us to guide us always. If we are to be children of light, we must walk in the light and, with our agency, choose the right. Yes, walk in the light and shun darkness; we must choose the right and defend the right when the choice is placed before us.<br><br>Think of the choices you are making each day. Will I go to school? How hard will I study? Will I go to church? How obedient will I be to the commandments that have been taught to me? Will I prepare myself to go to the temple and on a mission? Will I be worthy to go to the temple and be sealed to my companion for time and all eternity? Who will be my friends, and did I choose them for the right reasons? What kind of a friend will I be? What kind of a son or daughter, brother or sister, am I? Do I spiritually strengthen all family members with my conduct and attitude? Will I be honest and live with integrity in all my choices? These and many more choices and decisions must be encountered each day of our lives. How we make each daily choice in life affects what we become during our life in mortality, as well as having eternal consequences. If we, as members of the Church, are obedient and walk in the light, having both the Light of Christ and the gift of the Holy Ghost to guide us, we will make the right choices. If we make our choices without the Holy Ghost, we will make wrong choices that lead us toward the darkness--and we will wander in strange paths and be lost.<br><br>The first teaching about light begins in the Bible, in the book of Genesis, where the creation of earth is recorded. God divided light from darkness. Also, the separation of light and darkness symbolizes the difference between the Light of Christ and the darkness that surrounds Satan and his followers. Satan is known as the prince of darkness.<br><br>Let's turn to the scriptures:<br><br><i>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</i><br><br><i>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</i><br><br><i>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</i><br><br><i>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</i><br><br><i>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</i>[Genesis 1:1–5]<br><br>When the Spirit of God moved upon the Creation, there was light. The light of the Spirit is good and will always divide and dispel the darkness of evil. We will never be left in darkness if we are obedient to the commandments and have the Holy Ghost with us always.<br><br>In our daily lives we must understand how important the light of the Spirit is to us. As in the creation of earth, the Light of Christ is our salvation and protection from the darkness of the adversary. We will never be left without the Light of Christ even when there is darkness all around us in this mortal probation. In the creation of the earth we are assured of light even on the darkest of nights. The book of Genesis teaches more about the importance of light as a part of the creation of earth.<br><br><i>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night;...</i><br><br><i>... lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</i><br><br><i>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day</i>[the sun],<i>and the lesser light to rule the night</i>[the moon]:<i>he made the stars also</i>[for the night].<br><br><i>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</i><br><br><i>And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</i><br><br><i>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</i>[Genesis 1:14–19]<br><br>Just reflect on the power of the light provided for this earth by our loving Heavenly Father. Without light, living things now on earth would be unable to survive. Light from the sun provides energy for life on earth. Plants change the energy of sunlight into food energy in a process called photosynthesis. Very nearly all living organisms on earth depend directly or indirectly on photosynthesis for their food energy. We depend also on the energy of sunlight to warm the earth, to keep it in the temperature range necessary for living things to survive.<br><br>The light from the moon and stars provides a navigational standard that can guide the mariner directly toward his intended goal. The Light of Christ provides a spiritual standard to guide us safely home to live again with him and with our Heavenly Father.<br><br>When we talk of the Holy Ghost and of having the Spirit to be with us, we must talk about obedience. When we pray, when we study the scriptures, when we obediently live the commandments, we have within us a guiding light that can be obtained in no other way. The Light of Christ is brighter than the sun. Where Christ is, there is no need of the illumination of the sun, moon, or stars.<br><br>"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it:<i>for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof"</i>(Revelation 21:23; emphasis added). "They need no candle, neither light of the sun; for<i>the Lord God giveth them light:</i>and they shall reign for ever and ever" (Revelation 22:5; emphasis added). The Lord said, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world" (John 9:5). "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying,<i>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,</i>but shall have the light of life [eternal life]" (John 8:12; emphasis added).<br><br>"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him" (John 11:10). "Then Jesus said unto them, ... Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth" (John 12:35). "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:<i>walk as children of light"</i>(Ephesians 5:8; emphasis added).<br><br>And the Savior also said, "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness" (John 12:46). "To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace" (Luke 1:79).<br><br>The Lord is an everlasting light without beginning and without end. His light will never fail us in times of need. Isaiah taught, "The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee [by night]: but<i>the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light,</i>and thy God thy glory" (Isaiah 60:19; emphasis added). "Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness" (John 3:19). "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37).<br><br><i>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</i><br><br><i>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</i>[John 3:19–21]<br><br><i>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</i>[Acts 26:18]<br><br>Contrast the condition of despair and darkness that is Satan's with the joy and happiness that dwells with us in the brightness of hope that is found in the Spirit and in the light of our Savior.<br><br>We need eyes that see the Light of Christ. The human eye does not function in total darkness. It functions on the basis of reflected light. Sight, or vision, is a rapidly occurring process that involves continuous interaction between the eye, the nervous system, and the brain. When someone looks at an object, what they really see is the light reflected from the object. This reflected light passes through the lens and falls on the retina of the eye. Here the light induces nerve impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain and then over other nerves (75 to 150 million rods and about 7 million cones in the human retina) to muscles and glands. Having "eyes to see" requires reflected light. The human eye cannot function in total darkness. Heavenly Father never left us without light. We must use our eyes to see, ears to hear, and heart to understand.<br><br>"Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house" (Ezekiel 12:2). We live in the world, but we must not be of the world. Our eyes need to see the reflected light of the Holy Spirit and gospel truths. "By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God" (D&amp;amp;C 76:12).<br><br>Jesus taught:<br><br><i>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</i><br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</i>[Matthew 13:16–17]<br><br><i>The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:22]<br><br>Church members must use both the Light of Christ and the gift of the Holy Ghost that has been given us to make the most important choice--whom we will serve.<br><br>Joshua, an elderly prophet, gave the people a choice. Joshua taught his people this principle:<br><br><i>Now therefore fear the Lord</i>[to fear the Lord is to honor, respect, and love the Lord],<i>and serve him in sincerity and in truth....</i><br><br><i>... serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve ... : but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord....</i><br><br><i>And the people said unto Joshua, ... we will serve the Lord.</i>[Joshua 24:14–15, 21]<br><br>"Choose you this day whom ye will serve ...: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" is the declaration of a great prophet teaching his people, reminding them of their shortcomings. It is a declaration of his testimony and what he and his family or house intended to do. And the people said, "We will serve the Lord." And Joshua caused a pillar of stone to be erected. "And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the Lord" (Joshua 24:26) as a testimony that the people had agreed to serve the Lord. And Joshua said, "Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him" (Joshua 24:22). And they accepted that challenge and were witnesses against themselves that they agreed to serve the Lord. We are told in this scripture that the people under Joshua did serve the Lord, and the people that lived after him served the Lord and were true to this covenant. Once we have made the choice to serve the Lord, we will then have the light and Spirit within us to use our agency to make the right choices, and so will our posterity for generations to come.<br><br>Enoch humbly asked why he had found favor, for he described himself as "but a lad," and "slow of speech." He said, "All the people hate me" (Moses 6:31). The Lord told him to go and do as he was commanded, and "no man shall pierce thee" (Moses 6:32). When we do as the Lord commands, we are protected from the fiery darts of the adversary. Enoch was told to "open thy mouth, and it shall be filled" (Moses 6:32). He was told to say to his people, "Choose ye this day, to serve the Lord God" (Moses 6:33). He was promised that mountains would flee before him and rivers would turn from their courses. My message today is to do as the Lord has commanded, walk in the light, choose the right, and put on the whole armor of God (see D&amp;amp;C 27:15–18) so that you can defend the right and choose ye this day to serve the Lord.<br><br>You are standing at the crossroads of life with many choices placed before you. Everything that you need to guide you has been learned in your home or from Primary and other Church teachings, or from seminary and institute classes. You will be leaving your homes. You have been given agency, and you will have choices to make that will have an influence on who you are and what you will be. In Primary you learned to "choose the right when a choice is placed before you" ("Choose the Right,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 239). What is meant by "choose the right"? (See<i>Choose the Right,</i>1997 Children's Sacrament Meeting Presentation and Sharing Time.)<br><br>Heavenly Father has blessed us with agency to choose right from wrong.<br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall</i>[by his atonement].<i>And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh. ... And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i><br><br><i>And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit.</i>[2 Nephi 2:26–28]<br><br>Agency means I am free to choose right or wrong and I am responsible for my choices. What choices can I make even if others around me choose to be unrighteous? The story of Joseph is a good example of the righteous choices we can make under the most adverse conditions. Joseph served the Lord faithfully and blessed his family after being sold into Egypt by his brothers at age 17. He was later tempted by Potiphar's wife and was placed among evil and designing men who surrounded the pharaoh. In every challenge he proved faithful (see Genesis 37, 39, 41). May we all be faithful and strong like Joseph when we have difficult choices to make in times of trials and tribulations.<br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:2]<br><br>Remember that whenever we have a choice to make, there is opposition. "And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves" (D&amp;amp;C 29:39).<br><br><b>We are accountable to our Heavenly Father and to our earthly parents for our choices.</b>"Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin" (James 4:17). "Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord" (Colossians 3:20).<br><br><b>We must love the Lord as he showed love for his Father and follow his example of being obedient to choose the right.</b>"If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love" (John 15:10). Sometimes we forget how obedient Jesus was to his Father's commandments and desires. "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).<br><br><b>Heavenly Father gave us commandments to guide us and help us choose the right.</b>Often we hear that commandments are restrictive and difficult to live. Commandments are given to us by a loving Father who cares for us and wants us, through our obedience, to live a happy and joyous life. "But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (D&amp;amp;C 59:23).<br><br>Choosing to live the commandments saves us the pain and sorrow that come from acts of disobedience. Light and truth forsake that evil one. The greatest sorrow would be living unworthy here in mortality and not to be able to return into the presence of God the Father eternally.<br><br>If we remain faithful in keeping our covenants after going to the temple, we will have the opportunity of returning to him. To return into the presence of God, we must keep our minds and bodies pure and healthy.<br><br><i>If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:13]<br><br><b>Our choices have consequences. We all chose to live Heavenly Father's plan, obtaining a mortal body and coming to earth.</b>"In the image of his own body, male and female, created he them, and blessed them ... in the day when they were created and became living souls in the land upon the footstool of God" (Moses 6:9).<br><br>We must be obedient to the commandments if we are to receive blessings that come from our faithful consecration.<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br><i>For thus saith the Lord--I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 76:5–6]<br><br><b>The atonement of Jesus Christ allows us to correct our wrong choices by sincere repentance.</b>Repentance requires us to recognize that we have done wrong and confess of our sins to our bishop and to the Lord. We must experience sincere sorrow for our transgression and make a commitment to never repeat our disobedient act. In addition, we are required to make restitution to the injured parties to the fullest extent that is possible. Our feelings when we have done wrong weigh us down with sorrow and shame.<br><br><i>For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.</i>[Alma 12:14]<br><br>Oh, but then there is the joy of experiencing the joyful heart and the peace of mind that come from feeling the Spirit and being granted the remission of our sins after attaining full repentance from our transgression because of our faith in Jesus Christ.<br><br><i>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</i>[Mosiah 4:3]<br><br><i>Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more.</i><br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:42–43]<br><br><i>For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 19:16]<br><br>We should prepare ourselves each week to be worthy of partaking of the sacrament and renewing our baptismal covenants. When we were baptized we took upon us the name of Jesus Christ. Taking upon us the sacred name of Jesus Christ was a covenant and brought with the ordinance of baptism a promise of consecrated service and obedience to his commandments--a promise we renew each time we partake of the sacrament (see D&amp;amp;C 20:37, 77, 79; 68:27). If we can partake worthily of the sacrament each week, we will remember his atoning sacrifice for us, take his sacred name upon us, and covenant to keep his commandments. When we have done these things, he gives us the greatest blessing that he can bestow upon us--to always have his Spirit to be with us. What greater blessing could we ask for, here in mortality?<br><br>When we are making choices, we should be mindful of the sacred ordinances and covenants taken at our baptism and renewed each time we partake of the sacrament, and also of the covenants we make in the temple.<br><br><b>Daily prayer, scripture study, and obedience to the commandments will assure us of having the Holy Ghost to guide and strengthen us as we make important right choices in life.</b><br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</i>[Alma 37:37]<br><br>Daily prayers and scripture study will help us to ask the question "What does Jesus want me to do?" And our obedience to the commandments will give us the courage to do what is right. Studying the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets helps us apply lessons learned to our immediate needs, helps us make right decisions, and blesses us throughout our lives. "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God" (Alma 37:35). If we will learn to make right choices when we are young, we will make right decisions when we are older. Then eternal blessings can be ours. "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers" (D&amp;amp;C 112:10). "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2).<br><br>Sometimes difficult choices require a great deal of pondering and praying before we receive the confirmation of the Spirit, giving peace to our mind that our decision is the right choice. Oliver Cowdery was admonished to be patient when seeking the direction of the Spirit:<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>We have spoken of the Light of Christ and of the importance of having the Holy Ghost to guide us as we make righteous decisions. As I have been preparing this message to share with you, I have had feelings that we should be like the Savior as he admonished us to "Come, follow me" (Luke 18:22). Wouldn't it be pleasing to Jesus if we could let our light so shine that those who followed us would be following the Savior? There are those searching for the light who will gladly pass through the gate of baptism onto the straight and narrow way that leads to eternal life (see 2 Nephi 31). Will you be that light that will lead them to a safe harbor?<br><br>The headlines in a recent newspaper article seemed to jump off the page: "Lost in Fog, 757 Plunges into Pacific." With 70 people on board, Aeroperu Flight 603 from Lima, Peru, to Santiago, Chile, had fallen from the dark and foggy sky into the icy Pacific waters off the coast of Peru. What happened? Moments before the crash the pilot of the aircraft was asking the same question: "What's happening? What altitude am I at? Why is my ground crash alarm on? Am I over land or sea? ... I don't have any instruments." (See<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>3 October 1996, A1, A9.) With a failed navigational system and thick fog preventing him from seeing any lights on the ground, I believe the pilot may have been experiencing vertigo. If an airplane turns at a constant two or three degrees, the motion is imperceptible. If a person inside cannot see lights from the instrument panel or from the sky or ground, before long he could be flying completely upside down and not even be aware of it. When a pilot realizes he is losing altitude, his automatic reaction is to pull the stick back. If he is not flying straight and level, however, his airplane can dive toward the earth rather than climb toward the safety of the sky.<br><br>If we are not careful, we can experience spiritual vertigo. If we stray off the course of obedience only two or three degrees--an almost imperceptible difference--we can become disoriented. Losing sight of our eternal destination and not even realizing how far off course we are, we will make poor choices. Our Savior does not want us to crash. His desire is for us to choose the route that will bring us back on the straight and narrow path to live with him eternally. "Come, follow me," he has told us. He provides the light that will keep us on course and bring us back into his presence.<br><br>The pilot of Aeroperu Flight 603 asked for a guide plane--a light, if you will--to show him the way to the airport.<br><br><i>Before dawn, officials</i>[in Peru]<i>lined up ambulances, firetrucks, gasoline-powered generators and reflectors on the dark beach so that possible survivors would have bright lights to swim toward.</i>[<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>3 October 1996, A9]<br><br>A beautiful hymn, "Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy," gently reminds us of the importance of being a light for others to follow:<br><br><i>Brightly beams our Father's mercy</i><br><i>From his lighthouse evermore,</i><br><i>But to us he gives the keeping</i><br><i>Of the lights along the shore.</i><br><br><i>Let the lower lights be burning;</i><br><i>Send a gleam across the wave.</i><br><i>Some poor fainting, struggling seaman</i><br><i>You may rescue, you may save.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 335]<br><br>Have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you are the light sent by Heavenly Father to lead another safely home or to be a beacon from a distance to show the way back to the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life? Your light is a beacon and should never stop burning or mislead those who are looking for a way home. Let the lower lights keep burning--you may save a struggling seaman in the turbulent sea of life.<br><br>Elder John H. Groberg was once asked to go with Elder Boyd K. Packer to Samoa to create a new stake on the island of Upolu. Their plan was to fly one afternoon from Savai'i to Upolu. On the day of the scheduled flight, however, an intense tropical storm stirred up the elements, so much so that it was far too dangerous to fly. The only way back to Upolu was by boat, and that mode of travel would be extremely treacherous.<br><br><i>The flight to Upolu would have taken less than a half hour, and under normal conditions the boat journey would have taken just a few hours. Conditions were far from normal, however. The boat went up and down and rolled ... and pitched all over that angry ocean for many more hours than usual.</i>[John H. Groberg,<i>The Fire of Faith</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996), p. 257]<br><br>It was a terrible evening. Nearly everyone on board got sick. They held tightly on to one another to keep from being thrown overboard.<br><br>Finally, in the thick darkness of the night, they approached the harbor of Malifanua only to learn that they had another obstacle.<br><br><i>There was only a small opening in the reef and</i>[they]<i>had to negotiate it perfectly to keep from getting torn to pieces on the sharp coral on either side....</i><br><br><i>Normally there are two lights for night entry--one at the wharf and another up the hill a way. When you line those two up you know you are entering the opening properly. Unfortunately the only light on that night was the one on the wharf. The one up the hill was not on, so</i>[they]<i>could not tell accurately where to enter the opening.</i>[They]<i>later found that the two men who were supposed to turn on the light on the hill had said to each other: "It's a terrible stormy night and no one would be crazy enough to try to come from Savai'i. Let's just stay home tonight and not go out in such a storm for no reason."</i>[Groberg,<i>Fire of Faith,</i>p. 257]<br><br>The boat in which Elder Groberg and Elder Packer were traveling had to reroute to a safer port some distance around the island. They arrived cold and soaked with ocean water with little time to spare before their meetings began in Upolu.<br><br>It isn't just<i>nice</i>to be a light for others; it is<i>essential</i>for their exaltation as well as for our own. "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).<br><br>We are children of light. As children of light, we walk in the light and choose the right and stand for the right.<br><br>Choosing the right is a decision-making process. Choose to learn what is the right way to live your life, learning principles and keeping the commandments and covenants that guide and protect you as you exercise your agency in daily choices.<br><br>Will you have a desire to do what is right once you know what is right? Choose to do what is right when you have a choice to make that will affect your eternal goals, such as controlling the natural man's attitude and pride. Be humble.<br><br>Choose to do what is right because your greatest desire is to love the Lord and to be obedient to his laws, ordinances, and commandments so that you can return back into his presence eternally. Choose to do what is right because you love yourself and because you honor those who love you.<br><br>Help others to do what is right. Choose to be of service and be an example of what is right by lifting and strengthening others to do what is right because you care.<br><br>Choose to turn around and repent immediately if you ever depart from the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life. Repentance is a merciful result of our Savior's atoning sacrifice because of the love our Father in Heaven and his Son Jesus Christ have for each of us.<br><br>I leave you my testimony that I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. I ask that each one of us, as we contemplate and think about the discussion this evening, will be a light, that we will walk in the light, that we will choose the right, and that we will defend the right. I know that God lives. His Son Jesus Christ is the light that has been given to us so that we may follow and know where to go. That each one of us may choose the right and lift and strengthen those around us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert D.

<h1> Ghost: Our Infallible Guide - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbled by the awesome responsibility of speaking before you today, and I appreciate President Bateman's kind introduction. I am truly a person who has worn many hats in my life. Like Bartholomew Cubbins and his 500 hats, one just keeps popping on the minute I take another off: daughter, wife, mother, grandmother; student, teacher; missionary, visiting teacher, Relief Society president, nursery leader, choir member; and on and on (see Dr. Seuss,<i>The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins</i>[New York: Random House, 1989]). My life has been one of marvelous experiences.<br><h2><b>Introduction</b></h2><br>The title of my talk today is "The Holy Ghost: Our Infallible Guide." The Holy Ghost has touched my life in many ways. One might say his influence is multifaceted, like a precious diamond, or that he also wears many hats. These hats--callings, functions, roles, or gifts--and their manifestations are so numerous that full books could be written about them (as I found when I was preparing this talk). So today I would like to narrow my discussion to three special functions of the Holy Ghost that dynamically affect our lives at Brigham Young University: teacher, guardian, and comforter. I pray that you may listen by the spirit of the Holy Ghost to discern those things that are most needful in your individual lives.<br><br>I have keenly felt the importance of the Holy Ghost as a teacher, a guardian, and a comforter in my life because I have also worn these hats. My students know me here as a teacher of Shakespeare, technical writing, and creative writing. They also know that<i>unlike</i>the Holy Ghost, I am<i>not</i>infallible. Just this week, I found I had mixed up the colors in the War of the Roses and gave the red rose to the York faction instead of the Lancaster faction. Thank goodness for sharp students who set me right. I appreciate them for helping me be a better teacher. As a mother, I have also been a teacher and a guardian. But I wasn't a perfect mom, either. My children had their share of cut lips and skinned knees. Try as I might, I couldn't save them from all the bumps of life. And when either my students or my children--and now my grandchildren--have these bumps, I whip out my hat of the comforter and give this other role a try. But I'm not infallible here, either. I can't always take away the hurt. I must hand the hat over to that wonderful personage, the Holy Ghost. As I discuss the three roles or functions of the Holy Ghost, may I share with you true accounts of the marvelous influence of the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost as a Teacher</b></h2><br>First is the function of the Holy Ghost as a teacher. As students and teachers at Brigham Young University, we are engaged in the immediate task of gaining knowledge. We read, we listen, we experiment, we test, we write. We grow "line upon line, precept upon precept" (D&amp;amp;C 98:12) in both our fields of specialty and our general knowledge. Sometimes we become too self-sufficient and don't allow the Holy Ghost to help us learn. But he is always there, waiting to help.<br><br>James W. Cannon, professor of mathematics, discusses how the Holy Ghost helped him to study and research in the book<i>Expressions of Faith:</i><br><br><i>The problem I was considering was a hard one that I had been working on, off and on, for five years. I felt that I was really near the end. I felt that just one little insight was all I needed--the ideal occasion for praying and receiving an answer. And so I would hide in the library at the beginning of each day, think about what direction might be the right one to pry loose that additional bit of needed insight (the one that would explain everything), pray for direction and enlightenment, and set out to work. And, amazingly to me, each day I would feel instructed and directed. I would feel at day's end that I had traveled a great distance, and that only a</i>little<i>bit of insight was still needed to finish the problem. . . .</i><br><br><i>So went the months until at the end of the summer I was, actually, at the end of the problem. I understood it, and the little bit of needed insight was spread over the summer and was full of miraculous mathematical wonders, much deeper than I had dreamed--and I marveled. . . . I marveled at the naïveté that led me to expect my hard problem to have an easy answer, to assume that one little inspiration was all I needed, that I needed just one little word in the ear. I marveled at the distance I had traveled and at the length of my instruction.</i>[James W. Cannon, "Study and the Prayer of Faith,"<i>Expressions of Faith: Testimonies of Latter-day Saint Scholars,</i>ed. Susan Easton Black (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1996), pp. 86–87; emphasis in original]<br><br>At some times in our studies, we come up against a wall. We have done all that we can, but answers simply elude us. Robert L. Millet, dean of Religious Education, has noted:<br><br><i>When disciplined minds and creative artists open themselves to the enlightening powers of the Holy Ghost and are imbued with the spirit and power of the restored gospel, learning and discovery and creativity reach beyond the paltry bounds of what has been done heretofore and open us to new vistas of understanding and expression.</i>[Robert L. Millet, "Knowledge by Faith,"<i>Expressions of Faith,</i>p. 97]<br><br>This knowledge, given to us by the "infallible guide," is true, unlike some information from secular sources that may be subject to popular prejudices and limited testing.<br><br>Sometimes as we study and learn here at BYU, circumstances beyond our control deter us from putting adequate time and energy into a class or a particular assignment. Church responsibilities, illness, family problems, or unusual situations can cause us to have additional need to call upon the Holy Ghost's assistance. One such incident is recounted by Steven D. Bennion, now president of Ricks College. He had been serving as a bishop, completing classes for his PhD, and working full-time to support his family of seven. He needed to finish his doctoral dissertation and defend it, but it was taking much more time than he had expected. He had to do a crash program to finish. With only two days left, he ran up against a wall. I quote:<br><br><i>The first day was an exercise in frustration. I struggled at length through that day and produced only 4 pages. By 9 o'clock that evening, I was discouraged and desperate: I had only two nights and a day left to compose a compelling concluding chapter. I decided to get a good night's rest the first night, leaving myself only a day and a night to complete the chapter. I remember offering special prayers both that evening and the next morning. I pleaded my need to the Lord, reminding him of my good wife and family and their faithful support while I worked on the dissertation and served as bishop. I acknowledged gratitude for opportunities and then asked for special spiritual help to quicken my mind and spirit for the monumental challenge of completing the final chapter in a single day.</i><br><br><i>I arose the next morning at 4:30 and began to write. The words flowed as I had never before experienced. The next 42 pages came far more easily than the first 4 had the day before.</i><br><br>As Brother Bennion's wife helped him review those final pages, another miracle happened. His wife found many corrections in the first four pages, but, to their "mutual amazement, she did not suggest one change in the final 42 pages" (Steven D. Bennion, "Human Life Divided by Reason Leaves a Remainder,"<i>Expressions of Faith,</i>p. 50).<br><br>As you struggle in studying, researching, writing, and test taking, be aware that the Holy Ghost will help you and teach you along the way. I wish to testify that this principle is true and to give you a personal example to this effect. When I was completing my doctoral work at the University of Utah, I also struggled with time and responsibilities. I had four small children and was the ward Relief Society president. I was finishing my degree part-time, but even then some days were incredibly hard. One particular term was coming to an end when I suddenly got a bad case of the flu. I had studied very hard, but on the day of the final I was so sick with a high fever that I was dizzy and nauseated when I tried to get out of bed. I pleaded with the Lord for his help, then got dressed and headed for Salt Lake. As I walked to my classroom, I was so sick that I had to hold onto the wall so I wouldn't fall. I sat at the back of the room to take the exam. I remember how difficult it was to read the test questions. My mind was fuzzy and I couldn't think, but I nonetheless did my best. The next term I happened to meet that professor in the hall as I was going to another class. He stopped me and commented about my final. The Holy Ghost had blessed me more than I had ever supposed.<br><br>As our teacher, the Holy Ghost can do three things for us in our efforts to learn. First, he can reveal new knowledge. The Doctrine and Covenants says, "If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things" (D&amp;amp;C 42:61). If we do our part and can do no more, the Holy Ghost will add that "line upon line" to our understanding. We may even receive new insights that the world could not give. A second thing the Holy Ghost can do is to help us make connections. Like a chemist putting two different familiar elements together to create something new, we can be guided in our studies to make connections that will open up an entirely new possibility. A third way that the Holy Ghost can teach us is to bring to our mind forgotten things.<br><br>As a young missionary, the apostle M. Russell Ballard once had to defend the Church in an English debating society meeting before more than twelve hundred people. After his presentation,<br><br><i>as the questions began, the missionary's anxiety turned into joy as he was filled with the power of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>Elder Ballard understood each question before it was finished, and the answer came to him immediately. He felt the Lord's Spirit, like a flood, filling him and guiding his responses. Sometimes he would actually quote scriptures by heart--verses he had read once or twice but certainly had never memorized. He spoke with clarity and yet with warmth and good will, and the audience was moved.</i><br><br><i>. . . When the meeting finally ended, the crowd stood and gave him a standing ovation.</i>[Dean Hughes and Tom Hughes,<i>We'll Bring the World His Truth</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1995), pp. 61–62]<br><br>Jesus told us that he would send<br><br><i>the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</i>[John 14:26]<br><br>Parley P. Pratt has said:<br><br><i>The gift of the Holy Ghost . . . quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections; and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use.</i>[<i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i>9th ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1965), p. 101]<br><br>All these teaching moments and blessings are contingent on our faithfulness and on our own preparation and effort. He will not do our work for us. The Holy Ghost usually doesn't bring to our mind things we haven't read. We must pray with humility that we can remember those things we have studied and ask for his guidance in our research.<br><br>However, at times we are not meant to have certain knowledge. I know that I could pray until my kneecaps fell off to be a great physicist, but it's just not there. I not only don't have a physics hat, my physics area is bald. But I can write a sonnet--my creative corner is my crown. We may study for hours, prepare diligently, and pray fervently for help on an exam--and still end up with a C. That subject may be to you like my physics nonhat. You'll have to find your right hat for success--and that hat may be a hard hat rather than a top hat. We can't all be doctors or attorneys--the Lord wants a few poets around, too.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost as a Guardian</b></h2><br>A second function of the Holy Ghost is as a guardian. The Holy Ghost cannot guard us from all the pain in life, just as mothers and fathers cannot protect their children from every cut and scratch of life. But as a testifier of truth and as a protector, the Holy Ghost can guide us in our daily decisions. He can also help us to make right choices and guard us against evil. Promptings to do good come from the Holy Ghost. As I walk around campus, I see the work of the Holy Ghost as I notice people holding doors open for each other and hundreds of small ways of being kind and loving. Service opportunities are overwhelmingly supported. Students and faculty help with Special Olympics, read textbooks for the blind, staff the Crisis Center for Abuse, help with homeless shelters, serve in temples, and do numerous good things every day. The Holy Ghost not only prompts you to perform these services but gives you peace in your hearts as you serve.<br><br>When further opportunities to serve come, do not ignore the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Don't push urgings to do good aside with thoughts of your busy schedule or with feelings of inadequacy or preoccupation.<br><br>I once had a prompting to take a loaf of hot bread to a ward member. As I sat in my car in front of her house with the bread warm on the seat beside me, I said to myself that this woman was a renowned cook and homemaker in the ward and had so many wonderful gifts that my little offering would not be important to her. I talked myself out of going to her door and drove home. That very night her husband was taken to the hospital and subsequently died. My gift, although small, may have made a difference to her that day, and I have always regretted not following that prompting.<br><br>The Holy Ghost also warns us against the dangers and evils in this life. Dorothea Speth, now wife of Spencer J. Condie, records an unforgettable experience that occurred on February 13, 1945, in Dresden, Germany. This was the night that Dresden was firebombed, and Sister Condie's parent's home was hit. As the firestorm was raging through the streets, her parents decided to take the four daughters and head for the Elbe River, which was down a wide street about four blocks from their home. She says:<br><br><i>For safety, we did not all walk together. My father took one of my older sisters and my twin sister and began to lead the way. My mother, my oldest sister, and I were to follow as closely as possible. As my father started walking, he headed towards a narrow side street instead of choosing the wide street which led directly to our goal, to the river. Mother stopped, not wanting to follow down the narrow, burning street and began calling Dad to try to persuade him to turn around and take the more direct route along our street, which seemed so much safer and quicker. But due to the firestorm, Dad could not hear her plea, and he continued walking along the narrow side street.</i><br><br><i>With each passing second, the distance between us increased, but Mom was still not willing to abandon her plan. Then I heard my older sister plead with her, "Mom, let's follow Dad; he holds the Priesthood!" With this reminder, we started to move quickly, trying to catch up with Dad, who led us safely in a roundabout way down to the river.</i><br><br>After they reached safety, a neighbor lady came to tell them that she and her husband had taken the wide street to the river.<br><br><i>Her husband, tall and slender, walked very quickly leading the way, but she, somewhat short and heavy, could not follow so quickly, and lagged behind. Suddenly she saw her husband burnt alive in front of her eyes. Unknown to anyone, liquid phosphorous from one of the bombs had covered the street. It could not be seen but was immediately ignited whenever anyone stepped on it. There was nothing she could do to save her husband, she could only turn around and save herself.</i>[Dorothea Speth Condie, "Let's Follow Dad--He Holds the Priesthood,"<i>Behind the Iron Curtain: Recollections of Latter-day Saints in East Germany, 1945–1989,</i>coll. and trans. Garold N. Davis and Norma S. Davis (Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), pp. 33–34]<br><br>As a holder of the priesthood, Sister Condie's father had listened to the Holy Ghost and had saved his family from a fiery death.<br><br>We need not go into Mormon folklore to find strange and miraculous happenings of protection--almost any missionary journal tells of them. Many of you have served missions and have had both great and small experiences with the promptings of the Holy Ghost. On our own mission, my husband and I were protected and blessed. An example of just a small blessing occurred one evening when we were parking our car in a lot behind an apartment complex where we were to give the missionary discussions to some investigators from Brazil. As my husband pulled into a parking spot, I suddenly said, "Don't park here." I'm sure he thought, "There goes my nutty wife again." There didn't seem to be any reason for my request, but my husband pulled out and moved to a different spot. It was dark when we came out of our discussion sometime later, but we noticed that another car was where we had originally parked. It was totally hemmed in by other vehicles.<br><br>As a guide and as a guardian, the Holy Ghost helps us make the right choices, as well as being there to guard and protect us. You will be making many of the life-shaping decisions of your lives here at the university. If you listen humbly to the whisperings of the Spirit, that future can be directed toward the joy and happiness your Father in Heaven wants you to have. In choosing your careers and your employment opportunities, pray for guidance and then humbly and quietly listen. Do you feel at peace with your choices? Or is there an unsettled feeling? Is something just not quite right? Perhaps the Holy Ghost is trying to get through to you. Decision making is hard. Let the Holy Ghost be your partner in the process.<br><br>As you date, listen to the Holy Ghost. Ask him to help you choose each dating partner according to the right standards. Ultimately, the responsibility of choice is yours. But ask for the guidance of the Spirit to help you look for deeper spiritual values. Although you probably wouldn't want your parents choosing your mate, it doesn't hurt to listen to their advice when you have found someone special. Taking a prospective mate home to meet the folks is the acid test. You are marrying an eternal partner. No decision can have greater impact in your life. At that time you'll want the quiet assurance of the Holy Ghost. Ask him to verify your choice. But also listen to his warnings. Don't let wedding jitters rule you, but if you feel that something is not right, pay attention. The Lord<i>will</i>bless you in these decisions.<br><br>However, some hard experiences are necessary for us in our lives. One young woman whose marriage had not been smooth was deeply troubled because the Spirit had witnessed to her before the wedding that the man she had chosen was the right one. At this point in her life, she seems to have elected the wrong candidate for a husband. But the ballots are not all in yet. She may someday find the reason for this experience. In a similar manner, some promising career decisions that the Holy Ghost seems to verify end up falling to pieces. No matter what your choices are, you're going to be tested. That's the purpose of mortality--which leads to my third point: the Holy Ghost as a comforter.<br><h2><b>The Holy Ghost as a Comforter</b></h2><br>During trials in our lives, the Holy Ghost serves another function--that of a comforter. He brings the peace spoken of by our Savior in John 14:27: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you." Many stories can attest to the fact that when a loved one dies, there is often a loving peace that comes to the bereaved. But death is not the only sorrow in life. Loss of friendship, discouragement in schoolwork, an unexpected poor grade, the breakup of a romance, reverses in the workplace, divorce, the misdeeds of family or loved ones, loss of health, or disappointments in our goals--just to mention a few--will come.<br><br>Here at the university we often have much need of comfort. I have finally reconciled myself to the fact that I'll never have a shape like Barbie. But who wants a waist as small as your neck? We'd all like to be beautiful or handsome, brilliant, talented, popular. Who wouldn't like to throw the perfect football pass, be the star of the show, discover a cure for Alzheimer's disease, or design a billion-dollar skyscraper? Even thinking a little smaller, we'd love to have a date for a dance or do well on the midterm or lose five pounds or get chosen as a soloist in the choir. What happens when we don't? Intellectually, we can say, "I knew I couldn't do that anyway." But inside, you still hurt. You don't have to hurt alone. The Holy Ghost can wrap his spiritual arms around you and tell you that you're okay as you are. Your hips really aren't as big as you think they are--and anyway, so what if they are? The love of our Father in Heaven isn't determined by a tape measure.<br><br>Many trials are more than just wishing for something we don't have--and will probably never have. Some are very painful. But they are given for our growth here in mortality. As the Lord told Joseph in Liberty Jail, "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). Joseph Smith was often comforted in his trials--and he certainly had many more trials than any of us: dragged from his home in the night to be beaten, tarred, and feathered; jailed dozens of times; lied about and verbally abused; mocked; and finally martyred. And his suffering was small compared to the suffering of our Savior for us.<br><br>On a personal level, it is difficult to turn off the suffering, however. When these trials come--and they will come--we have the right to call upon the Holy Ghost to comfort us, just as Joseph Smith did.<br><br>That comfort came to my husband the night our furniture business, which was our livelihood, burned to the ground. For me, it took place again during my years of doctoral studies. Through a food or water contamination, both my husband and our next-door neighbor contracted infectious hepatitis. Our neighbor was pregnant, so she was hospitalized. As Relief Society president, I was responsible to find someone to help care for her young children left at home. But no one wanted children who had been exposed to hepatitis. I brought them to my home to be with my own four children during the day while the neighbor's husband was at work. All went reasonably well until I had to go to a class in Salt Lake City. I checked with my good friend who ran the day-care center that my own two youngest attended to see if it could accommodate the extra children. My friend graciously agreed. When I got home and picked up the children, I happened to notice one of the neighbor children's eyes--the whites had turned yellow. As the spread of the illness was confirmed, I called the day-care center with the bad news. My friend then called the parents of the other children who had been at the center so they could get a shot of gamma as a preventative. Panic ensued. Within a day or so, the day-care center (with my friend's much-needed income) was closed down by the board of health. When I heard this news, I was devastated. The pressure of caring for a very sick husband, my own--plus extra--children, going to school, and fulfilling my Relief Society responsibilities in addition to the terrible guilt I felt about the day-care incident drove me sobbing to my knees. Suddenly, an overwhelming feeling of love and peace flowed over me, beginning at the top of my head and covering me like a cloak. "Everything will be all right," the Spirit whispered. And, of course, everything did work out--not without more difficult moments, but I never again despaired.<br><br>A similar feeling to the one I experienced is described by Elfriede Pawlowski in the book<i>Behind the Iron Curtain.</i>She had been struggling with "an evil power" that seemed to try to prevent her from accepting the gospel. Then one day in branch meeting, this dark power tried to overcome her again. She later wrote:<br><br><i>I prayed fervently that the Lord would free me from this power so I could understand the gospel. . . . Then something happened that I will never forget. A new skin almost seemed to be drawn over me. It began with the top of my head and went down over my shoulders and over my entire body right down to the tips of my toes. At first, I was somewhat frightened, but a feeling of freedom came over me, a lightness, and a deep feeling of gratitude.</i>[Elfriede Pawlowski, "If God Is for Us, Who Can Be Against Us?"<i>Behind the Iron Curtain,</i>p. 72]<br><br>Occasionally, we want things that we shouldn't have. We pray and then agonize when what seems to us to be righteous desires aren't realized. Our parents are not healed from a sickness. They die, and we don't want them to die. We fail an examination that is vital to our future. Our best friend is permanently crippled in an accident. Our child is born with a handicap or is led away by bad companions. Despite our righteous lives and our prayers, the difficult things in life come. In essence, the Lord has said "no" or "not at this time" to our prayers.<br><br>When we are told "no" by the Lord, the Holy Ghost can soften that "no." Elder Boyd K. Packer tells of an incident where he was "invited to speak to a group at Harvard University." He says:<br><br><i>Both faculty members and students were to be present. I, of course, hoped that the gospel message would be accepted and that the meeting would end in a harmony of views. As I prayed that this might result, there came to me the strong impression that this petition would not be granted. I determined that, however preposterous talk about angels and golden plates and restoration might be to my audience, I would teach the truth with quiet confidence, for I have a testimony of the truth. If some must come from the meeting unsettled and disturbed, it would not be</i>me.<i>Let</i>them<i>be disturbed, if they would.</i><br><br><i>It was as the Spirit foretold. Some in the group shook their heads in amazement, even cynical amusement, that anyone could believe such things. But I was at peace. I had taught the truth, and they could accept it or reject it, as they pleased.</i>[Boyd K. Packer,<i>Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991), p. 88; emphasis in original]<br><br>Sometimes the answer is not "no" but "not at this time." We must have patience. The Holy Ghost is not a trained dog to jump through hoops at our demand. The Holy Ghost works in his own way in his own time frame. Some knowledge comes quickly, some is revealed little by little, and some will need to be revealed later--in God's time. Some blessings and healings will come later or even in the next life. Sometimes suffering must come before the comfort. If we are humble and submit ourselves to God's will, we will be comforted and will understand.<br><h2><b>Being Worthy to Receive the Spirit</b></h2><br>For the Holy Ghost to bless our lives, we must be worthy for its influence to be fully realized. I would like to reiterate what has been so masterfully given in many conference talks and<i>Ensign</i>articles--that the gift of the Holy Ghost, that precious gift we receive through baptism and the laying on of hands in confirmation, is only fully in force when we are worthy in mind and body to receive it. It cannot "always be with us" if our thoughts and acts are unclean.<br><br>To be guided properly by the Holy Ghost, we must follow some basic principles. Elder Carlos E. Asay suggests that<br><br><i>we must keep our bodies</i>[and]<i>minds clean. . . . We must</i>[make]<i>a place in our hearts for the Holy Spirit. . . . We must avoid all iniquity, all manner of wickedness. . . . We must pray, feast upon the words of Christ, and walk uprightly before God.</i>["The Companionship of the Holy Ghost,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1988, pp. 15–16]<br><br>We ourselves must be a worthy temple to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. If we are<i>not</i>keeping the covenant we made at baptism and make each week as we partake of the sacrament to "always remember him, and keep his commandments," we cannot expect him to keep his part of the covenant to "always have his Spirit to be with" us (Moroni 4:3). But if we are sincerely trying to keep the covenants, each of us is entitled to help from the Holy Ghost.<br><br>He can help you with your studies--he can help in every aspect of your lives. When your families begin, you young men can receive promptings from the Holy Ghost in guiding your family in righteousness, as did Sister Condie's father. Many of you young women will become mothers. You are entitled to the promptings of the Holy Ghost in guiding your children and blessing your home.<br><br>As a mother, I have been blessed many times. For example, one evening when our oldest son was about twelve years old, he had a slightly upset stomach and a bit of a fever. I put him to bed early, but in the middle of the night I woke suddenly and sat up in bed. "Matt has appendicitis," I told my startled husband. The next morning I took our son in for an examination. By early afternoon Matt was in surgery. The appendix was almost ready to rupture.<br><br>My husband has also had promptings for the safety and blessing of our family. Just before our eldest daughter, Jolynne, left for her mission to Peru, my husband was prompted to give her a priesthood blessing, which miraculously healed a severe eye condition. Recently she told me that her eye doctor can't understand why her eyes have gotten better through the years rather than worse.<br><h2><b>Listening for the Spirit</b></h2><br>What does it mean, "listening for the Spirit"? What does the voice of the Holy Ghost sound like? It can come in several different ways. It can come as a voice in the mind or even as an audible voice. It can come as a voice we can feel that "will tell [us] in [our] mind and in [our] heart" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2). It can create a warm feeling or the burning in the bosom or in the heart (see D&amp;amp;C 9:8) or even a tingling or lightness. Or it can "speak peace to [the] mind" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23). (See Jay E. Jensen, "Have I Received an Answer from the Spirit?"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1989, pp. 20–25.) Different people respond to the Spirit in different ways. And you must learn to recognize it for yourself.<br><br>When the audible voice came to the brothers Lehi and Nephi, it is described in the book of Helaman as<br><br><i>not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul.</i>[Helaman 5:30]<br><br>Marvin J. Ashton once noted, "Small voices are heard only by those who are willing to listen" ("There Are Many Gifts,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 21).<br><br>During the horrifying experience of being attacked by a bear, Michael Dunn felt an impression come to his mind: "play dead" ("Of Bears, Scares, and Prayers,"<i>This People</i>17, no. 3 [fall 1996]: 34). He heeded that voice and was saved from death. From my own experience, I have "heard" in my mind the words "not at this time" and "you already know" in answer to prayer. But "feeling" the words is almost closer to the actual experience. Nephi notes that Laman and Lemuel "could not feel [the Lord's] words" (1 Nephi 17:45). Although Oliver Cowdery was told that his "bosom [would] burn within [him]," he was also told that he would "feel that it is right" (D&amp;amp;C 9:8). The Lord also told him, "I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost" (D&amp;amp;C 8:2). President Ezra Taft Benson noted:<br><br><i>We hear the words of the Lord most often by a feeling. If we are humble and sensitive, the Lord will prompt us through our feelings. That is why spiritual promptings move us on occasion to great joy, sometimes to tears.</i>["Seek the Spirit of the Lord,"<i>Ensign,</i>April 1988, p. 4]<br><br>How do we know that the Holy Ghost is helping us? One of the things we teach in missionary discussions is to recognize what the Holy Ghost feels like. As missionaries speak of the Holy Ghost, they turn to Galatians 5:22–23 and read, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." The missionaries ask the investigator, "Do you feel these things when you listen to our message?" If the Spirit has been there, all in the room usually feel the peace, joy, and love it brings.<br><br>Do we feel peace and joy or other gifts of the Spirit as noted in Galatians when we receive impressions, whisperings, or thoughts that come into our minds? What are the results of our behavior when we act on those whisperings? In other words, what are the fruits of those promptings? Are we bringing joy to others? Are we better people because we have followed the promptings? Are we happier? Do we feel closer to our Father and to Jesus Christ? If we can answer yes, then we know that our promptings are from the right spirit. As we continue to follow those promptings throughout our lives, we learn to truly know what the promptings of the Holy Ghost feel like for us.<br><h2><b>False Voices</b></h2><br>However, we need to guard against false voices. Since the Holy Ghost can be felt in different ways by different people, how can we know for sure it is the Holy Ghost speaking? Elder Packer notes:<br><br><i>Not all inspiration comes from God (see D&amp;amp;C 46:7). The evil one has the power to tap into those channels of revelation and send conflicting signals which can mislead and confuse us. There are promptings from evil sources which are so carefully counterfeited as to deceive even the very elect (see Matthew 24:24). . . .</i><br><br><i>An unusual spiritual experience should not be regarded as a personal call to direct others. . . .</i><br><br><i>Few things disturb the channels of revelation quite so effectively as those who are misled and think themselves to be chosen to instruct others when they are not chosen.</i>[Packer,<i>Let Not Your Heart,</i>pp. 212–13]<br><br>Joseph Smith said that the Saints<br><br><i>can tell the Spirit of the Lord from all other spirits; it will whisper peace and joy to their souls; it will take malice, hatred, strife and all evil from their hearts; and their whole desire will be to do good, bring forth righteousness and build up the kingdom of God.</i>[<i>Manuscript History of Brigham Young: 1846–1847,</i>ed. Elden J. Watson (Salt Lake City: E. J. Watson, 1971), p. 529]<br><br>Our emotions can be tuned to many different responses. I can only use my own experiences as a guide, but for me, the Holy Ghost is a deep, peaceful feeling, a feeling of joy and rightness.<br><br>At times I have thought a feeling of excitement was the Spirit speaking, but I discovered that I was wrong. The voice of the Spirit isn't an excitement buzz. I have found that there is positive excitement and negative excitement. When a positive exciting thing comes--like the birth of a grandchild--with it also comes a deep joy and a spirit of peace. That accompanying joy and peace is<i>not</i>there in the negative excitement. Mob reactions create an electricity that is exciting. Defying the law by robbing, stealing, doing drugs, vandalizing, and even killing are reported to create an exciting high. Excitement in and of itself is not the Holy Ghost creating a feeling in our hearts.<br><br>In a similar way, those who think they are prompted to find the mote in a neighbor's eye are also listening to the wrong spirit. The Holy Ghost will not prompt us to correct our bishop or our General Authorities. We must<i>follow</i>those in authority over us--not fight with their decisions, even if we disagree with the decisions. The Holy Ghost will not prompt us to change the Church. It will not prompt us to tell the person who smells of tobacco to leave campus. The Holy Ghost's promptings are not of censoring. Judgment and correction are given to the proper authorities.<br><br>The voice of the Holy Ghost is also not a voice of anger, even righteous anger--because the voice we are hearing may really be self-righteous anger. The voice of pride or the voice of selfishness are not voices of the Spirit. Yet all of these voices can prompt us. We must carefully consider their fruits. If those fruits do harm, then they are false voices that we must turn off and tune out.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>May I conclude by giving personal witness. I know that God our Father is concerned about each one of us. He is the great designer of the plan of salvation and has given us a savior in Jesus Christ and a teacher, guardian, and comforter in the Holy Ghost. Through the Holy Ghost--through the baptism of the spirit--we are cleansed of our sins. He purifies and sanctifies us as we go through the process of returning to our Father in Heaven. He also is our brother, and he loves us. This wonderful personage, the Holy Ghost, is our infallible guide. I leave this witness with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Sally Taylor was a BYU professor of English when this devotional address was given on 5 November 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
<br>
How I love to come to BYU. I like the crunch of autumn leaves and the Y on the mountain. (I really liked the football game on Saturday.) But most of all, I like seeing you--book bags, bikes, comfortable shoes, and<i>long</i>shorts. I love and admire the good things you are doing. When I look in your faces, it makes me wish that this visit could take place in my kitchen.<br><br>I'd like to begin my message today with a<i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>cartoon by Bill Watterson. Calvin is in the front of a wagon with Hobbes hanging on in the rear. Calvin says, "I thrive on change." Hobbes replies, "You?! You threw a fit this morning because your mom put less jelly on your toast than yesterday!" Then Calvin says, "I thrive on making<i>other</i>people change."<br><br>Most of us like the "idea" of change. I believe that comes from our growth instinct. But in reality, change can cause some discomfort. Throughout our lives, I believe, we will be balancing our need for change--learning and growth--with our other important needs for safety, permanence, and security.<br><br>Today I am going to talk about dealing with change in our lives. Some of you are going through transitions right now that are requiring you to change and causing you some discomfort.<br><br>Because I spend a good deal of time with young people, I have become aware that a time of change can be a time of increased stress and vulnerability. From my vantage point, I've started to see life as a long series of transitions--adjustments that require us to change. Learning to make healthy transitions is a major factor not only in our learning and growth but in our ability to be successful and happy.<br><br>Your transition to greater independence didn't begin when you left home for college. It began when you entered the terrible twos, but back then your parents did most of the changing. You were thriving on making other people change. When the second child is born into a family, the first is displaced and must make some adjustments. When my own children were all in school, we added to our family a Hopi Native American daughter. She shared a room with my youngest daughter, Mary, who was nearly 15. I observed: "No wonder Mary is so well adjusted. She never had to adjust before."<br><br>I am aware of the many adjustments you are making. Listening to college students has taught me that many of<i>your</i>major transitions come in three categories we could call the three M's: moves, missions, and marriage. Some transitions are of your own choosing. Some are not, but each requires some change and adjustment.<br><br>One student reported that his most difficult experience in life was getting married--even though he isn't married yet. Just the thought of getting married, the very possibility, was stressful--scary because of lack of money to take care of a family and, besides, he<i>hates</i>weddings. I had one daughter who hated wedding receptions. I promised she could change into a sweatshirt and jeans at 9:00 p.m. on the night of her wedding reception even if all the guests hadn't yet gone through the line. That was enough security to convince her to go through with her marriage! There is a key in that suggestion. You can build in a feeling of security during change by adding something comfortable and familiar. In this case, for Jane, it was a friendly sweatshirt and jeans. A young child finds security from a favorite blanket or toy when away from home. I've seen a few teddy bears stacked on the luggage at the MTC.<br><br>I know a woman whose family success had allowed them to build a new and lovely home for their large family. They decided to give away all of their much-used and older furnishings and start again with everything new. How wonderful! we say. No, it wasn't. She said she would never do that again. The children felt no permanence or attachment to the new things. Some old broken-in "treasures," a sagging sofa or familiar pictures, may have helped as they adjusted to new friends, new neighbors, and new schools. I'm sure you have found that placing some photos, a journal, even a pillow from home can give you a feeling of connection, a sense of heritage and belonging.<br><br>Moving is always a major transition, and one most of you are experiencing. You must leave the familiar for the unfamiliar. You leave behind also a bit of your identity and have to make a new place for yourself.<br><br>One student said:<br><br><i>I felt so utterly alone and friendless when I came to BYU. I wanted to show my independence and chose to move into a dorm with no one I knew. Suddenly, I wasn't a cocky high school senior. I was a freshman at a large university. I felt so small. A lot of tearful prayers brought me close to my Heavenly Father. I found out that he knew me</i>[here]<i>the same way he had known me in my home. ... I began to sit by people who were sitting by themselves, striking up conversations about goals. I began to have many friends.</i><br><br>Her friends became her support, and she added, "Heavenly Father helped me find them."<br><br>Prayer, which strengthened her relationship with Heavenly Father, gave permanence and security in a time of change.<br><br>My counselor in the Young Women presidency, Bonnie D. Parkin, related the experience she had when she went away to college. She has given me permission to share her story. Sister Parkin said:<br><br><i>I remember in 1959 leaving my home in Herriman, Utah, to attend school at Utah State University. I hadn't been there many days when I became so homesick I was physically ill, and I feared my heart was going to break.</i>[Some of you may know what that feels like.]<i>Worse, I was at the same university that my brother and sister were attending, and yet all I wanted to do was go back to the safety of home, back to the gruff but tender care of my dad, back to the gentle arms of my mother in her warm kitchen. Finally,</i>[the adjustment]<i>was too great, and I found a ride to Herriman. I felt desperately alone as I hugged the passenger door as we were driving past our small school and old ward house. Finally I saw the sign for Dansie's Place--the little store my parents ran on the side of the road. I was home.</i><br><br><i>My parents were, of course, surprised to see me on their doorstep. I was just relieved to see them. I sat with my dad, who was in his big brown leather chair, and sobbed, recounting my heartaches and isolation so many miles away.</i><br><br><i>My dad was a farmer, a tough but tender man. Having served a mission in the depression, he knew something about hardships. . . . He could have rushed to counsel me or called me weak, yet he just listened and held me and finally said, "You don't have to go back if you don't want to."</i><br><br><i>Now, as a parent, I know in his heart he was hoping that I would go back--but he was not going to berate me or force me. He was going to let me decide.</i><br><br>Then Sister Parkin said:<br><br><i>I'm sure that at some time long past our Father sat with us in a big celestial chair and said, "You don't have to go if you don't want to." But I know he wanted us to go. ... We chose to leave him.</i><br><br><i>Knowing I could choose somehow freed me to decide I could return to school. I recognized that the pain and growing would surely continue in many forms, but I also recognized that miles away, in a big leather chair, sat my father, thinking of me, hoping the highest for me, simply loving me.</i><br><br>A strong and capable person learns to make difficult choices in times of transition. I have learned from experience and from listening to you how important it is to have someone to talk to when we are adjusting to change. Sometimes when we are trying to help others who are struggling, it's easy to make the mistake of giving too much advice. Heavenly Father gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason. He wants us to listen twice as much as we talk. Understanding takes listening. As one student said, "My parents and family had a tendency to do a lot of talking in order to make me feel better, but what I really wanted was just someone to listen and show love."<br><br>How many of you are returned missionaries? In a report of Campus Education Week, BYU professor Garth Hanson talked about the vulnerability of a missionary as he or she returns from a full-time mission. That is a major transition. Many of you are having that experience. He gave some suggestions to missionaries that could be helpful to all of us in times of change. He suggested that each person needs a board of directors. You need people you trust to whom you can turn for advice. These mentors may include parents, a bishop, someone in your chosen field, a teacher, a friend, or other returned missionaries. Make a conscious effort to have a group of resource people with whom you feel secure.<br><br>I think of my husband as I recall his service as a mission president in Canada. He said he has since learned that his most valuable service as a mission president was in the 10 or 15 years after his mission was completed. In these important years, returning missionaries--young men and young women--need a mentor who knows them, loves them, and understands them. These are the years that you are getting yourselves established in your lives with education, choice of mates, and the important choices of work and family.<br><br>One ability that can help any of us in a time of transition is the ability to build a support system. Look for credible mentors who not only listen and understand but can also enlarge your perspective. Sometimes you need someone who can help you consider new options.<br><br>Coming home from a mission may involve some grieving not unlike losing a loved one. Loss of relationships--companions, missionaries, and mission leaders--is a change; but the loss of relationships with investigators and members in a distant land may feel like a more permanent loss. Grieving involves some pain. Talk about it. Write about it. Consider our Heavenly Father's perspective. Perhaps he may be thinking, "How wonderful that you have learned to care so much for others who were different from you. This will help you be a more caring person in all of your future experiences." Your growth will continue, but growth sometimes feels like a loss!<br><br>Professor Hanson, in speaking of missionaries, suggested that when you get home you continue the mission rules. (I can hear your first reaction: "No way.") Good habits can become a part of ourselves that give a feeling of permanence and security no matter where we are.<br><br>May I give the example of a prominent Church and community leader, a successful businessman? As I give this man's experience, you may want to think of your own life and decide if there are any changes you want to make. A transition is a great time to choose to make positive changes. You can let go of some bad habits and hang on to the good ones. A transition does more than take us from one location to another. It can take us from one behavior to another.<br><br>The person in my example said he had a poor tradition for education. He gained his identity when he was young from goofing off and entertaining his friends. He said he missed many of the fundamentals of education, and as he went to junior high and high school, he formed a habit of "cram and survive." There was always tremendous stress for him as he tried to move along with his friends in an academic setting. There were beginning to be great deficits in his early preparation.<br><br>After high school this young man decided to go on a mission. He had a mission president who helped him develop his potential. He taught him about discipline and order. It gave him a fresh start. As he followed the mission rules and worked hard, he saw results.<br><br>The transition after his mission to university life was a difficult one. He felt as if he were falling back into a hole. He didn't want to lose what he had gained, so he decided to make a plan and make rules for himself. As he made the transition to a university life, he made the following four commitments:<br><br>First, he would never go to class unprepared.<br><br>Second, he would review, type, or rewrite notes after each class and before the next class.<br><br>Third, he would study with someone smarter than himself. He found a real advantage in study groups because he found it kept him focused on class preparation. It helped him anticipate tests and rehearse possible questions and answers. It also helped him enlarge his own point of view.<br><br>Fourth was his commitment to consult his professor if he felt he was struggling. He would offer to repeat assignments or do extra assignments until he mastered the fundamentals. This young man said he was amazed at how quickly he became a top student. Learning from mission rules, he learned to set standards for himself that carried him not only through a successful student life in the university but through a very successful and productive life in the Church and community thereafter.<br><br>I really like the idea of a transition being a time we can choose to change our behavior for the better. This change for the better doesn't always happen. Remember the children of Israel who were led by the prophet Moses out of bondage in Egypt? They were left wandering in the wilderness because they could not let go of the behavior that kept them enslaved. This is such a good time in your life to let go of behaviors that would keep you in bondage.<br><br>I would like to use an example that may apply to some of you. You will know the things in your own behavior that you want to consider changing. I make this one suggestion because I love you and I care about your future: Let go of crude language if you have let swearing become a part of your vocabulary. Fill your minds instead with the magnificent words that are available to you in this university.<br><br>When I hear swearing or crude language in public places, I think of that dangerous transition between elementary school and junior high school. Sometimes 12–13-year-olds start to spill out harsh words in an effort to protect themselves. Aggressive and unbecoming language becomes like a barbed wire fence wrapped around an inexperienced child. If that happened to you in your growing-up years, let go of that bad habit. Transitions can allow us to modify our behavior in ways that better prepare us and better equip us.<br><br>When I think of great words, I think of our prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley. He is an example of one who invested in great words throughout the many transitions of his life. His tremendous capacity has come through a lifetime of experiences not unlike your own. He lost a parent at an early age, struggled to get an education during the depression, and went on a mission. He experienced moves, mission, and marriage. He raised a family while carrying heavy responsibilities and has traveled extensively throughout the world. As he visits comfortably with the kings, queens, presidents, and leaders throughout the world, it is obvious that his commitment to great words and thoughts has become a part of him and has become a constant through the transitions of his life. Some of you heard him say at the groundbreaking for the Harold B. Lee Library addition, "What a marvelous thing is a book." Also, in a recent Relief Society lesson, I heard President Hinckley quoted:<br><br><i>When I was a boy we lived in a large old house. One room was called the library. . . .</i><br><br><i>There was quiet in that room. It was understood that it was a place to study. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . There was no television, of course, at that time. Radio came along while I was growing up. But there was an environment, an environment of learning. I would not have you believe that we were great scholars. But we were exposed to great literature, great ideas from great thinkers, and the language of men and women who thought deeply and wrote beautifully.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Environment of Our Homes,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1985, p. 4]<br><br>He added that not all homes can have a library. Your apartments may have little private space, but he said there can be an area that becomes something of a hideaway from the noises around us where one can sit and read and think. During this time of transition for you, let go of any words in your vocabulary that are unbecoming and follow the example of President Hinckley, who prepared himself by giving permanence in his mind to the words and wisdom of great writers. Times of transition can allow you to make changes through positive choices.<br><br>Some of the transitions we go through are not of our own choosing. These transitions are often characterized by a feeling of loss. Sometimes it is the loss of something we expected. Sometimes the loss is very tangible.<br><br>One student told of a very traumatic move just before starting high school. She said, "That move ended up being the best thing that could have happened to me."<br><br>One student returned from a mission full of optimism about the future to find his parents going through a divorce. The missionary said, "It was a contradiction to all I had hoped to be true."<br><br>Another student moved not to a new town but to a wheelchair.<br><br>One thing we can all learn is that with time and perspective much growth and spirituality can come from transitions, and that is gratifying to know. One student said, "With my parents' divorce, it has strengthened me to know how important it is to keep a family together." Even in difficult transitions we can learn important lessons that will help our own future choices.<br><br>For some, the postmission transition is the beginning of the premarriage transition because you feel "marriage pressure." As one who has been single twice and married twice, I learned in each case I could be a normal and happy person if I made the necessary adjustments--but I remember the pressure. When I was 18, my grandmother would say in a feeble voice (it is the only time she used a feeble voice), "Janette, I hope you get married before I die." She lived to be 97, long after I married, so she had plenty of time to pressure my cousins, too!<br><br>When the time is right for your marriage, it will be a time of transition. The book of Abraham states, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (Abraham 5:18).<i>Leave</i>means some letting go;<i>cleave</i>means holding onto a new and unique one-on-one sacred relationship.<br><br>When one student got married, she reported feeling a loss of single friends--a normal feeling for one who has had close roommates and good friendships. Fortunately they are not lost, but the relationships will change and mature.<br><br>Some years ago my daughter said her husband felt he lost his sister when he got married. They had been close, and she withdrew a little so she wouldn't interfere with his marriage. The loss was a temporary one and helped a healthy marriage transition. Their good visits have resumed, to the delight of my daughter, who also enjoys long-distance chats with her own brother.<br><br>I remember mourning the loss of college life when I got married just before my senior year at BYU. My husband was in graduate school, so we moved. Our budget didn't allow two tuitions at once. My graduation came after five children. It is true that a few tears followed my honeymoon, but I knew the decision was the right one for me, and I was learning about transitions--letting go and holding on.<br><br>When my husband died in 1988, I remember saying to myself, "Heavenly Father thinks I can do this." With that heartbreaking disappointment I asked myself, "What do I do when my first choice isn't one of the options?" Making an action plan often helps in a time of change. Even increasing physical exercise can help. I have learned, as you have, that we can't go back to the past. As one student was learning to live on her own, she said, "I realized I would never again be my parents' 'little girl.'" She experienced a feeling of loss but also a new beginning and a time of growth.<br><br>We should be particularly mindful of one another in times of transition. One student said that the most difficult part of a transition, besides the uncertainty about the future, is the lack of caring and empathy from others.<br><br>While I was visiting my son one summer, a ward member related an insightful interpretation of the parable of the Good Samaritan. You remember in Luke that a certain lawyer had asked the Master what he must do to inherit eternal life. After being told, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart ... ; and thy neighbour as thyself," the man asked, "Who is my neighbour?" Jesus told of the man stripped of his raiment who was left wounded, even half dead. Those who might have helped passed him by. In this interpretation the Good Samaritan who rendered service is our Savior, Jesus Christ. It was he who was unaccepted, even despised, by the Jewish people. We then are the wounded. He picks us up and ministers to our wounds and then takes us to an inn. He lingers long enough to be sure there are others to assume our care. He compensates the host for his effort. And then come my favorite words: "Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee." In other words, whatever it takes to help those in need, it is not too much; when our Savior comes again he will repay the debt (see Luke 10:25–35).<br><br>Many of us have had a time in our lives when we felt stripped of our security, left alone, even wounded. Many, too, can testify that in times of real difficulty they feel surprisingly supported, even suspended, in warmth and love. Then gradually that feeling of support starts to leave. It could be a letdown, but perhaps this can be a reminder that a time of healing is a temporary time, and soon we need to start taking more responsibility for ourselves.<br><br>The inn is a wonderful symbol. It is a temporary place--a place of transition. How many of us, especially if things aren't going well, would like to take up permanent residence as a guest of life, always expecting others to take care of us? But if we were to make that choice, we would not as likely realize our potential or reach that destination of eternal life. No matter what our past experience, it is important to realize that we must prepare to move on.<br><br>After a major change in our lives, the journey seems different, even dangerous. Perhaps loving, even trusting others, is too much risk. Gradually we learn that experience, even difficult experience, can increase our appreciation and our ability to understand and to care for others. Difficult experiences can also increase our capacity to work and deal with challenges.<br><br>As we are learning, I believe we all have times that we yearn for that perfect environment when we were with our Heavenly Father. Remember, we will return to him by moving forward, not backward, and in the process we will become changed. Our transitions make possible that change.<br><br>Every transition, every change, gives us a chance to choose again to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in the principles of his gospel.<br><br>Lehi's vision of the tree of life is a reminder of the important elements of healthy transitions. First we must fix in our minds and hearts the destination: the tree of life, eternal life--the perfect "love of God."<br><br>As you study for your Book of Mormon class, review chapters 8 and 11 of 1 Nephi. When we think of the path to eternal life described by Lehi, we see that transitions are an important part of the journey. In chapter 8, Lehi states:<br><br><i>I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste.</i><br><br><i>And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord....</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious field.</i>[1 Nephi 8:7–8]<br><br>Prayer was the constant in this time of transition in Lehi's vision. He received understanding as he moved along and after he prayed for help. Nephi's understanding came also after he had prayed to know what his father Lehi had seen. Prayer and our relationship with our Heavenly Father can be constants during every transition of our lives. The other major constant in Lehi's vision is the rod of iron, or word of God. Without those constant sources of help--prayer and the words of our Heavenly Father--we might be fooled, as were the people in Lehi's vision. The large and spacious building represents the world and the pride therein. As these scriptures describe that large and spacious building and the behavior of those inside, we do not doubt it is filled with things familiar that give temporary comfort, but the people inside have lost sight of their destination.<br><br>Hold fast to the iron rod, the words of Heavenly Father, and keep your minds focused on your destination. It takes inspiration to be able to adapt without compromising your spiritual integrity. When I think of the iron rod, I think of the counsel of the apostle Paul: "Cleave to that which is good" (Romans 12:9). Paul must have understood times of change and transition. In Romans 12:2 Paul gives great counsel applicable to us here: "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."<br><br>There is security in God's promises to us. According to Isaiah, the Lord has promised to the house of Israel: "Fear thou not; for I am with thee. ... For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand ...; I will help thee" (Isaiah 41:10, 13).<br><br>You are attending Brigham Young University, which has as its foundation the gospel of Jesus Christ. Most of you have made promises, even covenants, with the promise of eternal blessings. How grateful we can be for the atonement of Jesus Christ. It is that gift that allows us to change. We can let go of those things that would hold us down or keep us captive. As we make transitions in our lives, may we forgive, forget, and repent of those things that would keep us from our destination. As we go through transitions and move toward our goals, may we keep our focus on that ultimate destination, which is eternal life. This my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janette Hales Beckham was the Young Women general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 12 November 1996.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> Also Ought to Retain in Remembrance&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is good to be at Brigham Young University. There is a legacy of faith that I think everyone feels who comes here.<br><br>I would like to speak today about heritage. Certainly 1996 and 1997 are years of heritage from a Church point of view. The year 1996 marks the 150th anniversary of the Saints arriving in California, and 1997 marks the same anniversary of the Saints arriving in the Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>At the opening of this devotional we heard the hymn<i>High on the Mountain Top,</i>which is a good pioneer heritage hymn--the first words being "High on the mountain top / A banner is unfurled" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/high-on-the-mountain-top?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;"><i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 5</span></a>). This has reference to the banner unfurled in the tops of the mountains as a signal to the nations of the world that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. From our Church history we learn this is the reason Ensign Peak, a small round peak at the north end of the Salt Lake Valley, got its name.<br><br>Prior to the time the Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred, he and Hyrum crossed the Mississippi River with the intent of coming west. He asked the Relief Society to sew a flag for him that would be a banner he would take with him in fulfillment of the commission that a banner would be unfurled in the tops of the mountains. The Prophet was encouraged by those with him to not go west but to come back. He did so and eventually went to Carthage. Of course, that is where he met his death. As near as we can determine, the flag was never sewn. However, the Prophet Joseph, we are told from various historical sources, appeared to Brigham Young in vision after Joseph's martyrdom and before they arrived in the West. From a hill to the north, he showed President Brigham Young the valley.<br><br>When Brigham Young arrived at his destination and before he chose the site for the Salt Lake Temple, he asked to go to the top of what is now Ensign Peak. There he surveyed the valley that appeared to be a sort of confirmation of what he had seen in vision. (See William Hepworth Dixon,<i>New America</i>[London: Hurst and Blackett, Publishers, 1867] 1:186–87;<i>JD</i>13:85–86; Junius F. Wells, "Brigham Young's Prevision of Salt Lake Valley," The Christmas News section,<i>Deseret News,</i>20 December 1924, p. 17.) It was after this that he designated the location of the temple. He also moved the center of the community north from where it originally was up next to the temple site.<br><br>In the 24th of July celebrations of the early Saints the next two or three years, we know that flags were flown from Ensign Peak as a symbol of the banner that would be unfurled (see Council Meeting, 26 February 1847, Thomas Bullock minutes, in Archives, Historical Department, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City).<br><br>Today Ensign Peak has been designated as a historic site and nature park, in honor of the sesquicentennial of the Saints coming into Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>And so it is appropriate to speak of heritage at this time.<br><br>One historical event not well known in the Church is the voyage of a courageous band of Saints who sailed from New York City to San Francisco on the ship<i>Brooklyn.</i>This year marks the 150th anniversary of the journey of the<i>Brooklyn,</i>as it arrived in San Francisco Bay on July 31, 1846. On July 29 and 30 of this year, the Tabernacle Choir performed in the Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco in commemoration of this anniversary, and there were other related activities sponsored by the public affairs councils in Northern California.<br><br>I accompanied Elder David B. Haight and Sister Haight to this celebration. The Haights, of course, are much loved in California, having spent many years there before being called into Church leadership. As the choir performed so magnificently, seated with Elder Haight was Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, and I was seated next to Mayor Elihu Harris of Oakland. The choir's performance caught the interest of not only the audience but these two mayors. The choir sang an encore number of "San Francisco, Open Your Golden Gate" and "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" that brought Mayor Brown out of his seat. It was a wonderful celebration.<br><br>The voyage of the<i>Brooklyn</i>was, perhaps, the longest continuous sea journey of any religious organization in history. It took six months and covered 24,000 miles. The Israelites crossed the Red Sea on their way to Canaan. The Pilgrims of 1620 crossed the Atlantic, a voyage of about 3,000 miles, and were on the water 63 days. The Saints on the<i>Brooklyn</i>crossed the equator on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, went from the icy Antarctic to the tropical Hawaiian Islands and then to California. There were 120 Puritan Pilgrims, whereas the<i>Brooklyn</i>Saints numbered approximately 240. The two groups were alike in many respects in that they were predominately young people with small children. They had dauntless courage, matchless faith, and an abiding trust in God.<br><br>After the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1844, the persecution of the Saints continued and so did the plans of Church authorities to leave Nauvoo and to move west, there to establish themselves in the wilderness of what they referred to as "The Upper California," which at that time included the Great Basin.<br><br>About the same time, Church authorities decided that members living in New England and the Atlantic seaboard who didn't have the finances to go overland should pool their money and charter a ship. Orson Pratt of the Council of the Twelve went to New York to help organize the expedition.<br><br>Samuel Brannan, who was a printer from New York, was chosen as leader of the group, and he was also authorized to charter the sailing vessel. By combining their resources, the Saints were able to secure the 370-ton vessel<i>Brooklyn</i>under the command of Captain Richardson. The charge for the ship was $1,200 per month if they would furnish all their own provisions and if the men would handle the cargo. The captain of the ship ordered the space between decks converted into living quarters. A long table, backless benches, and sleeping cubicles with bunks were built, and all were securely bolted to the deck.<br><br>They sailed on February 4, 1846, which also happened to be the same day that the Saints began leaving Nauvoo. There were approximately 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children living in cramped quarters with low ceilings where only the children could stand upright. Most everyone suffered from seasickness. Storms in the Atlantic blew them almost to the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa. Storms battered them around the Horn. Scurvy was prevalent, and the water supply dwindled as they made their way north toward Valparaiso, Chile. Gale winds actually blew them back into Antarctic waters and out into the Juan Fernández Islands, made famous by Defoe in<i>Robinson Crusoe.</i>Here a young mother of seven was buried in what could have been the first LDS service held in the Southern Hemisphere. She had been thrown down a hatchway in a storm and died of her injuries. After five days' rest, the little group of pioneers sailed for Hawaii.<br><br>The<i>Brooklyn</i>stopped in Honolulu long enough to unload its cargo from New York. The passengers attended church services with missionaries who were serving there. They met Commodore Stockton, who informed them that the United States and Mexico were at war. He advised them to buy guns and ammunition and that Brannan should organize his men into military companies and drill them. They drilled all the way to California.<br><br>It took the Saints six weeks to travel from Honolulu to California. When they entered the Bay of San Francisco, which then was Yerba Buena, it was shrouded in fog, which, of course, is characteristic of San Francisco Bay even to this day. When the fog lifted, they were happy to see the Stars and Stripes flying. They would not have to fight. The passengers of the<i>Brooklyn</i>were the first colonists under the American flag. It was July 31, 1846. They had been at sea for nearly six months. Twelve deaths had occurred on the long trip. One boy, John Atlantic Burr, and one girl, Georgiana Pacific Robbins, were born at sea.<br><br>Yerba Buena was composed of nine dwellings and lay in the sand hills. The Saints faced the hardships of settlement in a raw, undeveloped land. The landing of the<i>Brooklyn</i>Saints doubled the population of Yerba Buena, which was renamed San Francisco six months later.<br><br>This band of pioneers established a number of firsts. The first school in California, where English was taught, was opened by Angelina Lovitt in an outbuilding of the deserted Mission Dolores.<i>The California Star</i>was the first newspaper in San Francisco, and Sam Brannan was its publisher. Twenty pioneers from the<i>Brooklyn</i>founded the first known agricultural colony in the San Joaquin Valley, called it New Hope, and planted the first wheat. Many went to work for John Sutter on his lands in the Sacramento Valley. Some of them were present when gold was discovered, and many went to the goldfields. Some of the<i>Brooklyn</i>Saints joined forces with the Mormon Battalion men who had been released from their service and were making their way back to Utah. Some remained in the Bay Area. They built the first public school in California. They established a ferry that served Fremont, San Francisco, and Sacramento. They founded a township named Brooklyn, which was later incorporated into the city of Oakland. Others began farming near Mission San Jose and in southern Alameda County. Some settled as far away as San Bernardino.<br><br>It is certainly proper for us to recognize and salute the Saints of the<i>Brooklyn</i>who came to California. Theirs was a journey that probably contained as many hardships as were encountered by most of the pioneers who came overland. Let us look in on one journal entry from this band of pioneers. This is an excerpt from a letter written by Mary Holland Sparks (1821–98) to Maria Clark dated November 15, 1846, some four months after they arrived at Yerba Buena. We pick up the account in the middle of the letter speaking of the sea voyage.<br><br><i>Then the wind began to blow. The ship began to roll and pitch. The sea broke over the sides of the ship. The water came down into the cabin in torrents some of the time. The captain came down into the cabin and said that he had done all that he could. The sails were all taken in and no one at the helm.</i><br><br>We now pick up another account of the captain's conversation. He said:<br><br><i>"My friends, there is a time in every man's life when it is fitting that he should prepare to die. That time has come to us, and unless God interposes, we shall all go to the bottom; I have done all in my power, but this is the worst gale I have known since I was master of a ship."</i><br><br><i>One woman ... answered him: "Captain Richardson, we left for California and we shall get there." ... The captain gazed upon them in mute surprise and left them. As he went upstairs he exclaimed, "these people have a faith that I have not," and added, to a gentleman: "They are either fools and fear nothing, or they know more than I do."</i>[Augusta Joyce Crocheron, "The Ship<i>Brooklyn," Western Galaxy</i>1 (March 1988): 81]<br><br>Returning to Mary Sparks' account:<br><br><i>Most all were seasick except myself and a few others. Mother was quite seasick. A few days after, I was taken sick with the canker and was sick almost all the voyage. And little Quartus had two spells of sickness. The last time he was sick, it seemed as though we should have to give him up. All remedies seemed to fail until we got some of the tincture of rhubarb, which soon relieved him.</i><br><br><i>But about the journey. The weather was very ... cold around Cape Horn. We had good luck getting around the Cape, intending to stop at Valparaiso but could not get in on account of a very bad storm of rain and wind. But sailed on until we came to the island of Juan Fernandez, the former home of Robinson Crusoe, finding only eight inhabitants living in caves. ... We then set sail for the Sandwich Islands</i>[Hawaii]<i>where we arrived in about four weeks, finding quite a city where the King resided. Mr. Brannan was invited to preach in one of the churches where we attended meeting. Was treated with great respect. Got almost all kinds of fruit such as watermelon, mushrooms, pineapples, grapes and bananas. ... Stayed about two weeks. We then set sail for California. Was about five weeks from Sandwich Islands and then we came in sight of the shores of California. Sailed up the Francisco Bay until we came in sight of a beautiful village on the shore where we landed.</i>[Letter from Mary Holland Sparks to Maria Clark, 15 November 1846, in Archives, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City; spelling has been corrected]<br><br>These intrepid pioneers of the<i>Brooklyn</i>certainly made their mark on this long sea journey from New York. They were inspired by their faith in Jesus Christ and in the restored gospel.<br><br>As we honor those who have gone on before us and as we pass on our own heritage to our children and grandchildren, this is best accomplished by keeping alive our spiritual heritage. This would include the heritage of our Church as well as the heritage and experiences that we have as individuals and in each of our families. Whether our ancestry is in the Church for five generations or we were baptized yesterday, there are those who went ahead and made the sacrifices and showed the faith and determination that brought us where we are today. They should be remembered and honored so that same faith and heritage can be passed on to the next generation.<br><br>Some time ago I went through the Book of Mormon and counted more than 220 verses where spiritual heritage was used as a means of preparing the hearts of the people to receive the doctrines. Listen to this from Alma:<br><br><i>And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?</i>[Alma 9:10]<br><br>That message could have been taken out of our own Church history.<br><br><i>Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity.</i>[Alma 36:29]<br><br>In each case, this approach was used to lay a foundation of faith.<br><br>This making reference to heritage was also used by the Prophet Joseph Smith. On June 8, 1830, Joseph convened the first general conference of the Church. In that meeting were five elders, three priests, and two teachers. The priesthood of the Church would not have filled up the front row here on the stand. To show the importance of the Aaronic Priesthood, the priests in that meeting were Martin Harris, Hyrum Smith, and Joseph Smith, Sr.<br><br>Joseph convened the meeting by reading the articles and covenants of the Church, which became a pattern for the conferences thereafter. These articles and covenants consisted of section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants. He was harkening back to the spiritual foundation of the Church to make sure they stayed on course.<br><br>You will notice that the opening verses of section 20 tell of the divine organization of the Church and the role of the prophet. I have always felt our mission as members of the Church is to know enough of the history of the Restoration to teach fundamental principles and to bear testimony of the sacred work of the Prophet Joseph. Certainly to teach our heritage to those who come after us is a way of developing and maintaining faith by passing on our spiritual heritage to yet another generation as well as teaching the gospel to the world. But this is not all. Your own personal experiences should be remembered and recorded for the sake of those who come after you. This is true whether you are just starting out or well established in life. Said President Gordon B. Hinckley:<br><br><i>It is good to look to the past to gain appreciation for the present and perspective for the future. It is good to look upon the virtues of those who have gone before, to gain strength for whatever lies ahead. It is good to reflect upon the work of those who labored so hard and gained so little in this world, but out of whose dreams and early plans, so well nurtured, has come a great harvest of which we are the beneficiaries. Their tremendous example can become a compelling motivation for us all, for each of us is a pioneer in his own life, often in his own family, and many of us pioneer daily in trying to establish a gospel foothold in distant parts of the world.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1984/07/the-faith-of-the-pioneers?lang=eng"><span style="color: #33cccc;">The Faith of the Pioneers,</span></a>"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1984, p. 3]<br><br>I would like to finish today by recounting an experience in early Church history having to do with Israel Barlow. He was one of those who went up the Mississippi River from Quincy and helped scout out the area that later became Nauvoo. He lived in Nauvoo and came west with the Saints as one of the early pioneers. In the early 1850s he was attending a general conference of the Church.<br><br>It was in that meeting that Israel Barlow heard his name mentioned from the pulpit. In those days, this was how the brethren were called on missions. Israel Barlow was called on a mission to Great Britain. He didn't have to have an interview. He didn't have to have a medical examination. He was called to go on a mission. He had a family and was just getting started in his new area, so it was no small sacrifice to answer the call from the presidency of the Church. But he had enough faith that this was what he knew he must do. His wife was supportive of him, but she asked him for one favor on his way to the mission field. Would he stop at their old farm in Nauvoo and find where they had buried their firstborn child and remove the grave to the Old Nauvoo Burial Ground? He said he would do this, and he made his way back across the Mississippi River and came up to Nauvoo.<br><br>He went to the farm and got the permission of the people who lived there to look for and move the grave. He said that at first he could not find it, but then he located it because his wife had planted ground cover around it. When he dug down, he felt that the grave was in such a condition that it could not be moved. According to his journal, he said to himself that he would leave it to the morning of the first resurrection and hoped that his wife would understand. As he turned away to continue his journey up the river and on to Great Britain, he turned back one more time just to be sure that he had made the right decision. He again felt that nothing more could be done, and as he turned away again he said that words came into his mind so clear that he knew he had not put them there. These words were, "Daddy, don't leave me here!" He said he stopped and took the necessary time and effort to move the grave of his firstborn child to the Old Nauvoo Burial Ground.<br><br>After he had completed the work, he said that he spent some time by the grave feeling this bond between himself and his firstborn child before he left, not knowing if he would return. To our knowledge, he never did return to the site. (See Ora H. Barlow,<i>The Israel Barlow Story and Mormon Mores</i>[Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1968], pp. 300–308.)<br><br>There is quite a message in the expression "Daddy, don't leave me here!" I feel that with the recent celebration in San Francisco the voyage of the<i>Brooklyn</i>Saints has been lifted from just a footnote of Church history to the position that it probably deserves. The faithful Saints who came on that ship deserve such attention. It is as if those who have written that chapter of Church history were saying to us, "Don't leave us here. Don't forget us."<br><br>And so it is with all of us as we remember our own heritage, as we remember the heritage of the Church, and as we pass it on to those who come after us and build their faith, just as our faith has been built because of the steadfastness of those who have gone on before us. Each of us is on his or her own sea voyage. Our steadfastness in finishing the voyage and just living from day to day the way we should live will leave a great heritage.<br><br>For the Book of Mormon people, it was the heritage of Moses leading the camp of Israel out of Egypt and into the promised land and Lehi and his family coming over the ocean. For Latter-day Saints, it is a young boy going into a grove of trees and, in an answer to faithful prayer, having God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ appear to him and speak to him. And then, through succeeding revelations and visions, it is having the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ restored with the priesthood, the authority, the covenants, and all that we enjoy today in the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is our heritage, and this was the heritage they sacrificed so much to establish. That heritage includes a thousand personal sacrifices taken from the lives of each member and deserves to live on for the sake of those who come after us. Like us, these early Saints knew the restored gospel was true and that there were living apostles and prophets. They were willing to sacrifice for that sacred knowledge.<br><br>I bear you my witness that there is a God in heaven and that he lives. I know God lives. I know that Jesus Christ is our Savior and our Redeemer. I know that Joseph Smith was a true prophet and that Gordon B. Hinckley is a prophet today. I know that this is the church of Jesus Christ and that the Book of Mormon is true.<br><br>May the Lord bless us that we may honor our heritage and pass the gift of faith to the generations who follow us. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Loren C.

<h1>gy and Society: Reflections - Robert W. Lucky - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for coming out to hear me this morning. I appreciate your attendance, and I hope to make it worth your while. This is a marvelous setting--it makes me want to be reincarnated as a basketball player and hear the cheers of the crowd as I dunk the ball. But I'm afraid that wasn't to be my lot.<br><br>I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and as a child you often wonder what adults do. You form opinions based on those adults you see around you. On my street--I lived on a dead-end street at the outskirts of the suburbs--they kept building new houses. I would see carpenters working, and when they'd leave at night, the house would have come up that much more and you could see what they had done. At the end of my street was a farm, and I saw the farmer growing things. I saw him harvesting what he had grown. And I came to believe that adults made things and they grew things.<br><br>One day, as an adult, I looked around and I realized that I don't know a single person who makes a single thing. I don't know a single person who grows anything. Everybody I know makes their living exchanging information. It is marvelous that it is all possible. We're living in an information world.<br><br>When I was in high school I worked in the U.S. Steel mill outside Pittsburgh. It was the largest steel mill in the world, and the experiences that I had in that summer were overwhelming to the senses. Molten ingots would flow by on automated rails, glowing orange. Then, a few seconds later, you would feel the wave of heat sweep over you. There was clamor constantly--near the auditory threshold of pain. There was soot in the air and in my nose, and the taste was in my mouth. My senses were overwhelmed.<br><br>Last year I visited the Microsoft company store in Redmond, and I looked at the company products--all in a line about twelve feet long, cardboard boxes filled with almost nothing. That was their entire product line. I looked at those boxes and thought, "That company is worth more than any company in the world right now, and their sole product weighs nothing, consumes no space--it's just those bits." At the company store, by the way, everything was $10--every software program that they had. I said, "I wish I were an employee and I could buy these things for this price."<br><br>One of the executives was telling me, "Do you know we still make a profit at $10?"<br><br>It's a frightening thought, but those cardboard boxes are worth more than General Motors, more than U.S. Steel. The steel mill I worked at so many years ago is now a deserted place, a junk pile.<br><br>Well, the world is getting changed into bits. Now there are two effects and their implications that I want to talk about here. One is the world changing from atoms into bits: the atoms of that steel mill to the bits of Microsoft. The other is that the world is becoming very connected.<br><br>These two effects are profoundly changing everything that the world is all about. And there are two laws here that I want to mention. When we look at the technology side of this, the most fundamental law is Moore's Law. Probably a lot of you have heard of Moore's Law, but some of you have not.<br><br>Gordon Moore is a retired engineer. He's a very soft-spoken, mild man. I think you'd like him a lot. You would never realize that he founded Intel and became a giant of industry. He's a very self-effacing individual. About 25 years ago he founded Intel, and about 20 years ago he proclaimed what has become known as Moore's Law. It's not a law at all; it's actually an observation. The observation is that digital technology, electronics technology, gets twice as good every 18 months. Now that means that transistors shrink, they get half the size, they get cheaper, they work faster, they cost less. That is an exponential thing, compounded. So in 15 years it's a factor of a thousand. Moore's Law tells us something about the way the world works. The transistors and all of the electronics technology get more and more and more powerful. So the laptop computer you buy this week will be obsolete next year, and you'll have to buy another one. Hey! That's great, isn't it--for the industry. This is a fundamental observation, and it has held exactly true over this long period and will go on for some time into the future.<br><br>This guarantees you that your life is going to get more complex. The complexity is mounting. The things we are doing are going to be more and more powerful--and more and more complex. This will be a burden to you in many ways. I remember when VCRs were very simple, and I used to laugh at the joke about the flashing 12:00. But now I've got two in my house that are flashing 12:00. You know, they've made them simple, yet somehow they've made them almost unworkable. But you're guaranteed that they'll become more complicated as time goes along, because that is the way the world works.<br><br>Now, another law about connectedness, about how the world is becoming more intertwined and connected. It's known as Metcalfe's Law. Actually, I'm a little jealous because I was talking about it long before it became Metcalfe's Law--probably so were a lot of other people. But a journalist, George Gilder, wrote about it in terms of Metcalfe's Law, and that's what it came to be. Metcalfe's Law is that the value of a network increases with the square of the number of users. This is why the Internet and the Web have suddenly become so important because their value is exploding as the size grows.<br><br>To give you a feel for that, I remember when it first became very clear to me that this is what was going on. I was on a federal advisory committee for the Internet quite a few years ago. We were asked to rule on the issue of whether Brazil was to be allowed to use the Internet, which at that time was subsidized by the U.S. government.<br><br>I said, "Of course not. It's paid for by U.S. tax dollars. Why give Brazil a free ride on this?"<br><br>Then we started arguing and I started realizing that when Brazil comes onto a network, they don't just use the network, they bring themselves. They bring what they know. They bring their culture. They bring value. They bring connections. They bring themselves. And that's the way a network works. Every time someone joins a network, they bring value to the network. And so the value of the network to everybody tends to explode.<br><br>By the way, as an aside, I had lunch with Bob Metcalfe (who this law is named after) earlier this year. I said, "Bob, you know, you've done a lot of things in your life that I've admired, and mostly you invented ethernet." Ethernet is a local area network that most of your computers are connected to here.<br><br>Then I said, "That's great, but the thing that you've done that I'm most jealous of is that you named a stadium." That is 3Com Park in San Francisco. Metcalfe started the company 3Com, and he picked the name out. Very few people know what the name stands for: Computers, Communication, and Compatibility. That's the 3Com--the stupidest name you could imagine, especially for a stadium. But, as we know, Candlestick Park is now called 3Com Park. And so I said, "Bob, you know, I can't imagine what it's like to have named a stadium."<br><br>He kind of laughed and said, "Well, you know, last week I went to a famous restaurant. They have a world-famous chef. When I ordered my dinner the waiter came over to me and said, 'Sir, I understand that you're Mr. 3Com. Our chef would like to meet you.'"<br><br>"I said, 'Well, that's fine, but your chef should understand that I don't own that ballpark. We just paid for the use of the name.'<br><br>"So the waiter says, 'Oh, just a minute.' A few minutes later he came back and said, 'Sir, the chef doesn't want to meet you.'"<br><br>But back to connectedness: The world is becoming so connected that you can sit here at your computers in Provo and reach out to the world in a way you've never done before. It's so fantastic. I have a little cubbyhole in my attic where I have my computer. The idea that I can reach out and touch the whole world from my little attic is so thrilling to me, and it's something new.<br><br>I got a call a week ago from a professor at MIT who is working on a project. He wants to prove the six degrees of separation. Now, you all have heard this theory about how we're all separated from everybody else by six people. I could get to any of you, or any of you could get to me, by reaching out to six consecutive people that you know. You reach out to someone you know, and they reach out to somebody they know, and in six or fewer people you get to me. This guy wants to prove it by looking at telephone records. Well, he's not going to be able to do that because he's not going to be able to get those records, and I don't think that would prove it anyway. But the concept is very interesting, as well as whether or not that is in fact shrinking as time goes along so that the world is becoming more tightly linked. As you go to faraway, exotic places and see McDonald's and other U.S. culture everywhere--you realize how connected the world is. As they say, when a butterfly flits its wings in Brazil, there is a snowstorm in Provo. That connectedness is happening.<br><br>In the Internet today on the Web we are seeing the emergence of a new group consciousness. It's not understood, as it is only shaping before us right now. We're getting such phenomena as Pierre Salinger's claim that TWA Flight 800 was shot down by a U.S. missile--and that actually came through the Internet. You see how these ripples of rumors from the Internet go out and explode across the world. It happens very quickly. We are getting the phenomenon of what is now known as "flash crowds": crowds that suddenly appear in a particular place in cyberspace. For example, on election night 50 million people tried to get to CNN and failed, of course. I was one of them. These flash crowds move around in cyberspace looking for the hotspots, where they are, and where the people will be.<br><br>On the Internet, though, it's not so much the crowds as it is that individuals can find each other. You can find people like you out there that you've never been able to get to before. Do you ever feel that you have a clone out there that you've never met--that there's someone just like you out there, but your chances of meeting them are zero? On the Internet you can find people like you, whatever you are like, out there. And so it's been said that on the Internet conspiracies can happen. People can get together and form conspiracies on the Internet, but you can't do propaganda on the Internet because propaganda is a broadcast phenomenon. You have to be able to talk to a crowd like I am doing right now. I could do propaganda now, but I couldn't do conspiracy. On the Internet you could do conspiracy but not propaganda, because the model on the Internet is pull rather than push. You choose what you want.<br><br>In finding people like yourself, there are various things taking place that take advantage of what we call collaborative filtering or the group consciousness. The group has a great deal of wisdom about it--like the stock market: it just seems to know things that individuals don't know. There is great wisdom somewhere in groups, and that wisdom can exist on the Internet in groups. As a simple example of this, we did something at my company that is now actually done by another company on the Web. If you want to look it up, it is Firefly Network, Inc.: www.firefly.com. They do movie, music, and restaurant recommendations based on groups of people like you.<br><br>Let me give you an example of this kind of thing. I was getting on an airplane a year or so ago, and the passenger in front of me as we were filing on the plane asked the stewardess what the movie was on that flight. The stewardess said that the movie was<i>Sommersby.</i><i>Sommersby</i>was a remake of the movie<i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i>but set in the American South. This guy asked the stewardess, "Well, is this movie any good?"<br><br>She said, "I don't know."<br><br>I was standing right behind, so I said, "No, the movie is no good at all."<br><br>The stewardess turned to me and said, "Now just a minute, sir, let me calibrate you. Did you like 'Enchanted April?'"<br><br>I said, "Great movie."<br><br>Then she started listing other movies, and I said "I don't like that" or "I like that."<br><br>Finally, after these questions she turned to the other gentleman and said, "This gentleman knows what he's talking about. Our movie is no good."<br><br>You can extend this example out to the Internet: Firefly does. What you do is give your personal ratings of all these movies that you've seen, and people love to do that. Then Firefly cross-correlates all your ratings against everybody else's ratings. They find somebody out there in the world who liked the exact same movies that you liked and hated the same movies that you hated. They've got somebody who represents you out there. They've got a small group of them. And now, when that somebody just like you sees a new movie and says it's great, you ought to see that movie because you're going to like it, too. Those ratings are much better for you than those of Siskel and Ebert, because you may not like the movies that Siskel and Ebert like. But you like the movies that this other, unknown person out there likes. So you can do the same thing with restaurants, with music, and with other things using the wisdom of the group to guide you. This group consciousness is happening out there.<br><br>An explosion of information is happening. There are about 60 million pages on the Web, and that number is doubling every 53 days. The interesting thing to me is that the number of pages on the Web is growing faster than the number of users. If this continues, what it means, basically, is that, statistically, nobody will ever see any page. The pages are increasing like an expanding universe, and faster than the number of users grows. That means the pages are the trees that fall in the forest and don't make a sound. I don't know exactly how this works, but we all know that 90 percent of everything is junk. How do we ever find our way through all this junk? This is a sudden new phenomenon that has happened. As you all know, the search engines, the AltaVistas and Excites, are not able to keep up with this. What happens is that you put in certain key words and you get 40,000 matches for your word. You say, "Ah, forget it. This is useless." So we need better ways to get at the information.<br><br>The people I know who work on indexing, library sciences, and so forth are trying to find ways to index the material out there. Yahoo!, by the way, is a site that does indexing, as you might know. It tries to do a Dewey decimal system for the Internet and classify everything so that you can find things by classification. But it's growing totally out of control. The information is not pure information. The quality varies greatly. One of the problems we have is that when you put in key words for a search in AltaVista, it won't tell you that what it's giving you is junk. There are no consumer reports for the Internet.<br><br>Now, librarians generally don't like to do quality evaluation. I once gave a keynote talk at the annual meeting of the Library of Congress. I told them that they had too many books, and they did not appreciate this at all. I said, "If you took 99 percent of your books and put them somewhere in the basement where no one could see them, I'd be better off because I might be able to find the good stuff."<br><br>You never see in the card catalog "This is good" and "This is no good." But if you pick the book off the shelf and see that it is dog-eared, that a lot of people have scribbled notes in it, and that a lot of people have checked the book out, you might say, "Well, there must be something to this." There is a certain wisdom in group behavior. We need to incorporate this kind of knowledge. This is implicitly incorporated today when you go out and search for something and you find links. The things that you most find links to are the things that other people thought were good. So, as you follow other people's links, statistically you actually are guided to the good stuff. You're not exactly following a card catalog in a library, you're following other people's recommendations to steer you where you might want to go.<br><br>So this self-organization is a phenomenon that is helping us right now. I don't know how it will work out in the long run, but we face a meltdown of information if we can't find better ways to organize it and to guide our own searches toward it. The critical factor in all of this, the one thing that is in short supply, is human attention. We only have 24 hours in a day, and there isn't enough time ever to explore even a tiny corner of this universe. I never felt this way before, but I started getting up really early Saturday morning because I'm afraid that I'll miss out on something. Time is ticking, and there isn't enough time. Somehow, as all this expands in front of you, you realize that the one essential is time--and you don't have enough of it.<br><br>It isn't just information out there. I hate to even mention its name in this setting, but there is a site on the Internet that was the most popular site earlier this year. I don't know whether it is anymore, but it's called the Peeping Tom Homepage. Probably if I asked for a show of hands of how many people have been to the Peeping Tom Homepage, no one would raise their hand here even though probably some people have been there. It's not in any way related to the Peeping Tom that you normally think of. The site merely guides you to all the cameras currently set up around the world and connected to the Internet. If you go to Peeping Tom Homepage, it will just give you a listing geographically by country. You can check a place out before you go there, as I did recently. If you want to check out what it looks like on the French Riviera right now, there are lots of cameras there. You can look at the beach and see what's happening. There is a camera in my hometown--Red Bank, New Jersey--on the main street, so I can see what it's like.<br><br>I have a camera, and I'm thinking of putting it out in my front yard so that when I'm on a trip like this I can just go on the Internet and see if my house is still there. That would give me a comforting feeling. You know, if you're driving home and you see a fire engine going the other way, you sort of wonder, Did they come from my place? Or better yet, I could have my camera actually right inside, focused on the inside of my front door, because that's where my two little dogs lie. I could see if the dogs are okay. If the dogs are there, I would know that my wife is out because the dogs wait by the door.<br><br>The number of cameras on the Internet now is certainly in the tens of thousands. We're heading toward the time when there will be millions of tiny, cheap cameras all linked together on the Internet. Everything will be visible from everywhere. These cameras are getting down to button size. It isn't even just cameras. Cameras are passive devices; they look. But more and more we're starting to get actuators out there, things that can move at your command. There is a cute little site called Tele-Garden at USC. They have a garden with a robot arm over the garden. You can log onto the site and register. They will let you work the garden. There's a camera, and you can move the camera around. You find a spot in the garden that no one else has taken, and you can plant seeds and water them, and watch them grow and stuff. It's a collaborative garden for people.<br><br>The author Douglas Adams, who is a friend of mine, says he gets a thrill out of there being such a lot of Coke machines on-line now. It's great because the companies can check when they're empty. But there are a number of Coke machines, particularly at universities, where you can actuate them and drop a Coke can. You can have an account that lets you do this, and Adams says he gets a thrill by paying some money and actually dropping random Coke cans in different places. A student will be walking by and a Coke can will drop. This gives him a great thrill to be able to reach out and do things, to actually affect things out there. More and more, as the world becomes connected and visible and actuated, you'll be able to see and check the traffic and the temperature on every street and every building, the elevator movements--everything. It is all going to be out there.<br><br>What about the societal impact of all this? This imagery sometimes captures my imagination. I'm sure that many of you saw the movie<i>Independence Day.</i>In<i>Independence Day</i>you've got this powerful image of giant flying saucers that look like 15-mile-wide Scooter Pies coming over the cities. They come very slowly of course, because that's much more effective. The shadow comes across toward you, and everyone's eyes are riveted on the darkening sky. That's what I think about sometimes in the Internet. You see it coming and you know it's inevitable, but you look up at that thing and you think, "Is that thing friendly?" That's what we worry about. There are a lot of implications here. People used to ask in the early days, "What's cyberspace?" I said the more interesting question is "Where is cyberspace?" because it doesn't exist in any particular geography. This is giving governments a great deal of difficulty. I'm often on government committees, and I feel this strange power--when you go and you get associated with any of the governments, you want to reach out and control things. It just happens to you when you sit in Washington, D.C., or in any seat of government power. You feel like you want to control. And the governments want to control this.<br><br>There are worries about the kinds of things that can happen when we see that bomb-making information is distributed on the Internet. People say, "Well, let's close down the Internet." Never mind that you can go to a library and get the same information. The fact that it was on the Internet makes it bad. Porn on the Internet is, as you know, an issue that's going to the Supreme Court and has given a great deal of difficulty. I like the wisdom of a good friend of mine, John Perry Barlow, who says that the Internet is actually self-policing. "Every time I get anywhere near pornography, there's so much traffic I can't get through," he says. It is an issue that probably can't be resolved. China today and Singapore are prime examples of countries that control the content on Internet. In those countries, the only access to Internet is through proxy servers that have censored the sites. China has a list of a 100 forbidden sites on the Internet, and they include<i>Playboy</i>and the<i>Wall Street Journal.</i>That information cannot get into China. However, I've met with the person who runs the Internet in China, and he says that you really can get it. The list is just for show, to tell people that that's a policy. And the same thing may be happening in Singapore. But the issue of control of content here is an almost unresolvable one that isn't going to go away.<br><br>Earlier, when I was talking to the electrical-engineering and computer-engineering students about how things happen, I mentioned a friend of mine at Stanford about 20 years ago who told me about this idea he had for public-key cryptography. This is a cryptography where you have two keys: a public key and a private key. It's as if you have a mailbox that anybody can put letters into, but the mailbox is locked and only you have the key to open it. I have to tell you a little story about this. My son-in-law was on a ski trip last year in Vermont, and his car had a big problem. He had to leave the car in Vermont at a repair place and then come home another way. But he realized when he got home that he had left his key ring in the car. One of his difficulties was that he has one of these mailboxes in the apartments where the postman puts the mail in the top of the box, and you have a key to open your particular box. That's just like public-key cryptography--the same kind of metaphor. He immediately called the car repair place in Vermont and asked them to send him the key ring, which they did. And then he realized: his key to the mailbox was now locked inside the mailbox! He asked me not to tell anybody any of this. So if you ever see him, please, I didn't tell you this. So, the key to your mailbox has been mailed to your mailbox. This isn't going to work. Anyway, my friend at Stanford, Marty Hellman, invented this public-key cryptography. I told him, "Marty, you know, people like you and me don't know about this stuff. There are people in Washington, D.C., who worked for years in the field. There are thousands of people who know all about the secrets of cryptography. But you and I, we don't know about this stuff."<br><br>Marty said, "I know. It's just my idea." Well, 20 years later, this idea of Marty and his friend Whit Diffie has changed the world. They've unleashed something on the world that the world doesn't know what to do with, and that is unbreakable secrecy. I've been in meeting after meeting, forum after forum, and nobody has a solution. The FBI, in particular, doesn't want there to be complete secrecy. So the U.S. has tried to impose a policy on the rest of the world. France was ahead of us--they just outlawed all cryptography for their citizens. But aside from France, we're probably the most vociferous on this point in not wanting this privacy to happen. The civil rights groups, on the other side, say that it's a right to have privacy. I see no resolution. The government comes up with policy after policy that won't fly; there are unresolvable demands of individual privacy on the one hand and the government's worries of how this will be misused on the other hand. There seems to be no relief.<br><br>So far, not a lot of other things have happened. In many things cryptography is helpful, such as with absolute authentication in time and signatures, for signatures that are unforgeable, and electronic money, money that is unforgeable. But here's a difficulty: money is for the first time profoundly anonymous; it cannot be traced. So we have, as I said, something that perhaps we're not ready for. But money is in the end a belief system more than anything. Money is what you believe it is, and as for the difficulties with money, it will be interesting to see what happens.<br><br>Finally, there is the whole societal thing of how media shapes what we are. As Neil Postman, who is today's version of Marshall McLuhan, says, "The structure of media alters what we are." We have a new medium in the Web, and it's going to alter what we as people are. Postman says that "all media represents a Faustian bargain. They have their pluses and all of them have their minuses." He says, "Technology giveth and technology taketh away. There are no unmixed blessings. There are always unforeseen consequences." The author of<i>Silicon Snake Oil,</i>Cliff Stoll, who is kind of crazy anyway, says, "Get a life. Get away from your computer." On the other hand, when you sit at your computer, you can reach out and touch the world. Which is the life here?<br><br>One of the prime examples, of course, is television. Now I often wonder about television. It has certainly changed what we are. It changed everything about us, but it was not an unmixed blessing. Now, by the time we are 20 years old, we have likely seen almost a million television commercials. Our minds are used to flashing images changing every three seconds, to sudden shifts of the world similar to a surfing entity going through the MTV world.<br><br>Some years ago I gave a talk to an organization called People-to-People. They are individuals in various countries who get together and find friends in other countries. Then they network through their friends. They had their annual meeting in Washington, D.C., and I talked to them. I was talking about digital television, how wonderful it was. You know, the idea of television<i>is</i>wonderful from a technical standpoint. I could feel from the crowd that they didn't like television. So I suddenly stopped and asked the crowd, "If you could go back and disinvent television, would you do it?"<br><br>Basically everybody said, "Yes, we would. We would stop this from happening. We think it's bad and it has hurt mankind."<br><br>I'm not going to resolve that. Postman says that Socrates opposed writing, which was just starting to be used in his time. He said that writing was going to have negative effects, that writing would cause us to lose our memories. And it did. You know people in those days memorized entire books;<i>The Iliad</i>and<i>The Odyssey</i>were passed down orally. People had marvelous memories because it was an oral culture. With writing you didn't need to memorize stuff, and they did lose their memories. Furthermore, Socrates said that writing would take away the dialectic. Writing, when you read it, forces you to follow an argument rather than participate in it. Once you've written something down, you can't change it. You lose the flexibility, and he said that these are all bad things about writing. Of course, writing, you'd have to say, is good, but it did, indeed, have those effects. And the Web will have unforeseen consequences in the way we live our lives. I don't know what those are going to be. I don't know whether it's going to make us better people or worse people, but it will change everything.<br><br>Now, speaking of change, all of this has happened so suddenly that there are no experts here. I wrote a column recently based on a remark a friend made. He said, "We're all bozos on this bus." I like the analogy because you just feel like you're a clown. You don't know anything about this, but you're being driven somewhere on some bus that is out of your control. You don't know where the bus is going, you don't know who is up front driving, and you're just a bozo on the bus. A lot of people wrote me e-mail after my column came out asking if I knew where that expression came from, and I didn't know actually. (Just for the record, it came from a<i>Firesign Theatre</i>radio show in the '70s, I guess, but I didn't know that.) Anyway, I just feel that we are all bozos on this bus, and there's a good side and a bad side. The good side is that everybody else is a bozo just like you. The bad side, of course, is that you are a bozo. I see everybody suddenly hanging out their shingles: "I Am a Web Consultant."<br><br>I heard a great ad on the radio the other day. I was driving in New Haven, Connecticut. This is the honest truth--this was an ad on the radio. It said, "Be an Internet consultant. Earn up to $2,000 a day. No previous experience required." I'm serious. When you're all bozos on a bus, that works. This is an important lesson to you students, though. We're bozos on a bus because all of this technology and everything here is so new that there are no preexisting experts. You are as good as the next person in this. The other part of this is that this is true of life in general. When you're in school you have this mistaken idea, speaking for myself here, that the world is full of geniuses out there. When you're in high school you read about a person who can multiply 15-digit numbers in their head and stuff. You think, "I'll never be like that. I'll never be a genius like that." You get this warped view of the world, that there are these fantastic geniuses out there. And there aren't. There aren't. When you grow up, you look around as an adult and you ask, "Where are these geniuses?" Where are these kids that could multiply 15-digit numbers in their heads? You don't see them as adults. But somehow, when you're very impressionable as a child, you think that this is what the world is like. And you worry.<br><br>I was at a meeting years ago--I was on an advisory committee for the Star Wars program. This group had some very famous people on it, and we heard this talk by an engineer from Boeing. I won't say what the talk was about because it's irrelevant. Besides, the talk was incomprehensible to me. I thought, I don't understand this because I'm stupid.<br><br>So afterward, this person who gave the talk stopped and asked, "Are there any questions?"<br><br>I thought, no way am I going to ask a question. I don't understand this stuff, but I'm keeping my hand down because I would just reveal my own stupidity. Finally one hand went up in the audience. Everyone turned and saw that the hand belonged to Edward Teller, the father of the H-bomb, arguably the most famous physicist in the world. Not only is he famous, but he carries a persona. He has a Bela Lugosi eastern European accent and talks like Dracula. He whispers so that everyone has to be real quiet and turn their attention to him. He's kind of old and infirm now, so he has a cane. But it's not a regular cane--it's a biblical staff, a gnarled tree trunk that he carries. Picture this: When he talks, he moves his head back and forth and his jowls joggle out of sync with the rest of his face--sort of like Richard Nixon's. When Teller raised his hand, everyone was quiet and turned to look at this world-famous physicist. I just couldn't wait to hear what he was going to say. In his Dracula voice he said, "I have understood nothing of this." I realized that I was not the only dumb one there. This guy's provably not dumb, so therefore the speaker didn't do his job. That's the way the world really is. But you do worry.<br><br>There's a little skiing story I want to tell you. I was skiing in Saint Moritz. You people are all skiers, so you'll know about this stuff. I'm not very good, but I was getting used to going down the groomed trails, down the front of the mountain where this resort was. I was pretty proud of myself; I hadn't killed myself yet and was doing okay. My friend kept accusing me of having no courage and urging me to go off the back of the mountain where there aren't trails, where you can ski 26 miles to a railroad station. I thought, no, this is the life I know. I can go down the front of the slopes. But finally, the last day, my manhood was being challenged. I had to do this. The thing is that the snow isn't groomed, and you don't know what's ahead, but you take the plunge and you go off the back of the mountain. I only got about a 100 feet when I crashed and burned. My skis flew off, and there I was, floundering in the heavy snow trying to get back up. I looked up; there were these two skiers standing over me. Blond, blue-eyed, with the sun and the blue sky above their heads, it was obvious that they were expert skiers. They were pointing at me and laughing and talking in German. I said, "I'm okay. I'm okay. Please go away." They stood there while I got my skis back on and started off again. They kept watching me. Now I was under a lot of pressure. I only got about 70 feet and I crashed. They came over to me again, standing there and looking at me and talking in German and laughing. I said, "Please, I'm okay. I'm not hurt."<br><br>And then one of the men turned to me and, in perfect English, said, "It's not that. It's harder up ahead, and you're not good enough."<br><br>He was right, it was harder ahead, and I wasn't good enough. Sometimes life is that way, but more often the converse is true. People tell you that it's harder ahead and you're not good enough, but that's not the case.<br><br>Now, as I look ahead, technology is shaping this world--it interacts with society. And there are going to be mega-events, probably in your lifetime. I think that we will do such things as actually create life in the laboratory. I think that we will engineer humans. I think machines will think. And these are mega-events that are going to change our understanding of the world. But I truly believe that we will still have wars. The wealth of the world will still be concentrated in a small number of people. There will be haves and have-nots and societal problems that all of our technology and all of our power are unable to solve. And that's where we need your help.

<h1>and Sacred Individuality - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you, because I have a hint as to who you are and what you will become. I have also fallen in love with this university, its students, and its mission to balance the sacred and the secular. President Bateman indicated earlier this semester that this balance "is at the core of this institution's existence" (Merrill J. Bateman, "The Mission of Brigham Young University,"<i>Addresses Delivered at the 1996 Annual University Conference,</i>August 26–27, 1996, p. 10).<br><br>A student friend recently asked me how I balance the sacred and the secular in my life. Upon reflection, I realize that I often draw parallels from both of those parts of my life and apply them to the other. With this in mind, I wish to address both secular and sacred aspects of our individuality. Secular aspects are from the perspective of my disciplines: nutritional science and molecular biology. Sacred aspects are from the perspective of our spiritually inherited qualities. I will attempt to draw some parallels between the two regarding our vulnerability to both physical and spiritual illnesses.<br><br>In his book entitled<i>The Quark and the Jaguar,</i>Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann contrasts elementary particles with complex systems. He notes that elementary particles such as quarks behave "exactly the same wherever [they occur] in the universe [and] are rigorously interchangeable with one another. . . .<i>Elementary particles have no individuality."</i>He contrasts this with a personal and rare sighting of a jaguarundi in Belize, and describes his observations of its behavior and personality. He notes: "My experience with<i>this particular</i>jaguarundi resonated with my thinking about the whole notion of individuality" (Murray Gell-Mann,<i>The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in the Simple and Complex</i>[New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, 1994], pp. 7–8; emphasis added).<br><br>He had discovered that<i>this</i>jaguarundi was altogether individual, not interchangeable with every other one. This one, this time, was curious and casual. He concludes that the more complex the organism, the more potentially individual it is and the less interchangeable it is with every other one of its kind.<br><br>I confess that my version of this discovery is pretty mundane. Having been reared on a dairy farm, I learned the hard way that each of our dairy cows was an individual. Each had its own personality, attributes, and descriptive name. Some were cantankerous and irritable. Others were docile and gentle. Some were inclined to kick the milk bucket over. Others were more inclined to slap our faces with a wet, dirty tail while we sat on the milking stool in that intimate contact with them. I confess that during those moments my thoughts about their individuality were not as noble as the professor's. Somehow though, I cultivated a fascination with individuality.<br><br>Early in my scientific career I used the tools of molecular biology during their infancy. It was then that I came to realize that my intrigue with molecular biology had its roots in a fascination with understanding differences between individuals. It is somehow satisfying to detect a delicate genetic difference and establish an association between that small difference and a large, consequent biological manifestation of the difference. Think of it! Identifying the minutest of differences between the DNA blueprints for two individuals and explaining its expression in some aspect of their lives, their health, their appearance, their personality, or a myriad other elements of their mortality.<br><br>I learned how different we are. There are nearly four billion base pairs of genetic information in each human cell. Our biological individuality is partially rooted in the variability of this information. There is an average of one difference in every 2000 of those base pairs. Therefore, in the genetic information encoded in DNA, there could be as many as two million differences between you and the person sitting next to you. If you will turn to your right or left and look carefully, you will see what I mean.<br><br>As you have just seen, we are not as easily interchangeable as quarks. We are<i>very</i>complex systems, with many blueprint differences that give us biological individuality. Let me illustrate this type of individuality with an example from my fascination with genetic variations.<br><br>On occasion I give a presentation called "Fitting into Our Genes" to groups interested in health-related issues. The topic conveys two important principles. One is that, because of our genetic differences, we each have individual susceptibilities and vulnerabilities to diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. Included in this principle is the corollary that it would seem prudent to make our lifestyle choices "fit into" those genetic vulnerabilities, meaning that we make dietary and exercise choices to reduce vulnerability. The second principle is that this concept is valid with regard to genes that might influence "fitting into our jeans," spelled J-E-A-N-S. If our nutrition choices do not fit into our genetic makeup, we are at increased vulnerability for the many diseases that attend excess weight gain.<br><br>My research has examined differences in genes that affect metabolic rate. As a population, we exhibit a wide range of metabolic rates. All of our friends, it<i>seems,</i>have high metabolic rates. It seems they can eat anything they want but never gain weight, whereas the rest of us<i>seemingly</i>pass the kitchen, smell the aroma, and absorb every calorie from the food by simple proximity. We are incensed at the unfairness of this form of individuality.<br><br>When we contemplate the fairness of such genetic differences, it is better to maintain the more eternal perspective taught by Elder Boyd K. Packer in a 1993 general conference:<br><br><i>There are what President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., called "pranks" of nature, which cause a variety of abnormalities, deficiencies, and deformities. However unfair they seem to man's way of reasoning, they somehow</i>suit the purposes<i>of the Lord in the</i>proving<i>of mankind.</i>[Boyd K. Packer, "For Time and All Eternity,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1993, p. 21; emphasis added. See also "Our Wives and Our Mothers in the Eternal Plan," address given in general Relief Society conference, 3 October 1946, in<i>J. Reuben Clark: Selected Papers on Religion, Education, and Youth,</i>ed. David H. Yarn, Jr. (Provo: BYU Press, 1984), p. 62]<br><br>Consistent with my fascination with genetic individuality, my research has illuminated some gene alterations that "prove" us by affecting our metabolic rate. They then contribute to increased vulnerability to weight gain. You might ask, "Why would you study this?" Here's the first part of the parallel. I study this to contribute to the possibility of fitting into a genetic vulnerability by making what I call "genetically intelligent nutrition choices." In this case, the purpose is to reduce someone's vulnerability (because of his genes) to excess weight gain and to avoid the consequent illnesses.<br><br>Now the second part of the parallel. In addition to biological and genetic individuality, we know that mankind also possesses spiritual individuality. Our agency allows it. We brought it with us from premortal life. It interacts with our biological and genetic individuality, and this interaction must be factored into any development of our total individuality. This alliance of individualities is God-given. Some portion of it may even be God-inherited if we can imagine a "deity DNA" that works in concert with our human DNA and that allows us the potential to eventually develop God's attributes in perfection.<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell separated the effects of biological from spiritual individuality in the recent general conference:<br><br><i>Our genes, circumstances, and environments matter very much, and</i>they shape us significantly.<i>Yet there remains an</i>inner zone<i>in which</i>we<i>are sovereign, unless we abdicate. In this zone lies the essence of our individuality and our personal accountability.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1996, p. 21; emphasis added]<br><br>This statement seems to identify the following: an inner individuality, separate from our genetic and environmental individuality, that contains its essence, where we have the ability to be sovereign unless we abdicate and for which<i>we</i>are accountable.<br><br>Perhaps we could ponder some obvious questions. How does one abdicate his or her sovereignty in this inner individuality? How is its essence contained therein? How is it distinct from the shaping influence of genes, circumstances, and environment? How do we improve this inner individuality since we can exercise sovereignty over it? How are we held personally accountable for our use and control of this individuality?<br><br>As we ponder these questions, the biological concept of fitting into our genes perhaps has spiritual and eternal parallels that are helpful. These parallels involve fitting into the facets of individuality that we learned in our premortal life, just as we should fit into the biological individuality we have been dealt as part of our mortal proving. Further, the parallels extend to our genetically determined vulnerability for disease and to our learning to make genetically intelligent nutrition choices. These may parallel our lifelong struggle to overcome spiritual vulnerabilities by learning to make what might be called "spiritually intelligent eternal choices." These choices would be designed to reduce the susceptibilities present in our individual set of spiritual predispositions.<br><br>Each of us brought individual talents from our premortal life, talents that we spent eons of time working to develop. Although our Savior achieved perfection in his attributes during his premortal life and became godlike, some of ours are not yet perfected.<i>We</i>came into mortality both with some significant talents and godlike attributes and with some that are less than completed. They therefore become vulnerabilities--susceptibilities to certain spiritual illnesses, if you will. Because we know we have the potential to perfect them, these attributes may be thought of as<i>unfinished</i>godlike qualities within us, perhaps contained in our inner individuality. Here in mortality we<i></i>must discover which ones are unfinished, strive to finish them, and make conscious lifestyle choices that allow us to fit into our spiritual vulnerability by making spiritually intelligent eternal choices. By such a course we will reduce spiritual vulnerability as we go about the business of finishing these attributes.<br><br>In science we learn much about the normal from observations of the abnormal. Let me give you an example of such involving an extremely spiritually dysfunctional group which illustrates that unfinished qualities can be vulnerabilities leading to spiritual illness. According to Joseph Smith, in D&amp;amp;C 129, there are three grand keys for detecting the nature of visiting angels and spirits. The central question is really whether it is inherent in the visitor's nature to deceive (see D&amp;amp;C 129:7–8). Let us assume that deceit represents the significantly unfinished quality of honesty. One would think that a devilish spirit who was attempting to appear as an angel of light might be smart enough to refuse to grasp an offered hand. Apparently, his quality of honesty is so unfinished, and its opposite is so entrenched, that he reacts impulsively to try to deceive and is thereby detected.<br><br>In contrast, our presence in mortality allows us the opportunity to refine and perfect our unfinished godlike attributes. Fortunately, we are well beyond the fixation of unfinished qualities experienced by the devils. With effort, we may finish them and manifest refined individuality within the righteous qualities. Therefore, by the spiritual equivalent of genetically intelligent nutrition choices we may be engaged in spiritually intelligent eternal choices that address our own identified vulnerabilities.<br><br>Many revelations have given us scriptural lists of godlike qualities. They proclaim the completed ideal qualities and beckon us to finish these godlike qualities in our inner individuality. These scriptural beckonings attest both to our potential sovereignty over the development of our inner individuality and to the possibility of eventually perfecting all the righteous qualities of God. Fulfilling that potential by finishing godlike attributes seems to represent the equivalent of spiritual genes inherited from God.<br><br>My favorite list describes not only the finished qualities for which we should strive but also acknowledges the range of related unfinished qualities we now possess. This appeals to me because defining the unfinished aspects of my qualities helps me identify my specific vulnerabilities for spiritual illness. I am then in a better position to make the spiritually intelligent eternal choices necessary to reduce the vulnerability.<br><br>In 1991, students here were given the following list by Elder Maxwell, who taught that the following "scriptural virtues are intertwined, interactive, and interdependent":<br><br><i>We are to be:</i><br><br><i>1. Meek and humble--not self-concerned, dismissive, proud, seeking ascendancy. . . .</i><br><br><i>2. Patient--not hectic, hurried, pushy.</i><br><br><i>3. Full of love--not demanding, dominating, manipulative, condescending, or harsh.</i><br><br><i>4. Gentle--not coarse, brusque, and vindictive.</i><br><br><i>5. Easily entreated--not unapproachable, inaccessible, and nonlistening.</i><br><br><i>6. Long-suffering--not impatient, disinterested, curt, easily offended. . . .</i><br><br><i>7. Submissive to God--not resistant to the Spirit, counsel, and life's lessons.</i><br><br><i>8. Temperate (self-restrained)--not egoistic, eager for attention and recognition, or too talkative. . . .</i><br><br><i>9. Merciful--not judgmental and unforgiving. . . .</i><br><br><i>10. Gracious--not tactless, easily irritated, ungenerous.</i><br><br><i>11. Holy--not worldly.</i><br><br>[Neal A. Maxwell, "In Him All Things Hold Together,"<i>Brigham Young University 1990–91 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1991), pp. 105–6]<br><br>Each range on this list contains individual qualities near both finished and unfinished ends of a spectrum. We are free to, encouraged to, and even obligated to exercise, not abdicate, sovereignty over the development of their finished form within our nature. We should recognize our personal accountability; understand where we, personally, stand; and do all in our power to move to the finished end of the spectrum and thus overcome spiritual vulnerability.<br><br>If I were at significant risk because of a genetic predisposition for excess weight or heart disease, I would change my lifestyle and my dietary habits to reduce the risk of developing the disease. Because I know that I am at significant risk for a spiritual disorder because of a less-than-finished godlike quality that I brought to mortality, I can cultivate that personal quality and change my spiritual habits and my lifestyle, thereby reducing vulnerability to the associated spiritual illness.<br><br>Two rudimentary examples will illustrate the point. They are closer to everyday reality than detecting deceit in spiritually dysfunctional devils. The first addresses the finished quality of being easily entreated, which means to be approachable and accessible, to accept good counsel, and to have a listening, attentive ear.<br><br>Thirty-three years ago a brand-new missionary arrived in my missionary district. He brought with him his guitar. Our mission president, Bruce R. McConkie, suggested that he leave it in the mission home and pick it up in two years. I watched as he struggled briefly with taking another simple step toward finishing the quality of being easily entreated and then watched him take that small step. Five years ago my calling with the 19 BYU stakes involved me in the reorganization of one of them. This same individual, now an experienced priesthood leader, was assigned as part of his training to accompany a member of the Twelve to the reorganization. Again I watched, and this time saw him easily and anxiously glean principle after principle taught by the member of the Twelve. I appreciated his now-refined quality of being easily entreated. I wondered how crucial each of his small, earlier steps were. I also wondered what spiritual illness might have claimed him had he not learned to fit into that earlier unfinished quality by making spiritually intelligent eternal choices that reduce vulnerability.<br><br>A second simple example addresses the finished quality of being temperate, which is defined as being self-restrained and using self-control. At the unfinished end of this particular spectrum resides eagerness for attention and recognition, as well as egoism, defined as seeking the welfare of oneself only and talking too much about oneself.<br><br>Fifteen years ago, as a young stake president, I was associated with a priesthood leader who was talented and charismatic and could touch many lives. As time passed, however, it became clear that being temperate was not a refined quality within him. He was at the other end of that spectrum and was egoistic, eager for attention and recognition, and too talkative. As his priesthood leader, I tried to help him fit into patterns that would reduce his vulnerability for the associated spiritual illness. I watched him struggle at length, then finally succumb to a spiritual illness, then lose his marriage, family, friends, testimony, and the gospel. Again, I wondered how crucial each of the early, simple<i>but untaken</i>steps were and where he could be now had he understood better his weakness and adjusted his choices to fit into them to reduce his vulnerability.<br><br>Can you see both the blessings and vulnerabilities associated with our sovereignty, or its abdication, over the qualities of our inner individuality? As you exercise sovereignty over these qualities, consider the list that should be, in the language of King Benjamin, "kept on" as you make your spiritually intelligent eternal choices. Consider as well as those that should be "put off" because they make you vulnerable to spiritual illness (see Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>Now, many times we encounter barriers as we seek to put off the vulnerabilities of unfinished godlike attributes. First, individuality itself should not be used as an excuse for harboring unrighteous qualities. For example, graciousness may be refined and expressed in countless individual ways, and all are far superior to tolerating tactlessness or cultivating curtness within our character simply from a fierce defense of diversity and individuality.<br><br>Second, some have an inclination to equate extreme individualism with refined individual qualities. An example I continually encounter because of my discipline intertwines both biological and spiritual principles. A caution against it was taught by President Packer in April conference regarding the principle and promises of the Word of Wisdom:<br><br><i>Young people, learn to use moderation and common sense in matters of health and nutrition, and particularly in medication. Avoid being extreme or fanatical or becoming a faddist.</i><br><br><i>For example, the Word of Wisdom counsels us to eat meat sparingly (see D&amp;amp;C 89:12). Lest someone become extreme, we are told in another revelation that "whoso forbiddeth to [eat meat] is not ordained of God" (D&amp;amp;C 49:18).</i>[President Packer's footnote to the last sentence adds that the revelation was given "to<i>correct some</i>. . .<i>erroneous doctrines. One . . . was not to eat flesh--meat or fish."</i>] [Boyd K. Packer, "The Word of Wisdom: The Principle and the Promises,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1996, pp. 18–19; emphasis added]<br><br>I realize that there may be appropriate reasons for choosing not to eat meat, and that is acceptable, if knowledgeably done. But too often the reasoning is based on an erroneous interpretation of the Word of Wisdom, and that seems to appeal to our inclination to overexpress individualism and equate it with the refinement of qualities. An extreme and erroneous interpretation of the doctrine of the Church should not be an excuse for extreme individualism.<br><br>An additional barrier, at the other extreme, is hiding our individual unfinished qualities in<i>groups</i>rather than polishing righteous qualities as individuals. This is fraught with spiritual vulnerabilities. The Savior taught some poignant parables focusing accountability on<i>individuals,</i>not on groups in which one might hope that unfinished qualities go unnoticed.<br><br>The parable of the gospel net has particular application to the qualities of individuals within the community of the Church (see Matthew 13:47–50). The harvest by the gospel net is large but not completely selective. It includes many different species, individual fish with individual qualities. Only after the fishermen return to shore are the fish submitted to a selective sorting process. Whatever an individual fish's purpose for coming into the net, being part of that<i></i>community is necessary but not sufficient. The sorting process is a personal and individual scrutiny, and only those individuals--not groups--who have developed the personal, finished qualities will survive the selective sorting and be saved in the vessels.<br><br>I might add for emphasis that the BYU admissions net gathers of many kinds also. It is not the<i>end</i>of the sorting process. Both<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>document as well as deviations from our Honor Code attest to our unfinished qualities. Our progress and growth in both secular and sacred matters while here at BYU is<i>part</i>of the sorting process. We have, here, abundant opportunities to develop and be proved in all of the godlike qualities mentioned. This process is certainly not limited to learning patience by standing in long lines.<br><br>The Savior also taught the parable of the marriage feast (Matthew 22:1–14), in which the king's servants gathered "both bad and good" for the wedding feast of his son. Consider Alfred Edersheim's teachings regarding this parable.<br><br><i>The "Servants" . . . had fulfilled their commission; they had brought in as many as they found, both bad and good . . . ; and "the wedding was filled with guests." . . . The King entered to see His guests, and among them he descried</i>one<i>who had not on a wedding-garment. . . . As the guests had been travellers . . . , we cannot be mistaken in supposing that such garments were supplied</i>in the palace itself to all those who sought them. . . .<i>If they were to take part in the feast, they must put on a garment suited to the occasion.</i>[Alfred Edersheim,<i>The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah,</i>vol. 2 (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1981), p. 429]<br><br>It seems clear that the king will individually examine each guest. This scrutiny will involve their individual qualities and take into account their individual differences. It will determine whether the guests who accepted the invitation were able to overcome the genetic clothes they had arrived in, put off the vulnerabilities within unfinished qualities brought from premortal life, and put on the wedding garment of finished qualities.<br><br>An angel of God gave King Benjamin the way to "put off" the individual "natural man." He admonished in essence, "Yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit," and become "a saint<i>through the atonement of Christ the Lord,"</i>and<i>become "as a child"</i>by developing a list of godlike qualities (see Mosiah 3:19). Partaking of the Atonement is then an individual experience and involves individually finishing godlike qualities. The Savior will, as it were, take time to allow us, individually, to feel the imprints of the nails--but, as the angel told King Benjamin, only if the process is intertwined with individual refinement of a list of godlike qualities.<br><br>In fact, the Father is even angry with us when we<i>fail</i>to understand this individual nature of the Atonement. It helps me to personalize Alma quoting Zenock: "Thou art angry, O Lord, with [Mark Rowe], because [he] will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon [him]<i>because of thy Son"</i>(see Alma 33:16; emphasis added). Elder Russell M. Nelson taught succinctly the importance of understanding the individual significance of the Atonement as we finish godlike qualities through spiritually intelligent choices:<br><br><i>In a very real way, the atonement of Jesus Christ affects each of our lives and the life of every human being who ever lived. Understanding the significance of His atonement is fundamental to choices we make in all facets of our lives.</i>[Russell M. Nelson, "Standards of the Lord's Standard-Bearers,"<i>Ensign,</i>August 1991, p. 5]<br><br>If we understand the individual, personal significance of the Atonement, that understanding will be pivotal in making the individual choices necessary to finish godlike qualities, and it will happen in every facet of our lives!<br><br>Examine yourselves, discover your individual spiritual vulnerabilities, and learn to avoid them. Consult your spiritual physician, take advantage of the healing of the Atonement available to you. If necessary, do so through his agent.<br><br>Blessings will attend our attempts to reduce vulnerabilities to the spiritual illnesses that inhibit advancing, progressing, and becoming like God in all of his character, perfections, and attributes. Elder McConkie's summary of this process is clear and comprehensive as he paraphrased Joseph Smith. It points out the assistance we receive from God as we strive to remove vulnerabilities and become like him through obedience:<br><br><i>In the final and all-comprehensive sense, the sole and only way to find and know God is to</i>keep his commandments.<i>As a result of such a course,</i>knowledge and revelation will come in one way or another<i>until man knows his Maker.</i>The more obedient a person is, the clearer his views become,<i>the nearer he approaches his God, and the more he comes to know those holy Beings whom to know is eternal life.</i>[Bruce R. McConkie,<i>The Promised Messiah</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1978), p. 18; emphasis added]<br><br>The clearer view, which flows from obedience, is essential to successfully finishing the personal, individual qualities that will reduce vulnerability for spiritual illness.<br><br>I pray that we may do just that, and I bear testimony of the promise of eternal life with God and of the joy of eternal life with each other as we manifest individuality in our finished, godlike qualities. I am grateful that the atonement of his Son both removes the effects of our unfinished qualities and makes our efforts to finish them bear the fruit of eternal life. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Mark J.

<h1>esigns: Tracing the Lord’s “Pattern in All Things” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Our lives are alive with patterns. Think about it: We are surrounded by patterns. In a sense we live our lives in discovering, identifying, tracing, or following patterns. We awaken in the morning to the sun's diurnal pattern; our bodies function and malfunction in patterns suggested by our patterned DNA. Our education consists of learning and testing patterns. Our sciences and mathematics are centered in formulaic patterns, as are our works of art, drama, music, dance, and literature. Our games, from hopscotch and Monopoly to football, are patterned play. And every year, as the pattern of the seasons moves from fall to winter, the BYU Cougars follow a well-worn pattern to the Western Athletic Conference championship--but not without the 10,000 prayers of the Saints who see a clear providential analogy, parallel, or pattern between the Cougars' gridiron triumphs and the triumphant progression of the restored Church.<br><br>The poet Wallace Stevens describes as the "blessed rage for order" our inborn human need for orderly, predictable, and stable patterns to offset disorder and uncertainty (Wallace Stevens, "The Idea of Order at Key West,"<i>The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry,</i>eds. Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair [New York: W. W. Norton &amp;amp; Company, 1973], pp. 251–52). In fact, patterns order chaos, lessen our concerns with life's mutability, identify progress, promote social happiness, and clothe our lives with a larger sense of continuity and meaning. Patterns help us to promote and maintain our individual and group values. Indeed, wo, wo be unto those who attempt, willfully or inadvertently, to shortcut, skirt, or flout the vital patterns of our codes of law, our social or moral codes of conduct, or etiquette. Such will pay a penalty. Wo be unto the member of Congress who gets caught ignoring the patterns, to the student who audaciously marries two independent clauses with a comma, to the foolish husband who installs a new roll of toilet paper so it unrolls from behind instead of over; and wo be unto those pattern-shattering fast Sunday visitors who invade my ward six minutes early and capture, occupy, and hold my pew in the center section, back row, right aisle, seats 1 and 2. We are indeed pattern-centered and pattern-driven beings.<br><br>I believe such an abundance of patterns reflects not only a divine ordering of existence but provides mortal pattern-seekers with yet another way in which the power of the Godhead can be present with us. I hope this morning to lift your vision beyond the multitude of mundane patterns that drive our dailinesses to more important spiritual patterns, which, though invisible, often become as surprising, clear, and instructive to the pattern-discerner as was the outstretched finger of the Lord to the brother of Jared. I invite you to become for a few minutes a spiritual pattern-tracer of a few of the many divine patterns that can become Liahonas in helping us to define our mortal errand, remind us of our place in the Lord's plan, and enable us to walk through mortality with increased confidence, a clearer sense of purpose, and with deepening faith in the designs of our Heavenly Father.<br><h2><b>Patterns</b></h2><br>A pattern is a model, form, format, template, example, overlay, or paradigm of an object, process, or behavior or of acts or character traits that we deem deserving of imitation and that are arranged so as to enable you or me to follow, reproduce, imitate, replicate, trace, copy, or repeat the qualities or the spiritual characteristics of the original or prototype in a way that remains unchanged and unchanging.<br><br>Divine patterns, then, are the processes, fundamental laws, principles, and truths that the Lord seems to follow in ordering and organizing his heavenly and earthly realms. In revealing these divine patterns to his mortal children, the Lord reveals his patterns of truth and righteousness, which, if identified, understood, followed, traced, copied, or imitated, will give us additional motivation to cleanse our souls of earth-stain, crack through accumulated earth crust, and retrace the patterns to our heavenly home. The Lord showed the Prophet Joseph Smith, in June 1831, the importance he attaches to divine patterns. After revealing his pattern in a few things, he says, "I will give unto you a pattern in all things [in<i>all</i>things], that ye may not be deceived" (D&amp;amp;C 52:14).<br><br>As part of his grand design, you and I are taking our turns on earth. We come to these parentheses in eternity shorn of everything but our customized spiritual DNA, preset to assist us in transforming the human compromise we have become into the men and women of God we formerly were and will yet be. That spirit body within is intuitively analogical; that is, it helps us see similarities or analogies between things around us here on earth and things of the spiritual world--it helps us, in other words, to trace the divine "pattern in all things." The search for divine patterns is grounded in the key pattern, which I will call the All Things Are Spiritual Pattern, for the Lord told the Prophet Joseph, "All things unto me are spiritual" (D&amp;amp;C 29:34). And that same Lord, speaking to Moses as Jehovah, explains not only that "all things . . . are spiritual," but reveals that "all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me . . . ; things . . . above and beneath: all things bear record of me" (Moses 6:63). This world becomes, for the spiritual man and woman, a kind of Urim and Thummim that enables those who allow themselves to be schooled by the Holy Ghost to look at the earth and its inhabitants through spiritual spectacles. Gradually we begin to discern divine patterns everywhere, especially in the holy scriptures--God's great pattern book--and in the words of his contemporary prophets, seers, and revelators--his divine Butterick, Vogue, or McCall's compendium of patterns. It is for us to trace, cut, and test those patterns in the fabric of our own mortal experiences.<br><h2><b>The Plan of Salvation: Journey Pattern</b></h2><br>Although each of you has had similar experiences with divine patterns, let me share with you the continuing impact of such a divine pattern on my life. When I was fourteen, I stumbled, one long Sunday afternoon, into my own sacred grove, a mysterious book called the Pearl of Great Price. Intrigued by the delicious promise of the book with its strange hieroglyphs, and able to attach its teaching to the frame I had read not long before in Nephi Anderson's early Mormon novel<i>Added Upon,</i>I read all afternoon, engrossed by an illuminating glimpse into the plan of salvation and redemption of humankind as told by the metaphor or pattern of a journey from eternity to eternity. Since that long-ago afternoon, my glimpse has expanded and deepened into a pattern in which I see myself trekking the plains of mortality as a heaven-directed pioneer or as a mariner on a heaven-bound voyage. I'm 61 years out, with a great mate and a fine crew; the sea is often rough, but I'm confident of the charts, certain of the polestar, sure of the location of our home port, and looking forward to seeing an increasing number of my fellow earth-farers who have already reached port.<br><br>Last July, as my wife and I visited in Ravensburg, Germany, with a long-on-the-verge-of-baptism friend, I began once more to sketch out for him this Journey Pattern of the plan of salvation. His wife laughed and brought him an envelope containing the felt cutouts we use so often in teaching the plan. She said, "It's this plan that so attracts him to Mormonism; he uses these figures to teach it to all our friends."<br><br>Clearly moved, our dryland Mormon friend looked us directly in the eyes and said, "Dieser Plan ist fantastisch!"<br><br>I warned him that such faith in the plan would soon bring him into the waters of baptism; and it will. The plan, made so vivid and meaningful when depicted as a Journey Pattern, is simply<i>fantastisch!</i><br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><center><i>The Plan of Salvation as a Journey Pattern</i><br>HOME<br>Preparation<br>Call to Mortality<br>Veil<br>__________________Initiation<br>Experience<br>Adversity/Trials<br>Belly of the Whale<br>Humility<br>Obedience<br>Sacrifice<br>Spiritual Refinement<br>Increasing Confidence<br>Accomplishment<br>Enlightenment<br>Continuing Trials, Final Tests<br>Enduring to the End<br>__________________</center>Veil<br>HOME<br><i>Journey Mentor: Holy Ghost</i><br><br>Reared in a heavenly home by the noblest of parents, we are called to leave our safe place and undertake a potentially dangerous mission to earth, where we will be tried and tested in the school of life to see if we can be, as Brigham Young put it, "righteous in the dark" (Brigham Young's secretary's journal, 28 January 1857 [LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City]). Our spirits confined in a mortal body, the veil drawn across our memories of our earlier life, we are humbled and must place total trust in earthly parents. We undergo growth and development amidst hard-won experience, pain, adversity, and, occasionally, pleasure. We learn, test, and try principles and patterns. We plunge into the belly of the whale, from which most of us emerge only because of a helping hand from the Holy Ghost and from fellow travelers acting in his stead. As we heed the promptings of this divine mentor, we achieve a degree of faith as well as spiritual and intellectual enlightenment. In time, as seasoned pattern-readers and veterans of the journey, we reach a mortal maturity and enjoy a spiritual wisdom commensurate to our effort and to our response to the Holy Spirit. Our vision clearing, though still circumscribed, we become confident in our patterns. Then finals begin--the concluding mortal tests that may involve failing health and most certainly the grand test of enduring to the end. Withstanding the trials and overcoming the flesh, we turn at last into safe port, where we are welcomed as accomplished veterans who have been proven in a journey that has been customized to our capacities. At that reunion, the Lord himself will be the "keeper of the gate," for "he employeth no servant there" (2 Nephi 9:41). We hope to hear the greeting "Well done, thou good and faithful servant" (Matthew 25:21)--but for me it will suffice if he simply says "<i>fantastisch!</i>"<br><h2><b>The Awake and Arise Pattern</b></h2><br>Just as seeing the pattern of the journey makes the far-reaching plan of salvation very clear and personal for you and me, so the Awake and Arise Pattern shows how God reaches out of eternity to call his prophets to the ministry. Note how this Awake and Arise Pattern, seen so clearly in the life of Joseph Smith, Jr., is wonderfully like the initiating call to the ministry traced out by Jesus of Nazareth some 1900 years earlier, although in a desert instead of a grove.<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><center><i>Awake and Arise Pattern</i><br>His Soul Hungered<br>Brokenhearted and Contrite<br>"Enter into Thy Closet"<br>Prayer of Faith<br>Enter Satan<br>The Belly of the Whale<br>The Cry for Help<br>Release from the Dark Powers<br>The Theophany<br>The Call</center>In tracing this pattern note how Joseph's experience may parallel your own experiences and those of the prophets:<br><br>1. His soul hungered: Joseph, confused, seeks light and knowledge from the Lord.<br><br>2. Brokenhearted and contrite, he humbly acknowledges his dependency on God and turns to the Holy Bible, where he finds another pattern: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5).<br><br>3. Commanded to "enter into thy closet" (Matthew 6:6), Joseph seeks a solitary place where he can pray.<br><br>4. In the grove he pours out a prayer of faith to his God.<br><br>5. Enter Satan, to tempt and to try: "I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me."<br><br>6. He is plunged into the belly of the whale and seized by the blackness of the darkness: "It seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction."<br><br>7. Then, from the darkness comes the cry for help and his surrender to the Lord. "Exerting all [his] powers to call upon God to deliver [him]," Joseph reminds us of Alma the Younger's similar cry from a similar abyss: "Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me" (Alma 36:18).<br><br>8. Then comes the release from the dark powers: "I found myself delivered from the enemy."<br><br>9. Next is the theophany, the appearance of the Father and the Son, "whose brightness and glory defy all description." The Son is introduced, according to pattern, with the echoing and familiar words: "This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!" Then comes the call, and with it the flood of light and pure knowledge that will change his life--and ours--forever.<br><br>10. The boy, awakened from his mortal stupor, arises from his knees a man of God. He leaves the shelter of the grove to face the world and begin his ministry. (See JS--H 1:8–20.)<br><br>Hold on, folks! There is more. This Awake and Arise Pattern is a revelator rich with meaning. Not only does the pattern hold true for the call to prophethood of Jesus of Nazareth and Joseph Smith, but the pattern is almost exactly replicated in the callings of Enoch, the brother of Jared, Abraham, Moses, Enos, Alma the Younger, and Paul. And when we overlay the pattern on what details we can glean about the callings of Adam, Noah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Samuel, Malachi, Lehi, Nephi, Jacob, Peter, James, John, and Wilford Woodruff, to name a few, it seems safe to assume they were likewise so called by the Lord to their respective ministries. And, given the responsibility of prophets and apostles to bear<i>personal</i>witness of the Lord, I believe we can assume that the prophets, seers, and revelators of all dispensations, including our present apostles and prophets, have traced the Awake and Arise Pattern in their lives.<br><br>There is yet another level to this pattern: Look in the mirror and you will realize that you and I and every soul born again to become a witness for Jesus Christ and the restoration of the gospel has been ministered to in our own sacred groves by the Holy Ghost, a member of the Godhead. Awakening and arising to our own calls to serve, we trace the pattern to find the results much as Alma described them some 75 years before Christ's birth: "Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God[,] . . . their souls . . . illuminated by the light of the everlasting word" (Alma 5:7).<br><br>My colleague, Professor Bruce W. Jorgensen, captures in a moving folk ballad called "The Light Come Down" my own joy in the divine order and continuity of the Awake and Arise Pattern as it occurred in Joseph Smith's experience and as it has recurred across the millennia:<br><br><i>Just a dusty country boy<br>Praying in the trees,<br>Knocked out flat and speechless,<br>Again up on his knees</i><br><i>And the light come down,</i><br><i>Lord, the light come down.</i><br><br><i>Sharper than suns he sweated in,<br>It slapped that April mud,<br>It withered the one that threatened him<br>And stunned him where he stood.</i><br><i>Yes, the light come down,</i><br><i>Lord, it did come down.</i><br><br><i>And he was just fourteen,</i><br><i>Mixed up, and read your book</i><br><i>And took you at your word</i><br><i>and asked--and Lord,</i><br><i>You let the light come down,</i><br><i>O Lord, a comin down.</i><br><br><i>Old Adam had a farmer's son<br>And Abraham did too--<br>All made of mud but you made em good<br>And brought em home to you,</i><br><i>For the light come down,</i><br><i>It always did come down.</i><br><br><i>So Lord look down on country boys<br>That stink and puzzle and pray,<br>And strike the light to blind their sight<br>And make their night your day.</i><br><i>O let the light come down,</i><br><i>Yes, bring the light on down.</i><br><br><i>And bless you, Lord, for country boys,<br>Each hungry mother's son<br>Treading the furrow his father plowed<br>Just like your single son</i><br><i>When you and him come down,</i><br><i>When you the light come down.</i><br><br>[Bruce W. Jorgensen, "The Light Come Down," in<i>Harvest: Contemporary Mormon Poems</i>, eds. Eugene England and Dennis Clark (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1989), pp. 260–61]<br><h2><b>An Evening at the Luzern Opera</b></h2><br>With you, I have observed the Awake and Arise Pattern followed in the birthing process of those being born again. In fact, most of us have experienced this patterned process ourselves. The mission field is the great delivery room for the souls of men and women, and the mission field is all around us. When we are able to bring the pattern of our own gifts of the Spirit to the assistance of someone tracing the Born-Again or Awake and Arise Pattern, the convergence is memorable. I participated in such a divinely engineered convergence in the early spring of 1988 at the Luzern Opera House in Switzerland.<br><br>The office staff of the Switzerland Zürich Mission had taken the evening off to enjoy a performance of Verdi's<i>Rigoletto.</i>We were the guests of LDS baritone Brian Montgomery, who would be singing the role of Rigoletto.<br><br>Following the first act, the manager of the theater made his way to our little group chatting in the foyer. Looking at my name tag, he asked if I were the "Herr Präsident of the Mormon Church."<br><br>Bemused at my sudden elevation, I affirmed that I was indeed the "Herr Präsident of the Mormon Church's Swiss Mission."<br><br>He explained that Herr Montgomery had requested our services and then asked with some urgency that I accompany him, which I did, taking my assistants, Elders Steven McGhie and Scott Smith, with me. As we made our way backstage to the women's dressing room, he explained that Miss Marina Jajic, the soprano playing the role of Gilda, had become seriously ill and would be unable to continue her performance. He had been about to call the house physician but was prevented by "Herr Montgomery, of your faith," he explained, "who insists that the Präsident of the Mormon Church say a prayer over Miss Jajic and make her well--so, if you would be so kind . . ."<br><br>Suddenly apprehensive, we followed him into a corner of the dressing room where Miss Jajic--an attractive, heavily made-up, and deathly pale young woman--sat slumped in a corner chair looking like a Gilda who had already fallen victim to the assassin's dagger. I introduced ourselves to her and learned from her labored and whispered responses in broken German that she was from Yugoslavia, spoke little German but more English, believed in Jesus Christ, and, yes, she knew he could heal her. She slumped back against the chair, and Elder McGhie anointed her head<i></i>with oil from a key-chain vial.<br><br>It was a scenario at once strange yet familiar. Here, in a woman's dressing room in a Swiss opera house, an American LDS mission president from Provo, together with two Mormon elders from Alpine, Utah, and Bettendorf, Iowa, were unexpectedly retracing the Lord's pattern of the laying on of hands to administer to the sick in behalf of a deathly ill Roman Catholic soprano from Yugoslavia who desperately needed to be made well on this important evening of her musical career.<br><br>We laid on hands, anointed, and then sealed the anointing according to the ancient pattern, which I had traced several hundred times before. I had come to know my gift and what I might expect. I brought to that moment a confidence in a long-established pattern of blessing the Saints. As I began the sealing portion of the ordinance, I was unsettled by the distracting hubbub of the busy dressing room, for I feared that the Spirit would not come with the power I had been pleading for in the last few minutes. Suddenly someone turned off the hubbub switch, and I felt, moving through my hands and up my arms, a tingling faith flowing from this woman. Simultaneously I felt the old, familiar "Go": the thrill up the spine, the electric flash across the forehead, the chill across my shoulder blades--signs I had known well and often. I knew my role; I stepped back and let the Spirit take command. From some recess in my soul the words welled up to give utterance and translation into English of those clear but ineffable impressions affirmed by the Holy Ghost in behalf of this lovely, talented, and deathly ill woman, who looked like one who ought to be on the way to the hospital and not into the rigors of act 2. Then I heard myself say, "It is the will of God, Marina, that you be healed, at once! Be healed!" And then: "You will begin to regain strength immediately; you will experience an amazing recovery; and you will not only continue your performance this evening, but you will sing and act magnificently." Then, the words of healing pronounced, I suddenly saw on my internal video the implications of this evening; I saw that all that had happened, including our presence at that theater on that night, was also part of the Awake and Arise Pattern that, unbeknown to Marina, she was even now beginning to trace. The mission president reasserted himself, and I editorialized: "As you reflect later on the miracle of this evening, you will understand that this blessing comes by way of the power of God through his Son, Jesus Christ, whose representatives we are. And you will desire to learn about Christ's purposes for you in mortality and will seek out his Church, which has been restored to earth for the purpose of blessing you and all mankind."<br><br>I concluded the administration. Then someone turned the switch and the hubbub, which apparently had never stopped, flowed about us once again. Marina did not take up her bed and walk. Instead, she mumbled her thanks, her eyes still partially closed, her face pallid. As we turned away, the hand-wringing manager asked if I would be offended if he allowed the house doctor to treat her. "No, of course not," I replied, but to myself I thought, still in tune with the Spirit and confident in the well-tried pattern, "She won't need him; she's going to recover--now."<br><br>Then, like Peter, my stroll across the water was threatened by the storms of reality, and my spirit collided with my soul. I nearly staggered with the realization of what I--or somebody--had just promised. And the raised eyebrows of my two assistants said, "President, you just promised this woman that she will sing act 2. What have you done?"<br><br>As we left the dressing room, I said to them, "Elders, I said only what the Lord told me to say; let's pray he'll make it happen."<br><br>We made our way back to our seats, reassured the others in our party, and requested their faith--right now--on Miss Jajic's behalf. I began to pray--hard, intensely, and invoking the priesthood--that the Lord would honor at once the very specific promises I had made in his name and by his promptings. In a few minutes the manager appeared on stage to explain the delay by announcing that Miss Jajic had been taken seriously ill and that he had sent for her second; he requested our patience. I prayed harder, my weak faith warring with my confidence in the Lord's proven gift.<br><br>After an interminable five-minute wait, the manager reappeared. "I am pleased to announce," he beamed, "that Miss Jajic has recovered and will be able to continue in her role as Gilda." The curtain went up, and Marina swirled onto the stage as the vivacious Gilda and sang her way into our hearts. I sat all amazed and thanked the Lord for his gracious intervention. As we applauded her performance, I was cheering our Father for his class act in stretching his welcome finger into our little scenario and repeating his patterns. For her part, Marina performed marvelously, as did our Mormon baritone, but I thought she looked a trifle too convincing in her death scene. We learned later that she went home to bed and collapsed for several days.<br><br>The encore to that evening was just another everyday miracle of just another child of God tracing the Awake and Arise Pattern. Marina, soon recovered and very much aware of the miracle that had occurred, began to ask Brother Montgomery during rehearsals exactly what had happened that Monday evening. Unwilling at first to attend church, Marina agreed to accompany the Montgomerys to a ward dinner at the Luzern chapel. Impressed by the Latter-day Saints' welcome and by the Montgomerys' deep faith, she continued to ask questions during rehearsals, when there was little time for him to respond. So the next week Brian and Jenny invited Marina to dinner, where, he promised, "We'll answer all of your questions about Mormonism." That Friday at dinnertime, two sister missionaries "just happened by" and were persuaded to stay for dinner and teach Marina the gospel. In June 1988, two months after that very special night at the opera, Marina Jajic awoke and arose to membership in the Church of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>The One Step into the Dark Pattern</b></h2><br>One of the patterns that has guided me in exercising personal faith first smacked me in the right eye as a young missionary. Only later did I understand that the One Step into the Dark Pattern recurs often in the scriptures and in our daily lives. President Harold B. Lee named it best when he taught us to "walk to the edge of the light, and perhaps a few steps into the darkness, and you will find that the light will appear and move ahead of you" (quoted by Boyd K. Packer,<i>The Holy Temple</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1980], p. 184). That step into the dark is the start-up key to an act of faith. Thus the brother of Jared prepared 16 stones and, from the darkness of mortality but with the brightness of faith, asked, "Touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness" (Ether 3:4). And the Lord flooded Mahonri Moriancumer and his people with light. It is a pattern: Faith precedes the miracle, just as it did when Peter forgot himself and stepped out of that ship and into the darkness to walk upon the sea (see Matthew 14:29).<br><h2><b>The Contact Lens</b></h2><br>So it was, in a much diminished but no less important way for me, when, on a rainy summer afternoon in 1958, I unwittingly traced the One Step into the Dark Pattern while tracting along a gravel road on a hillside above Baden, Switzerland. As we walked from home to home, I was suddenly laid low by a speck of dust in my right eye. I learned, as one who had worn brand-new contact lenses for only five days, that a mote feels like a beam. I quickly extracted the lens, cleaned it, and prepared to reinsert it. As I held my finger at the ready, a gust of wind swept the lens from my fingertip. My lens was gone with the wind, and I was aghast--and virtually blind, being plunged instantly into 20/600 vision in one eye, which had been miraculously corrected only a week earlier to 20/20.<br><br>Elder Neil Reading and I began to search on hands and knees in the wet gravel, sweeping an eight-foot radius about my point of loss; we searched unsuccessfully for twenty minutes. Half-blind and half-despairing, I suggested that while we were already in position, we should pray. I reasoned with the Lord, told him about my need to see; about our need to meet our three investigator families that evening; about my feeling that there was more to be gained by finding the lens than by my learning whatever I was to learn from the loss. As I concluded the prayer and stood up, I received one of those Joseph Smith "flashes of intelligence." It surprised me, but I reacted at once. Explaining the plan to my startled companion, I stood on my feet in the same place I had stood earlier, squeezed out my left contact lens, and was plunged into the distorted virtual blindness of 20/600 vision. I had begun my step into the dark.<br><br>Assured that my companion was on his knees and at the ready, I put my left lens in my mouth, extracted it, and, mounting it on my finger some six inches from my face, I waited--but not for long. A slight breeze caught my left lens, and it was gone: my step into the dark was now complete. I stood stock-still, heart in throat, until Elder Reading said, "I see it. It's still in the air."<br><br>"Don't lose it," I pled.<br><br>"It's still up," he whispered, now 10 feet away. Then, from even further away, he exclaimed, "It's starting to fall!"<br><br>"Keep your eye on it," I pled again.<br><br>"I see it! I see it!" he said. There was a long pause and then, "Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!"<br><br>I braced.<br><br>"Oh my gosh," he said, "it's landed, and"--pause . . . pause . . . pause--"it's landed almost right on top of the other lens!"<br><br>"You see the other lens?" I shouted.<br><br>"Yes, it's right here!"<br><br>Unable to see a thing, I crawled over to him. Slowly, he planted in my palm, in order, my left and right lenses--my seer stones. I wet the lenses and, with my back to the wind and sheltered by my companion's hovering frame, I implanted them: "And there was light, and it was good." And we knelt, and full of gratitude I thanked our God for tender mercies. We pressed on to the next house, filled with wonder at a God who knows each sparrow's fall<i>and</i>the exact whereabouts in Switzerland of Elder Cracroft's right contact lens.<br><h2><b>The Bread Cast Upon Waters Reverberation Pattern</b></h2><br>There is more. (There always is.) The test of a divine pattern is this: An act of divine intervention, when acknowledged as such and testified of, will, like the proverbial bread cast upon the waters, come back after many days to testify, bless, and re-bless, for it witnesses an eternally re-greening and re-blossoming truth. It is a pattern. So Christ becomes alive in us as we bear witness, in any age. So this little contact lens story has reverberated in at least two ways and surprised me both times.<br><h3><strong><i>Reverberation One</i></strong></h3><br>On the Sunday after the event, I told the contact lens experience to the members of the Wettingen Branch, over which I presided. The Saints, who had witnessed my visual difficulties up close and shared my joy in my newfound vision, reverberated with the larger meanings of the incident and apparently told it to others. In 1986, 28 years later, I returned to Switzerland as mission president. As President Peter Lauener introduced Janice and me to the Bern stake conference, he surprised us: "We all have known about President Cracroft for many years," he said. "He it is, brothers and sisters, who as a young missionary here in Switzerland exercised faith and found his lost contact lens." Many in the congregation nodded in recognition.<br><br>I was dumbfounded. He turned to me and said for all to hear, "Over many years, that story has been told and retold in all our meetings as an illustration of the necessary steps to faith." Suddenly I understood that young Elder Cracroft had unwittingly cast his burden on the Lord by taking an inspired and faith-impelled step into the dark. I wondered if President Cracroft, at 50, still possessed that same simple faith.<br><h3><strong><i>Reverberation Two</i></strong></h3><br>In January 1994, on the day after our 25-year-old daughter and bride of one short year died suddenly, naturally, and without warning--and my wife and I were plunged into the belly of the whale--I received a letter from a former Swiss-Austrian missionary living in Salt Lake City. He knew nothing of our sorrow, of course. He said he had recently read my name on an article and was writing to inquire if I was the same Elder Cracroft he had known briefly in 1958, at the beginning of his mission and near the end of mine. He said he had been deeply impressed by a story I had told at a missionary conference about losing and recovering a contact lens. He had related the incident often over the years and hoped he had told it accurately. He then repeated the story as he recalled it. Although I had not told it in a long time, I was amazed that he had captured it exactly as I recollected it and as I just told it.<br><br>The reverberation resounded in my ears. In his letter I read my own story in tears of joy amidst my tears of grief. His retelling us that story 36 years later, at the darkest moment of our lives, was no coincidence. Janice and I had received a message from the Lord reminding us that he was there with us at the fall of our dear sparrow, just as he had been there with me on that long-ago hillside. He was reminding us that this was merely another obstacle on our salvation journey; that all things, including our daughter and ourselves, were in his hands; and that we should press on, confident that, as Lehi says, "All things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things" (2 Nephi 2:24). Who knows, perhaps this twice-told tale may take on new life in the soul of someone in this congregation who needs to hear that message.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>The few patterns we have traced this morning suggest yet other patterns, for they are to be found everywhere, all related to each other and founded in eternal truth. Recently, while reading 3 Nephi for Gospel Doctrine class, it occurred to me that the coming of the Lord to the Nephite survivors retraces on a larger scale the Awake and Arise Pattern with its trials, Satanic intrusion, and belly of the whale nadir, culminating in the appearance of the Lord. But as I traced this pattern among the Nephites, it occurred to me that the pattern of the Lord's appearance in the New World foreshadows, clarifies, and orders what we know about the second coming of the Lord as it will occur. Knowing this Appearance Pattern as described by Nephi will strengthen us in the day of Christ's coming, when we who trace patterns will be able to comfort our families and cry out to our neighbors in the great dark like a television weatherman: "The worst is over, folks! We're calling for three days of darkness, for voices to begin soon, for the light to return, for our God to introduce his Beloved Son, as he always does--and then the King of Kings will appear and wipe away our tears." It is all in the Lord's pattern book.<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br><center><i>The Parallel Pattern:<br>Christ's Appearance to the Nephites and<br>the Second Coming of the Lord</i><br>A Voice of Warning<br>The Great Sign<br>Irrefutable Signs Witnessed<br>The Righteous Minority<br>Satan Sows Confusion<br>The Lord Counterattacks<br>The Bitter Struggle Ensues<br>The Signs Suddenly Realized<br>The Voice<br>Morning Breaks<br>The Lord Comes to His Temple<br>The Witnesses<br>The Ministry of Jesus Christ</center>Seeking and finding the Lord's "pattern in all things" can be, then, a rewarding and important spiritual discipline on the way to becoming, as Christ charged us to be, "even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27). All other patterns are subordinate to this grand pattern of Jesus Christ. Brigham Young taught that "the greatest mystery a man ever learned, is to know how to . . . bring every faculty and power of the [human mind] in[to] subjection to Jesus Christ" (<i>JD</i>1:46). We learn that discipline by tracing his divine pattern, which he teaches at every opportunity and in every setting, of following and teaching all men and women, everywhere, the intensifying, incremental, and upward-spiraling pattern of faith, repentance, baptism, renewal, and--hand-in-hand with the Holy Spirit--enduring to the end in discovering more and more divine patterns through knowing and following that other grand pattern: "He that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24). May he hasten that day for each of us, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Richard H.
