<h1>ptures: How Knoweth This Man Letters - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Elder Bateman:</b> Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to see the large number gathered this morning in the Marriott Center as Sister Bateman and I extend our welcome at the beginning of a new year. The attendance at the devotionals during the last semester was exceptional as many students, faculty, and staff responded to the challenge given on that fateful day, September 11th. The devotionals are an important part of the BYU experience. They add significantly to the Spirit on campus and provide a weekly opportunity for all to ponder the meaning of life and reflect on ways in which we may improve. I encourage everyone to recommit to attend this semester. Safeguard the 11 a.m. hour each Tuesday to be in the Marriott Center.<br><br>Today Sister Bateman and I wish to focus on the Savior and the process by which He grew spiritually during His mortal sojourn. The process He followed is no different than the one He has asked us to follow. We hope the presentation will inspire and motivate you to apply the principles outlined.<br><br>In the rural towns of Galilee, Jesus often frequented the synagogues and took occasion to teach. He also was well-known as a teacher at the temple in Jerusalem. Each time He taught, those who listened were astonished by His knowledge of the scriptures, the clarity of His doctrine, and the authority with which He spoke. The impact of His teaching is typified by the words of Mark. Mark recorded that during the early part of the Savior's ministry, Jesus went "straightway on the sabbath day . . . into the synagogue, and taught. And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes" (Mark 1:21–22).<br><br>Jesus' first opportunity to teach in the temple at Jerusalem occurred when He was still a boy. At 12 years of age, He accompanied His parents to the Feast of the Passover to celebrate Israel's deliverance from Egypt. When the time came to return home, Joseph and Mary believed that He was with relatives in another part of the company. After a day's journey they learned that He was not with their kinsfolk, and they returned to Jerusalem to find Him. After three days of searching, they located Him in the temple, "sitting in the midst of the doctors, and they were hearing him, and asking him questions. And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding, and answers" (JST Luke 2:41–47).<br><br>Even at 12 years of age, His spiritual understanding and maturity were well beyond His years. Eighteen years later, again at Passover, Jesus entered the temple at Jerusalem. On this occasion He cleansed the temple of those selling merchandise and taught the gathered Jews about His atonement, death, and resurrection by citing scripture (see John 2:13–22). Even those closest to Him, however, did not understand the full import of His sermon until after the Resurrection. But again, they were amazed with His knowledge of the doctrine. On another occasion Jesus returned to Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of the Tabernacles. Again He taught at the temple. John recorded that the "Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" (John 7:15).<br><br>What was meant by this paradoxical question? On the one hand, Jesus demonstrated the same knowledge as a man of letters; but on the other, He had never learned. What did the Jews mean when they said, "How knoweth this man letters?" Those who interacted with Jesus quickly grasped that He was fully conversant with the law, the scriptures, and the doctrine. His knowledge of the prophets and their words exceeded that of the Pharisees and Scribes as He confounded them on numerous occasions. On the other hand, the Jews saw Him as one "having never learned." What did they mean by this phrase? Jesus, unlike Paul, had not sat at the feet of Gamaliel or any other celebrated teacher. He had not been a student in the Jewish system of higher education. Therefore, how could He have acquired such profound knowledge?<br><br>Today Sister Bateman and I will address the question of how Jesus grew spiritually and illustrate the importance of searching and pondering the scriptures as part of not only Jesus' spiritual growth process but our own. First, Sister Bateman will discuss three ways by which Jesus grew spiritually. Second, I will illustrate the importance of searching and pondering the scriptures as part of the growth process--a process that each one of us must also attempt. Actually there is a fourth element that contributed to Jesus' spiritual maturation that will not be discussed today. It is the Atonement. The Apostle Paul said that Jesus "learned . . . obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8).<sup>1</sup> In other words, the atoning process was an incredible learning experience. But that is a subject for another day.<br><br><b>Sister Bateman:</b> Brothers and sisters, I also extend my welcome this morning. A new year and a new semester present opportunities to rededicate our efforts to become more Christlike, to lift others, to lighten burdens, and to increase faith. My subject today concerns the steps taken by the Savior that increased His spiritual understanding and faith. Just as the Lord's physical growth followed a natural sequence, so did His spiritual progress, although the latter was accelerated. What were the key elements that defined the Savior's growth? As John the Baptist stated, "He received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace" (D&amp;amp;C 93:13). In a similar vein, Luke stated that as Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, He also "increased . . . in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). What was the process?<br><br>First, like every child, He was taught by His parents. Joseph and Mary had been specially prepared to teach Him. He was in their home and under their tutelage for more than half of His life. They had special knowledge concerning His identity and earthly ministry (see Matthew 1:19–21; Luke 1:29–38). Both of them knew of His divine Sonship. They had been taught by the angel Gabriel of His mission and destiny. They had been taught about His atonement and that He was the Messiah about whom there had been prophecies for centuries. And Mary knew that His mercy and salvation would last "from generation to generation" (Luke 1:50). With little doubt Mary and Joseph were knowledgeable and highly effective teachers during the Savior's early years.<br><br>Second, knowing the identity of His Father and His purpose on earth, it is reasonable to assume that Jesus learned much through prayer and the power of the Holy Ghost. Undoubtedly He was taught to pray as a young boy--a practice He continued in adulthood. The importance of prayer in His life is illustrated by the fact that His ministry began with 40 days of prayer and fasting in the wilderness and concluded with a night of agony and prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane. Often He sought the privacy of the mountains to pray. After one of those private moments, a disciple, having watched Him, pleaded, "Lord, teach us to pray" (Luke 11:1). Jesus clearly pointed out to His listeners that the doctrine He taught was not His but came from God. Only through prayer and the Holy Ghost could He have known this truth. Jesus received the Holy Ghost following baptism and heard His Father's voice declare His divine Sonship. Luke recorded that "the heaven was opened" at this time, which suggests that the Father and the Son enjoyed a close working relationship (Luke 3:21).<br><br>The Apostle John speaks of this relationship as follows: "God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand" (John 3:34–35). In other words, Jesus was given "a fulness of the Holy Ghost" following His baptism, indicating that access to the Father was uninhibited (D&amp;amp;C 109:15). The Savior's learning process was orderly in that He received "line upon line, precept upon precept," but the process was accelerated and highly compressed because of His righteousness, talents, and capacities. In contrast, our learning is also "line upon line, precept upon precept," but we are given "here a little and there a little" (2 Nephi 28:30). We are not given all things at once. In contrast to the Savior's experience, the Holy Ghost is given "by measure" to us, and our access to spiritual truth increases as we increase in faith, repent of our sins, and learn to be obedient. For us a lifetime or more may be required to receive the Holy Ghost in its fulness. But again, like the Savior, we do have access to the Holy Ghost to help us grow spiritually.<br><br>Third, Jesus was a student of the scriptures. I believe that scriptural study was a major contributor to His knowledge of spiritual truths. If He was to understand our learning process in mortality so that He could succor us, then it was essential that He learn in like manner. The evidence is strong that He was diligent in searching the scriptures prior to His ministry. Jesus' first sermon in Nazareth is a demonstration of His familiarity with the Old Testament--the scriptures of His day. He deliberately chose Isaiah 61:1–2 to announce His divine Sonship to those in the synagogue. The passage reads:<br><br><i>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</i><br><br><i>To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</i> [Luke 4:18–19]<br><br>Following the reading, Jesus told the congregation that He was the fulfillment of the passage. The Jewish leaders understood the meaning of the verses. They knew that Isaiah's words were a direct reference to the Messiah. For them, Jesus' claim to be the fulfillment was blasphemous. "Is not this Joseph's son?" they declared (Luke 4:22). Jesus then likened Himself to Elijah and Elisha, saying, "No prophet is accepted in his own country" (Luke 4:24–27). The Jews were enraged by His use of the scriptures and attempted to kill Him.<br><br>Another illustration of His familiarity with the scriptures is the story of Jesus and the two men on the road to Emmaus following His crucifixion and resurrection. It was Sunday, the day of the Lord's resurrection, and the two men were discussing the recent events. The Savior approached and joined them. Luke indicated that the eyes of the two men "were holden that they should not know him" (Luke 24:16). Jesus asked them why they were so sad. They in turn questioned Him, suggesting that He must be a stranger in those parts if He was not aware of the events concerning Jesus of Nazareth. The two men then repeated for the Master the particulars of the trial, the crucifixion, and their disappointment in that they had thought Jesus was the one who would redeem Israel. They concluded by telling the story of His reported resurrection. Women of their company visited the tomb early that morning and found it empty. Angels reportedly told them that Jesus was alive. They were astonished by the women's report and did not know what to make of it. After listening to their recitation, Jesus said:<br><br><i>O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</i><br><br><i>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</i><br><br><i>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them</i> in all the scriptures <i>the things concerning himself.</i> [Luke 24:25–27; emphasis added]<br><br>Jesus used the scriptures to teach the two disciples the purpose of His mission and the necessity of His death and resurrection as part of the plan of salvation. The prophetic words of all the Lord's servants had pointed to these three days. All of the prophets from Moses to Malachi had looked forward to the atoning events and had written about them. Later that evening, after the scales had fallen from their eyes and they recognized their Master and Lord, Jesus vanished from their sight. The two men then said: "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and <i>while he opened to us the scriptures?"</i> (Luke 24:32; emphasis added).<br><br>Jesus knew the scriptures. His familiarity with them was earned through study and prayer. He became a student as a boy, and familiarity with the scriptures increased throughout His life. He was the Jehovah of the Old Testament. The heavens were opened to Him because of His righteousness, and His understanding of and familiarity with the scriptures came quickly through prayer and the Holy Ghost.<br><br>I testify, brothers and sisters, that scriptural study was a key element in the Savior's growth from "grace to grace" (D&amp;amp;C 93:13). Likewise, time invested in the scriptures will pay huge dividends for us. Our spiritual progress will be shaped by our familiarity with God's words as revealed through the prophets. May each of us commit a few minutes daily to that study is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><b>Elder Bateman:</b> Jesus was not only a student of the scriptures Himself, but He commanded that we join with Him in that pursuit. He said, "Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).<br><br>From the beginning of time God has directed the affairs of His children in mortality through prophets. Their inspiration has been written down for the benefit of the believer. According to the Apostle Paul, these written words have been passed from one generation to another for the purpose of declaring "doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (2 Timothy 3:16), or, as Christ said, for a testimony of His divinity and understanding of His mission that we might "have eternal life" (John 5:39). By illustration and commentary I wish to help you to appreciate the spiritual power and understanding that await you if you are willing to pay the price of becoming a diligent student of the scriptures.<br><br>In a direct statement to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord declared why reading and studying the scriptures can be a revelatory experience. In section 18 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord, speaking of the Book of Mormon and all scripture, said:<br><br><i>These words are not of men nor of man, but of me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me. . . .</i><br><br><i>For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit . . . and by my power you can read them one to another. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words.</i> [D&amp;amp;C 18:34–36]<br><br>In this passage the Lord states that when reading the scriptures one may hear His voice, feel His Spirit, and know His words.<br><br>Now I turn to the New Testament and the Gospel of John, where we will examine a few scriptures and ponder their meaning in order to understand better the Apostle's message concerning Christ. All of us are familiar with the four Gospels in the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The first three are known as the synoptic Gospels because they "see alike"--i.e., they are similar in approach and use much of the same material. These three Gospels bear witness of Christ through a narrative beginning with His birth and ending with His death and resurrection. The Gospel of John, on the other hand, is different. Ninety-two percent of the material in John is not found in the other three Gospels. Rather than telling the story of Jesus' life, John employed key events to teach gospel truths.<br><br>The LDS Bible Dictionary indicates that the four books were written for different audiences. The dictionary states:<br><br><i>It appears from the internal evidence of each record that Matthew was written to persuade the Jews that Jesus is the promised Messiah. To do so, he cites several</i> [Old Testament] <i>prophecies and speaks repeatedly of Jesus as the Son of David, thus emphasizing his royal lineage. Mark appeals to a gentile audience and is fast moving, emphasizing the doings more than the sayings of the Lord. . . . Luke offers his readers a polished literary account of the ministry of Jesus, presenting Jesus as the universal Savior of both Jews and gentiles. . . . John's account does not contain much of the fundamental information that the other records contain, and it is evident that he was writing to members of the Church who already had basic information about the Lord. His primary purpose was to emphasize the divine nature of Jesus as the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh.</i> [LDS Bible Dictionary, "Gospels," 683]<br><br>As noted, John appears to have been written for members of the Church who have an understanding of basic gospel principles and of who Jesus is. With this context in mind, what did John want the members of the Church to know? We do not have time today to discuss the entire book, but a brief review of the first five chapters may be helpful in answering the questions.<br><br>The first chapter of John presents testimonies of who Jesus is. Through the Doctrine and Covenants and the Gospel of John we know that the primary testimonies are those of John the Beloved and John the Baptist (see D&amp;amp;C 93:1–18). A knowledge of the Godhead and the plan of salvation is required to appreciate fully the messages given in this chapter. The first verse of John 1 indicates that Jesus was in the beginning, that He was with God, that He was God. To appreciate the meaning of this verse, a knowledge of the premortal world and the relationship between the Father and the Son is necessary. Jesus was the Firstborn in the spirit and lived in the world of spirits with the Father before coming to earth. Because of His righteousness, the light within Him, and His anointing, He was a God. As such, Jesus was the Creator of all things, as noted in the third verse. We know through other scriptures, including modern revelation, that Jesus did create all things under the direction of the Father (see Hebrews 1:2; Moses 1:32–33).<br><br>Verses 4 through 9 of John 1 state that Jesus is the source of life and light for every man and woman. We know that the Light of Christ is given to every person who comes into the world to help them know right from wrong. We also know through modern revelation that the Light of Christ is the ultimate source of light and energy for the sun, for the stars, and for this earth (see D&amp;amp;C 88:7–10). Jesus is the source of light and life.<br><br>Perhaps the most important verse in chapter 1 is verse 14. It reads: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."<br><br>Only Latter-day Saints fully understand and appreciate the meaning of the phrase "the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh." Jesus as a person in the premortal world was the spirit offspring of heavenly parents. For His earthly parents, however, Jesus had an immortal Father and a mortal mother. Through His mother He received mortal seeds that allowed Him to die. Through His Father He inherited immortal genes that allowed Him to live forever if He so chose. On one occasion He told the Jews, "For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself" (John 5:26). On another occasion Jesus said:<br><br><i>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</i><br><br><i>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</i> [John 10:17–18]<br><br>Although the Romans nailed Jesus to the cross, His death was of His own volition. As Paul said, He had "the power of an endless life" (Hebrews 7:16). He did not have to die. He was the Son of an immortal being. His death was a voluntary sacrifice. From His mother He had the power to lay down His life. From His Father He had the power to take it up again. That is why the Atonement is "infinite and eternal" (Alma 34:10, 14). It was performed by an infinite and eternal being. Although there is much we do not understand about the Atonement, a knowledge of Christ's relationship to the Father clarifies the source of His power to accomplish it. Also, a knowledge of the mortality within Him helps us appreciate the tremendous pain and suffering He endured to atone for our sins (see D&amp;amp;C 19:16–19).<br><br>The first chapter of John concludes with other testimonies that Jesus is the Messiah. John the Baptist identified Jesus as the Lamb of God. In other words, He is the sacrificial lamb for all mankind. Andrew and Philip also bore witness. This wonderful chapter of John 1 is an introduction to Jesus as the Redeemer of the World. It teaches us of His divinity and the source of His power.<br><br>The second chapter is concerned with Jesus' mission and purpose on earth. He is the promised Messiah whose mission is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man"--to accomplish the Atonement (Moses 1:39). Two key statements in the second chapter illustrate that Jesus knew at the beginning of His ministry what the end would be. The story used by John to illustrate these truths is the marriage feast at Cana.<br><br>Jesus and His disciples entered Cana on the third day of the week to attend a marriage celebration to which they had been invited. During the feast the host and hostess ran out of wine. The Savior's mother then approached Jesus and asked for help. His response was: "Woman, what wilt thou have me to do for thee? that will I do; for <i>mine hour</i> is not yet come" (JST John 2:4; emphasis added).<br><br>Jesus agreed to the request made by His mother but noted that His actions would relate to His hour, even though that hour had not yet come. What was Jesus' hour? In numerous references it is the time in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross. His hour is the time during which He performed the Atonement (see John 12:23; 17:1).<br><br>After asking the servants to fill six waterpots to the brim--waterpots used for cleansing and purifying--He told them to "draw out" and take to the governor, who then asked why the "good wine" had been kept until now. John then stated, "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and <i>manifested forth his glory;</i> and his disciples believed on him" (John 2:11; emphasis added).<br><br>As stated earlier, the glory of the Father and the Son is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. How did the conversion of water to wine relate to His hour? What did the conversion signify? What did the wine represent?<br><br>There are a number of parallels that might be drawn. The power to convert water to wine might parallel the power of Christ's atonement to change men and women from mortal to immortal beings, to transform corruptible bodies into incorruptible ones, to create an inseparable connection between body and spirit in the Resurrection (see 1 Corinthians 15:42–44; D&amp;amp;C 93:33–34). In short, the miracle at Cana not only illustrated Christ's power to change the earthly element of water to wine but also His power to "cleanse" and "purify," to lift men and women from mortality to immortality--from an earthly to a celestial state. The miracle was connected with His hour and did show forth His glory.<br><br>The third chapter of John is concerned with the introductory ordinances of the Church. After introducing Christ in chapter 1 and confirming the purpose of His mission in chapter 2, John turned to the basic ordinances required for members to participate in the blessings of the Atonement. The story is that of the Jewish leader Nicodemus coming to Christ by night, asking what he must do in order to enter into the kingdom of God. He is told that he must be born again of water and of the Spirit. He must be baptized by immersion for the remission of sins and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Chapter 4 then describes what a member following baptism should do to stay on the path to eternal life. This chapter tells the story of Christ meeting the Samaritan woman at the well and telling her of living water that quenches one's thirst forever. Christ is the Fountain of Living Waters, and those who drink from His well will never thirst. The water is a symbol for His words, the gospel of Jesus Christ. The water is also linked to the sacrament in our day, which reminds us that we must internalize His words by taking His name upon us and by keeping His commandments.<br><br>The fifth chapter of John is the story of Jesus healing the sick at Bethesda. For me the story has great meaning. The scriptures read:<br><br><i>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</i><br><br><i>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</i><br><br><i>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</i><br><br><i>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</i><br><br><i>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</i><br><br><i>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</i><br><br><i>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</i><br><br><i>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked.</i> [John 5:2–9]<br><br>Why did John include this story in the Gospel? To what ordinance, covenant, or promise does this miracle refer? Will there come a day when Jesus tells each of us to rise, walk, and be made whole? One of the great blessings that awaits all mankind is the glorious Resurrection, the opportunity to be redeemed from the bands of physical death--a time when each person will be given power to restore the "sleeping dust" "unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them" (D&amp;amp;C 138:17). As Jesus lifted the blanket of despair from the lame man, so He will lift the blanket of the grave in a future day, allowing us to rise in a newness of life through the power of His atonement and resurrection. When that day comes, no man or woman will be able to say, "I have no man to help me!" As the lame man at Bethesda was made whole, so we in the Resurrection will experience the greatest healing of all as "spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy" (D&amp;amp;C 93:33).<br><br>The 1883 Carl Heinrich Bloch painting of <i>Christ Healing the Sick at Bethesda</i> now hangs in the BYU Museum of Art. It is a masterpiece. It is a signature piece for this campus as it portrays the Lord as healer and comforter both in time and eternity. I encourage you to visit the museum and see it. I encourage you to ponder its message.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, do you feel the beauty and power of the scriptures? Can you sense the blessings that await if you drink deeply of Christ's living water? Will you set aside a few minutes each day to read from the scriptures and then ponder the meaning of the verses read? When the day comes for us to stand before the keeper of the gate, the Holy One of Israel, it is my prayer that He will not perceive in us a slowness of heart to believe that which the prophets have said. Rather, may He see us as men and women of spiritual letters, having learned day by day over a lifetime. May each of us prepare to meet Him is my prayer in his holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>BYU President Merrill J. Bateman and his wife, Marilyn S.

<h1>he Right Choices - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I express profound gratitude for the privilege and blessing of being with each of you tonight. I thank you for the sacrifice you have made to be here. I know that gathered throughout the world there is a very select group of righteous young men and women who love the Lord and want above all else to obey His commandments. Although this message is being broadcast from Brigham Young University, it is intended to be a personal conversation with you, individually, wherever you are.<br><br>I have been blessed to be in the presence of some of you in smaller groups as I have traveled throughout the world. As I have looked into your faces, I have been touched to the very core of my being. There is a radiance, an excitement, an expression of calm assurance, and, above all, an aura of purity and righteousness that emanate from you. I am not speaking of physical beauty. I am referring to something far more important--the peace and power that radiate from worthy, righteous, purposeful lives. It is here tonight. You can feel it wherever you are.<br><br>You are now making some of the most critically important decisions of your life--decisions that will have a profound influence on your happiness, on what you will become, and on how you will spend eternity. I have humbly, repeatedly sought the help of the Lord to be able to share with you some of the principles that guide correct decisions. I know they are true. They are founded in doctrine, and they have been proven in the crucible of my own life. You do not have the assurance of making the right choices in essential matters without divine guidance. I will give suggestions concerning how that help can be obtained. I have also prayed that somehow, while we are together, you can feel the love of the Lord for you personally, and also that He will convey a message to your mind and heart through the Spirit tailored to your personal needs.<br><br>The spiritual moments in your life will often come in clusters when you feel so occupied that it seems difficult to record them. Yet that special effort is powerfully rewarded when you take a few moments to crystalize in a permanent record the sacred impressions of the Holy Spirit. Begin tonight, even if you have to borrow paper and pencil to do it.<br><br>With all the capacity that I possess, I counsel you to strengthen your testimony that there is in very deed a Heavenly Father who is in total control. You must come to really know God through the scriptures, prayer, and the testimonies of His chosen. Then He can guide you in the application of His teachings in every circumstance. He has a specific plan for your life. He will reveal parts of that plan to you when needed as you seek His guidance with faith and consistent obedience. You may have found portions of it realized already in your life. His Son has made you free--not from the consequences of your acts, but free to make choices. Your Father's eternal purpose is for you to be successful in this mortal experience. Be attentive to the personal guidance given to you through the Holy Spirit. Continue to live worthy to receive it. Record it so that you can fulfill it. Then it will be available throughout your life. I am confident that as you pray for that help, some of it will come while we are together. That instruction will be far more important to you than anything you will hear from me.<br><br>Do you feel overwhelmed, wondering if you can make the correct choices, uncertain of how to proceed? Does trying your best not seem to be good enough? I understand what you are going through. Earlier in my life I have felt the same way. It took me a long time to figure out that part of the plan for our growth on earth is to have periods of life when we have far more important things to do than we can possibly accomplish. You know that feeling when there is more weight on your shoulders than you think you can possibly bear, far more questions than answers. That is a test to teach the importance of establishing priorities. It emphasizes the wondrous treasure of time. When you encounter more vital things to do than you can possibly accomplish yourself, you will learn how the Lord can, through guidance of the Spirit, give you help and assurance. Have you ever had the feeling that the walls are closing in, that you are not in control of your life, that you simply cannot do it? Those feelings of frustration are not from the Lord. They are caused by Satan. He wants you to bolt and run when you encounter a difficult growth challenge. A sacred personal experience may help you.<br><h2><b>Worry Versus Concern</b></h2><br>Some people divert their best efforts from constructive accomplishment by investing them in mental anguish and continual worry. The Lord has taught me a great lesson about worry that I now share with you. After completing meaningful full-time missions, my lovely Jeanene and I were sealed in the temple. We began life together with every expectation of happiness. I was blessed through the kindness of the Lord to obtain a job in a new, highly developmental pioneer effort to place a nuclear power plant in a submarine. The work was fascinating, challenging, and absorbing. When combined with the natural growth experiences that come with the formation of a new family and Church assignments, I found each day filled to overflowing.<br><br>Within eight months I was being examined by a doctor to determine if I had ulcers. For weeks I returned home from work each night with a severe headache, and only after long, quiet periods of isolation could I calm my nerves sufficiently to sleep briefly and return to work the next day. I began to prayerfully consider my plight. All I wanted to do was to be a worthy husband and father and honorably carry out my Church and professional assignments. Yet my best efforts produced frustration, worry, and illness. In time the Lord led me to a solution. I was prompted to divide mentally--and physically, where possible--all of the challenges, tasks, and assignments given to me into two categories. All of the things for which I felt responsibility but for which I could do nothing to resolve I put in a basket called "worry." Then all of those things for which I had some ability to control or resolve I put into a basket called "concern." I realized I could not resolve those things in the worry basket, so I tried hard to forget them. Later in the process I learned that putting them into the worry basket didn't mean they wouldn't be taken care of. They were resolved by those who could best handle them--and most often that was the Lord Himself. The items in the concern basket were ordered in priority. I conscientiously tried to resolve them to the best of my ability. Although I could not always fulfill all of them on schedule or to the degree of competence I desired, I did my conscientious best.<br><br>As I was learning to control worry, occasionally I would feel my stomach muscles tighten and tension overcome me. I would cease whatever I was doing and, with earnest prayer for support, concentrate on relaxing and overcoming the barrier that worry produced in my life. I would mentally say, "I am not going to do another thing until I begin to control my emotions." Over a period of time those efforts were blessed by the Lord. I came to understand how He is willing to fortify, guide, and direct every phase of life. The symptoms of illness passed, and I learned how to face tasks under pressure.<br><h2><b>The Lord's Help</b></h2><br>No matter how difficult the problems that surround you, the Lord knows how to resolve them. As you exercise faith, doing what you can, He will help you handle those things within your capability. He will bring into your path priesthood leaders who can counsel and advise, friends who can give you support, and parents who can provide answers. Through the avenue of prayer and the path of inspiration, He will help you know what to do. It is a process that takes time to master, but knowing it exists should give you great comfort as you face the difficult decisions you must now make in life.<br><br>The Lord puts challenges in your path to mold your character. For your own personal growth He will often let you struggle with a matter for a while, even when you are pleading for help. But as you follow true principles, He will finally see you through. He intends that when you have reached your extremity, you will turn to Him for comfort, peace, and assistance. He will send it through the quiet prompting of the Spirit. He will give reassurance and guidance that are essential in correcting decisions in your life.<br><br>You are learning powerful, eternal lessons. Be sure you understand them. The Lord does not abandon your urgent pleas, nor is He ever, for even a moment, unmindful of your anguish and heartache. He hears every supplication. He invariably answers according to spiritual law. Understanding that law will help you appreciate how the Lord answers your prayers. His silence and seeming absence at times are a powerful means of expanding your vision and understanding as you continue in faith to do your best.<br><br>Consider this example. A racehorse may resist efforts to develop his potential to run, preferring to enjoy the beauty and rich green grass of the pasture. Yet, even at times against his will, if the horse will train, there develops a new excitement, a grander pleasure--the incomparable joy of winning. The pleasure of the pasture is not diminished, but his joy of life is expanded.<br><h2><b>Answers to Prayers</b></h2><br>Seldom will you receive all at once a complete answer from the Lord. It will come a piece at a time. Inspiration comes in packets so that you will develop and grow and not remain as a child, given everything; also so that you will appreciate it, give thanks for it, treasure it, and apply it. Moreover, it will seldom come as the prayer is offered, rather in quiet moments when the Spirit can most effectively touch your mind and heart. Hence the need for periods of quiet time to keep perspective and to be instructed and strengthened. Discover how a clean, neat, quiet place can enhance spiritual direction in your life.<br><br>Your capacity is greater than you can possibly imagine. Satan will try mightily to discourage you. Initially he will encourage you to do many worthwhile things, but not the essential ones. Then he will try to lead you through rationalization into gray areas and subsequently into dark ones. Beware of rationalization. It is to twist something you know to be true into a pattern that appears to support a deviation from truth. Rationalization would lead you down blind alleys. It would drain spiritual power. It barricades the path to happiness because it distorts your understanding of truth.<br><br>When you seek inspiration to help make decisions, the Lord will give gentle promptings that require you to think, to exercise faith, to work, to struggle at times, and then to act. It is a stepwise process to finally reach an inspired conclusion. It is unlikely that the whole answer to an important problem will come all at once. The Lord's pattern allows you to grow. Satan's method would make you more bound to his ways, with the resultant loss of agency.<br><br>I was once present when the Lord inspired mightily a husband as he gave his wife a priesthood blessing. The blessing addressed specific needs in her life. He gave counsel that would bring a solution to her difficulties. It was a beautiful experience, evidence of the power the Lord permits to be exercised through a righteous priesthood bearer. Yet this blessing did not benefit her as much as it might have. She did not write down the promises made. Even shortly after the remarkable blessing she could not remember the counsel given. She did not realize that fulfillment of the blessing would require effort on her part. The truth is that we must do all we are capable of doing to help fulfill a blessing. That effort includes the exercise of faith; the consistent, diligent application of counsel given; and abundant, prayerful expression of gratitude to our Father in Heaven, the source of the promised blessings. This truth applies whether it be a priesthood blessing or an impression from the Spirit to our mind and heart.<br><br>Your efforts to distill truth from reading and pondering the scriptures, from analyzing and striving to understand the inspired messages of the prophets, will provide you with an armory of truth. That truth will protect you from evil influences and lay a foundation for happiness, security, and purpose in your life. It will help you make correct choices. Initially these truths are accepted on faith. The confirming witness of their validity comes as you apply them in your life and as you express gratitude for the growth, maturity, and blessings that come from their use. That confirmation strengthens your capacity to discipline your life to avoid those things you know to be unproductive and harmful. Such a witness provides encouragement and the confidence to center your life in the teachings of the Savior and the plan of happiness of the Father.<br><h2><b>Analogy of an Orchestra</b></h2><br>An analogy will help you understand what is happening to you. I wrote down these impressions as I watched an impressive composer conduct an orchestra of gifted musicians. It has helped me understand more clearly our Father's plan of happiness. The conductor had created the musical score being played. He understood better than anyone else what he desired be accomplished through the music. He had crafted a role for each individual instrument. He was anxious to communicate that vision to the musicians so that, working in harmony together, they could make reality what he had defined in a complex musical score.<br><br>Each instrumentalist or percussionist had his or her part to play. They were experienced musicians and had polished innate talents through long, tedious hours of practice. They had studied their specific parts privately and attempted to master them.<br><br>It was not until they began to perform together under the direction of an inspired leader that the full beauty and grandeur of their combined efforts could be realized. The result was overwhelmingly moving and edifying. Each individual carefully followed the conductor, all striving to the utmost of their capability to play their part accurately with feeling, emotion, and precision. They were not forced to perform. It was done willingly. Although individual performances were outstanding, it was the combined effort of all that created the sublime result. Could you imagine how one discordant note could mar or destroy the power of their combined efforts? How one individual intentionally modifying the musical score could create havoc and destroy the beauty of the others' performances?<br><br>I understood with greater clarity how our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son have schooled us in the premortal life, preparing us for this mortal experience that we might make the most of it. We can receive individual guidance from the Spirit to perfect our own talents and abilities. We can learn to work together and yield our will to the divine conductor. We become fitted for the unique contribution that we are expected to make in fulfilling His personal plan for us. Certainly those who work diligently to learn truth and to live it willingly will make the greatest progress here. Just as it would be a demoralizing experience for an untrained individual to attempt to play in an orchestra of skilled musicians, so it would be painful punishment to attempt to live in a celestial realm for which you are not prepared. Your personal understanding of truth, the willing obedience to it, and the resulting growth, development, and perfection obtained in mortal life will determine your happiness here and lay the foundation for what your contribution will be in the eternities.<br><br>A musician can perfect his or her skill with practice and determined effort to succeed--privately, correcting mistakes as they come. That effort is enhanced by the influence of a caring teacher who is anxious to share counsel for improvement and to identify specific areas where performance can be bettered. In like manner, the Lord through the Holy Spirit can perform those functions in your life so that this mortal experience may yield the development, perfection, and understanding that you should gain in your personal plan of happiness. If you qualify here, you can serve in the celestial kingdom.<br><h2><b>Learn the Feelings of the Spirit</b></h2><br>How can you determine whether an impression is a prompting from the Lord, a temptation from the evil one, or the product of your own mind? One answer is explained in Ether 12:6:<br><br><i>And now, I, Moroni, . . . would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i><br><br>If you have a feeling that an impression has come through inspiration, "try your faith" by diligently living it. When it is truly a prompting of the Lord, there will be a confirmation that what you have done is right. You will learn what it feels like to have that witness. In time that feeling will become more certain than what you see or hear. A word of caution: Recognize that an individual who is violating commandments of the Lord will find it very difficult to discern a prompting of the Spirit from the powerful emotions that can be stimulated through transgression. I am confident that is one of the reasons that some marriages fail. Two individuals who have allowed themselves to violate the laws of chastity during courtship cannot expect to clearly perceive the answer to their prayer regarding marriage. Under such circumstances, seeking to discern the guidance of the Spirit is like trying to savor the delicate flavor of a raspberry while chewing on a red-hot jalapeño pepper.<br><br>Don't judge yourself by what you understand of your potential. Trust in the Lord and what He can do with your dedicated heart and willing mind (see D&amp;amp;C 64:34). Order your life more effectively and eliminate trivia, meaningless detail, and activity. They waste the perishable, fixed, and limited resource of time. Choose to emphasize those matters that have an eternal consequence.<br><br>Permanent worthwhile growth is attainable, but not without great effort and the honest application of truth. Worthy accomplishment is founded in integrity. Righteousness is fundamental to happiness and desirable attainment. Righteousness is rooted in a pure heart. And indeed it protects one from contamination and the filth of the world. Righteous love is the supreme motivation for constructive change. The examples of our Father in Heaven and the Savior and Their teachings are the perfect source of motivation and direction for life.<br><br>May this teaching of the Master benefit you as much as it has me: "Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days" (D&amp;amp;C 24:8). I know that promise is fulfilled.<br><br>As you discipline yourself in careful obedience to commandments of the Lord, you will qualify to receive inspiration and direction in your life. You will grow in discipline, capacity, devotion, understanding, compassion, and joyous service. Your worthy life will allow you to interpret and apply the inspiration that will come through the Holy Ghost. Your love of Heavenly Father and His Son will increase. It will be a love of reverence, awe, and gratitude of a child to the greatest of all. It will become a love of total willingness to be obedient to Their will. It will result from a pure desire and willing determination to serve Them above all else.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In closing I would share some of the innermost feelings of my heart. I do not know when I will have the opportunity to speak to you individually again. Though life now seems difficult, hold on to that iron rod. You are making better progress than you realize. Your struggles are defining character, discipline, and confidence in the promises of your Father in Heaven and the Savior as you consistently obey Their counsel. You are so important. You are so needed. There are so few willing to make the sacrifices you are making to live righteously. You will develop the sensitivity, love, and kindness to rejoice within the bonds of an eternal marriage. You will bless your children with an insight the world can never give them. Your example will set the course of their lives. You are needed to strengthen the growing kingdom of the Lord, to be the role models for so many more who will embrace the truths of the gospel.<br><br>This world is in trouble. The nation from which I speak is in difficulty. If you live elsewhere, your nation is struggling also. There is a continual crumbling of obedience to principle, the bedrock of civilization and an absolutely essential ingredient to happiness. Oh, there can be transitory pleasure from power, influence, or material wealth. But true, lasting happiness, the kind that is felt in the early hours of the morning when you are honest with yourself, can only be obtained by obedience to the teachings of God. Honesty, integrity, chastity, virtue, willingness to forego for the moment something seemingly desirable for a greater future good--these are essential to true success in life.<br><br>Develop the capacity, when circumstances demand, to lay everything on the altar to defend a principle. There are so few willing to do that. The world needs men and women like you who are willing to place principle above personal gain, businessmen who are honest and morally clean, attorneys who defend justice, and government officials who strive to preserve honor and integrity because it is right. You can be that shining light, that righteous influence, the leaven in the loaf to increase the moral fiber of your nation. Your prayers and humble study of the teachings of the Master, with a 24-hour application of those teachings every day of the week, will strengthen your life. They will help provide the stability the world needs.<br><br>Where can there be a greater satisfaction in life than to defend that part of the line the Lord has given you to preserve? Show those in the world around you a better way. There are some things that are wrong because God decreed that they are wrong. Truth is not determined by what men think, no matter how influential they may be. It was determined by an Almighty God before the creation of this earth, and it will exist forever. We serve. We make our contribution. We pass on. Let it never be said of you what was recently said of an individual with great potential and resources at his passing: "He left no legacy."<br><br>Will you prayerfully consider what we have discussed together? If there is a need to repent of some improper action, do it. Likewise, if there is a need to repent from failure to act, correct that. There are so many willing to be led by your righteous example. Because you have been enlightened, you owe it to those who follow to give them the best example you are capable of giving. Not only will they be blessed, but your life will be enriched as well.<br><br>I have come to know of the great influence for good that flows from individual acts born of conscience and principle rooted in truth. Resolve that each moment of your life will reflect your determination to humbly be an example of righteousness, integrity, and conviction. Keep the Sabbath day holy. Honor and live temple covenants as you receive them. Drink deeply from the fountain of the revealed word of God. Hold fast to His word. You are succeeding in the purpose for which you came to earth.<br><br>I bear solemn testimony that I have an absolute witness that Jesus Christ lives. As you follow the principles that we've discussed, I bear witness that He will guide you to the correct choices in the critical matters before you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<br>
From out the misery of a cold, dark, comfortless jail cell in Liberty, Missouri, Joseph Smith asked a poignant question that all of us sooner or later in our lives have asked or will ask: "O God, where art thou?" You know the story--many of you have probably been to see Liberty Jail. The Saints had been driven from their homes--indeed, from their state--in the cold of winter, and the whole Church had been brought down to near destruction.<br><br>In answer to Joseph's question, what comfort did the Lord have to offer? If we turn to D&amp;amp;C 121, we find the answer.<br><br>1. First, the Lord invokes the immensity of time: "Thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" (verse 7), He says, and the hope of the enemies of the Saints "shall be blasted" (verse 11).<br><br>2. Second, He comforts Joseph and the Saints with promises of great knowledge.<br><br>3. Third come promises and exhortations regarding priesthood.<br><br>We usually focus our attention in this section on this last point, but, in fact, considerable emphasis is placed on the comfort to be derived from knowledge, and it is about this I would like to speak.<br><br>Listen to these words:<br><br><i>All thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars--</i><br><br><i>All the times of their revolutions, all the appointed days, months, and years, and all the days of their days, months, and years, and all their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times. . . .</i><br><br><i>How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:29–31, 33]<br><br>Now, here we are at a great university, all of us focused on the quest for knowledge. From the passage above, as well as from others, it is clear that knowledge is something God values greatly. In fact, when you think about it, helping each other grow in knowledge stands at the heart of most of what we do in the Church. When we attend meetings, participate in missionary work, attend the temple, listen to conference, and participate in interviews, these activities are all primarily focused on helping us grow in understanding and knowledge--deep knowledge, that is--knowledge that includes facts but goes far beyond to embrace wisdom, as discussed by Elder Oaks in a wonderful conference talk last spring that I strongly encourage you to reread (see Dallin H. Oaks, "Focus and Priorities,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 82–84).<br><br>But going back to Joseph Smith's situation: What value and comfort do we find in knowledge? Surely we would all agree that knowledge of the gospel itself can comfort and inspire. But can so-called secular knowledge do so as well? When you stop and think about it, it should--that is, when you consider that all truth comes from God. He doesn't make the distinction between sacred and secular truth. To Him it is all one--it is all truth.<br><br>Let me give you an example of the kind of comfort and inspiration I have found in my own life from what we might normally call secular knowledge as revealed in the latter days. These are things I've learned in just the kinds of classes you might be taking in school right now.<br><br>I'm amazed at the fulfillment of the promise given in D&amp;amp;C 121 that during the term of this dispensation much will be revealed about the stars, planets, and the world in which we live. So when I'm camping at Lake Powell or elsewhere with my kids, I love to talk to them about those things. Our favorite time is at night. Perhaps you can recall being out on a clear night yourself with no clouds and no moon, far from city lights. Close your eyes and go back there with me. Look up. What do you see? A black sky full of stars. Does the sight not fill you with wonder? How many stars do you think you can see? I've asked this of different groups on different occasions, and the usual answers range all the way from thousands to millions.<br><br>If you ask your local astronomer how many stars you can see, she'll tell you it's about 10,000. The answer will vary a little depending on whom you ask, but it will be in about that ballpark. And for thousands of years that's how many stars it seemed there were. But it has only been in the last couple of hundred years that we've begun to realize how many stars there really are! Just as the Lord has promised, in the dispensation of the fulness of times new knowledge about our universe is accumulating at a breathtaking and accelerating rate.<br><br>Probably the most recent and dramatic improvement in our view of the real scope of the universe results from the launching and subsequent fixing of the Hubble space telescope. Now we look out at a tiny patch of sky that before looked like a black, empty spot and find it is full--not of individual stars but of galaxies, each of which has hundreds of billions of individual stars in it.<br><br>So what is the answer to our question? How many stars are there? Well, brace yourselves, because the answer is truly awe-inspiring. Again, depending on whom you ask, you'll get an answer something like this: There are about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and there are about 100 billion galaxies in the known universe.<br><br>Now that answer merits some serious pondering. Unfortunately we've become rather glib about using big numbers nowadays. With national debts in the trillions and gigabytes in our computers, these numbers roll easily off the tongue. But what do they mean?<br><br>Even on the surface you can tell we're talking about a lot of stars. But how can we get a real feel for the numbers involved? The difficulty reminds me of some verses in LDS scripture that also speak of the immense numbers of worlds in the cosmos. First, let's turn to Enoch, who is shown the cosmos and says:<br><br><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still.</i>[Moses 7:30]<br><br>Now let's see what Abraham said:<br><br><i>Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made;</i><br><br><i>And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof.</i>[Abraham 3:11–12]<br><br>And here is what Moses saw:<br><br><i>And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore.</i><br><br><i>And he beheld many lands; and each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof.</i>[Moses 1:28–29]<br><br>It is interesting that repeatedly in scripture, when the Lord is trying to help us imagine huge numbers of things, He alludes to the grains of sand on the beach. And there is another reason this metaphor is especially fascinating to me: because it pops up in another, entirely unrelated place. In his 1980 television series<i>Cosmos,</i>Carl Sagan, a scientist who was, in fact, not a believer, tried to help the viewer understand the enormous numbers of stars there are. Lo and behold, he stated that the number of stars in the known universe is greater than the number of grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth. Now, when I first heard that, I have to admit I did a double take. I'm from Missouri, as are most scientists, so you have to "show me." (Actually I'm from Canada, eh?) I wanted to be shown that this is really true, so I did my own calculations using outlandish estimates of the amount of beach property on earth, the average depth of a beach, etc. Now there's something you can try at home--so try it, and if you do, you'll be astonished to find that Carl was about right.<br><br>Imagine how many stars that represents! Imagine standing on a huge beach, the sand stretching out for miles before you. Reach down and gather up a handful of sand and imagine trying to count the number of grains just in your hand. Now imagine all the sand on all the beaches. That's how many stars there are. This is a really awesome thought! Does it inspire you? It does me. Does just thinking about it take your mind off your problems? It does for me. Perhaps this is what God was talking about when He gave the promise of great knowledge to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail as a source of love and comfort. Remember the hymn we sang last week: "O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder Consider all the worlds thy hands have made . . . ; Then sings my soul" ("How Great Thou Art,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 86). You know, it's hard to stay discouraged when your soul is singing. It's hard to look at the night sky and think of the scale of the universe and be depressed. What mankind has learned about the stars has become a source of both comfort and inspiration. And chances are you'll never look at the night sky again without thinking about these ideas.<br><br>This whole idea about the scale of the known universe is so fun to contemplate, let's look at it again from another perspective. You are the captain of the starship<i>Enterprise,</i>and you have set out to explore the universe, to go where no man (in the case of James T. Kirk) or no one (in the case of Jean-Luc Picard) has gone before. You wish to identify all the inhabited solar systems in the universe, and so you set out. But you have an important advantage over these other captains. You have a new super-charged<i>Enterprise</i>that can ignore all the effects of relativity and acceleration and get from one star to another in one second. You then have one second to explore that solar system and move on to the next. You begin your exploration the second you are born (you are a very precocious child!), and you continue it nonstop for your 100-year life span. You don't stop for lunch or to sleep or to open your Christmas presents. How many stars will you have visited at the end of your journey? It turns out only about 1.5 billion. How discouraging! You worked really hard, but you've only managed to visit around 1 percent of the stars in our own galaxy, let alone in any of the other 100 billion galaxies out there. So how long would it take to visit all the stars at this rate? Oh, about 100 trillion years.<br><br>Now, no thinking human being can come up against these newly revealed truths without feeling a sense of awe at the vastness and complexity of our universe. For us, as Latter-day Saints, this kind of insight is a striking testimony of the greatness of God's power. Others, like Sagan, feel the awe and wonder but are not convinced. One might ask, why the difference? Well, because we do not derive our testimonies from nature's wonders. Our testimonies come from the voice of the Spirit to our hearts. Having received the witness, though, the awe we feel finds a comfortable home in our testimonies, it reinforces faith, it confirms and enlarges what we already know to be true. And keeping this kind of perspective inspires us and helps us to endure the challenges of life and, yes, sometimes great suffering, such as Joseph was able to endure in Liberty Jail.<br><br>When we look at the night sky, and in many other ways, the wonders of nature bear witness to us day in and day out of a Heavenly Father who brings order to all we see around us. Ask yourself how often you stop to listen to these witnesses. If you're like me, the answer is "not often enough." That's unfortunate, because every time I stop and listen, I am healed. Each time I grow in appreciation of God's great plan in which all of nature participates, and it heartens me to know that I, together with you, lie at the center of that plan. Just think that all this vast creation was made for you and me! Doesn't that make you feel both humble and wonderful at the same time?<br><br>Now we've talked about the majesty of God's creations on the scale of the very large, but there's just as much to be said and it is just as amazing to look at it from the other end of the spectrum: on the scale of the very small. Take just one of those grains of sand we talked about earlier. Even this is a true marvel of complexity. Each grain contains about the same number of atoms as there are stars in the known universe. They are arranged in neat rows, linked by electrons that dance in amazing wheels of choreography. If you were the size of an atom and looked about you within one of these tiny stones, you would see rank upon rank of atoms lined up like soldiers on parade extending outward as far as the eye can see in all directions. In fact, at this scale you could journey for months through the matrix and never find an edge. You would be in a little world that seems to go on forever.<br><br>Now the world of atoms as depicted in those $100 chemistry texts you buy at the bookstore looks static and lifeless, but the real world of atoms is in constant motion, with atoms jiggling and colliding and forming and breaking bonds in a frenzied kaleidoscope of constant change. Only now are we beginning to be able to depict how this amazing world works. Newly revealed knowledge of the miniature world presents another witness--a tiny but powerful witness--to the grandeur of God's laws and the care with which He has designed this amazing universe.<br><br>And then there is you. Believe it or not, as befits a child of God, your body is the most complex system in the whole universe. The more we learn about the cells that make you up and the biochemical processes that make you function, the more awe-inspiring you become. Every cell in your body is an amazing little world of its own with gates and walls, with sophisticated chemical factories, with a central government and a complex communications system. If you could be the size of a protein molecule and set out to explore a single cell in your body, you could spend a lifetime observing all the comings and goings and the busy activity and never run out of interesting new things to see. The experience would make going to Disneyland pale in comparison. And you have a hundred trillion such cells of innumerable different kinds! Anyone who has seen a video of circulating blood knows what a complex and awe-inspiring sight it is to see a living system in action at the cellular level. Again, we share this sense of awe with nonbelievers. As Carl Sagan said, "We are, each of us, a multitude. Within us is a little universe" (in "One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue," episode 2 of<i>Cosmos</i>[1980], videocassettes, DVD). For Latter-day Saints the complexity of the biological world provides another witness of the greatness of our Father in Heaven and His creative genius.<br><br>As time goes by and we learn more and more about the cosmos on the scale of both the large and the small, the more we find so-called secular and religious truths coming together to bear witness of our Father's great plan. All of this vast, complex universe has been designed for a purpose--one that includes us as very important players. Mormonism is the only Christian religion I know that adopts the doctrine that the earth is part of a vast civilization that spans the universe, that men and women are passing through one natural phase in the life cycle of eternal beings who populate the universe in a planned, organized fashion. Think of all the great knowledge that has been poured out in the dispensation of the fulness of times, as prophesied in D&amp;amp;C 121. These truths, both sacred and secular, are an ever-expanding testimony of this marvelous plan. Everywhere we look, both on the scale of the very large and on the scale of the very small, witnesses in nature speak to us of our own place in the grand scheme of life. Knowledge of this plan makes it possible for us to adopt an eternal perspective that is otherwise impossible to achieve. We see life and the problems we face from a whole new angle, and this offers us a sense of hope beyond the confines of this world. It is indeed reassuring to know that there is a plan behind the seeming chaos in which we are immersed, that there is a Master who loves us and who governs all things from the greatest to the least.<br><br>Look about you and you will see God all around. In the Lord's own words:<br><br><i>All kingdoms have a law given;</i><br><br><i>And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom.</i><br><br><i>And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions. . . .</i><br><br><i>Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:36–38, 47]<br><br>Now, in conclusion, let's consider the most awesome thought of all, that through the power of the Atonement we can be joint heirs with Christ and can inherit all this, "all that [the] Father hath" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38). How much is it that the Father hath? Enoch, Abraham, and Moses had an idea, for it was shown to them. We have their testimonies, but I think we have begun to catch the real vision only in recent years. What the Father hath is an awful lot. And as joint heirs with Christ, just think: It could all be ours one day! What a source of comfort and strength and hope that whatever we have to endure, it is worth it. "All that [the] Father hath" can be ours. I am humbled by that prospect. Look what is in store for us if we live worthy of it. Look at all we stand to lose if we fail. With all that we know, how can we hesitate to do everything it takes, to sacrifice all we have to sacrifice, to obtain those blessings?<br><br>Perhaps you find yourself facing great adversity in your life, as did Brother Joseph in Liberty Jail. Perhaps you have felt to cry out, "O God, where art thou?" as did he. The Lord has sent you comfort--many sources of comfort and inspiration--not the least of which are witnesses in stars and stones that He lives, that He loves you, and that He has set in place a plan by which all that He has created can be yours if you will have faith and endure. That we will do so and find great joy therein is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>John D. Lamb was the Eliot A.

<h1> Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The most significant academic talks I heard during my service at BYU had one common characteristic. Instead of providing new facts or advocating a particular position, as many lectures do, the most significant talks changed the listeners' way of thinking about an important subject. Though I am a devotional speaker rather than a lecturer on an academic subject, I am going to make that same attempt today. I will attempt to change some listeners' ways of thinking about an important subject--the matter of<i>timing.</i><br><br>I begin with a story I heard many years ago at the inauguration of a university president. It illustrates the importance of timing in university administration. One university president had come to the end of his period of service, and another was just beginning. As a gesture of goodwill, the wise outgoing president handed his young successor three sealed envelopes. "Hold these until you have the first crisis in your administration," he explained. "Then open the first one, and you will find some valuable advice."<br><br>It was a year before the new president had a crisis. When he opened the first envelope, he found a single sheet of paper on which were written the words "Blame the prior administration." He followed that advice and survived the crisis.<br><br>Two years later he faced another serious challenge to his leadership. He opened the second envelope and read: "Reorganize your administration." He did so, and the reorganization disarmed his critics and gave new impetus to his leadership.<br><br>Much later the now-seasoned president encountered his third major crisis. Eagerly he opened the last envelope, anticipating the advice that would provide the solution for his troubles. Again he found a single sheet of paper, but this time it read, "Prepare three envelopes." It was time for new leadership.<br><br>The familiar observation that "timing is everything" surely overstates the point, but timing<i>is</i>vital. We read in Ecclesiastes:<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; . . .</i><br><br><i>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; . . .</i><br><br>[A]<i>time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; . . .</i><br><br>[A]<i>time to keep silence, and a time to speak.</i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2, 4–5, 7]<br><br>In all the important decisions in our lives, what is most important is to<i>do the right thing.</i>Second, and only slightly behind the first, is to<i>do the right thing at the right time.</i>People who do the right thing at the wrong time can be frustrated and ineffective. They can even be confused about whether they made the right choice when what was wrong was not their choice but their timing.<br><h2><b>I. The Lord's Timing</b></h2><br>My first point on the subject of timing is that the Lord has His own timetable. "My words are sure and shall not fail," the Lord taught the early elders of this dispensation. "But," He continued, "all things must come to pass in their time" (D&amp;amp;C 64:31–32).<br><br>The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith means trust--trust in God's will, trust in His way of doing things, and trust in His timetable. We should not try to impose our timetable on His. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has said:<br><br><i>The issue for us is trusting God enough to trust also His timing. If we can truly believe He has our welfare at heart, may we not let His plans unfold as He thinks best? The same is true with the second coming and with all those matters wherein our faith needs to include faith in the Lord's timing for us personally, not just in His overall plans and purposes.</i>[<i>Even As I Am</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1982), 93]<br><br>More recently, during last April conference, Elder Maxwell said: "Since faith in the timing of the Lord may be tried, let us learn to say not only, 'Thy will be done,' but patiently also, 'Thy timing be done'" (<i>CR,</i>April 2001, 76; or "Plow in Hope,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2001, 59).<br><br>Indeed, we cannot have true faith in the Lord without also having complete trust in the Lord's will and in the Lord's timing.<br><br>Among the persons who violate this principle are those who advocate euthanasia. They are trying to take an essential matter that we understand to be determined only by God and accelerate its occurrence according to their own will or preference.<br><br>In our service in the Lord's church we should remember that<i>when</i>is just as important as<i>who, what, where,</i>and<i>how.</i><br><br>For a vivid illustration of the importance of timing we can look to the earthly ministry of the Lord and His succeeding instructions to His Apostles. During His lifetime the Lord instructed the Twelve Apostles not to preach to the Gentiles but "rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Matthew 10:5–6; also see Matthew 15:22–26). Then, at the appropriate time, this instruction was reversed in a great revelation to the Apostle Peter. Only then, at the precise time dictated by the Lord, was the gospel taken to the Gentiles (see Acts 10–11).<br><br>As this example shows, continuing revelation is the means by which the Lord administers His timing. We need that revelatory direction. For example, many of us or our descendants will doubtless participate in the fulfillment of prophecies about the building of the city of New Jerusalem (see D&amp;amp;C 84:2–4). But in this matter the timing is the Lord's, not ours. We will not be approved or blessed in clearing the ground or pouring the footings for that great project until the Lord has said that it is time. In this, as in so many other things, the Lord will proceed in His own time and in His own way.<br><br>We prepare in the way the Lord has directed. We hold ourselves in readiness to act on the Lord's timing. He will tell us when the time is right to take the next step. For now, we simply concentrate on our own assignments and on what we have been asked to do today. In this we are also mindful of the Lord's assurance: "I will hasten my work in its time" (D&amp;amp;C 88:73).<br><br>People who do not accept continuing revelation sometimes get into trouble by doing things too soon or too late or too long. The practice of polygamy is an example.<br><br>The importance of the Lord's timing is also evident in His dietary laws. The Lord gave one dietary direction to ancient Israel. Much later, because of the "evils and designs" that exist in these "last days" (D&amp;amp;C 89:4), He has given us a Word of Wisdom suited to the circumstances of our time, accompanied by the promised blessings we need in our time.<br><br>The Lord's timing also applies to the important events of our personal lives. A great scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants declares that a particular spiritual experience will come to us "in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68). This principle applies to revelation (see Oaks, "Teaching and Learning by the Spirit,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1997, 11) and to all of the most important events in our lives: birth, marriage, death, and even our moves from place to place.<br><br>Here is an example from the life of a prominent pioneer ancestor of many in this audience. Anson Call was in the initial exodus from Nauvoo. He and his family crossed Iowa in the spring of 1846 and reached Council Bluffs, Iowa, that summer. There Brigham Young was organizing wagon companies. He appointed Anson Call captain of the first 10 wagons. The Twelve ordered his wagon train to move west. It left the Missouri River for the West on July 22, 1846. Organized by priesthood authority, they were directed toward the Rocky Mountains, and they went westward with great energy.<br><br>After traveling more than 130 miles through what is now Nebraska, this first wagon train was overtaken by new instructions directing them not to proceed further that season. They found a place to winter, and then, in the spring of 1847, returned east and rejoined the main body of the Church on the Iowa side of the Missouri. There Anson Call and his family remained for a year, making further preparations and helping others prepare for the trip west. It was two years after their initial start westward in 1846 that Anson Call and his family finally journeyed to the valleys of the mountains. There the obedient and resourceful Anson Call was frequently used by Brigham Young to begin new settlements in the Intermountain West. (See<i>The Journal of Anson Call</i>[United States: Ethan L. Call and Christine Shaffer Call; Afton, Wyoming: Shann L. Call, 1986], 36.)<br><br>What is the meaning of this pioneer experience? It is not enough that we are under call, or even that we are going in the right direction. The timing must be right, and if the time is not right, our actions should be adjusted to the Lord's timetable as revealed by His servants.<br><br>The Lord's timing is often revealed in this way. Several years ago President Hinckley announced the construction of a large number of new temples, essentially doubling the number of operating temples of the Church from about 50 to about 100 in just a few years. Having additional temples has always been the direction to go, but until the prophet of the Lord signaled this as a major initiative, no one could have properly urged such a sudden and dramatic increase for the Church and its people. Only the Lord's prophet could move the whole Church west. Only the Lord's prophet could signal the Church to double its operating temples in just a few years.<br><br>In my conference talk last October I gave another illustration--the importance of following the Lord's timing with those we try to interest in hearing the gospel message. Proclaiming the gospel is His work, not ours, and therefore it must be done on His timing, not ours. There are nations in the world today that must hear the gospel before the Lord will come again. We know this, but we cannot force it. We must wait upon the Lord's timing. He will tell us, and He will open the doors or bring down the walls when the time is right. We should pray for the Lord's help and directions so that we can be instruments in His hands to proclaim the gospel to nations and persons who are now ready--persons He would have us help today. The Lord loves all of His children, and He desires that all have the fulness of His truth and the abundance of His blessings. He knows when groups or individuals are ready, and He wants us to hear and heed His timetable for sharing His gospel with them.<br><h2><b>II. The Agency of Others</b></h2><br>The achievement of some important goals in our lives is subject to more than the timing of the Lord. Some personal achievements are also subject to the agency of others. This is particularly evident in two matters of special importance to young people of college age--missionary baptisms and marriage.<br><br>Last summer Sister Oaks and I were in Manaus, Brazil. I spoke to about a hundred missionaries in that great city on the Amazon. As I stood to speak, I was prompted to put aside some notes I usually use on such occasions and substitute some thoughts on the importance of timing--some of the scriptures and principles I have been talking about today.<br><br>I reminded the missionaries that some of our most important plans cannot be brought to pass without the agency and actions of others. A missionary cannot baptize five persons this month without the agency and action of five other persons. A missionary can plan and work and do all within his or her power, but the desired result will depend upon the additional agency and action of others. Consequently a missionary's goals ought to be based upon the missionary's personal agency and action, not upon the agency or action of others.<br><br>But this is not the time to elaborate on what I told the missionaries about goals. Instead I will share some other applications of the principle of timing, giving illustrations from our personal lives.<br><h2><b>III. Applications to Our Lives</b></h2><br>Someone has said that life is what happens to us while we are making other plans. Because of things over which we have no control, we cannot plan and bring to pass everything we desire in our lives. Many important things will occur in our lives that we have not planned, and not all of them will be welcome. The tragic events of September 11th and their revolutionary consequences provide an obvious example. Even our most righteous desires may elude us, or come in different ways or at different times than we have sought to plan.<br><br>For example, we cannot be sure that we will marry as soon as we desire. A marriage that is timely in our view may be our blessing or it may not. My wife Kristen is an example. She did not marry until many years after her mission and her graduation. Older singles have some interesting experiences. While she was at her sister's place to celebrate her fiftieth birthday, her sister's husband shared something he had just read in a newspaper. "Kristen," he said, "now that you are a single woman over 50, your chances of marrying are not as good as your chances of being killed by a terrorist."<br><br>The timing of marriage is perhaps the best example of an extremely important event in our lives that is almost impossible to plan. Like other important mortal events that depend on the agency of others or the will and timing of the Lord, marriage cannot be anticipated or planned with certainty. We can and should work for and pray for our righteous desires, but, despite this, many will remain single well beyond their desired time for marriage.<br><br>So what should be done in the meantime? Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ prepares us for whatever life brings. This kind of faith prepares us to deal with life's opportunities--to take advantage of those that are received and to persist through the disappointments of those that are lost. In the exercise of that faith we should commit ourselves to the priorities and standards we will follow on matters we do not control and persist faithfully in those commitments whatever happens to us because of the agency of others or the timing of the Lord. When we do this, we will have a constancy in our lives that will give us direction and peace. Whatever the circumstances beyond our control, our commitments and standards can be constant.<br><br>Sometimes our commitments will surface at unexpected times and be applied in unexpected circumstances. Sometimes the principles we have taught to others come back to guide our own actions when we think we don't need them anymore. A personal experience illustrates this reality. Most Latter-day Saint parents know the importance of giving their children reminders as they go out on a date. I did this with our children, and I think they heeded my counsel. During the time I was getting acquainted with Kristen, when I left the house to meet her, one of my children said to me with a twinkle in the eye: "Now Dad, remember who you are!"<br><br>The commitments and service of adult singles can anchor them through the difficult years of waiting for the right time and the right person. Their commitments and service can also inspire and strengthen others. The poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote of this in his wonderful poem "Snow-Bound," which contains this description of a dear aunt who never married:<br><br><i>The sweetest woman ever Fate</i><br><i>Perverse denied a household mate,</i><br><i>Who, lonely, homeless, not the less</i><br><i>Found peace in love's unselfishness,</i><br><i>And welcome whereso'er she went,</i><br><i>A calm and gracious element.</i><br>[John Greenleaf Whittier, "Snow-Bound: A Winter Idyl," in<i>Snow-Bound: Among the Hills: Songs of Labor: and Other Poems</i>(Boston; New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1898), lines 352–57]<br><br>Wise are those who make this commitment:<i>I will put the Lord first in my life and I will keep His commandments.</i>The performance of that commitment is within everyone's control. We can fulfill that commitment without regard to what others decide to do, and that commitment will anchor us no matter what timing the Lord directs for the most important events in our lives.<br><br>Do you see the difference between committing to what<i>you will do,</i>in contrast to trying to plan that you will be married by the time you graduate or that you will earn at least X amount of dollars on your first job?<br><br>If we have faith in God and if we are committed to the fundamentals of keeping His commandments and putting Him first in our lives, we do not need to plan every single event--even every important event--and we should not feel rejected or depressed if some things--even some very important things--do not happen at the time we had planned or hoped or prayed.<br><br>Commit yourself to put the Lord first in your life, keep His commandments, and do what the Lord's servants ask you to do. Then your feet are on the pathway to eternal life. Then it does not matter whether you are called to be a bishop or a Relief Society president, whether you are married or single, or whether you die tomorrow. You do not know what will happen. Do your best on what is fundamental and personal and then trust in the Lord and His timing.<br><br>Life has some strange turns. I will share some personal experiences that illustrate this.<br><br>When I was a young man I thought I would serve a mission. I graduated from high school in June 1950. Thousands of miles away, one week after that high school graduation, a North Korean army crossed the 38th parallel, and our country was at war. I was 17 years old, but as a member of the Utah National Guard I was soon under orders to prepare for mobilization and active service. Suddenly, for me and for many other young men of my generation, the full-time mission we had planned or assumed was not to be.<br><br>Another example: After I served as president of BYU for nine years, I was released. A few months later the governor of the state of Utah appointed me to a 10-year term on the supreme court of this state. I was then 48 years old. My wife June and I tried to plan the rest of our lives. We wanted to serve the full-time mission neither of us had been privileged to serve. We planned that I would serve 20 years on the state supreme court. Then, at the end of two 10-year terms, when I would be nearly 69 years old, I would retire from the supreme court and we would submit our missionary papers and serve a mission as a couple.<br><br>I had my 69th birthday last summer and was vividly reminded of that important plan. If things had gone as we planned, I would now be submitting papers to serve a mission with my wife June.<br><br>Four years after we made that plan I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles--something we never dreamed would happen. Realizing then that the Lord had different plans and different timing than we had assumed, I resigned as a justice of the supreme court. But this was not the end of the important differences. When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later--a year and a half ago--I married Kristen McMain, the eternal companion who now stands at my side.<br><br>How fundamentally different my life is than I had sought to plan! My professional life has changed. My personal life has changed. But the commitment I made to the Lord--to put Him first in my life and to be ready for whatever He would have me do--has carried me through these changes of eternal importance.<br><br>Faith and trust in the Lord give us the strength to accept and persist, whatever happens in our lives. I did not know why I received a "no" answer to my prayers for the recovery of my wife of many years, but the Lord gave me a witness that this was His will, and He gave me the strength to accept it. Two years after her death, I met this wonderful woman who is now my wife for eternity. And I know that this also was the will of the Lord.<br><br>I return to the subject with which I began. Do not rely on planning every event of your life--even every important event. Stand ready to accept the Lord's planning and the agency of others in matters that inevitably affect you. Plan, of course, but fix your planning on personal commitments that will carry you through no matter what happens. Anchor your life to eternal principles, and act upon those principles whatever the circumstances and whatever the actions of others. Then you can await the Lord's timing and be sure of the outcome in eternity.<br><br>The most important principle of timing is to take the long view. Mortality is just a small slice of eternity, but how we conduct ourselves here--what we become by our actions and desires, confirmed by our covenants and the ordinances administered to us by proper authority--will shape our destiny for all eternity. As the prophet Amulek taught, "This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God" (Alma 34:32). That reality should help us take the long view--the timing of eternity. As President Charles W. Penrose declared at a general conference memorializing the death of President Joseph F. Smith:<br><br><i>Why waste your time, your talents, your means, your influence in following something that will perish and pass away, when you could devote yourselves to a thing that will stand forever? For this Church and kingdom, to which you belong, will abide and continue in time, in eternity, while endless ages roll along, and you with it will become mightier and more powerful; while the things of this world will pass away and perish, and will not abide in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord our God.</i>[<i>CR,</i>June 1919, 37]<br><br>I pray that each of us will hear and heed the word of the Lord on how to conduct ourselves in mortality and set our standards and make our commitments so that we can be in harmony and in tune with the timing of our Father in Heaven. I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior, whose Church this is, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 29 January 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ng Money Cannot Buy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am humbled by the opportunity to speak to each of you this evening. Thank you for your righteousness, for your valiant stand against the forces that would pull you under, and for your desire to be the person our Father in Heaven would have you be. I believe you are some of the most outstanding young people who have ever lived on this earth. You were truly sent "for such a time as this" (Esther 4:14). I love you and pray for you and have confidence in you.<br><br>I have a good friend whose car was vandalized just a few days before Christmas. Among other things, the thieves took her attaché, which contained everything from her cell phone and PalmPilot to a personal journal, some other sensitive papers, and her passport. By nearly miraculous circumstances, a few days later her briefcase was recovered. Everything that was valuable by the world's standards--the money, the credit cards, and anything else that could be hocked--was gone. But to her delight and relief, all of her personal papers and passport had been undisturbed. Though it was inconvenient and costly, she was able to replace everything the thieves took. Ironically, those things that were of greatest value to her--things that money could not buy--were returned.<br><br>A scripture we have read many, many times in 3 Nephi says:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.</i>[3 Nephi 13:19–20]<br><br>Today I want to talk about what those treasures are, why we seek them, and how we can obtain them. In other words, the whats, whys, and hows.<br><br>Would you begin to ponder in your minds those things that are most precious to you and see if you reach the same conclusion as my friend--that the things of greatest worth are things that money cannot buy.<br><br>I began to learn this when I was just 14 and earned my first paycheck. I remember thinking I would be able to do so much with all of that money. Maybe you have learned the same--that money never goes as far as you want it to, that you just cannot get enough of what you do not need, and that it is not possible to buy happiness at a store or through a catalog.<br><br>It has been my experience that periodically life's circumstances force us to stop and think about just what we<i>do</i>need to be happy. We have all had occasion to evaluate and reevaluate priorities. When my husband and I were your age, money was a real concern for us. But during our five decades together, we have learned that when push comes to shove, aside from necessities like food, clothing, and shelter, what we have needed most are things that money cannot buy.<br><br>I know that finances are a real concern for most of you. But for our next few minutes together, will you set those thoughts aside and allow the Spirit to "renew your mind" so that you can gain vital perspective? I love the Apostle Paul's counsel to the Saints in Romans 12:2: "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God." Renewed perspective can set in motion a transformation. As we set worldly concerns aside and focus on eternal needs, we will come to know the will of God in our individual lives. We will come to appreciate those things that cannot be bought or sold.<br><br>When President Harold B. Lee was growing up in Clifton, Idaho, "money was dreadfully scarce" for his family. Their "farm produced generously, but grain and potatoes brought little" monetary return. Their "father augmented the family income by contracting for custom grain cutting, drilling wells, and building irrigation canals." And so they had sufficient for their needs. "The Church provided entertainment opportunities" for the family.<br><br>"The Lee children did not know they were poor." Their home was filled with love and laughter, reading, and music. Their mother was a skilled homemaker who made a very little go a very long way. Her children were always dressed appropriately for church. As an adult, President Lee recounted, "We had everything money could not buy." (Excerpts from Gordon B. Hinckley, "President Harold B. Lee: An Appreciation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1972, 2–4.) That is my prayer for each of you--that you, like President Lee, might have the most important things, the most enduring things, those things of greatest worth that cannot be purchased with money. What are they?<br><h2><b>Eternal Family Ties</b></h2><br>One of the most important, valuable qualities is love. You simply cannot buy the love created in eternal family ties.<br><br>In September our first granddaughter was married in the Salt Lake Temple. All of the aunts and uncles (and some of the older cousins) came together for the sealing. You have heard it said before, but I want to say it again: Nothing compares to the joy of being surrounded by your family in a sealing room. At times like these, when earth communes with heaven, all material concerns, worries, and pressures vanish. You realize just how priceless an eternal family unit can be.<br><br>Late that afternoon the whole family gathered to help prepare for the reception and take family photos. All of the family worked together decorating for the special event. Joy and excitement filled the room! As a wife, mother, and grandmother, I stood back watching the love, respect, and unity in our family, and my heart filled with deep joy and appreciation for the blessings of family.<br><br>We all tasted a bit of heaven that day. Everything that you take with you into the next life is everything that money cannot buy. Covenants that seal husbands and wives, parents and children, are of inestimable worth. Love that spans the generations and binds hearts together is nothing less than divine.<br><br>If your family of origin is not ideal, please do not despair. You can set in motion a new pattern of behavior. You can be a transitional figure whose love and light will ripple through the generations. Hold on to gospel truths and begin a transformation in your own life and then in your own family when you marry and raise your children.<br><br>As young mothers put their pen to paper and evaluate the cost of working outside the home, I deeply hope they will not sell themselves short. I am so proud of those who clearly see the importance of their role. Mothers who make the choice to stay home with their children, teaching by precept and example, make lasting investments in eternal accounts. Their preparation and education does so much more than draw a paycheck. It enriches the whole family and shapes the lives of their children. Such mothers become refined by their righteous choice. They love and serve and sacrifice, and they are blessed in ways that they could not otherwise be. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation.<br><br>As I watch young fathers work hard to provide a living for their families, "to preside over their families in love and righteousness," I applaud their noble efforts ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102). Oftentimes they shoulder these responsibilities while they are still receiving their education. As difficult as it may seem at the time, such fathers will look back at this stage with satisfaction. Someday they will recall the sacrifices they have made and the eternal bonds that were forged, and they will feel grateful that they put first things first. They brought children into the world when, by worldly standards, they could not afford to. They took care of their families even while they were still learning how to provide for them.<br><br>I love the story our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, related about a conversation he had with his wife, Marjorie, on the eve of their wedding. He was anxious about the economic realities of their marriage. He had totaled his assets and realized that he had less than $150 and, even more alarming, that he made only $185 a month. Marjorie put his fears to rest. She replied that "she had hoped for a husband and now she found out she was getting $150 too. 'This will work out wonderfully,' she told him. 'If you've got $150, we're set.'" And, as you well know, they were. (In Sheri L. Dew,<i>Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B. Hinckley</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 115–16.)<br><h2><b>Knowledge and Intelligence</b></h2><br>Another thing that money cannot buy is knowledge. Yes, it usually takes money to pay for an education, but it also takes desire and diligence to acquire knowledge. And I speak here not only of formal education but of a lifelong quest to live and learn. You have to read and study. You have to put forth the effort if you want to learn. And when you do, when you really learn something, it can stay with you forever. In Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19 we read:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><br><br>Learning is a lifelong process that neither begins nor ends in the classroom.<br><br>All around the world some people feel helpless because they lack the means to improve themselves. Recently in Abomoso, Ghana, a 40-foot container of books was being unloaded, and all the leaders of the community were there to receive it. These books were being distributed to 52 schools. Standing next to our LDS charities leader was a little girl about eight years old. She had bare feet and a torn dress and eyes as deep as her desire to learn. She had no uniform and could not respond to English. Her mother lived in Accra, and she lived with her grandmother in Abomoso. They had no money for school fees--which were $1.85 in U.S. money--or for the required uniform--which was an additional $7 to $10. The most she could do was wish to read. So money was left for this little child to attend school. That kind act could impact the little girl's life forever.<br><br>We may have to pay for our own education, but in most cases we can work and save and enroll in school. We can "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Money purchases the opportunity to take a class, but real education comes only through diligent study.<br><br>As you enroll in religion and institute of religion classes, afford yourself the opportunity to immerse yourself in the word of God. Learn the gospel, know its doctrines and teachings, and study the history of the restored Church. Take time for religion classes; take time for eternity.<br><h2><b>The Restored Gospel</b></h2><br>If you will study the gospel with a humble heart, you will come to treasure its truths above all worldly wealth. Everything that money cannot buy is contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In his autobiography, Parley P. Pratt told of his conversion and then of his compelling desire to share the gospel with others. Parley's brother William, however, was more impressed by Parley's material success and could not understand why he would give it all up to teach the gospel.<br><br>William asked Parley, "This is your all; you have toiled for years to obtain it, and why not now continue to enjoy it?"<br><br>Parley responded, "I see plainly you know but little of my circumstances--of the changes which have taken place with me since we parted five years ago, nor how vastly wealthy I have become within that time. Why, sir, I have bank bills enough, on the very best institutions in the world, to sustain myself and family while we live."<br><br>Again William questioned, "Well, I should like to see some of them; I hope they are genuine."<br><br>Parley replied, "There is no doubt of that. They are true bills and founded on capital that will never fail, though heaven and earth should pass away."<br><br>Parley then unlocked his treasury and took out a large pocketbook full of promissory notes like the following: "Whosoever shall forsake father or mother, brethren or sisters, houses or lands, wife or children, for my sake and the gospel's, shall receive an hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come life everlasting." Parley explained to William that the words of Jesus Christ will not fail, and then he said, "I feel called upon by the Holy Ghost to forsake my house and home for the gospel's sake; and I will do it, placing both feet firm on these promises with nothing else to rely upon." (Adapted from<i>PPP,</i>1985, 16–17.)<br><br>Still not fully convinced, William left to do his business, and Parley made preparations for a mission that would be lifelong. Parley was not "conformed to this world." With all his heart he sought to both obtain and share those treasures that money cannot buy.<br><br>Have you ever noticed how much more you prize something you have worked for? Sometimes when things are just given to us without any effort on our part, we do not appreciate their full value. The same principle applies to the gospel of Jesus Christ. If you were just handed the gospel and if you have never taken the time to ask yourself why it is so important, I challenge you to do so now. Ask yourself: Why can the gospel of Jesus Christ bring us lasting peace? Why is there no other way to experience true joy? Why is it the source of those things of greatest worth?<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored. No one will force us to accept this gift of inestimable value. Why? It is up to us to determine why it is important and give it the highest priority in our lives.<br><br>All of us, whether a new convert or a lifetime member, have had to think through these things before. We may not remember the details, but we all participated in the Council in Heaven during our premortal life. The plan of happiness was presented by our Father in Heaven. The Savior accepted His plan, and our agency was preserved. We were given a choice.<br><br><i>Choice</i>is a big word in our society today. People insist on the right to make a choice. We are determined to choose what we will do each hour of the day. Choices without responsibility, however, can bring heartache and adversity into our lives.<br><br>The Savior believes in agency, and so must we. We are here today working out His plan of salvation. Do not let that which is most valuable slip away from you because you have not made a conscious choice to safeguard it. The Savior will not force us to seek for everything that money cannot buy. But He will lovingly guide us.<br><br>Napoleon Bonaparte drew some interesting conclusions about how the Savior leads with love. While in exile at St. Helena, Napoleon asked another man in his suite, "Can you tell me who Jesus Christ was?" Then Napoleon went on to say: "I will tell you." Napoleon compared himself and other heroes of antiquity with Christ and then showed how far Jesus surpassed them all. "I think I understand somewhat of human nature," said Napoleon, "and I tell you all these were men, and I am a man, but not one is like Him. Jesus Christ was more than man. Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and myself, founded great empires; but upon what did the creation of our genius depend? Upon force. Jesus alone founded His empire upon love and to this very day millions would die for Him." (In Charles E. Sargent,<i>Our Home: Or Influences Emanating from the Hearthstone</i>[Springfield, Massachusetts: King-Richardson, 1900, c1899], 325.)<br><br>Most of us sitting here today would say we are among those willing to die for the Savior. Would we not have defended Him if we had been there that night He was sentenced to death? We would not have denied Him. The Lord, however, does not ask us to die for Him. He asks us to live for Him. We certainly chose, in the premortal world, to live for Him--meaning to devote our lives here to Him. He asks us to choose to follow His example to love and serve one another. To the degree we accomplish this, we are valiant in our testimony of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us that when we were baptized we left neutral ground, and we can never get back to it. If we choose not to follow the Savior's example, we are choosing to follow Satan. The promise of glory in the life to come is too great a gift to foolishly squander. President Harold B. Lee taught that we must remember that we are here today to earn our eternal salvation, and we do not want to<br><br><i>be like those foolhardy ones on the river above the Niagara Falls who were approaching the dangerous rapids. . . . Despite warnings of the river guards to go toward safety before it was too late, and in complete disregard of the warnings, they laughed, they danced, they drank, they mocked, and they perished.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1970, 117]<br><br>Webster's dictionary gives us a clear definition of the word<i>strategy:</i>"A careful plan or method . . . toward a goal" (<i>Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,</i>10th ed., s.v. "strategy," 1162). We each need strategies in our life.<br><br>How do we acquire these strategies or "careful plans" and make them a part of our lives? In Deuteronomy 5:27 we read that after Moses had received the Ten Commandments, the Israelites said, "We will hear it [the word of God], and<i>do it"</i>(emphasis added).<br><br>Not in some distant future when life gets easier, but now, tonight, as we leave this meeting, I hope each of us can begin to make deposits in our spiritual bank accounts. If we are not continually building these assets of most worth, they soon become overdrawn. And we are left feeling helpless and hopeless.<br><br>Money cannot buy love, health, or happiness, or even what it bought last year. Money may be used as a universal passport everywhere except in heaven. If I asked you how to receive the best returns on your spiritual investments, I am sure you would know the answers. Unfortunately, common sense is not always common practice. So let me be a grandmother for a minute and whisper a few words of experience in your ear. Since I have been balancing my spiritual checkbook just a little longer than most of you, allow me to offer four tried and true strategies for obtaining a life of lasting worth. This list is not intended to be complete, but it will give you a place to start.<br><h2><b>Determine Your Plans for Spiritual Growth</b></h2><br>The first strategy: Determine your plans for spiritual growth. Remember to say your prayers--morning and night. In Alma 37:37, Alma instructed his son Helaman:<br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God.</i><br><br>When you pray, have you ever considered not only pleading for help but also reporting for duty? Ask for the Spirit to guide you. If you will pray for direction and listen for promptings, you will become familiar with those promptings and learn to act on them. The gospel will come alive in your life. You will have more of those "aha" experiences that help you see what really matters.<br><br>Also, do not forget to read your scriptures. For the past two years my husband and I have discovered one of the best spiritual investment programs we have ever undertaken. We determined to read two chapters of the scriptures together every day. It is not a matter of how busy we are; it is simply placing a high priority on reading the word of the Lord on a daily basis. And what a difference doing this together has made! Greater harmony, peace, and insight have come into our marriage.<br><br>We are all given 24 hours a day. Each of us can choose what we will do with them. Decide now to read your scriptures every day. I think we all can budget 10 to 15 minutes a day to find out what the Lord wants us to know. By committing to read just two chapters a day, you can read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the New Testament in one year. It works! If you are reading as a couple, it is a great bonding experience. If you are reading alone, it is a great time to commune with the Holy Ghost.<br><br>All investments in our spiritual growth lead to the keeping of covenants. More than a hundred years ago the prophet Brigham Young counseled the Saints: "Now is the time for labor. Let the fire of the covenant . . . burn in your hearts, like flame unquenchable" (The Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 28 September 1846, Church Archives, Salt Lake City, 5). More recently, Elder M. Russell Ballard has said: "Sometimes we are tempted to let our lives be governed more by convenience than by covenant. . . . But there is no spiritual power in living by convenience. The power comes as we keep our covenants" (<i>CR,</i>April 1999, 113; or "Like a Flame Unquenchable,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1999, 86).<br><br>As I have met and been inspired by Saints the world over, I have seen what happens to people who keep their covenants. I have seen what happens when they take time to invest in their spiritual well-being. I have watched their lives change and their testimonies grow.<br><br>Four years ago I was in Kiev, Ukraine, and the mission president's wife took me to the home of Katya Sarduk, a lovely young woman with two children. Katya had just joined the Church, and her eyes sparkled as she told about her conversion. She loved her new faith and was committed to living the gospel. As I left her home that day, I prayed that the fire of the covenant would continue to burn in her heart. I prayed that her children and her children's children would embrace the truth.<br><br>I returned to Kiev just two months ago and wondered if I would see her again. I arrived for Church meetings on Sunday. Soon I was introduced to my interpreter, a lovely blonde woman with sparkling eyes who said, "Do you remember me?" Her countenance was even brighter than before. Katya Sarduk had grown in the gospel. She had invested in her spiritual well-being, and her joy was overflowing.<br><br>I cannot help but wonder about the missionaries who taught her. Does the fire of the covenant still burn in their hearts? My dear brothers and sisters who have returned from missions, if the people you helped bring into the Church were to see you today, would they recognize you? Would they see a bright countenance when they look into your eyes? Are you praying, reading the scriptures, going to the temple, and otherwise investing in your spiritual well-being? With all of my heart, I hope so. I hope that worldly concerns have not kept you from investing in eternity.<br><h2><b>Serve Others</b></h2><br>The second strategy: Serve others. Make unselfish investments that will produce spiritual dividends. In my personal life I have found that what you give to others always pays dividends. Service to others is a wise investment. In Matthew 10:39 we are told, "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."<br><br>One wise young couple determined soon after their marriage that with every paycheck they would delegate a portion to help others. Over the years their ability to give enlarged with their ability to produce, and now they are among the most generous, charitable, and successful people I know.<br><br>Service to others is the very essence of the gospel. Service brings joy as nothing else can. It develops our inner strength and helps us feel more grateful. Service brings us closer to our Father in Heaven. In Matthew 25:40, the Savior taught: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."<br><br>In our families, in our ward, in our own communities, we find countless opportunities for meaningful service.<br><br>Recently another financier was asked about his extraordinary success in life. His reply was: "Study the tree and put your basket where the apples will fall" ("James L. Sorenson's Primer for Success, or How to Become a Billionaire,"<i>Deseret News,</i>29 August 1999, M1). The Lord provided the organizations of the Church for the purposes of filling our spiritual baskets, and as we serve others, blessings come into our own lives. We don't need to start a new program, establish a foundation, or enlist in all kinds of causes. But we do need to fulfill our callings as visiting teachers and home teachers and reach out to others in our own ward. We need to be kind to roommates and family members. More than an activity or a project, service is a way of life. It is a way of being! Priesthood holders serve. Members of the Relief Society serve.<br><br>The Relief Society declaration makes this clear. It says that we "delight in service and good works," and we do! (Mary Ellen Smoot, "Rejoice, Daughters of Zion,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1999, 93). We want to fill our baskets and partake of the fruit of the tree of life.<br><br>One group of young people from a college ward and a stake institute class determined to spend a Super Saturday serving those in need. They started in the morning with baptisms for the dead, and those who were endowed did an endowment session. There were 113 who turned out, and they spent the rest of the day making hygiene kits for Humanitarian Services. They produced 3,500 kits. Each kit contained two unbreakable combs, two toothbrushes, one tube of toothpaste, a bar of soap, one bottle of shampoo, one travel sewing kit, and one hand towel. These kits are sent out to orphanages, women's shelters, and homeless shelters. They are also used for emergency relief efforts. After this activity the consensus of this youth group was that with every future activity they needed to include a service project.<br><br>If you have a Humanitarian Service Center in your area, you can call ahead and make arrangements for a time you would be able to assist. There are needs to be met everywhere. There are bishops' storehouses, canneries, and welfare farms. If you do not have these facilities in your area, look for ways you can be of service in your own communities. Organize your young people and check out orphanages, hospitals, and homeless shelters for possible ways you may be of service. Present a proposal to priesthood leaders for their counsel and direction.<br><br>An organization has been formed in which students have an opportunity to help in an orphanage in Quito, Ecuador. They help care for and love the children, prepare food, and will often spend nights with a child who is in the hospital in need of medical attention.<br><br>In Bucharest, Romania, an estimated 65 young single adults gathered for a conference, studying the gospel and participating in community service. They donated blood to the local blood bank and spent time at a local orphanage. Participants at the blood drive received food credits that were used to purchase food to help a home for the elderly.<br><br>More than 180 young single adults from Ontario, Montreal, Ottawa, New York, Michigan, and Ohio gathered to paint the fence surrounding the Toronto Ontario Temple grounds.<br><br>From countries in what was formerly known as Yugoslavia, youth and young adults gathered in Slovenia for a three-day conference. The conference included a pizza party, "secret friend" assignments, dancing, and a service project.<br><br>Be examples. Look for needs. Make the world a better place. It will pay dividends in the future.<br><h2><b>Cultivate Humility</b></h2><br>The third strategy: Cultivate humility. Remember your indebtedness to the Lord and never become indebted to the things of the world. No person can fully and completely discharge his debt to our Savior for what He has done for us, but we can make regular payments. As we give our will to Him and do what He would have us do, we are showing appreciation for His gift of the Atonement.<br><br>One mission president I know talks about the obedient missionaries in his mission. He never indicates that he hopes his missionaries are obedient. He always speaks in the affirmative: "Our missionaries are obedient." If for some reason he finds one doing something that is not appropriate, he corrects him or her immediately, reminds him of his expectations and the Lord's expectations of him, and then becomes his friend.<br><br>Our Father in Heaven will do the same. We can go to Him and pour out our hearts, ask for forgiveness, and promise to do better. He will again become our personal friend. We never need to live outside His influence if we will be obedient and listen to His promptings.<br><br>It is always best to avoid sin. None of us can avoid it altogether; we all draw upon the powers of the Atonement. Sin can be compared to debt, which has been said to be like quicksand and just about as hard to get out of.<br><br>President Hinckley was speaking to missionaries, and he reminded them of what Sir Galahad said:<br><br><i>What was it that Sir Galahad said? "My strength is as the strength of ten, because my heart is pure." What was it the Lord said? "Let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly." That's the commandment of the Lord through modern revelation.</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>359]<br><br>Recently a professor on this campus told me about two different students who came to him with confessions of cheating. Each had lied about completing reading assignments in order to receive a higher grade. As the days passed, both realized that they had cheated themselves. This incident plagued the conscience of one student, and she decided she must set things straight. The other was preparing for a mission and could not feel good about teaching others to keep the commandments and be honest. And so they sought for forgiveness, and inner peace was restored.<br><br>Repentance is a priceless gift, bought with our Savior's sinless blood. No amount of money can buy the sweet peace that forgiveness brings or the hope that we can change. We can overcome. Our lives can be rich, purposeful, happy, and hopeful.<br><h2><b>Evaluate Your Priorities</b></h2><br>The fourth strategy: Evaluate your priorities. Examine your life's portfolio. What kind of returns are you receiving on your investments? Have you invested in that which you value most? The Lord has provided us with parents, leaders, and organizations of the Church to assist us in developing standards to guide our lives. Almost without our knowing it we can be trapped by worldly lures and lose sight of eternal goals. All through the ages prophets have sounded the warning: "The love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows" (1 Timothy 6:10).<br><br>Periodically we need to examine our life's portfolio and evaluate the kind of returns we are receiving. In other words, we need to evaluate the direction we are going and make adjustments where necessary. Do we feel good about who we are and have confidence in the decisions we are making? Do we have joy and peace in our hearts?<br><br>Along with renewing our minds, spending more time on our knees, and reading the scriptures, we also go to places where we know we will be taught truth, and then we act upon the truths we are taught. That link many times is missing, the link of acting on what we hear or on what we learn. It is only as we act on those promptings that come to us as we attend meetings or read and study that we can feel real joy. Blessings will come into our lives through obedience. Putting off renewing our minds or seeking the perfect will of God brings regret and many times great heartache.<br><br>We live in a unique period of history. Here we are in a new millennium. You are beloved youth. Our Father in Heaven is depending on each of us to do our part. The Relief Society declaration says:<br><br><i>We are beloved spirit daughters of God, and our lives have meaning, purpose, and direction. . . . We are women . . . who: . . .</i><br><br><i>Dedicate ourselves to strengthening</i>[that includes preparation for]<i>marriages, families, and homes.</i><br><br><i>Find nobility in motherhood and joy in womanhood. . . .</i><br><br><i>Rejoice in the blessings of the temple, understand our divine destiny, and strive for exaltation.</i>[Smoot, "Rejoice, Daughters of Zion," 92–93]<br><br>We know who we are, and we have total truth to guide us.<br><br>We can change. We can overcome. We have the Savior to assist us, and He proved so many times that He can change people's lives. Look how He changed Peter. Look how He changed Mary Magdalene. He gave sight to those who could not see. He healed the lame, and He can heal us too. He can make our lives rich and purposeful if we will give our will to Him.<br><br><i>Evil multiplies by the response it seeks to provoke, and when I return evil for evil, I engender corruption myself. The chain of evil is broken for good when a pure and loving heart absorbs a hurt and forbears to hurt in return. The forgiveness of Christ bears no grudge. The love of Christ allows no offense to endure. The compassion of Christ embraces all things and draws them toward himself. Deep within every child of God the Light of Christ resides, guiding, comforting, purifying the heart that turns to him.</i>[Dennis Rasmussen,<i>The Lord's Question: Thoughts on the Life of Response</i>[Provo, Utah: Keter Foundation, 1985], 63–64]<br><br>President Harold B. Lee told this great story<br><br><i>In a . . . meeting I listened to a young girl's heartwarming testimony. Her father was afflicted with what the doctors had pronounced was an incurable malady. To his wife one morning, this stricken father, after a night of pain and suffering, had said with great feeling, "I am so thankful today." "For what?" she asked. He replied, "For God's giving me the privilege of one more day with you."</i><br><br><i>Today I . . . desire with all my heart that all within the sound of this broadcast would likewise thank God for one more day! For what? For the opportunity to take care of some unfinished business. To repent; to right some wrongs; to influence for good some wayward child; to reach out to someone who cries for help--in short, to thank God for one more day to prepare to meet</i>[Him]. [<i>CR,</i>October 1970, 117]<br><br>Can we each find something for which we need to repent? Are we working on overcoming that weakness? Do we need to correct some wrongs or misunderstandings? Can we influence some person who we see making wrong choices? Are we grateful for this day--one more day to prepare in every way to meet God?<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>I believe that each of us can be renewed in mind and spirit as we sincerely seek for those things that money cannot buy. We must want to do God's will and gain the knowledge necessary to act accordingly. In other words, we need to put Him first in all the decisions we make. We each need to ask ourselves, "Are we ready? Are we ready to have the kind of experiences that are life changing and exhilarating? Are our hearts and minds pure?" The way we choose to spend each day of our lives will dictate the direction we will go and the joys that will fulfill our lives now and for all eternity.<br><br>September 11, 2001, will be a date forever chiseled in the stone recesses of our memory. At the last October general conference President Hinckley lamented the state of the world. A prophet of God essentially said to us that these are perilous, precarious, fragile, and dangerous times. (See<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 87–91; or "The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 72–74.) But are we without hope? Absolutely not. As President Hinckley stated: "Our safety lies in repentance. Our strength comes of obedience to the commandments of God" (<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 91; or "The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 74).<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, "Lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life" (Helaman 5:8). No other gift is greater. Of this I humbly bear testimony with grateful heart and with confidence in each of you to accomplish this, and I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Mary Ellen Smoot was the Relief Society general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 February 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
Several years ago I had the opportunity to work at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. During the Apollo 12 mission I received a telephone call from the capsule communicator in mission control. He had been communicating with Richard F. Gordon, who was orbiting the moon while the other two astronauts--Charles Conrad, Jr., and Alan L. Bean--were on the lunar surface. Although he was 250,000 miles from the earth, he was able to communicate with the capsule communicator. He had encountered a problem. He needed guidance and direction. He needed an answer. I possessed the technical information Richard Gordon needed to resolve his problem. This information was given to the capsule communicator, who was able to relay the answer. Likewise, in our earthly journey, we will need answers to questions and guidance in our lives. Through prayer we can communicate with the God of Heaven and receive answers.<br><br>An example of prayer and divine communication is recorded in the Book of Mormon. Aaron, one of the sons of Mosiah, had the remarkable experience of teaching the gospel to the Lamanite king who was king over all the land:<br><br><i>And Aaron ... said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: ... If now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe.</i><br><br><i>And now when Aaron heard this, ... he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.</i>[Alma 22:7–8]<br><br>Aaron then read and expounded to him the scriptures (doctrine) about the Creation, the Fall, and the plan of redemption.<br><br><i>After Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken?...</i><br><br><i>But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</i><br><br><i>And ... the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</i><br><br><i>O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee.</i>[Alma 22:15–18]<br><br>God answered the king's humble prayer and instructed him in eternal truths. The king then ministered to his family and servants and opened the door for the preaching of the gospel throughout his kingdom. "And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord" (Alma 23:5).<br><br>There are several true principles included in the scriptural account of the king's conversion and his coming to know God. These teachings demonstrate the spiritual power of<br><br>*Testimony (Alma 22:8)<br><br>*Scriptures (Alma 22:12–13)<br><br>*Desire (Alma 22:16)<br><br>*Faith and Hope (Alma 22:16)<br><br>*Repentance (Alma 22:16, 18)<br><br>*Ministering (Alma 22:23, 25–27)<br><br>*Prayer (Alma 22:16–18)<br><br>Application of these principles can help us--as they did the Lamanite king--to know God and come unto Him.<br><br>There is a God. It is vitally important that we know Him. The Redeemer of the World, in His great intercessory prayer, declared: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).<br><br>President James E. Faust said:<br><br><i>Having such a relationship can unchain the divinity within us, and nothing can make a greater difference in our lives as we come to know and understand our divine relationship with God and His Beloved Son, our Master....</i><br><br><i>We should earnestly seek not just to know about the Master, but to strive, as He invited, to be one with Him (see John 17:21).</i>["That We Might Know Thee,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1999, 2]<br><br>President Howard W. Hunter taught, "We must know Christ better than we know him; we must remember him more than we remember him; we must serve him more valiantly than we serve him" ("He Invites Us to Follow Him,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1994, 5).<br><br>Not only is it important for us to know Him, it is equally important we know that He knows us.<br><br>Our latter-day apostles and prophets have proclaimed:<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny....</i><br><br><i>In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life.</i>["The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102]<br><br>His knowledge of us is illustrated in a journal entry of pioneer Joseph Millett, who with his large family was suffering through some very difficult times.<br><br><i>"One of my children came in and said that Brother Newton Hall's folks was out of bread, had none that day.</i><br><br><i>"I divided our flour in a sack to send up to Brother Hall. Just then Brother Hall came.</i><br><br><i>"Says I, 'Brother Hall, are you out of flour?'</i><br><br><i>"'Brother Millett, we have none.'</i><br><br><i>"'Well, Brother Hall, there is some in that sack. I have divided and was going to send it to you. Your children told mine that you was out.'</i><br><br><i>"Brother Hall began to cry. He said he had tried others, but could not get any. He went to the cedars and prayed to the Lord, and the Lord told him to go to Joseph Millett.</i><br><br><i>"'Well Brother Hall, you needn't bring this back. If the Lord sent you for it you don't owe me for it.'"</i><br><br><i>That night Joseph Millett recorded a remarkable sentence in his journal:</i><br><br><i>"You can't tell me how good it made me feel to know that the Lord knew there was such a person as Joseph Millett."</i>[Diary of Joseph Millett, holograph, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City; in Boyd K. Packer, "A Tribute to the Rank and File of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1980, 63]<br><br>We can communicate with the Almighty through prayer. Prayer is a sacred two-way communication with God, and we have been invited to "pray unto the Lord, call upon his holy name" (D&amp;amp;C 65:4).<br><br>The LDS Bible Dictionary provides some sacred insights about our relationship with God as we approach Him in prayer:<br><br><i>As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (Matt. 7:7–11). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God, but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant, but that are made conditional on our asking for them.</i>[Bible Dictionary, s.v. "prayer," 752–53]<br><br>In Gethsemane the Savior taught a great lesson about being submissive. His example to us was that the will of the Father, not His own will, be done.<br><br><i>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</i><br><br><i>And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</i>[Mark 14:35–36]<br><br>This same spirit of submissiveness was illustrated in a recent article by Elder Neal A. Maxwell. He related an account of nine-year-old Melissa Howes as she participated in family prayer shortly before her father died of cancer. Her unselfish pleading included the following prayer:<br><br><i>"Heavenly Father, bless my daddy, and if you need to take him and need him more than us, you can have him. We want him, but Thy will be done. And please help us not to be mad at you" (letter from Christie Howes, 25 Feb. 1998).</i>["Testifying of the Great and Glorious Atonement,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 2001, 14]<br><br>When the resurrected Lord appeared to the Nephites, He taught and ministered unto them. Although His ministry was short, many of His teachings focused on prayer. Sacred events--so sacred a record of them was not written--occurred because of His prayers unto the Father. He also gave some specific instructions regarding the use of His name:<br><br>"Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name" (3 Nephi 18:19).<br><br>"Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and children may be blessed" (3 Nephi 18:21).<br><br>The Bible Dictionary states:<br><br><i>We pray in Christ's name when our mind is the mind of Christ, and our wishes the wishes of Christ--when his words abide in us (John 15:7). We then ask for things it is possible for God to grant. Many prayers remain unanswered because they are not in Christ's name at all; they in no way represent his mind, but spring out of the selfishness of man's heart.</i>[Bible Dictionary, s.v. "prayer," 753]<br><br>The Lord has cautioned, "Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips" (D&amp;amp;C 63:61). According to Elder Dallin H. Oaks:<br><br><i>This caution applies to all that is done in the name of the Lord, from the performance of sacred priesthood ordinances at one end of the spectrum to the things said in sermons, teachings, and prayers at the other.</i>[<i>His Holy Name</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1998), 18]<br><br>After the first day of the Savior's Nephite ministry, the disciples whom Jesus had chosen<br><br><i>ministered unto the people....</i><br><br><i>And ... they ... prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus.</i><br><br><i>And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them....</i><br><br><i>And ... the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire....</i><br><br><i>And ... Jesus came and stood in the midst and ministered unto them....</i><br><br><i>And ... Jesus ... bowed himself to the earth, and he said:</i><br><br><i>Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen....</i><br><br><i>Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.</i>[3 Nephi 19:7–9, 13, 15, 19–21]<br><br>The Holy Ghost, a member of the Godhead, is a revelator, a guide, a teacher, a comforter, a purifier, a sanctifier, and a testifier. The Holy Ghost will guide us "into all truth" (John 16:13) and testify that Jesus is the Christ (see John 15:26 and 1 Corinthians 12:3). Nothing is more fundamentally important than knowing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.<br><br>There is a relationship between prayer (asking) and revelation (the answer). President Marion G. Romney stated:<br><br><i>Just as prayer is the means by which men address the Lord, so revelation is the means by which God communicates to men....</i><br><br><i>Now I know ... and bear witness to the fact that revelation from the Lord comes through the spoken word, by personal visitation, by messengers from the Lord, through dreams, and by way of visions, and by the voice of the Lord coming into one's mind.</i><br><br><i>Most often, however, revelation comes to us by means of the still, small voice.</i>["Prayer and Revelation,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1978, 50]<br><br>The Lord has declared:<br><br><i>Behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.</i><br><br><i>Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 8:2–3]<br><br>A process of revelation is included in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>In summary, that process is:<br><br>*Study it out<br><br>*Make a decision<br><br>*Ask the Lord<br><br>*Observe feelings and thoughts<br><br>I was taught a powerful lesson by my mission president regarding this process. I was a student at Utah State University. My mission president, also from Logan, lived nearby. I frequently visited him and his wife. He always inquired about my dating experiences and if I was making any progress in finding an eternal companion. I always replied that I was working on it.<br><br>One night when he asked the question, I stated, "I have it narrowed down to two."<br><br>He asked, "What have you been doing about it?"<br><br>I replied, "I have been praying that the Lord would direct me to the right one."<br><br>He then said, "If I was the Lord, I wouldn't answer a prayer like that." He then reminded me of the revelatory process included in the Doctrine and Covenants--that I needed to make a decision and then seek confirmation through prayer. The matter was studied out, a decision made, confirmation sought, and a prayer answered.<br><br>The Lord Himself has given this promise:<br><br><i>If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:61]<br><br>The Lord has also said:<br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i><br><br><i>Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:63–64]<br><br>The word<i>ask</i>is included in many of the scriptures referenced previously. This same pattern prevails throughout the scriptures. The Prophet Joseph Smith was deeply impressed with this scripture:<br><br><i>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i><br><br><i>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</i>[James 1:5–6]<br><br>The Prophet wrote:<br><br><i>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine....</i><br><br><i>... I at length came to the determination to "ask of God."...</i><br><br><i>So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt....</i><br><br><i>... I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me....</i><br><br><i>... When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS--H 1:12–14, 16–17; emphasis in original]<br><br>The appearance of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith is the foundation of the restored gospel. Through his humble prayer the heavens were again opened, and his prayer was answered. Millions, both among the living and the dead, have been blessed because of the Prophet's prayer that opened the door of the Restoration. Countless others will be blessed as "thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 65:2).<br><br>A similar pattern of prayer (asking) and revelation (answer) is included in the final writings of Moroni:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will</i>manifest<i>the truth of it unto you,</i>by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. [Moroni 10:4–5; emphasis added]<br><br>Untold numbers have asked for and received the answer that the Book of Mormon is true. This promise is extended to all of us.<br><br>There is an inner peace that comes from calling home and simply talking to God through fervent and sincere prayer. There are times when we may be discouraged, faced with trials and tribulations or the loss of a loved one or a severe illness. We may have a feeling of being all alone, that no one cares. There may be those moments when we need to forsake sin and make midcourse corrections in life. At such times we can literally open heaven's door and communicate with the Almighty and know that He is there--that He listens and that He understands. He knows how to succor.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith offered these words of prayer in Liberty Jail: "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1). The Lord answered, "My son, peace be unto thy soul" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7).<br><br>Alma the Younger cried unto the Lord and found peace:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.</i>[Alma 38:8]<br><br>Enos prayed mightily "all the day long ... ; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens. ... Wherefore my soul did rest" (Enos 1:4, 17).<br><br>To Oliver Cowdery the Lord said, "Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:23).<br><br>This peace can come to all of us, both young and old. Several years ago my older children and I were returning from a trip to eastern Utah. On the way home we encountered a terrible storm. The snow was deep. The road had not been plowed. No other cars were on the road. The wind was blowing, making it difficult to see. My sons were asleep in the back of the car. My daughter, age seven, was in the front seat by me. There was complete silence as the car slowly made its way over a steep mountain pass.<br><br>She broke the silence by saying, "Dad, we're going to be okay."<br><br>I responded, "How do you know?"<br><br>She replied, "I just talked to Heavenly Father, and I feel warm inside, warmer than when I gave my talk in church. I know we are going to be okay."<br><br>Someday most of you will be parents. Remember that the Lord has commanded, "And they [parents] shall also teach their children to pray" (D&amp;amp;C 68:28). Personally, one of my greatest hopes and desires as a father and grandfather is that my children and grandchildren will develop a pattern of regular prayer. President Heber J. Grant said:<br><br><i>I have little or no fear for the boy or the girl, the young man or the young woman, who honestly and conscientiously supplicate God twice a day for the guidance of His Spirit. I am sure that when temptation comes they will have the strength to overcome it by the inspiration that shall be given to them. Supplicating the Lord for the guidance of His Spirit places around us a safeguard, and if we earnestly and honestly seek the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord, I can assure you that we will receive it.</i>[<i>Gospel Standards: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Heber J. Grant</i>(Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1969), 26]<br><br>The Bible Dictionary also states, "Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work, and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings" (Bible Dictionary, s.v. "prayer," 753).<br><br>There may be times when we pray and expect the Lord to do everything--we expect that everything depends upon Him. For example, we may pray that the Lord will bless the poor and the needy and the sick and the afflicted. We need to help the Lord answer those prayers. What if we said, "Today is fast day. I promise Thee that I will give a generous offering that the needs of the poor in our ward and stake will be taken care of--that Sister White's utility bill may be paid and the gas not turned off."<br><br>The prophet recently counseled the youth to be prayerful. He said:<br><br><i>You need His help. ... You cannot do it alone....</i><br><br><i>So live that in good conscience you can speak with the Lord. Get on your knees and thank Him for His goodness to you and express to Him the righteous desires of your hearts. The miracle of it all is that He hears. He responds. He answers--not always as we might wish He would answer, but there is no question in my mind that He answers.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "A Prophet's Counsel and Prayer for Youth,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 2001, 10]<br><br>Lawrence Johnson is a dear friend who lives in Provo. During World War II he was a bomber pilot. One night his crew was given a mission to bomb a certain target. It was a dark night over the South China Sea. The antiaircraft artillery was heavy. Searchlights illuminated the sky. After they had passed over the drop zone, "The navigator stuck his head into the cockpit and said, 'I don't have any idea as to where we are. I got so scared back there that I just stopped keeping our position.'" Brother Johnson continued, "To complicate things, our radar went out after the bomb run. None of that seemed to bother me because of a sweet calm and a feeling that all was well. I pointed to a position on the map I was holding and told the navigator he could assume that was our position. He looked dubiously at me and asked, 'Are you sure?' I assured him it was--my quick little prayer seemed to leave little doubt." From those coordinates on the map the navigator plotted the direction to their home base. After flying for seven hours they spotted the runway lights of their home base and landed safely. (Lawrence H. Johnson, personal history.) Likewise, through prayer and spiritual guidance, we also will be able to return safely to our home base--home with God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>I know and testify there is a God. I know He knows us. He hears and answers our prayers. He has not left us alone on our earthly journey. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, His Only Begotten Son. I testify that He is our Savior and Redeemer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Clayton S.

<h1>ur of Light (Romans 13:12) - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to speak about a great robbery that is taking place among us. It is of more consequence than any theft in history. The thief is Satan, and his objective is to rob us of light. Lucifer does not want to steal light for himself; he wants to steal light because it is the presence of light by which he can be defeated. Since Satan abhors light and avoids its presence, and since he cannot conventionally steal light against one's will, his efforts and temptations are designed to entice his targets to voluntarily yield it up that he might more freely and effectively carry forth his destructive plans. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches:<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i><br><br><i>Light and truth forsake that evil one. . . .</i><br><br><i>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:36–37, 39]<br><br>Satan steals light from us through our own disobedience.<br><br>Why is light so valuable and its loss so devastating? The revelations of the Restoration contribute much to our understanding about light. The analogies I will use this morning are based upon scriptures that refer to light as spirit, as truth, or as the power of God. Having light is evidence that Jesus Christ is part of our life. His light--His spirit, His truth, His power--inspires, motivates, comforts, capacitates, and protects. An abundance of light in a person's life is manifested by virtues such as faith, hope, charity, patience, kindness, and humility. Outward signs of light are easy to recognize: respect, dependability, dedication to duty, modesty, obedience, and reverence for the things of God. When light is diminished in our lives, motivation toward spiritual things also diminishes to one degree or another. We are less exact in our commandment keeping and less dedicated to activities such as home teaching, Church attendance, temple attendance, scripture reading, and prayer--the very things that intensify light in our lives. With insufficient light we are more susceptible to temptation, and like a plant without the nourishment of the light of the sun, without the nourishment of the light of the Son of God, we can also weaken and shrivel and eventually die spiritually.<br><br>We call people who have an abundance of this light "spiritual." Jesus Christ is the light and life of the world. Spiritual people--or those who strive to always have His spirit to be with them--reflect the light of Jesus Christ in their lives and in their countenances. I love senior citizens in the Church--those who have been sanctified through continued righteousness over time. Their countenances reflect a life well lived. Having learned to walk in the light, they have become a reflection of that light. This is clearly evident in the radiance of those who give significant time to temple service.<br><br>Light is like a protective shield that can withstand the fiery darts of the adversary. The Apostle Paul wrote to the Romans:<br><br><i>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</i><br><br><i>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness. . . .</i><br><br><i>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</i>[Romans 13:12–14]<br><br>To put on the armor of light is to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the light and life of the world. This light--His light--forsakes the evil one.<br><br>Let me give you two examples. First, as I read this familiar story, listen closely and try to discern at what particular point darkness was defeated.<br><br><i>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.</i><br><br><i>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being--just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</i><br><br><i>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--</i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him! [JS--H 1:15–17; emphasis in original]<br><br>In the Sacred Grove, darkness left young Joseph Smith when the light first appeared.<br><br>The second example involves an experience I had in graduate school. I asked one of my classmates to take the missionary discussions. He did not join the Church at that time, and I moved back to Arizona. When I came back for another summer school session, I learned that although he had not been baptized, he had been going to church for the entire year that I had been away.<br><br>One evening I got a call from him requesting that we meet in the bleachers of the Smith Fieldhouse. He was puzzled over something that had just occurred. A few years before my friend had seen a movie that was a graphic R-rated movie on the subject of demonic possession. Now a friend had asked him to see the sequel to the movie, and this suggestion to see the second movie had brought back vivid memories of the content of the first movie that, at the time, my friend had thought little about. But now, a few years later, and after a year's worth of church attendance, things were somehow different. He went to bed but could not stop thinking about the movie. He became extremely nervous and began sweating profusely. Finally, at about two o'clock in the morning, he reached over to his nightstand and picked up his copy of the Book of Mormon and started to read. He said that as he read, the nervousness went away and he calmed down and was able to fall asleep.<br><br>His purpose for our meeting was to ask me if I could explain what had happened to him. You can imagine I was most eager to do so. I testified to him that the Book of Mormon was true and that the light contained within its pages chased away the darkness that he was experiencing as he reflected on the evil contained within the movie. Again, light forsakes the evil one!<br><br>Light can increase or decrease according to what we desire, what we think, and what we do. Nephi taught:<br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</i>[2 Nephi 28:30]<br><br>The principle that we receive more and more from God according to our continued obedience is true of light. The Lord declared:<br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:24]<br><br>This same truth can also work in reverse. People lose light line upon line or sin upon sin--here a little and there a little. Although each ray of lost light can be almost imperceptible to a person at the time, the aggregate or cumulative loss that has taken place over time puts one in grave danger. The spiritual immune system becomes depleted, and when the going gets tough, the once tough cannot get going because there is little to reach down and draw upon for strength and power.<br><br>The story is told of an Eskimo who was losing his meat to a crafty wolf. One day the Eskimo took his razor-sharp knife and placed it blade up in the snow. He then put a big piece of meat on top of the blade so that all the wolf would see was the meat. The wolf came and began enjoying the easy meal. The meat was so delicious that he didn't notice that as he was licking and biting, he was cutting his own tongue on the knife. The wolf was literally drinking his own blood, which continued until he became so weak that he froze to death.<br><br>As in the story of the Eskimo, Satan tempts us with alluring distractions and circumstances that may appear on the surface to be harmless. But as we partake, the light slowly dissipates until we become weak and in serious spiritual trouble. President Kimball taught that transgression "begins tiny and grows to monumental proportions. It grows drop by drop, inch by inch" (<i>TSWK,</i>152).<br><br>When we lose light, Satan has effectively neutralized us. He has taken us out of the battle--or we have allowed ourselves to be taken out of the battle. The armies of the Lord cannot be defeated, but they can defeat themselves. For example, in the Old Testament there is a story about a man named Achan whose disobedience brought defeat to Israel's army (see Joshua 7; 22:20). In the victorious battle against Jericho he had taken an object from the enemy that God identified as accursed. The next battle against the city of Ai was supposed to be easy, yet Israel met with a humiliating defeat. In response to Joshua's plea to know why they had been defeated, the Lord revealed the disobedience of this Israelite soldier in taking from the spoils of Jericho a forbidden or accursed object. This disobedience robbed the Israelites of the power needed to stand against its enemies. This story has universal application, for just as Israel lost power and protection, we also lose power and protection when we entertain forbidden thoughts, harbor evil desires, or engage in activities prohibited by God.<br><br>Maintaining light is like staying spiritually in shape so that when the test comes we can meet it. A person who slowly drifts over time into poor physical shape does not fully appreciate that fact until a test arises that requires great physical exertion. The test or trial clearly exposes the lack of capacity. A colleague of mine observed that it is the storm that reveals the importance of having your house built on rock and not on sand.<br><br>Imagine two elders who are home teaching companions. They return home from their separate Friday night activities to each find a message that a sister they home teach had been in an accident and desperately needed them to come to the hospital to administer a blessing. One elder had just returned home from a movie where violence, profanity, immorality, and partial nudity had been part of the film. The other elder had returned from a barbecue with friends. Which elder do you suppose would make an excuse or perhaps delay the hospital visit long enough to petition God for forgiveness to have the proper spirit to give a blessing? Which elder would feel comfortable meeting the challenge of listening to the still small voice of the Lord to pronounce an inspired blessing?<br><br>Dabbling in darkness robs one of light and consequently the spiritual confidence to stand in the Lord's place to bless as He would bless. The true witness that light has been lost comes when one shrinks back, lacking confidence to perform one's duty. Through disobedience Christian soldiers can effectively nullify the power of their own priesthood. What if both elders had attended that movie?<br><br>In our homes we have power outlets of either 240 or 120 volts. Dryers and ovens operate on 240 power, whereas all other devices require 120 power. A dryer or an oven would not work effectively on 120 power. Sometimes electrical problems cause what is known as a brownout. Electrical power is still present, but it is not sufficient to handle the load requirement. By way of analogy, compare 240 power to the power required to stand up to the challenges and temptations of latter-day life. Then compare 120 power to power that enables us to live, move, attend school, and function but that is insufficient when we are faced with the kinds of temptations that surround us. When we fail to maintain light in our lives, we fail to maintain necessary power levels. We slip into a "spiritual brownout," so to speak, placing ourselves in a dangerous weakened position with less strength to resist temptation.<br><br>Concerning Satan's tactics, Nephi wrote:<br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i>[2 Nephi 28:21]<br><br>The "all-is-well-in-Zion" way of discipleship is like this spiritual brownout. It says: I can be laid back in the Church. I can skip my personal prayers, indulge in borderline entertainment, skip some meetings, and sidestep full-hearted service. In essence, I can run at 120 power, and all is well. This is simply not true. As Nephi said, "Thus the devil cheateth their souls." We have been blindsided by our own inattention to duty and devotion to God. Over time we have lost a significant measure of what we all so desperately need--the light, the spirit, the power of God. We have been carefully weakened so that when a 240 test comes, we fail because we only possess 120 power.<br><br>As a campus bishop I saw this consequent result over and over in regard to serious sin. Invariably those in trouble had suffered losses before the bigger loss had occurred, and it was those preparatory losses that set up the bigger fall.<br><br>There is no little loss of light that is insignificant, and there is no little loss of light without the potential of becoming a major breach to the brightness of our armor. As Latter-day Saints we are blessed with the glorious light of the restored gospel. We have no excuse, as the scriptures state, to walk "in darkness at noon-day" (D&amp;amp;C 95:6). In the Doctrine and Covenants we are warned: "He who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><br>One temptation that seems to be a challenge for all of us is the temptation to play both sides of the fence. We select some things in the Church that we like and some things of the world that we like, and we try to settle in and get comfortable with the mix. Some want to partake of the fruit of the tree of life and also party in the great and spacious building. The Apostle James said, "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways" (James 1:8). Jesus taught, "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62). Just as a farmer who looks back cannot plough a straight furrow, neither can a disciple walk on the straight and narrow path for an extended period with split loyalties. Lot's wife was punished for her disobedience in looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah. Although her feet were pointed away from the city, perhaps her real problem was that her heart remained within it. Our feet as well as our hearts need to be on the gospel path.<br><br>I would like to issue a challenge: Sometime today take a piece of paper and divide it into two halves. On the right side list things that could intensify light in your life: temple attendance, attendance at all Sunday meetings, scriptures, prayers, repentance, service, and so forth. On the left side list things that you think, desire, do, say, view, or even places you go, that diminish light from your life. Then ask yourself in all honesty, "How can I improve in those things that intensify light, and what can I simply let go of that takes light away?" As in the story of Achan: "What accursed things do I do, say, think, or hold onto that drain my power?" This list can be compared to a dimmer switch that controls the intensity of light within our homes. Turn the dial to the right and light increases. Turn the dial to the left and the light dims. The decision as to which way we turn the dial is up to us.<br><br>Remember that this is not a balance sheet where the seven good things on the right side cancel out the five bad things on the left side, leaving us with two positives. If that was possible, I might reason, I can continue with the five things that take away light because I can easily counterbalance them and still come out on top. Somehow, feeling safe because of a balancing of the two is spiritually dangerous. The bad things we choose weaken the system so that sometimes we are unable to fully compensate by choosing good. In fact, the consequence of choosing bad, over time, is that the good doesn't seem so good anymore. As more and more bad things are chosen, they become more and more desirable and seem less and less wrong. Another consequence of choices that rob us of light is that we don't discern the good as clearly, and that leads to the possibility of delving deeper and deeper into the bad. When you are in the darkness, your eyes adjust, and it soon doesn't look dark anymore. So, too, can we adjust to dark deeds and actually acquire a taste for the bad.<br><br>We cannot willingly keep taking the poison without consequence. God will not be mocked, for as we sow, so shall we reap (see Galatians 6:7). As we sow light, we receive light. As we sow disobedience, we reap darkness. Jesus taught:<br><br><i>The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</i><br><br><i>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</i>[3 Nephi 13:22–23]<br><br>As you try this challenge you might find that you don't really have many things on the left side that cause a loss of light, but you will find that you could add more things on the right side that will bring more of God's light into your life. Sometimes the critical issue is not the commission of light-robbing activities but serious omissions of light-bringing deeds.<br><br>In connection with this challenge consider striving to make your living areas places where God's light can shine unobstructed. I currently serve in a branch presidency at the Missionary Training Center. The Missionary Training Center is a place where the Lord's light shines brightly--it is hard to go there and not feel the presence of the Holy Ghost. There are no questionable pictures on the walls, there is no music with suggestive lyrics, and there is no entertainment that compromises standards. The missionaries are trying hard to avoid the coarse, the unclean, and the vulgar. Christ and service to Christ is at the center. In this environment learning soars, and missionaries are often heard to say, "I have never felt the Spirit so often, or so intensely."<br><br>Although we are not full-time missionaries with that central focus, we can join together with our roommates or spouses and agree to cultivate an environment of light in our dormitories or apartments. As are the missionaries, we also can be Christ-centered, and we also can eliminate those things of the world that dim God's light. By doing so we can enjoy the blessings associated with increased light.<br><br>Living in an environment of light will have many advantages for you at this time in your life. You are searching for important answers to critical questions. It is always easier to find what we are looking for when the light is on. Doctrinally it is as simple as this: The closer we are to the light, the more we can see. The farther we step away from the light, the less we can see. And we need to be able to see clearly.<br><br>In a devotional assembly President Bateman told students:<br><br><i>You stand at a critical juncture in life. You have just crossed the threshold into adulthood. Your dreams and choices will determine not only your future but the destiny of untold generations to come!</i>[Merrill J. Bateman, "Light, Visions, and Dreams,"<i>BYU 2000–2001 Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 2001), 101]<br><br>In connection with this thought, he asked this question: "Are you living worthy to experience the light that the Lord wishes to bestow upon you?" ("Light, Visions," 101).<br><br>I would like to close with an observation by Elder Glenn L. Pace of the First Quorum of the Seventy:<br><br><i>Many of us take the blessings of the gospel for granted. It is as if we are passengers on the train of the Church, which has been moving forward gradually and methodically. Sometimes we have looked out the window and thought, "That looks kind of fun out there. This train is so restrictive." So we have jumped off and gone and played in the woods for a while. Sooner or later, we find it isn't as much fun as Lucifer makes it appear or we get critically injured, so we work our way back to the tracks and see the train ahead. With a determined sprint we catch up to it, breathlessly wipe the perspiration from our forehead, and thank the Lord for repentance.</i><br><br><i>While on the train, we can see the world and some of our own members outside laughing and having a great time. They taunt us and coax us to get off. Some throw logs and rocks on the tracks to try and derail it. Other members run alongside the tracks, and although they may never go play in the woods, they just can't seem to get on the train. Others try to run ahead and too often take the wrong turn.</i><br><br><i>I would propose that the luxury of getting on and off the train as we please is fading. The speed of the train is increasing. The woods are getting much too dangerous, and the fog and darkness are moving in. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . With all the prophecies we have seen fulfilled, what great event are we awaiting prior to saying, "Count me in"? What more do we need to see or experience before we get on the train and stay on it until we reach our destination? It is time for a spiritual revival. It is time to dig down deep within ourselves and rekindle our own light.</i>[Glenn L. Pace, "Spiritual Revival,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1992, 11–12]<br><br>May each of us dig down deep and do what is needed to intensify light in our life. May we also guard against its theft. Jesus said:<br><br><i>But know this, if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to have been broken up, but would have been ready.</i>[JS--M 1:47]<br><br>We are the good men and women of the house, and Lucifer is the thief who is diligently, patiently, and carefully seeking to break up our house--or to destroy our souls. May we always watch and be ready.<br><br>I testify that the things I have spoken of today are true. I pray that we might maintain the brightness of our armor, the armor of light, by consistently coming unto the light--even Jesus Christ--who is the light. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dennis L.

<h1>g in the Lord: the Armor and Power of God- Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You have been blessed, brothers and sisters, to frequently receive counsel and instruction from others of my Brethren. I am aware that I must have the power of the Spirit with me if I am to teach you anything worthwhile. You will also need the power of the Spirit with you. I pray that this may be the case with each of us tonight.<br><br>I marvel that through the miracle of technology I not only speak to those of you here in the Marriott Center but also to many thousands more who are with us through the wonders of satellite and Internet technology. On behalf of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, I extend a warm welcome to each of you, regardless of where you are. Here in Utah we have just concluded the 2002 Winter Olympics. It has been a most remarkable time, one that we will never forget. Although all who qualified to participate are to be highly commended, those great athletes who won the gold, silver, and bronze medals demonstrated commitment, sacrifice, and discipline that were remarkable to see. Their dedication to reach their goals through hard work and focused attention to details made them world champions. I am sure we will see the same rewards of hard work among the Paralympic athletes who will begin their competition in just a few days.<br><br>Tonight I would like to talk with you about what you must do to win the eternal gold that our Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ have prepared for the faithful followers of Christ. This prize excels any other accomplishment in life. The great thing about this contest is that each one of you is in the competition, and each one of you can win the gold medal of eternal life.<br><br>I shall try to speak to you as if it were just you and me sitting in my living room, sharing some thoughts about your challenges to stay focused on keeping the commandments of God.<br><br>The scriptures describe our day as one that will be both "great and dreadful" (D&amp;amp;C 110:16). The greatness of our day is that we live when the Church of Jesus Christ is restored fully to the earth with all of its doctrines, with the priesthood, and with all of the saving ordinances. We have additional books of scripture and are led by prophets, seers, and revelators. We see the Church fulfilling its mission to spread across the world, and we see temples built and operating in many countries. At the same time, the "dreadfulness" of our day is evident in such things as the events of September 11. This tragedy alone brought the whole world to the painful, dreadful reality that evil is rampant in the world. We also live in a day where there are very real and very prevalent spiritual dangers. Note the words of our prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, in our last general conference:<br><br><i>But wonderful as this time is, it is fraught with peril. Evil is all about us. It is attractive and tempting and in so many cases successful. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We live in a season when fierce men do terrible and despicable things. We live in a season of war. We live in a season of arrogance. We live in a season of wickedness, pornography, immorality. All of the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah haunt our society. Our young people have never faced a greater challenge. We have never seen more clearly the lecherous face of evil.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 4; or "Living in the Fulness of Times,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 5–6]<br><br>As the Lord predicted in the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, we now see the time when "the devil shall have power over his own dominion" (D&amp;amp;C 1:35). Is it any wonder that some are dismayed and disturbed by what they see? Yet, my dear young friends, we do not find President Hinckley or the other apostles and prophets wallowing in despair, nor do we sense even the smallest touch of hopelessness. The opposite is true. As President Hinckley also said in our last conference:<br><br><i>Now, I do not wish to be an alarmist. I do not wish to be a prophet of doom. I am optimistic. I do not believe the time is here when an all-consuming calamity will overtake us. . . . There is so much of the Lord's work yet to be done. We, and our children after us, must do it.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 89; or "The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 74]<br><br>This hope and optimism comes because we know, with absolute certainty, that God is in His heaven and He is the Lord Omnipotent. God's wisdom and knowledge and power are greater than all the combined forces of evil. He is able to work His will, and His purposes cannot be frustrated (see D&amp;amp;C 3:1). He has not left you and me to make our way alone in these perilous times. He is watching over His people. Note just a few of the scriptural promises to us:<br><br>• "He will preserve the righteous by his power" (1 Nephi 22:17).<br><br>• "The righteous need not fear; for . . . they shall be saved" (1 Nephi 22:17).<br><br>• "The Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst" (D&amp;amp;C 1:36).<br><br>• Zion shall be "a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety" (D&amp;amp;C 45:66).<br><br>My beloved young brothers and sisters, those promises are sure. Peace. Refuge. Safety. That is what our Father wants for His children. But those promises are also conditional. They are extended to those who turn to Him and accept the counsel and guidance He has so freely given us.<br><br>Long before the world was formed, Satan and those who followed after him raged against the forces of good and tried to overthrow the work of God. That struggle has not ended, only shifted battlegrounds. It is ruthless, and relentless; the objective of the battle is your eternal soul and mine.<br><br>The Apostle Paul spoke of how to arm ourselves for this conflict in these very graphic terms:<br><br><i>Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</i><br><br><i>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i><br><br><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day.</i>[Ephesians 6:10–13]<br><br>How do we put on the whole armor of God so that we may, as Paul promises, "be able to withstand in the evil day"?<br><br>I like to think of this spiritual armor not as a solid piece of metal molded to fit the body, but more like chain mail. Chain mail consists of dozens of tiny pieces of steel fastened together to allow the user greater flexibility without losing protection. I say that because it has been my experience, covering many more years than you have yet been privileged to live, that there is not one great and grand thing we can do to arm ourselves spiritually. True spiritual power lies in numerous smaller acts woven together in a fabric of spiritual fortification that protects and shields from all evil.<br><br>It is a common expression to talk about the "chinks" in a person's armor. The definition of the word chink is "a crack, cleft, . . . a narrow opening" (<i>Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary</i>[1996], s.v. "chink," 361). Should an arrow strike exactly one of the chinks in one's armor, a fatal wound can result.<br><br>I would like to suggest to you six ways we may protect ourselves by eliminating any chinks or gaps in our personal spiritual armor.<br><h2><b>1. Rely on the Protective Power of Prayer</b></h2><br>There are numerous teachings about the importance of prayer found throughout the scriptures, but one specifically ties prayer to power, especially the power to resist temptation. The Doctrine and Covenants teaches: "Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work" (D&amp;amp;C 10:5).<br><br>What a wonderful promise! In this spiritual warfare that rages over individual souls, that is what we want more than anything else--to conquer Satan and to escape the hands of evil men and women who carry out his work. I cannot stress too highly the protective power that comes into our lives through earnest, humble, consistent, yearning prayer.<br><br>I know you believe that; but in the hectic, pressure-filled schedules you face, I also know how easy it is to let prayer slip. Some of you hit the snooze button on your alarm clocks, thinking you can eke out just another minute or two of sleep, then jerk awake realizing that you are going to be late for school or work. On such mornings prayer gets pushed aside, perhaps with a feeble promise to yourself that you will do better tomorrow. Put the alarm clock where you can't reach it from bed; that will solve this problem. Sometimes you return home late at night, exhausted and eager to collapse into bed. You may go through the motions of prayer in a perfunctory and superficial manner, but that is not the kind of prayer that helps us conquer Satan.<br><br>I know many of you live in apartments where you have four or five roommates. The television or stereo may be on day and night. People talk loudly enough that even in your bedroom you can hear them clearly. There is laughter, noise, interruptions. In such circumstances it is a challenge to find a time and a place where you can be alone with your Heavenly Father. The Savior spoke of entering our closets to pray (see Matthew 6:6), suggesting the importance of privacy and quiet when we talk with God. For most of you, your closets will not allow this to happen, so you need to find a time and place where you can be alone with the Lord and pour out your heart to Him, that you might add strength and power to your spiritual lives. Every honest and sincere prayer adds another piece to chain mail armor.<br><br>Perhaps there are some of you who have slipped into patterns of behavior that you know in your heart are displeasing to the Lord. You feel unworthy and ashamed to approach your Father in Heaven. "I'll repent first," you say to yourselves, "and then I'll begin saying my prayers again." I tell you with all soberness that those thoughts are not from the Lord, but come from the evil one. Nephi said it very clearly: "The evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray" (2 Nephi 32:8).<br><br>It is when we are lost in the mists of darkness and cannot find our way that we most desperately need the influence of the Lord. Nowhere in all of the scriptural injunctions on prayer do we find the suggestion that we must first be perfect in order to communicate with God.<br><br>A further word of caution. I often hear people say "I told the Lord" this or "I told the Lord" that. Be careful not to "tell" Him but, rather, humbly seek and ask your Heavenly Father for guidance and direction. Prayer should be yearning and filled with gratitude.<br><br>My young friends, one of the most important ways to clothe yourselves in the armor of God is to make sure that prayer--earnest, sincere, consistent prayer--is part of our daily lives.<br><h2><b>2. Rely on the Protective Power of the Scriptures</b></h2><br>There is another very direct and specific promise about how to gain spiritual power and protection. When Nephi's brothers asked him what the meaning of the rod of iron was, Nephi explained:<br><br><i>I said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.</i>[1 Nephi 15:24]<br><br>Isn't that the protective power that we all seek? To resist the temptations of Satan. To not be blinded by his cunning ways. Knowledge gained through our study of the scriptures teaches us how to get protection from the devil for ourselves.<br><br>Note the choice of verbs Nephi used. He did not talk about merely reading the scriptures. He did not suggest that we only study the word of God. He said that we must "hearken" to the word of God and "hold fast" to it. How do we "hold fast" to the word? This implies much more than a cursory, occasional reading. We not only need to read and study and learn the scriptural content, we must hearken to it, follow the principles taught therein, and cling to those principles as though our very lives depended on it--which, if we are speaking of spiritual life, is literally true.<br><br>Alma taught that there is great power in the word (see Alma 31:5), but this power won't come by simply having the Book of Mormon on your bed stand. It won't come by having your parents bear testimony of the truthfulness of the scriptures. They cannot hold fast to the iron rod for you; only you can do that.<br><br>Again, as I think about your schedules and the pressures you face at this time in your lives, I can understand why scripture study can so easily be neglected. You have many demands pulling at you. (In some cases, just maintaining your social life is a full-time occupation.) But I plead with you to make time for immersing yourselves in the scriptures. Couple scripture study with your prayers. Half an hour each morning privately studying, pondering, and communicating with your Heavenly Father can make an amazing difference in your lives. It will give increased success in your daily activities. It will bring increased alertness to your minds. It will give you comfort and rock-steady assurance when the storms of life descend upon you.<br><br>Here are some practical suggestions that I hope will help you derive greater power from your study of the scriptures:<br><br>*If possible, set a consistent time and place to study when you can be alone and undisturbed. Knowing the lifestyle of many young adults, I think it is safe to say that early morning in your apartments is one time you can be both alone and have it quiet.<br><br>*Always have a marking pencil ready as you study. Make notations in the margins. Write cross-references. Make the scriptures yours by marking them.<br><br>*Commit yourself to study for a set amount of time, rather than to just read a chapter or a certain number of pages. Sometimes a single verse or short passage will take the entire time as you think about it and consider what it means for you.<br><br>*Study topically as well as chronologically. Both approaches have merit, but we need to go to the Topical Guide or the index from time to time and read all that the Lord has said on repentance or faith or some other principle.<br><br>*Take time to ponder, reflect, meditate, and pray about what you read. Ask yourselves questions such as "What can I learn from this passage that will help me come unto Christ and be more like Him?"<br><br>One thing I have learned in life is how frequently the Lord answers our questions and gives us counsel through the scriptures. It is not unusual for one of us in the Quorum of the Twelve to say, "I saw this teaching more clearly than ever before in this verse of scripture." Let us then go to the Lord in prayer, pleading for help or answers; and those answers will come as we open the scriptures and begin to study them. Sometimes it is as though a passage hundreds or thousands of years old was dictated specifically to answer our question.<br><br>Remember the promise of the Lord: If you "hold fast" to the word of God, the fiery darts of the adversary will not penetrate your chain mail. Your spiritual armor will be strong.<br><h2><b>3. Draw on the Merciful Grace of God</b></h2><br>This is one of the most important ways we are given to fortify ourselves in time of peril. As the Lord promised us through the prophet Moroni:<br><br><i>If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>There are several interesting things about that scripture. First is that the Lord gives us weaknesses--not sin, but weaknesses--so that we may be humble. Think about that for a moment. If we were perfect in every respect, it would be hard to be humble. Even in specific things, humility comes harder to those who are very strong in one area or another. The woman or man who is remarkably beautiful or handsome can easily become proud of her or his appearance. A brilliant scholar may look down in condescension on those less intellectually blessed. Our weaknesses help us to be humble.<br><br>Then comes the promise. If we are willing to humble ourselves, then, as it says, "My grace is sufficient." In the Bible Dictionary<i>grace</i>is defined as "an enabling power" (s.v. "grace," 697). Can you see the significance of that promise?<br><br>One of the signs of our day is how frequently we use the word<i>addiction</i>to describe destructive behavior. We talk about being addicted to alcohol, about drug addiction, and, more recently, of addiction to pornography. These are all insidious and powerful evils. Jesus warned His disciples that "whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin" (John 8:34). Alma used a similar metaphor when he warned us about "the chains of hell" (Alma 12:11).<br><br>One of the most devastating effects of sin is that it weakens you, binds you, brings you down to slavery. The grace of God and of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the answer to that predicament. If you will but humble yourselves and turn to Them, then Their grace, Their enabling power, can not only help you throw off the chains of sin but actually turn your weaknesses into strengths.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, how I long to have the reality of that promise sink into your hearts. Are you struggling with some sin or weakness? It can be something as simple as not having the willpower to rise in the morning early enough to have time for scripture study and prayer. It can be something so powerful, such as Internet pornography or lack of moral self-control, that you feel like you have been pulled down into an abyss and there is no hope for you. Do you find yourself hating what you are doing but not able to find the willpower to turn away from it? Then reach out and humble yourself. The Lord's enabling power is sufficient to change your heart, to turn your life, to purge your soul. But you must make the first move, which is to humble yourself and realize that only in God can you find deliverance.<br><h2><b>4. Watch Yourselves</b></h2><br>This commandment was given by King Benjamin in his last great address to his people. After counseling them on various gospel principles and warning them against certain sins, he said:<br><br><i>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God . . . , ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</i>[Mosiah 4:30]<br><br>I have thought much about what King Benjamin meant by that phrase and its implications for each of us. Here are some of the things that I have concluded:<br><br>Often in the scriptures the Lord speaks of watchmen on the towers and of watchtowers themselves (see, for example, D&amp;amp;C 101:12, 43–60). A watchtower is generally raised so that someone can climb to the top and see a greater distance. In this way they are alerted to danger or threat much sooner than they would otherwise be.<br><br>The same principle holds true in our lives. We can raise watchtowers that help us deal with threats before they actually descend upon us. Let me give some examples.<br><br>Bishops often hear in confessions of moral transgression a statement something like this: "I was so sure that I would never be caught in this problem. Somehow we got carried away, and then it was too late." The physical and emotional drives associated with physical affection are powerful, lowering the will to resist and often sweeping people on to things they will later deeply regret.<br><br>It is not enough to simply say, "I will never do that." This is an excellent example of where we need to "watch ourselves." The wise couple will build watchtowers to protect themselves from being swept away. These are simple things, such as limiting the time they are alone together; strictly avoiding dark, isolated places; and setting strict limits on the bounds of their physical affection. To wait until you are caught up in the passion of the moment to start building watchtowers is to wait until the enemy is upon you, and often it is too late.<br><br>I know that there are some of you who are struggling with the tenacious power of Internet pornography. You come away from such encounters ashamed and sickened, vowing that you will never again allow yourself to give in to such temptation. Such determination is good, but you need to take intervening action when you are calm and away from the influence of those images. Move your computer into a room where there is always the possibility of someone walking in on you. Make sure the monitor faces the room so that others can see what it is you are doing on the screen at any time. There are inexpensive software programs that screen out pornographic sites and eliminate unsolicited pornographic e-mail. Take action when you are strong so that if you are tempted you will have armed yourself and it will be much more difficult to fall.<br><br>It is such a logical thing to prepare for danger or discomfort in the natural world. Mountain climbers are very careful to pack the proper gear. Arctic explorers do not wait until the blasts of subzero winds strike them to decide what clothing they need. So why don't we do the same in our spiritual lives?<br><br>These are but a few examples of how you can take preventive and protective action so you are covered with the full armor of God. Remember: "It is far better to prepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent."<br><h2><b>5. Don't Waste the Days of Your Probation</b></h2><br>The scripture from which this phrase comes is found in 2 Nephi: "Wo unto him that has the law given, . . . that wasteth the days of his probation" (2 Nephi 9:27).<br><br>How does one "waste" the days of this probation? Turning to sin is surely part of it, but there is another, more subtle way, a way that may not seem evil at all. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord gave a similar warning in these words: "Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known" (D&amp;amp;C 60:13).<br><br>Why would I speak of that with you? Because one of the ways Satan lessens your effectiveness and weakens your spiritual strength is by encouraging you to spend large blocks of your time doing things that matter very little. I speak of such things as sitting for hours on end watching television or videos; playing video games night in and night out; surfing the Internet; or devoting huge blocks of time to sports, games, or other recreational activities.<br><br>Don't misunderstand me. These activities are not wrong in and of themselves (unless, of course, you are watching salacious programs or seeking out pornographic images on the Internet). Games, sports, recreational activities, and even television can be relaxing and rejuvenating, especially in times when you are under stress or heavily scheduled. You need activities that help you to unwind and rest your minds. It is healthy to go onto the soccer field or the basketball court and participate in vigorous physical activity. So, again I say, these things are not wrong in and of themselves.<br><br>No, I speak of letting things get out of balance. It is not watching television but watching television hour after hour, night after night. Does not that qualify as idling away your time? What will you say to the Lord when He asks what you have done with the precious gift of life and time? Surely you will not feel comfortable telling Him that you were able to pass the 100,000-point level in a challenging video game.<br><br>This idea of not wasting the days of our probation has deeper significance. One of the greatest challenges of this life is the ordering of priorities. If we do not do this wisely, then things that matter most in life are at the mercy of things that matter least.<br><br>This is a most important time in your lives. As single young adults you face some of the most critical and pivotal decisions of mortality: serving a mission, education and career, marriage. This time in your lives is a time to focus on those decisions.<i>That takes time.</i>One devastating effect of idling away our time is that it deflects us from focusing on the things that matter most. Too many people are willing to sit back and let life just happen to them. It takes time to develop the attributes that will help you to be a well-balanced person. It takes time, prayer, and pondering to determine what kind of man or woman you want to marry. It takes time, prayer, pondering, and much more effort to<i>become</i>the kind of man or woman<i>your eternal partner</i>wants to marry.<br><br>We hear of students, both male and female, who are so focused on academic success or moving up the career ladder that they "don't have time for dating." We hear young people say that they will postpone marriage or having children until they can afford them. Let me tell you as a father of seven children, you will never be able to afford them! So just trust in the Lord as Sister Ballard and I did. Somehow it works, with His help. Others want to wait "until I graduate," "until we can buy a home," or "until I'm settled in my career." I am reminded of a statement sometimes cited by President Boyd K. Packer: "There are many who struggle and climb and finally reach the top of the ladder only to find that it is leaning against the wrong wall" (<i>"That All May Be Edified"</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1982], 275). Now is the time to carefully evaluate which walls you are approaching with your ladders.<br><br>Sooner or later in life you will be released from every calling in the Church. Perhaps my release is not the best alternative, but it will surely come. You will quit or retire from every position in life except two: You brethren will never be released from being a husband and a father. You sisters will never be released from being a wife and a mother. You cannot be exalted without an eternal mate. That is the sum of it. You young men especially need to remember that<br><br><i>in the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i><br><br><i>He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4]<br><br>Remember, you<i>can</i>be exalted without a college degree. You<i>can</i>be exalted without being slender and beautiful. You<i>can</i>be exalted without having a successful career. You<i>can</i>be exalted if you are not rich and famous. So focus the best that you can on those things in life that will lead you back to the presence of God--keeping all things in their proper balance. There are those who may never marry in mortality. But<i>all</i>of God's blessings will ultimately come to those who are righteous and true to the gospel.<br><br>Oh, my dear young brothers and sisters, these are the days of your probation. This time is a precious window of opportunity to prepare for your future. Do not waste this time away. Get out a paper and pencil and write down the things that matter most to you. List the goals that you hope to accomplish in life and what things are required if they are to become a reality for you. Plan and prepare and then do.<br><h2><b>6. Remember That Reverence Invites Revelation</b></h2><br>I shall dwell on this only briefly, but it is of great importance in spiritually fortifying yourselves. A lack of reverence opens up not just chinks in our chain mail armor but creates great gaps of vulnerability.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord declared that "your minds in times past have been darkened because . . . you have treated lightly the things you have received" (D&amp;amp;C 84:54). That is a recurring theme in the revelations. "Trifle not with sacred things," the Lord warned Oliver Cowdery (D&amp;amp;C 6:12).<br><br>In a time of peril and danger, the last thing we need is to have our minds darkened. And yet we have seen a great increase in how the world treats lightly and often offensively things of deep value. The media jokes and pokes fun at even the most sacred things. Television sitcoms, as they are called, show people constantly engaging in crude, rude, immoral, and cruel banter.<br><br>When we speak of reverence, we are talking about much more than mere quietness at our meetings. Reverence is an attitude of mind and heart. It involves a keen sense of God's majesty and infinite goodness and our unworthiness and our need for Him and His redeeming grace. It includes a profound sense of the sacred and a desire to honor and protect it.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer said:<br><br><i>Reverence invites revelation. . . .</i><br><br><i>No one of us can survive in the world of today, much less in what it soon will become, without personal inspiration. The spirit of reverence can and should be evident in every organization in the Church and in the lives of every member.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>October 1991, 28–29; or "Reverence Invites Revelation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1991, 22–23]<br><br>Without belaboring that point, may I say just a few things that some of you may need to consider? As leaders, we see some patterns related to reverence that, if not corrected, may open up chinks in your spiritual armor. For example, we have noticed a growing trend in the Church, but especially among young adults, to arrive late at sacrament meeting, priesthood, and other meetings. Bishops and stake presidents report some members coming in as late as half an hour after the meeting has started. Occasionally there may be a legitimate excuse for not arriving on time (such as an emergency appendectomy), but in most cases it is because you simply plan poorly or do not care enough. The ideal would be to arrive five or ten minutes early so you can sit in the chapel quietly listening to the prelude music and preparing yourselves to worship. Our sacrament meetings belong to the Savior. When you arrive late, it not only interrupts the reverence of others, but it is a sign of your own disrespect and apathy.<br><br>Far too often we see young adults who persist in whispering during the administration of the sacrament. Their minds and hearts are obviously not focused on the emblems of which we partake. It is hard for me to comprehend how anyone who has an understanding and an appreciation for the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ could allow this to happen.<br><br>Here are a few other concerns:<br><br>• Each human soul is precious in the sight of God (see D&amp;amp;C 18:10). To belittle or ridicule someone who has traits that you view as peculiar or to speak in a demeaning manner of members of the opposite sex is offensive to God.<br><br>• Gossip and the passing on of half-truths or untruths about others will, likewise, cause you to lose power.<br><br>• Joking about sacred things, or speaking of them in inappropriate places or in inappropriate ways, is a sign of irreverence. Off-color language or swearing is offensive and wrong.<br><br>• The intimate relationship between a man and a woman is one of the most sacred aspects of the Lord's plan. Vulgar jokes and bawdy comments about this relationship deeply offend the Spirit.<br><br>By carefully cultivating an attitude of reverence in these matters you will strengthen the power and the influence the Spirit has in your life. Remember, "reverence invites revelation."<br><br>The Lord has given us specific doctrines and principles that show us how to clothe ourselves in the armor of God so that we can stand against the powers of evil. I have tried to suggest a few ways to incorporate gospel principles into your lives. In most cases we are not talking about massive changes of behavior. As with chain mail, you need simply to add small, individual pieces of armor each day through prayer, scripture study, focusing on things that matter, and by acting in a reverent manner.<br><br>In the closing session of last conference, President Hinckley made this simple but wonderful declaration: "Our safety lies in the virtue of our lives. Our strength lies in our righteousness. God has made it clear that if we will not forsake Him, He will not forsake us" (in<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 112; or "Till We Meet Again,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 90).<br><br>I close as I began. We are all in the contest of seeking to live eternally with our Heavenly Father and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. All that They have can be ours. What They offer far excels any earthly accomplishment. So, my dear young friends, "go for the real gold." Go forward, keeping the commandments of God and following the admonition of the Apostle Paul:<br><br><i>Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</i><br><br><i>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</i>[Ephesians 6:10–11]<br><br>I leave you my witness that Jesus is the Christ. He lives and presides over His Church. He loves the young adults of His Church, and I humbly pray and invoke a blessing upon each one of you. In the sacred and beloved name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>M. Russell Ballard was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 March 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is an honor for me to be with you today. You are choice sons and daughters of our Father in Heaven, sent here at this time to perform a great mission. I know many of you well and others in passing. You are wonderful, and I feel your spirit and know of your goodness and your righteous desires. I humbly pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us and that each of us may know His will as we focus on the goal to build His kingdom.<br><br>Recently, as we always do, the coaches of the volleyball team evaluated this past season. We lamented the fact that if we had been three points better in our last match, we would have advanced to the next round of the NCAA championships. After further analysis it was apparent that the results of several of our matches could have been different if we had only been three to six points better. Different training, a more consistent performance, or a better coaching decision could have made the difference. We determined that if each of us on the coaching staff and on the volleyball team is a little better, collectively we will be a lot better.<br><br>I invite all of you to join our team in trying to be a little bit better at whatever we do. For the purpose of our discussion today, I challenge all of us to do as the Lord instructs in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:27–28]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley, by his example and by his instruction, teaches us about that great cause in which we should be anxiously engaged:<br><br><i>How glorious is the past of this great cause. It is filled with heroism, courage, boldness, and faith. How wondrous is the present as we move forward to bless the lives of people wherever they will hearken to the message of the servants of the Lord. How magnificent will be the future as the Almighty rolls on His glorious work, touching for good all who will accept and live His gospel, and even reaching to the eternal blessing of His sons and daughters of all generations through the selfless work of those whose hearts are filled with love for the Redeemer of the world.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Stand a Little Taller: Counsel and Inspiration for Each Day of the Year</i>(Salt Lake City: Eagle Gate, 2001), 38]<br><br>Because we love the Redeemer, we are called to the work. We should be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. We have the power: let us be about doing good. The Spirit will guide us in knowing what and how to do it, for we are agents unto ourselves.<br><br>As we strive to be better, I would like to suggest 10 things we might do to be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness.<br><h2><b>1. Prayerfully Act</b></h2><br>President Ezra Taft Benson taught:<br><br><i>Less spiritually advanced people, such as those in the days of Moses, had to be commanded in many things. Today those spiritually alert look at the objectives, check the guidelines laid down by the Lord and his prophets, and then prayerfully act--without having to be commanded "in all things." This attitude prepares men for godhood.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1965, 121]<br><br>If you prayerfully and anxiously engage in opportunities to act, and pursue them with diligence, you will find yourself progressing toward your goals and contributing to the Lord's cause. The Lord will direct your life and lead you to magnify your callings.<br><br>I, like many of you, was directed to BYU even though my friends attended other institutions. I came planning to pursue a career in elementary education. As I became involved in one of my favorite activities, sports, I found opportunities for leadership. Soon I found I had talent and a desire to pursue physical education. By devoting my energies to developing these talents, I was selected to teach and help direct university student programs.<br><br>As I approached graduation I received a contract for my dream job, teaching at a prestigious high school in Salt Lake City. Just before school ended, the dean of the college called me to his office, asked me to give up my contract to teach at the high school, and requested that I teach at Brigham Young University the next year. I had never envisioned the possibility of teaching at BYU. I did not have the exceptional intelligence I saw in my university professors. But the Lord knew my willingness to be an instrument in His hands to find a special way to serve the youth of the Church and serve in this part of the kingdom.<br><br>If we are anxiously engaged in whatever we are inspired and called to do, we will be prepared for what the Lord has in store for us as we go through life. For some it may not be the conventional path. If we are diligent it will be the direction the Lord would have us follow. He knows what is in store for us and will lead us to the fulfillment of our purpose in life.<br><br>So I would urge you and me to be a little bit better in our service. Be better prepared for your teaching assignment in the ward. Do your assignments well and on time. Study the gospel with the same intensity as you do your academic work. Prayerfully act to meet the needs of those you serve in your callings as a home teacher or visiting teacher.<br><h2><b>2. Contribute Good to the World</b></h2><br>In the book of Moroni, Mormon taught: "For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also" (Moroni 7:5).<br><br>President Hinckley added:<br><br><i>You are good. But it is not enough just to be good. You must be good for something. You must contribute good to the world. The world must be a better place for your presence. And the good that is in you must be spread to others.</i>[Hinckley,<i>Stand a Little,</i>26]<br><br>Do something good in the world each day. Help someone in need. Be good at your work so that others may benefit. Share the blessings of the gospel. Be a good brother or sister to others.<br><h2><b>3. Be an Example of the Virtues of the Gospel</b></h2><br>One of the ways we can make the world better is by the way we live our lives. If we are examples of honesty, character, and integrity, our influence will help others to recognize these values as qualities they respect and want in their own lives.<br><br>In the recent Australian Open--one of the grand-slam professional tennis tour championships--Jiri Novak from the Czech Republic was playing a critical game in a quarterfinal match. On game point his opponent hit a ball that the linesman called long. His opponent asked the umpire to overrule the linesman. The ball had landed on the side of the court, which allowed the umpire to get a good look at the ball, but the umpire refused to overrule the linesman. Knowing the call would give his opponent the game, Novak told the umpire the ball was in, and his opponent was awarded the point. The capacity crowd vigorously applauded his honor call.<br><br>There are several significant points in this incident. Novak was a professional athlete, and there was a lot of money weighing on the outcome of this match, which he lost. It is not common for this type of honor call to happen in major tennis competitions. The crowd's response is indicative of respect for the honesty exhibited in this situation. People believe in the virtue of honesty. However, it takes courage and character to live these virtues in our world.<br><br>In the second collegiate national championships for volleyball in 1970, the BYU team was playing in a pool-play match to determine qualification for the quarterfinals. Brenda, the middle blocker, hit the ball, which landed in the opponent's court, giving the team the final point of the match. The team celebrated, except for Brenda. She told the referee that she had touched the net. The referee was stunned and unsure what to do. Brenda noted the official's hesitation and explained she realized it was difficult to see, but she had touched the net, which made it an illegal play. The official reversed the call, and play continued. After the match several missionaries brought some investigators to see the team. The honor call became an interesting point of discussion.<br><br>As the tournament progressed, there were other occasions where honor calls were used by BYU's team. Some teams would also make honor calls when they competed against BYU, but not during their matches with other opponents. The National Association for Girls and Women in Sport was the governing body of the championship at that time. The members of the NAGWS board of directors, who witnessed the events at the championships, were so impressed with the honor calls at the competitions that a statement was drafted for the rule book that requested coaches and officials to encourage honor calls in competitions governed by NAGWS rules. That statement still appears in the current rule book.<br><br>Last spring the softball team was playing a game against Louisiana Tech. The score was 0 to 0 in the fifth inning. The Louisiana Tech lead-off hitter sent a ball deep to center field. The umpire ruled that it was a ground rule double because the ball had bounced over the fence. The BYU center fielder, while chasing the ball, stumbled over the fence. Coach Amicone went to see if she was okay, and she told her she was but that the ball went over the fence, making it a home run. This was also confirmed by both the left and right fielders.<br><br>Coach Amicone went to the second-base umpire and told him the ball had gone over the fence without bouncing, so it was a home run. The second-base umpire met with the home-plate umpire, and they decided since it was a judgment call, he had to leave the Louisiana Tech player at second base.<br><br>Later in the game the umpire told BYU's catcher that he had never seen anyone come to an umpire to tell him the ball went over the fence as a home run when the call was favorable to their team. He was amazed by the honesty of the players. In all his experience he had never seen anything like that before.<br><br>As we strive to be examples to the world, I ask all of you to evaluate your behavior at our athletic contests. Do you treat our guests, fans, opponents, referees, and media with respect? Will they be favorably impressed with our university as they leave the arena? Will our behavior be an example of what we believe? The teams do not need you to taunt, distract, or be demeaning to our opponents or officials. We want to compete fairly and win based on the quality of our play. We want to win against an opponent on his or her best day. Help us to play our best by offering your support and encouragement.<br><br>A mission of the university athletic teams is to be missionaries and to build the kingdom by the example we set and the quality of our play. At a meeting with Elder Henry B. Eyring, the coaches were counseled to lead our teams to be "very, very good and very, very nice." Many times we are in a position to open doors for missionaries because we have had an opportunity to be an example on the court, on television, or as we travel of who we are and what we represent. We hope that example will cause someone to take an interest in the Church we represent. I invite you to be a part of that example, influencing those who share the arena with us to have a favorable impression of BYU.<br><h2><b>4. Be Valiant in the Cause of Truth</b></h2><br>Everyone has opportunities to demonstrate by example the virtues of the gospel. In his book<i>Standing for Something,</i>President Hinckley pleaded with us to stand for what we believe:<br><br><i>We cannot be indifferent to the great cause of truth and right. We cannot afford to stand on the sidelines and watch the play between the forces of good and evil. Wrote John the Revelator: "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth" (Revelation 3:15–16).</i><br><br><i>John's imagery is vivid. It points to our critical duty to stand strong, even to become leaders in speaking up on behalf of those causes that make our civilization shine. Each of us can be a leader within our sphere of influence. The adversary of all truth would put into our hearts a reluctance to make an effort; we must cast that fear aside and be valiant in the cause of truth, fairness, and right.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley,<i>Standing for Something</i>(New York: Times Books, 2000), 171–72]<br><br>Life at BYU is a good one. We have made commitments to live a higher standard based on gospel principles. It is important to understand the meaning of those commitments we have made and make them a permanent part of our lifestyle. These standards can be an armor to help ward off the ways of the world. With this commitment to live the gospel comes the courage to stand strong and be valiant in the cause of truth.<br><br>While we are learning at the feet of the apostles of the Lord and His servants, we should listen and learn from their counsel and teachings. We should check our armor for chinks that could be stumbling blocks placed in our path by the adversary. How are you doing with the Honor Code? Are you committed to its value to you as a code of conduct that makes you a worthy servant of the Lord? Do you support the Dress and Grooming Standards? Do you understand the purpose of these standards? Standards and guidelines help us keep focused on why we are here and prepare us to stand strong and be valiant leaders.<br><h2><b>5. Seek the Companionship of the Spirit</b></h2><br>When I was in my teenage years, my father was a stake president. At that time the General Authorities stayed overnight in the home of the stake president on Saturday night between stake conference sessions. We had a small, humble home with only two bedrooms appropriate for the visiting Brethren: my parent's room and my simple room. My room became the guest room. I remember cleaning thoroughly and preparing my room so everything was neat, orderly, and appropriate for our guests. I felt everything and every activity conducted therein needed to contribute to an atmosphere where the Spirit could be present for our guests. Many apostles and other leaders spent a night in my room.<br><br>That experience led me to a lifelong quest to be sure my life is in order to invite the Spirit to be my companion. How we dress, our conduct, our environment, our associates, and the activities in which we engage all influence the opportunity for the Spirit to be a part of our lives. If we keep our lives in order, the companionship of the Spirit will provide us with peace, comfort, guidance, and promptings. It will enlighten us regarding the Lord's will and help us testify of Christ.<br><h2><b>6. Beware of the Adversary</b></h2><br>It is not always easy to live each day as we would like. But it is easier when we take care of the chinks in our armor.<br><br>An example of one of the more subtle chinks the adversary uses to divert our attention from the influence of the Spirit is pride. President Ezra Taft Benson in his wonderful talk on pride declared that "pride is a sin" and cited several faces of pride: "selfishness . . . , self-conceit, self-pity, worldly self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking." President Benson continued, "The proud depend upon the world to tell them whether they have value or not. . . . Pride is ugly. It says, 'If you succeed, I am a failure'" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, 5, 6).<br><br>There are many circumstances in the university setting that can foster pride. Whenever there is a status system, it is a challenge to value people and work equally. Being a member of a team where there are starters, finishers, and substitutes is another setting where pride can enter into the team chemistry. People who are not teachable or become defensive limit their progress because of pride. Worldly recognition and awards may not be equal and fair and can subtly foster pride unless perspective and recognition of the contributions of others are acknowledged.<br><br>Where pride is prevalent, unity is impossible. Unity is mandatory for a team to succeed. It is also mandatory for a family, a marriage, or a business to succeed. I believe that a primary factor in the success of our teams at BYU is team chemistry, where the focus is on the team as we compete. The true meaning of competition embodies the process of striving together.<br><br>President Benson continued in his address: "The antidote for pride is humility--meekness, submissiveness. (See Alma 7:23.) It is the broken heart and contrite spirit" (Benson, "Beware," 6). Humble behavior is selflessness and respect and esteem for others as ourselves. It is doing service, being teachable, submitting to the Lord's will, and putting Him first in our lives. In closing his masterful address on pride, President Benson declared, "We must yield 'to the enticings of the Holy Spirit,' put off the prideful 'natural man,' become 'a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord,' and become 'as a child, submissive, meek, humble'" (Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware," 7).<br><br>Listen to the prophets. They will warn us of the ways the adversary will challenge our commitment to the Lord. Yield to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, who is our personal guide to help us become a saint.<br><h2><b>7. Be a Participant</b></h2><br>We saw many great examples of gracious, humble athletes during the Olympics. Their sincere appreciation for the opportunity to participate was expressed often. Although goals may not have been reached, satisfaction in doing one's best was their reward. What a wonderful experience it was for all of us to share with the world the joy of participation and effort. We would all do well to adopt the Olympic Creed:<br><br><i>The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part. The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.</i>[Baron Pierre de Coubertin, in<i>Games of the XXIIIrd Olympiad Los Angeles 1984 Commemorative Book</i>(Salt Lake City: International Sport Publications, Inc., 1984), 270]<br><br>I like the definition and insights of a champion offered by 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek:<br><br><i>On Being a Champion</i><br><i>A champion is a winner,</i><br><i>A hero . . .</i><br><i>Someone who never gives up</i><br><i>Even when the going gets rough.</i><br><br><i>A champion is a member of</i><br><i>A winning team . . .</i><br><i>Someone who overcomes challenges</i><br><i>Even when it requires creative solutions.</i><br><br><i>A champion is an optimist,</i><br><i>A hopeful spirit . . .</i><br><i>Someone who plays the game,</i><br><i>Even when the game is called life . . .</i><br><i>Especially when the game is called life.</i><br><br><i>There can be a champion in each of us,</i><br><i>If we live as a winner,</i><br><i>If we live as a member of the team,</i><br><i>If we live with a hopeful spirit,</i><br><i>For life.</i><br>[Mattie J. T. Stepanek,<i>Journey Through Heartsongs</i>(New York: Hyperion, 2001), 20]<br><br>Be a participant, enjoy life, don't worry and fret. Have a hopeful spirit. Be anxiously engaged in the game of life.<br><h2><b>8. Stay Focused</b></h2><br>It is easier to keep the commandments and our covenants when we keep the game plan in focus. Understanding the plan of salvation and keeping our focus on preparation for exaltation will help us to keep our priorities straight. If we will remember to keep our focus every day and make every decision based on our goal to return to our Heavenly Father with the help of our Brother, Jesus Christ, we will have eternal life.<br><br>Life's experience is a lot like a game. It is hard to keep focused for the duration of the game--or the match. The opponent provides challenges and tests as the game progresses. When there is a letdown, we fall behind. But we can refocus and get back on track. With the new rally scoring in volleyball, we divided the game into seven-point minigames to provide a checkpoint on how we were doing to meet our end goal. Coach Judkins divided the basketball game into eight, five-minute segments to help the basketball team focus. During breaks, coaches build confidence, provide counsel, give encouragement, and adjust strategy. Coaches never give up--they always believe they can still achieve a goal. They coach to the last play.<br><br>Life is like the game. We lose focus sometimes. Our prayers have less meaning. Daily pressures make it hard to study the scriptures. We forget to listen to the Spirit. The opposition diverts our attention to world affairs. When there is a letdown, we fall behind. But we can refocus and get back on track. The Lord has given us hours, days, and years as checkpoints to help us focus on the final goal of eternal life. We have coaches of life to help us toward that goal: parents, teachers, friends, bishops, angels, prophets, apostles, home teachers, visiting teachers, leaders, and the Holy Spirit. Use valuable checkpoints to help you: prayer, scriptures, church attendance, devotionals, and service. We must keep our focus. Never give up. Your coaches will be there to the last play.<br><h2><b>9. Be Happy</b></h2><br>The key to happiness is to be anxiously engaged in doing whatever we are guided to do by the Holy Spirit to be a part of this great cause. This will bring true happiness. President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed it this way:<br><br><i>Do you want to be happy? Forget yourself and get lost in this great cause. Lend your efforts to helping people. Cultivate a spirit of forgiveness in your heart against any who might have offended you. Look to the Lord and live and work to lift and serve His sons and daughters. You will come to know a happiness that you have never known before if you will do that.</i>[Hinckley,<i>Stand a Little,</i>192]<br><br>The happiness you will experience is the joy of effort. A great example is the missionaries who serve years in the mission field and return with unfulfilled dreams of numerous converts, yet they speak of the greatness of their mission because of the joy of being totally engaged in a good cause. It is like the Olympian who trains hours, days, and years to participate, knowing that only one will receive the gold. To participate and enjoy the process of striving to reach your potential is worth the effort.<br><br>It is the same for us as we strive and train daily for eternal life. It is a wonderful experience as we progress through life to reach our full potential as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. But in the Lord's plan, He desires all of us to obtain the gold, which is eternal life.<br><br>As with the Olympic athlete, there will be challenges and setbacks in our progression. There may even be a major problem like a knee injury, which means there has to be rehabilitation before we can continue to progress. It takes courage and determination to endure and pursue the goal. We know the adversary will put stumbling blocks in the way. But we have our support system to help us. Remember that the Savior has experienced all the emotions, pains, and suffering we will have to endure. He will be there to show us the way. Being anxiously engaged in this great cause will bring you great joy.<br><h2><b>10. Bear Testimony</b></h2><br>In closing, I would like to share with you one of my favorite scriptures:<br><br><i>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 68:6]<br><br>The phrase "be of good cheer" is one of my favorite messages from the Savior. It implies a life of joy, happiness, and optimism based on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our knowledge of the plan of salvation. We know that He lives and loves us and is our advocate with our Father in Heaven. This faith in the Lord and our gratitude for His atoning sacrifice compels us to assist in this great work by bearing our testimony that He is the Son of the living God, that this is His work, and that He will come again.<br><br>We cannot be slackers in our commitment to the Lord, in our effort to be an example of His teaching, or in our desire to share what we have with those with whom we have contact. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and our gratitude for His sacrifice for us compels us to serve by bearing testimony of Him, even Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. May we do this by our example and our performance, knowing we need not fear but can have courage because the Lord is with us and will stand by us. May the Lord bless each of us as we strive to serve.<br><br>Let us strive to be anxiously engaged in bringing to pass much righteousness. I invite you to join me in trying to be a little bit better in His service.<br><br>I leave with you my testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, our Heavenly Father. This is His work, and we are called to the work because we love Him, our Redeemer. Be of good cheer is my prayer for all of us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Elaine Michaelis was the director of BYU Women's Athletics when this devotional address was given on 12 March 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>e Book of Mormon in Your Heart—Not on Your Bookshelf - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Today I would like to speak with you on a subject that has been close to my heart for many, many years--a subject you are familiar with: the Book of Mormon.<br><br>In its introductory pages, we find this profound statement:<br><br><i>After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>[who, incidentally, was younger than most of you in this audience]<i>and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language.</i><br><br><i>In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.</i><br><br>Currently the Book of Mormon is published in 100 languages with approximately 6 million copies distributed each year. (Full translation in 66 languages; selections in 34 languages.)<br><br>The Book of Mormon is one of the greatest sources of spiritual power given to men and women on earth to guide us on our quest for eternal life. We have a challenge with our neighbors, family, and friends to help them overcome misinformation, prejudice, doubts, misunderstandings, rumors, falsehoods, and incorrect traditions that keep many from reading or understanding the Book of Mormon. Most people in the world and many in the Church do not realize that the Book of Mormon will help a person get nearer to God "than by any other book" (Joseph Smith,<i>HC</i>4:461). It will help us obey the laws and ordinances of His gospel. It shows us how, through grace, we can be saved in His kingdom, "after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23), and helps us endure to the end (see 2 Nephi 31:15–21).<br><br>When we read the Book of Mormon, do we pray about it? (See Moroni 10:4.) Do we ponder on it and take it into our hearts? When we take the Book of Mormon into our hearts, we have more love for our Father in Heaven and His Only Begotten Son, our Savior. This love of God can dispel the contentions that come into our personal life with family members, friends, loved ones, or neighbors: "And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people" (4 Nephi 1:15).<br><br>A great Russian writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, said, "Only the heart knows how to find what is precious" (in<i>The Brothers Karamazov,</i>trans. Constance Garnett [New York: Random House, 1950], part II, book VI, chapter 1, 346). It is important that the Book of Mormon be precious in our hearts.<br><br>Let me illustrate. Some years ago I was working with the missionaries in Korea. We walked into a furniture store in downtown Seoul and were soon introduced to the proprietor. He was very kind to the elders. I listened to them encouraging him to accept a copy of the Book of Mormon. I do not speak Korean, but I understood enough to know the proprietor was friendly and open to the missionaries. In a few moments he invited us upstairs to his apartment. He walked over to what we thought was a window, where he drew back the curtain to reveal a bookshelf. It held at least 12 copies of the Book of Mormon in the Korean language. Obviously, someone had been there before us. My thought at that time was, "We need to place a copy of the Book of Mormon in this man's heart, not on his bookshelf."<br><br>Psalm 28:7 says, "My heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth." It is not easy. People have preconceived notions and ideas about the Book of Mormon. Even our own members start reading the Book of Mormon with good intentions, but often, when they get to 2 Nephi and run into "the Isaiah wall," many never complete this spiritually powerful book.<br><br>To help us place a copy in our own heart or in the heart of a friend, neighbor, or loved one, let us turn again to the introductory page, which is often overlooked. Notice the third paragraph: "The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection." Do you know of any other book, independent of the Bible, which does not take its reference from the Bible, that talks of Jesus Christ after His resurrection? Except for a few brief sentences in the New Testament, I am not aware of any, and yet the crowning event in the Book of Mormon "is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel."<br><br>If you want to know and understand the doctrines of this Church, read the Book of Mormon. It "outlines the plan of salvation." If you want to understand salvation, read the Book of Mormon. It "tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life." Would you like to have a little peace in your life "and eternal salvation in the life to come"? Read the Book of Mormon. What a powerful thing to have eternal salvation in the life to come. If you want eternal salvation, read the Book of Mormon and then follow the rest of the formula outlined in Moroni 10:4. Pray about it, ponder it, take the book into your heart!<br><br>Just to illustrate this a little further, let's turn to 2 Nephi 3:12. We understand the record left by Judah to be the Bible and the record left by Joseph to be the Book of Mormon. We recognize the two shall grow together to enlighten us. There are five powerful things mentioned in this verse that can happen as a result of studying these books together.<br><br>1. "The confounding of false doctrines." What a comforting thing to know that false doctrines of the world will be confounded by studying the Book of Mormon.<br><br>2. The "laying down of contentions." As I travel the world and listen and read about the contentions among the various religions of the world, I marvel that, along with the Bible, the Book of Mormon is available to us so that the contentions in the world over religion can be settled.<br><br>3. "Establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins." What a wonderful thing that there can be peace in the world. Not only is it to be established among Joseph and Judah, but also among the nations of the earth that have been at war with one another for so long.<br><br>4. "And bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days." There is nothing that will bring us to an understanding of God and our forefathers like studying the Book Mormon and the Bible.<br><br>5. And also bringing them "to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord." The saving covenants that the Master has made with His people are outlined in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Here are five things in just one verse to help us understand ourselves and our place and purpose in this life.<br><br>Now I know that the challenge of placing a copy of the Book of Mormon in the heart of a person is not easy. Some years ago Sister Sorensen and I were preparing to go to Eastern Canada on a mission. We were in a restaurant in Salt Lake City just prior to going to the airport. A young man walked up to us and called me by name because he had seen my missionary badge.<br><br>He said, "I see you are going to the Canada Halifax Mission. Let me introduce myself. I am John Gaetz. I lived in Halifax. When I was a young boy I left home and made my way to Calgary. There I eventually found the Church, was baptized, and accepted the gospel in its fullness. My wife and I have a small family and have since moved here to Salt Lake City. My father, Raymond C. Gaetz, lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He is not a member of the Church. He does not understand the Church. He does not seem happy with me for having joined the Church. I would like to help him. I have sent him books, records, and materials--all kinds of information over the years. Some of them he has read, others he has sent back either unopened or marked "not interested." I have here a copy of the standard works in a recently published quad. I have taken the liberty of having my father's name engraved in gold on this book. I think he might accept it if you would take it to him.<br><br>"Now, I want you to know that before I left home, my mother passed away. My father remarried a faithful, devout, Catholic lady. She is very committed to her own church. She has no interest in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She lives according to the light she has received. I do not wish to come between my father and stepmother in any way. So please be careful and delicate in how you present this book to my father. I'm his only son."<br><br>We accepted the challenge. When we arrived in Halifax, I called Mr. Raymond Gaetz and told him who I was and that I had a gift from his son. I asked if I could present it to him. He asked me a little about his son and then said, "I have no interest whatsoever in the Book of Mormon. Please pass it on to someone else."<br><br>I told him I couldn't; it had his name engraved on it. I asked if he would please accept it from his only son.<br><br>He said, "No," and hung up.<br><br>Soon thereafter I decided to pay Mr. Gaetz a visit. I went to his lovely apartment. When I arrived I was met at the gate by a guard and, of course, electronic security equipment. However, the guard was kind enough to connect me with Mr. Gaetz on the intercom. I told him I would like to give the gift to him and bring him greetings from his fine son. He said I could leave the book with the guard but not to bother him further.<br><br>A few days later he called me and said, "I noticed this is an expensive book. I'm a frugal Scotsman, and I can't stand to see it go to waste. Please come and get it. We can have my name removed and you can give it to someone else."<br><br>I made an appointment to see him. When I arrived, I rang the intercom to the Gaetz apartment, but no one answered. The guard had been instructed to tell me I was to take the book with me. I took the book, returned to the office, and put it on my desk to remind me that I had a work yet to complete.<br><br>Time marched on. I sent my assistants over to talk to him, but they made no progress. Then some beautiful sister missionaries came to work in the area. I sent them to his door, but he also rejected them.<br><br>Sometime later my wife, Verla, came into the office, saw the book on my desk, smiled, and said, "My goodness, what kind of a missionary are you? Haven't you delivered those scriptures to Mr. Gaetz yet?"<br><br>"Sweetheart, I've been trying, but without much success."<br><br>She responded with, "Oh, come on now. You're just too busy."<br><br>I was a little irritated, so I said, "Well, Verla, why don't you try?"<br><br>She said, "All right, I will."<br><br>She took a different approach entirely. She called their home, and fortunately Mrs. Gaetz answered the phone. After a friendly conversation, Verla invited Mrs. Patricia Gaetz and her husband to the mission home for dinner. She accepted Sister Sorensen's invitation. About halfway through the dinner I was getting anxious to present the book. Sister Sorensen gently nudged me under the table, so I knew better. After the dinner we had a lovely discussion, but we never mentioned the Book of Mormon.<br><br>A few days later Mrs. Gaetz called and invited us to their apartment. We had a delicious lunch and talked. This went back and forth for some weeks. Then one day I again mentioned to Raymond, "Remember that wonderful book your son has given you? I surely would like to present it to you. You will find, on the whole, Latter-day Saint people, those who believe the Book of Mormon, are good and righteous people. They are kind, friendly, and good neighbors. You have a young grandson coming along; you surely want to know something of his beliefs."<br><br>This time Raymond accepted the book.<br><br>We continued to meet together socially, and then one day I said, "Raymond, it's time for you to receive the missionary discussions."<br><br>"No, I'm not interested. But I'll tell you what I will do. I walk every day at noon in the park for my health, and I would be happy to hear about the Book of Mormon through your lips. We'll talk religion."<br><br>So I arranged my schedule during the lunch hour to walk in the park two or three times a week with this good brother.<br><br>Our friendship deepened during these discussions. I soon asked him to be baptized.<br><br>He said, "No, I'm not interested in being baptized."<br><br>"Well, you've heard the gospel, you know it's true, you need to accept it. You've been reading the Book of Mormon; now take it into your heart."<br><br>"I haven't the faith yet to accept the Mormon Church."<br><br>One day a video came to the mission office entitled<i>How Rare a Possession.</i>You may have seen it. It's about a man who found a copy of the Book of Mormon without a cover or introductory pages in a trash can in Italy. The man read the book, accepted it, lived its principles, and spent almost a lifetime trying to find out more about the Church. He eventually found the missionaries, was baptized, and came into full fellowship. The video projects him later in his life going to the temple in Switzerland. It is a true story.<br><br>I gave the video to Raymond. A few days later, during our usual walk, it was obvious that he had changed. He said, "You know that man that found the Book of Mormon was not unlike me. Of course he was not married, but I am. I have a wife. I have a son. I have grandchildren. I do have hope in eternal life. I've changed my mind. I'm ready to be baptized."<br><br>"Do you have a testimony of Jesus Christ?"<br><br>"You know I have."<br><br>"Are you willing to give up smoking?"<br><br>"I can do it."<br><br>"Are you willing to give up drinking?"<br><br>"I will."<br><br>"Ray, you're a wealthy man. You're a captain of industry. You're a man of influence, a man of substance and means. Are you willing to pay a full tithe on all that money you make?"<br><br>"I certainly am."<br><br>"Good. Have you told your wife, Patricia?"<br><br>"No. That's your job."<br><br>We went right to his home. I told her of his decision and invited her to join him in baptism.<br><br>She said, "I can't be baptized. You know I'm a good Catholic. Neither can he. He still smokes and drinks, and he won't pay all that tithing."<br><br>You know something; he did. He gave up his coffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco and he paid his tithing and rejoiced. When he came up out of the waters of baptism, he said, "Now I want to go to that temple."<br><br>"Brother Gaetz, the temple is a year away. You'll have to work hard and prepare yourself spiritually."<br><br>"That's what I want to do."<br><br>"The nearest temple is 1,200 miles away in Washington, D.C."<br><br>"I understand that, and by the time I'm ready to go, your mission will be completed. Would you be willing to meet me there a year from now? You and Sister Sorensen?"<br><br>"We certainly will."<br><br>So it was. We flew to Washington, D.C., a year later. As we walked out of the temple after several sessions, he looked up at those beautiful spires and made an unusual remark.<br><br>"I feel like I'm the last one in and the first one out."<br><br>"Brother Ray, what do you mean?"<br><br>"Well, recently I have contracted terminal cancer. I don't know how long I have to live. I am just so grateful that I have been able to come here to the house of the Lord. I feel very much like the man that was portrayed in the film who lived out his life and finally found the temple. I'm sorry that my wife, Pat, and my son John and his wife are not here with me. My wife, Pat, lives according to the light she has in her own faith."<br><br>Some time passed. Sister Gaetz called me on the phone.<br><br>"Brother David, if you want to see Raymond in the flesh, you will have to come."<br><br>I flew to Halifax, found the stake president, and together we went to the hospital. We laid our hands upon Raymond's head and gave him a blessing of comfort and peace, releasing him from this life. Shortly thereafter he died, one of the happiest men I have ever known.<br><br>This good man who had been a captain of industry, a man of wealth and substance who had spent most of his life pursuing riches and the pride and praises of men, can be likened to this saying:<br><br><i>The elusiveness of happiness is . . . something like a butterfly, which, when pursued, seems always just beyond our grasp, but which, if we sit down quietly, may light upon us.</i>[Quoted from the<i>Sentinel</i>in<i>The Christian Leader's Golden Treasury,</i>ed. Maxwell Droke (Indianapolis: Droke House, 1955), 252]<br><br>What of Sister Gaetz? Over the years it has been Sister Sorensen's and my privilege to correspond with her, to encourage her, to bless her. And she has blessed us. Just this Christmas she called to wish us a merry Christmas. She told us her eyes were now too dim to write us a card. Even though she has not yet accepted the fullness of the gospel, she loves the Latter-day Saints. She understands us more fully, and she appreciates the virtues of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Raymond's son John, who was so interested in the salvation of his father, at the funeral spoke of the sweet reunion with John's mother. John testified that his father has gone on to his great and eternal reward. He was firm in the knowledge that the temple is the great garner that completes the gathering of Israel.<br><br>Very recently a note written by Ray Gaetz to his young grandson fell into my hands. It is dated October 5, 1989, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada:<br><br><i>My Dear Grandson,</i><br><i>I am sending you this Book of Mormon that I hope will be your lifelong companion. The teachings of this book will have a profound influence on your life. If you follow these teachings, you will be the recipient of many blessings. May our Father in Heaven bless and care for you.</i><br><i>With love,</i><br><i>Grandad</i><br><br>So it is, my dear young friends, Brother Raymond Gaetz came to understand that "come unto Christ" is not a nondescript, lovely phrase. It means come unto Christ through the ordinances of the temple. In fact, partaking of the temple ordinances is the only way to permanently come unto Christ. The Book of Mormon teaches us of the power and glory and gift of God and the desire to come unto Christ.<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i>[2 Nephi 25:26]<br><br>We know that all of our sins can be swallowed up in the blood of Christ. We learn this so perfectly in the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Make a commitment today that you will not leave this great university without having read the Book of Mormon at least once. You owe it to your parents or spouse--and to this great institution whose mission it is to bring souls to Christ. Most of all, you owe it to yourself.<br><br>These comforting, closing words from 2 Nephi 32:3 can mean so much to each of us: "Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do."<br><br>Karl G. Maeser, the first president of this great university, said, "Labor with the hand is as honorable as labor with the head, but labor with the heart, when the heart is pure and true, is the noblest labor that can be done" (in Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928], 78). I pray that you will labor with your heart as you study the Book of Mormon.<br><br>To its truths I humbly testify, in His holy name, even Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David E. Sorensen was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 19 March 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>m and Let Him Go - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Aloha. It is a blessing and privilege to greet you today from your sister campus, BYU--Hawaii, which is guided by the same prophetic destiny as this campus. As you may know, we are a small, intimate campus made up of students of many nations. My greeting could easily come to you in scores of different languages, but<i>aloha,</i>meaning love and affection in the Hawaiian language, has become our universal expression of love, for hello and good-bye.<br><br>One of the most significant episodes in our Savior's mortal ministry was the literal raising of Lazarus from the dead after he had lain in the tomb for four days. The setting for this dramatic manifestation of Christ's power and love is carefully laid out in John 11. The Apostle's skillful use of detail, his sense for drama, dialogue, suspense, crescendo, and climax match the doctrinal importance of this event. It is an astounding public miracle that illuminates the core truths about Christ and His Atonement.<br><br>You know the story. Christ receives desperate word from Martha and Mary to come to Bethany, for their brother is deathly ill. Jesus deliberately delays His journey for two days, then announces that Lazarus is dead and that He and His disciples must go to him. The disciples remind Him of the hostility of the Jewish leaders toward Him, even unto His death. Thomas simply says, "Let us also go, that we may die with him" (v. 16).<br><br>When Christ arrives in Bethany, Martha greets Him with weeping and a gentle rebuke: "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died" (v. 21). Martha's complaint is followed by her fervent testimony: "But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee" (v. 22). Jesus affirms His own role and identity: "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live" (v. 25).<br><br>The setting includes Lazarus, his sisters, the disciples, and other Jews. Some are believing. Some are critical. The intense grieving of the sisters, the wailing of the mourners, Christ's own tears, the anticipation of His death, the disciples' fear of the Jewish leaders, the hostility of certain ones in the crowd, and the melancholy of the grave site--all of these constitute for us a crescendo of profound human emotion. Jesus commands that the stone covering the tomb's entrance be removed. Martha objects, saying, "Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days" (v. 39). Christ says, "If thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God" (v. 40).<br><br>The stone is removed. Jesus offers a prayer of gratitude that reveals He had asked permission from His Father to stage this miraculous representation of the Atonement for the purpose of comforting wounded and grieving hearts, of testifying of His love and power, and of convincing the people present to believe the Father had sent Him (see v. 42).<br><br>The climactic moment comes when Christ cries out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth" (v. 43). Can you imagine that combination of hope, terror, and surprise the people feel when Lazarus obeys the command and rises, "bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin" (v. 44)? The sight and smell of this dead man must have been more than some could bear. But then came Christ's second command to certain others standing by: "Loose him, and let him go" (v. 44).<br><br>Think of it. Christ was commanding the people to free Lazarus, to remove the graveclothes and unbind the wrappings from around his eyes, mouth, hands, and feet--the wrappings of the grave. For he lived again! Think of the joy! But can we imagine also the hesitancy of some to reach out and remove the graveclothes? No doubt some shrank away completely.<br><br>For me the Lazarus story provides one of the most powerful metaphors of the Atonement of Christ for all humankind. We are all like Lazarus, beloved of the Lord, but wrapped about in the graveclothes of this world.<br><br>The Atonement is the central reality of our existence. It is the comprehensive instrument of hope, justice, and mercy in the world. In a significant way the Atonement will account for, reconcile, and redeem every injustice perpetrated in the history of this planet--all suffering, cruelty, guilt, violence against innocent and defenseless people, all accidents and ironies. It is the principle and the mechanism through which the work and glory of God can be accomplished; namely, "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life" of mankind (Moses 1:39).<br><br>Although the story of Lazarus made a powerful impression on me early in life, it wasn't until I came to BYU as an English literature major and later as a teacher that I was deeply moved by the essence of this story. Interestingly enough, it was not in a religion class--although religion classes were always inspiring. It was a literature class in which we studied Feodor Dostoevsky's classic novel<i>Crime and Punishment.</i><br><br>This novel contains for me one of the profound religious moments in all literature. It is that haunting scene in which Sonya the harlot and Raskolnikov the murderer sit in the waning candlelight of Sonya's apartment and read the story of Lazarus from the Bible.<br><br>In the novel, Raskolnikov is assailed by poverty and an eroding self-centeredness that has led him to a belief in man-made reason and will-controlled morality. Sonya is tortured by a life completely alien to her moral sensibilities. Raskolnikov is feelingless. Sonya is all love. Raskolnikov claims he murdered an old Jewish pawnbroker to prove that he, like Napoleon, was above traditional morality and could justifiably remove any obstacle that blocked his path to power. Sonya--crushed by poverty, exhausted by a drunken father and a neurotic stepmother, and terrorized by the thought of starving brothers and sisters--has become a prostitute to support the family.<br><br>In this particular scene Raskolnikov sneers that her self-sacrifice is in vain, since she will, no doubt, die of infection; the stepmother will eventually die of tuberculosis; and the children will die of starvation. Sonya is impaled on the barbs of his cynicism. He renders the unkindest cut of all when he predicts that Sonya's little sister Polechka will also have to walk the streets simply to prolong the agony of life:<br><br><i>"No! No! That can't be! No!" Sonya almost shrieked in desperation, as if someone had plunged a knife into her. "God--God will not allow such a terrible thing! . . ."</i><br><br><i>"He lets it happen to others,"</i>[responded Raskolnikov].<br><br><i>"No, no! God will protect her! God will protect her!" she repeated, beside herself.</i><br><br><i>"Perhaps God does not exist," answered Raskolnikov, with malicious enjoyment. He looked at her and laughed.</i>[Feodor Dostoevsky,<i>Crime and Punishment,</i>trans. Jessie Coulson (New York: W. W. Norton, 1975), 271]<br><br>Moments later Raskolnikov suggests suicide to be better for Sonya than living a life so loathsome to her. Sonya's answer is simple: "But what will become of [the children]?" (Dostoevsky,<i>Crime,</i>272). Raskolnikov is stunned into silence. The light of Sonya's love shines in the darkness of his mind. He can't comprehend it. He decides it must be religious fanaticism, a mad hope that a miracle will happen. He is determined to tear that delusion from Sonya's heart:<br><br><i>"So you pray a great deal to God, Sonya?" he asked her. . . .</i><br><br><i>"What should I do without God?" she said in a rapid, forceful whisper. . . .</i><br><br><i>"And what does God do for you in return?" he asked, probing deeper. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Her . . . little chest heaved with agitation.</i><br><br><i>"Be quiet! Do not ask! You are not worthy!" . . .</i><br><br><i>"He does everything."</i>[Dostoevsky,<i>Crime,</i>273–74]<br><br>In a final malicious whim, Raskolnikov insists that Sonya read the story of Lazarus. And so, in this setting, with the plagues, wretchedness, cruelty, and stench of St. Petersburg engulfing them, Sonya reads the sacred words:<br><br><i>"I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</i><br><br><i>"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. . . ."</i><br><br><i>"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</i><br><br><i>"And he that was dead came forth . . . bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."</i>[Dostoevsky,<i>Crime,</i>276–77]<br><br>Here is the moment of vision in the novel. It marks the beginning of Raskolnikov's regeneration, and it affirms and validates Sonya's hope. But it is much more than the pivotal moment in the lives of two imaginary persons. It is a moment for all time, for all men and women. It is the voice of God speaking out of the human predicament, not merely out of a holy text. (For a more extensive analysis, see Eric B. Shumway, "Literature as Religious Experience," in<i>"From This Place": Lectures in Honor of David O. McKay: Delivered Annually at Brigham Young University--Hawaii Campus, 1963–1992,</i>comps. Jesse S. Crisler and Jay Fox [Laie, Hawaii: Brigham Young University--Hawaii, 1998], 163–79.)<br><br>These two commandments to "come forth" and to "loose him, and let him go" constitute the way and the power of the Atonement. Let me illustrate further from the lives of two of BYU--Hawaii's international students.<br><br>Theany Reath from Cambodia was forced as a child to witness the massacres of her people. Terrified and traumatized by this horror of torture and genocide, she burned incense nightly to her favorite Buddhist god. When peace finally came to her country and the LDS missionaries arrived, she was attracted to the Church. But she was warned by friends and family not to join this foreign cult or she would be damned in the deepest hell or reincarnated into the most loathsome creature on earth.<br><br>Wrapped about by fear, she trembled at the admonition of the missionaries to pray. She was conditioned to believe in many gods and many demons both mysterious and terrible. How could she approach the god of the missionaries? How could she obey the admonition to "come forth," as it were?<br><br>Theany described her first attempt to address deity--not in the language of prayer that the missionaries had taught her but in the only language she could muster. Her prayer was simply a question: "Are . . . you the god of all the gods?" As she has testified, in that moment she was engulfed with profound feelings of warmth and love--deep and personal sensations of a loving Heavenly Father. Her surprise was exceeded only by her joy. She had "come forth," and Heavenly Father had freed her from the graveclothes of every present fear and insecurity and from the visions of horror from her past. Theany later served in the Sacramento California Mission and is now studying on our campus.<br><br>Katsuhiro Kajiyama was among the first students who came from Japan. Now a professor of Japanese on our campus, he reminisced about his rescue, Lazarus-like, from soul death. His tomb was a dark hopelessness; his graveclothes a bitter cynicism and hatred toward Americans. As he said in the account he sent to me: "I lived numbly, desensitized, and cold."<br><br>He remembered as a child the joy of his family, his prayers to the Buddha and Kami. But especially he remembered his mother--beautiful, soft, kind, gentle. His home was a place of peace. Their hometown was Hiroshima. On the morning of August 6, 1945, Kats was playing with a friend at school. He was just seven years old. These are his words:<br><br><i>The loud air raid alarm pierced our ears. . . . As I crouched down to the edge of the front door, an extraordinarily bright flash of light exploded as if a thousand flash photos had been taken, the light enveloping the whole building and sky. . . . There was a thunderous blast and a gust of force so strong that it shook the entire building and ground. . . . I screamed. . . . All around me there were noises of things being crushed and of shattered glass cascading to the floor.</i><br><br>Kats described the panic that ensued. Covered with blood, he escaped from under heavy fallen doors and ran out into a world surreal in its horror: houses on fire, whirling dust and smoke, hysterical crying and screaming from every direction. "Floating, groping along in the chaos," he had visions of his beautiful mother waiting for him at home. He longed for her comfort, her soft, gentle touch. However, when he arrived at the spot, he said:<br><br><i>I</i>[encountered]<i>a strange woman in baked, dirty clothes with a grotesquely swollen face and burnt, short, kinky hair. . . . Severe burns disfigured my beautiful mother into a stranger of bloated face with red and dark-brown blotches and scratches. I looked on in disbelief as her sweet voice called my name, "Kacchan." I cried for relief that it was she, but also</i>[in terror for her dreadful look].<br><br>It took 20 agonizing days for his mother to finally die. His brother was never found, except for the remnant of a sock with his name written on it with a black marker.<br><br>Motherless and reduced to abject poverty, Kats was tormented by the images of the pain and death of his mother and brother. He longed to hear "the sweet, gentle call" of his mother. "It seemed that [he] would never find peace in this cruel and harsh existence," until one day an American named Elder Gary Roper spoke to him: "How is school? Do you live nearby? I see you often in the streetcar. Would you like to join an activity for young people?"<br><br>Kats said he was amazed by this American's indescribably tender smile.<br><br><i>I was unfamiliar with this type of gentleness from foreigners. . . . Until then I had</i>[believed]<i>all Americans were heartless monsters who willingly sought to hurt and degrade the Japanese people.</i><br><br>After Elder Roper, it was Elder Green. One year had passed since his first introduction to the Church. He was still reluctant to join, but at a district conference in Hiroshima, the voice of Christ from the mouth of mission president Paul C. Andrus commanded, "'Come forth.' Be baptized."<br><br>In contrast to the horrific flash of light in the atomic bomb blast, Kats wrote of his baptism:<br><br><i>At that moment . . . I felt as though the brightest sun had broken through the clouds and streamed through the building. The whole auditorium seemed to be brightly lit and glowing. I was . . . filled with incomprehensible happiness and joy.</i><br><br>You can guess the rest of the story. The graveclothes of his tortured past were now unwrapped. The cynicism, hatred, and bitterness were gone. Kats was called on a mission to his native Japan. As a missionary he helped teach and baptize 80 people.<br><br>After his mission, thanks to generous donors and a work-study scholarship program, he went to BYU--Hawaii, which was then the Church College of Hawaii. He married his wife, Hilda, in the temple. He had further schooling, coming to the Provo campus to finish his bachelor's degree and to complete his master's degree in art. The graveclothes of ignorance and prejudice were further removed. He and his wife have raised a family of brilliant, devoted children. Both their daughters are now embarking on missions for the Church--one to Japan and one to Hong Kong.<br><br>Nearly every true conversion or repentance sequence is an analogue of the story of Lazarus.<br><br>One interesting question is: What if Lazarus, exercising his agency even as a spirit, had decided he did not want to return to a decaying, tortured body? He might prefer to let dead bodies lie. Or what if those present were squeamishly reluctant to touch the death wrappings of a man who clearly had been dead? It is not difficult to identify parallels among us today: people who would not be inclined to obey either commandment. Obedience to both commandments is central to the restoration of life.<br><br>Sometimes the wrappings of death are manifest in the clothes of addiction and behavioral patterns that paralyze righteous thought and action, such as alcoholism, gambling, drug use, pornography, anger, and violence. These wrappings are made of coarse cloth and smell of hell, and they bind people in a tomb of hopeless illusion and despair.<br><br>But what about the death wrappings of a finer texture: the silken wrappings of pride and self-importance, of obsession with one's appearance, of wealth devoid of any generous impulse? Many of these finer-textured addictions are mutations of things that satisfy basic needs; for example, the need we all have for encouragement morphing into a desperate search for praise and flattery. A dependency on "praise from above and flattery from below" has doomed more than one rising leader in nearly every profession (Stanley M. Herman,<i>The Tao at Work: On Leading and Following</i>[San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1994], 40).<br><br>The acts of helping to remove someone's "graveclothes," as it were, are the essence of a Latter-day Saint's errand from the Lord. You may ask yourself, "Am I an unbinder or am I a binder? Do I help loose or remove the graveclothes of others, or do I wrap their graveclothes more tightly around them?"<br><br>We all know people who have magnificent public or pulpit personas who may teach tearfully the doctrines that unbind and heal but who in their private lives are binders, who by their selfish prejudices, labels, and stereotypes bind others more tightly in their graveclothes.<br><br>Alma the Elder was in effect bound in heavy graveclothes. The act that unbound him was his willingness to listen to a prophet (see Mosiah 17). Abinadi gave his life to unbind Alma. In turn, Alma the Elder was an unbinder for his son, Alma the Younger, for whom all he could do was sincerely pray (see Mosiah 27:14). Prayer is part of the great unbinding process. Enos also found that out in his all-day-long prayer (see Enos 1).<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard is one of the great unbinders in the Church today--not just in his pulpit sermons and priesthood leadership training but also in his personal ministry, largely unseen by the general public. In the second month of my service as mission president in Tonga, Elder Ballard conducted two stake conferences on the same Sunday on the island of Vava`u. After a long, glorious day of meetings and training, we all returned to the hotel exhausted. I was in my pajamas ready for bed at 9:30 when a knock came at the door. It was my counselor, saying Elder Ballard wanted me to come to the restaurant immediately. I dressed hastily and went to the grill and found Elder Ballard talking to a man.<br><br>"President Shumway, this is John. He is leaving first thing in the morning on his yacht, but he wants to hear about the gospel. I told him he was in luck because a duly authorized servant of God was in the hotel who could teach him. Could you find a room where you can teach him and pray together?"<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I do remember the teaching and praying with this man, but I will never forget the example of an Apostle who, though exhausted, could still ask a golden question and put someone in touch with a missionary who could help begin the process of unbinding.<br><br>The great unbinders in the Church are our bishops. Many people stay in their graveclothes because they don't go to their bishops. Sometimes they desperately need to "come forth" from their own little tomb to confess. Sometimes they just have concerns, but fear that by coming to a bishop they will be seen as somehow less valiant. Sometimes they don't need to confess as much as they need to give voice to their feelings, ask questions, be reassured, ventilate, and feel love from a Church leader.<br><br>Sister Shumway belongs to that vast army of unbinders in the Church whom we call Relief Society visiting teachers. For 10 years she has been a visiting teacher to a woman who never once came to Church. During one visiting teaching session, Carolyn asked her if she ever read the<i>Ensign</i>magazine that she had sent her every month.<br><br>"No," she said, pointing upward, "but I know Father in Heaven is there because you keep coming back and you do not judge me."<br><br>This lady's graveclothes are being loosened. Her son did become active and is now serving a mission in the Philippines.<br><br>I pray that the story of Lazarus will take root more deeply in all of us; that the power of the Atonement in Lazarus, Sonya, Raskolnikov, Theany Reath, and Kats Kajiyama and millions of others will give us courage to "stand forth" and to allow our graveclothes to be removed; and that we might also be both the healers and the healed, the unbinders and the unbound.<br><br>With all my heart I testify of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the reality of His existence, the blessedness of the Restoration, and the blessed opportunity that you and I have to be associated with Brigham Young University. We are all called to be healers and unbinders. Faculty and students are healers and unbinders, but we all must be the healed and unbound as well, through Jesus Christ. I say this in His name, amen.<br><br><i>Eric B. Shumway was the president of BYU--Hawaii when this devotional address was given at BYU on 26 March 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

Gerald Horton Bath told the experience of a small African boy who<br><br><i>listened carefully as the teacher explained why it is that Christians give presents to each other on Christmas day. "The gift is an expression of our joy over the birth of Jesus and our friendship for each other," she said.</i><br><br><i>When Christmas day came, the boy brought to the teacher a sea shell of lustrous beauty. "Where did you ever find such a beautiful shell?" the teacher asked as she gently fingered the gift.</i><br><br><i>The youth told her that there was only one spot where such extraordinary shells could be found. When he named the place, a certain bay several miles away, the teacher was left speechless.</i><br><br><i>"Why ... why, it's gorgeous ... wonderful, but you shouldn't have gone all that way to get a gift for me."</i><br><br><i>His eyes brightening, the boy answered, "Long walk part of gift."</i>[Gerald Horton Bath, "Long Walk Part of Gift," in<i>The Greatest Christmas Ever: A Treasury of Inspirational Ideas and Insights for an Unforgettable Christmas</i>[Tulsa, Oklahoma: Honor Books, 1995, 69]<br><br>During our path of life "the long walk"--the opportunity for charitable love and service--is often the most important part of the gift. In fact, the most important gifts are usually not the ones that cost the most but the ones that come from the heart and reflect true love in the line of service.<br><br>When Christ was preparing for His ultimate sacrifice and His crowning achievement, He told His disciples:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you. ...</i><br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</i>[John 13:34–35]<br><br>After a long life of service, King Benjamin shared the wisdom of his experience:<br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i><br><br><i>Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?</i>[Mosiah 2:17–18]<br><br>But there is a counter side to this line of thinking. It is all around us. We are bombarded by it on television, in the magazines we read, and in the natural man found within. The counter side is the "me generation." In the decade of the 1990s more wealth was generated in the United States than in any other time in the history of our nation. More millionaires and billionaires were spawned than ever before, and the focus turned to worldly possessions and conspicuous consumption.<br><br>During the 1990s I worked with the home-building industry. Home building boomed in the latter part of the 1990s, and the economy experienced the longest economic upturn in its recorded history. Although the median square footage of houses has grown significantly over time, the average size of households living in those houses actually dropped in the 1990s. Big houses, fancy cars, and new televisions, VCRs, and DVDs abound.<i>Lifestyle</i>became the buzzword of the marketing profession. More women than ever were in the workplace--a phenomenon that was perhaps one of the most significant societal changes to take place in the United States in the last 30 years of the century. But because of the focus on worldly wealth, for many families it now takes two incomes to maintain--or at least come close to--a middle-class lifestyle. Long hours and a focus on possessions characterized the decade of the 1990s.<br><br>Now don't get me wrong--I am not saying that you shouldn't "love yourself" in a positive sense. You need to know who you are, and you need to make sure that you are at one with yourself and that you are physically, emotionally, spiritually, and educationally strong and prepared. Furthermore, particularly for the single students, you have the opportunity to be--at least in part--"self-oriented" in a positive way to make sure that you are doing the things you need to do to prepare for the future. It is important to love yourself, but it is equally important to balance this with an outward focus. My parents have told me that as a little boy I would often say "Self, self" as an indication that I wanted to do it myself. It is important to be independent to a point, but I have learned that I can do far better with the help of the Lord and the service of my fellowmen.<br><h2><b>September 11th--How Did it Change Our World?</b></h2><br>On September 11, 2001, as we were attacked by terrorist forces, the roaring spirit of the '90s was brought to a devastating halt. As a society we were in shock. We cannot change what happened, but there is much to learn.<br><br>When President Hinckley spoke on Sunday morning, October 7, 2001, at general conference, he helped put our lives in perspective:<br><br><i>Through centuries of time, men and women, so very, very many, have lived and died. Some may die in the conflict that lies ahead. To us, and we bear solemn testimony of this, death will not be the end. There is life beyond this as surely as there is life here. Through the great plan which became the very essence of the War in Heaven, men shall go on living.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 74]<br><br>He then focused eloquently on how we should live:<br><br><i>Are these perilous times? They are. But there is no need to fear. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes. We can be an influence for good in this world, every one of us.</i>["The Times," 74]<br><br>The question then is: What kind of an influence for good do you want to be?<br><h2><b>George W. Romney--Shirtsleeve Public Servant</b></h2><br>Let me share an example of a person who knew what it meant to be in the line of service.<br><br><i>When George W. Romney died on 26 July 1995, newspapers in Michigan and across the nation eulogized him as one of the most genuine public servants of our time. ...</i><br><br><i>"Romney embodied the Mormon belief that we are all literally brothers and sisters on earth, that service to each other is essential. ... [He believed] we have to be helping and fair with each other" (</i>The Detroit News and Free Press,<i>28 July 1995).</i>[In<i>George W. Romney: Shirtsleeve Public Servant,</i>Romney Institute of Public Management, Marriott School, Brigham Young University, 2002, 2]<br><br>Yes, George Romney was a very successful businessman, and through hard work and creativity he led American Motors from disaster to stunning success. "By 1959, George had become the most famous businessman in the world, and he went on to become the Associated Press 'Man of the Year in Industry' four years in a row" (<i>Shirtsleeve Public Servant,</i>9). But throughout the time of his business success he was constantly involved as an active citizen and contributor to his community. In December 1956, despite the significant challenges at American Motors, he agreed to chair the Citizens Advisory Committee on School Needs in Detroit. And his work soon earned him the nickname Spokesman for a Better Detroit.<br><br><i>Later, in 1959, when the state of Michigan faced a seemingly insoluble financial crisis, George argued that the problem could only be resolved with the enactment of a new state constitution. He subsequently formed Citizens for Michigan, a nonpartisan citizens' group ... designed to give the Michigan state government the kind of total makeover that</i>[was required.]<br><br><i>... On 10 February 1962, after a day of contemplation and prayer, George announced his candidacy for the governor's office.</i><br><br>[Eventually he was elected, and]<i>during George's three terms as governor, he was able to wipe out Michigan's deficit, dramatically increase conservation efforts, improve school funding, and streamline government.</i><br><br><i>... When Richard Nixon won the presidency</i>[in 1968],<i>he invited George to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). George accepted.</i>[<i>Shirtsleeve Public Servant,</i>11, 14]<br><br>He resigned in 1972, and after his retirement from nearly 40 years of public service, George Romney with true missionary zeal spent the next 23 years--the rest of his life--helping to gather and direct the growing movement for volunteer service in the nation.<br><br>Let me share with you what he said when he spoke on February 20, 1970, at the first meeting of the National Center for Voluntary Action--a board he would chair for more than five years:<br><br><i>Americans have four basic ways of solving problems that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector--the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector--the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association. Voluntary action is the most powerful of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies. ... As Woodrow Wilson said, "The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people." Individualism makes cooperation worthwhile--but cooperation makes freedom possible.</i>[<i>Shirtsleeve Public Servant,</i>16]<br><br>Mitt Romney said it well in speaking of his father:<br><br>[My father believed America would be saved]<i>by men and women who work in their communities to lift one another; who encourage, lead, support, and help Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts; and who volunteer their talents to help people who are less advantaged. That is the only course that brings people back to the greatness that has always been part of America. That's what he'd tell you. And ... he devoted his life to preaching that message.</i>["George Romney: A Citizen First,"<i>Exchange,</i>fall 1996, 28]<br><br>And it is certainly fair to say that Mitt has followed in his father's footsteps in the line of service with his great effort in the Olympics. And the service in this state related to the Winter Olympics that was rendered by so very many people--including, I'm sure, many of you--has been a great example of the importance and benefits of volunteer service.<br><br>My wife and I came to Utah for some meetings the week after the Olympics, and it was our humble observation that the Olympics had brought the state together. The opportunity for many to volunteer--and the success that comes from service--had yielded a sense of community for the state and for the nation. When done in the right spirit, service fosters unity, oneness, and commitment.<br><br>President John F. Kennedy said it well:<br><br><i>For of those to whom much is given, much is required. And when at some future date the high court of history sits in judgment on each of us, recording whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the state, our success or failure, in whatever office we hold, will be measured by the answers to four questions: First, were we truly men of courage. ... Second, were we truly men of judgment. ... Third, were we truly men of integrity. ... Finally, were we truly men of dedication?</i>[John F. Kennedy, speech to the Massachusetts state legislature (9 January 1961)]<br><br>In his State of the Union speech on January 29, 2002, President George W. Bush set forth a challenge to every American:<br><br><i>In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self. We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.</i>[At whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html]<br><br>He offered a specific challenge to all of us: "My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two years--4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime--to the service of your neighbors and your nation" (at whitehouse.gov).<br><br>Two years--that has a familiar sound to it, doesn't it?<br><h2><b>What Does It Mean, Then, for All of Us to Be in the Line of Service?</b></h2><br>Being in the line of service can include a career in public service, involvement in a family project, or individual acts of charity. In essence it is showing, on a regular basis, our love for those around us and the pure love of Jesus Christ. It is loving one another as our Savior loved us.<br><br>I am delighted to be on campus as a Romney lecturer for the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management in the School of Management. This is not intended to be a commercial, but it is worth noting that the Romney Institute trains people who will receive master's degrees in public administration and who will spend their life in public service. I have an MPA, and it is a great degree that has allowed me to work in a variety of different capacities--many related to public service and public policy. People trained at the Romney Institute serve as city managers, state government officials, health care professionals, federal workers, leaders of nonprofit organizations, consultants, and change agents working in the United States and international countries with nonprofit or nongovernmental organizations. These jobs are just a few examples of a host of careers in public service, and, as you can see, the options are rich and varied.<br><br>And what about family service? The opportunities abound. In December 1999 our family had a unique experience. Between Christmas and New Year's we were able to go to Belfast in northern Ireland to work on a house for Habitat for Humanity. It was a different kind of Christmas for us, but the privilege to be together and to work with both Catholic and Protestant families to help build Habitat houses was a unique opportunity. We saw how providing decent, safe, affordable housing could bridge the gap between different people and cultures, and it provided a common bond for our family through service and love. It was a Christmas we will never forget.<br><br>And, speaking of Christmas, I am reminded of one of my favorite Christmas stories that illustrates the importance of individual acts of charity in the line of service. I heard it years ago, and although I am not sure of the source or even if it is a factual story, the point is clear.<br><br><i>It was just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no identification, no inscription. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years or so. It began because my husband Mike strongly disliked the commercial aspects of Christmas--the frantic running around at the last minute and the focus on gifts instead of people and our Savior. Knowing he felt this way, I reached for something special. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level. Shortly before Christmas there was a nonleague match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church. These youngsters didn't have headgear, and they dressed in sneakers so ragged that shoestrings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, and they were a sharp contrast to our boys in their spiffy blue and gold uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes.</i><br><br><i>We took every weight class. Mike, seated beside me, shook his head sadly. "I wish just one of them could have won," he said. "They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could take the heart right out of them."</i><br><br><i>Mike loved kids--all kids--having coached Little League football, baseball, and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church. On Christmas Eve I placed the envelope on the tree with a note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me.</i><br><br><i>His smile was the brightest that year, and in succeeding years. For each Christmas I followed the tradition--one year sending a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, another year a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas, and on and on. The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning, and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents. As the children grew, the toys gave way to more practical presents, but the envelope never lost its allure.</i><br><br><i>The story doesn't end there. You see, we ost Mike last year due to cancer. When Christmas rolled around I was still so wrapped in grief that I barely got the tree up. But Christmas Eve found me placing an envelope on the tree, and in the morning it was joined by three more. Each of our children, unbeknownst to the others, had placed an envelope on the tree for their dad. The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation watching as their fathers take down the envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.</i><br><h2><b>But It's Not Always Easy to Be in the Line of Service</b></h2><br>I hope that I have made the case for being in the line of service. We have noted some inspiring examples. But I also want to be realistic. Service is great, but I caution you: It cannot wait for the convenient moment. You need to be proactive. If you wait for the convenient moment to serve, it will never happen! Sacrifice is what makes it service.<br><br>If we are really going to learn to serve, it must become a way of life as it was for George Romney and many other people we know. It must become part of our everyday actions. You can make it your profession, but if it's not your profession, you can still make it an important part of your life.<br><br>The Savior is our ultimate example. He lived a life of service, and, indeed, He sacrificed His life so that we might live again. He did not spend His life with the rich and famous or seeking worldly possessions; He spent His life healing the sick and teaching His disciples. His admonition to us was: "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you" (John 15:12).<br><br>Remember, this is the time for you to prepare. The sign at the entrance to campus has never been more meaningful: "Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve." You are students at the university sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This is your time to prepare, and the education you receive now will help you to be ready to serve throughout the remainder of your life. One of the best ways you can prepare to "go forth to serve" is to be of service while you are here. Guard this time well. Don't waste your time. Prepare for the future. The opportunities lie before you, and the moment is now. Seize the moment.<br><h2><b>In the Line of Service: A Model for Life</b></h2><br>We talk often in the business world about the importance of profit and bottom-line financial success. Returns on investment and maximizing shareholder equity often drive decision making. I believe in the free enterprise system and the importance of providing for family and financial reserves. However, King Benjamin's words provide a different model of success. He taught us the importance of starting with a clear destination in mind: "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). The destination is our return to the presence of our Father in Heaven, and the path is through service, charity, and the pure love of Christ.<br><br>We all know Albert Einstein and the powerful scientific contributions he made that have influenced our way of life. Listen to his words as they set forth a related model of success:<br><br><i>Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to a divine purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that man is here for the sake of other men. ... Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow-men, both living and dead, and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received.</i>[Albert Einstein, in<i>Living Philosophies</i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1930); see also Einstein,<i>The World As I See It,</i>translated by Alan Harris]<br><br>The process of giving back through service and other means is an expression not only of service but of gratitude.<br><br>Moroni was a great prophet. In the last days of his mortal life he was forced to see the devastation of his people. Despite the destruction and excesses that were all around him, he provided powerful insights into the blessings that come from practicing service, charity, and the pure love of Christ. He outlined a clear vision and destination for life:<br><br><i>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</i>[Moroni 7:47–48]<br><br>May we seek to practice this pure love of Christ with the hope that we may become the sons and daughters of God, to be like Him and see Him as He is. May we always be in the line of service, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kent W.

<h1> Forth to Serve&quot; - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Some of you may have had your picture taken today at one corner of the campus. There is a motto inscribed there. Both parts of that motto present a challenge. The first part invites you to "enter to learn." You had lots of temptations to focus on other things than learning. I won't list them for fear that I would put bad ideas into the heads of prospective students. But for you who have come to this point of honor, it took some discipline to put learning first.<br><br>The second part of that motto will be even more of a challenge for you. It exhorts you to "go forth to serve." That will require resisting the forces that will pull you away from service to serving your own wants and needs. You will only have the strength to resist those forces if you have a view of who you are, a view that is at odds with most of your experience.<br><br>It was not hard to come to see yourself as a learner. Seeing yourself that way fits what most of you have been doing for a good part of your waking hours since you were little children. And, if we succeeded at this university, you will for a lifetime see yourself as better for having become a perpetual learner.<br><br>It is not as easy to see yourself as a perpetual servant, but you must if you are to achieve the purpose of your education here. The word<i>servant</i>is not an exalted title for most of us. The picture it brings to mind--probably from an old movie--is of you as a server standing behind people of higher social status than you. They are seated at a table, and the servant waits on them. The servant may be dressed beautifully and may even stand with head carried at a noble angle, but few of us would find ourselves pleased with the thought that our education had prepared us for what appears to be a demeaning place. Most of us have, at least unconsciously, seen ourselves as working for an education so that we might sit at the table of abundance--not become a servant of others.<br><br>But there is another way to see the word<i>servant.</i>When the Lord Jesus Christ wishes to dignify those He loves and trusts, He uses the title as praise: "My servant." Listen to His voice as recorded in His revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray earnestly that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the children of Zion upon the laws and commandments which have been and which shall be given unto you.</i><br><br><i>All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence, faithfulness, and prayers of faith.</i><br><br><i>Let my servant Parley P. Pratt journey with my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.</i><br><br><i>Let my servant Lyman Wight journey with my servant Sidney Rigdon.</i><br><br><i>Let my servant Hyrum Smith journey with my servant Frederick G. Williams.</i><br><br><i>Let my servant Orson Hyde journey with my servant Orson Pratt, whithersoever my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall counsel them, in obtaining the fulfilment of these commandments which I have given unto you, and leave the residue in my hands. Even so. Amen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 103:35–40]<br><br>Your key and mine to rising to our potential as servants is to know our Master, to do for Him what we can, and be content to leave the residue in His hands. Let me give you an example that will face you in the days ahead. You will be torn between the demands to put bread on the table and a roof over your head, to take care of a family need, to respond to the cries of the widows or the orphans around you, and at the same time to meet the requirements of the calling you have accepted in the Church. When that happens, you will be sorely tempted to murmur, perhaps even to complain.<br><br>But remember that you serve a Master who loves you, who knows you, and who is all-powerful. He has created not demands for your service but opportunities for your growth. You can pray to Him with confidence and ask, "What would you have me do next?" If you listen humbly and with faith, you will feel an answer. And you will, if you are wise and good, set about to do that which your Master has commanded. And you will leave the residue in His hands. As His servant I promise you that you will find that some of those residual tasks you left will be done when you return to them. Others will have been prepared for you. And you will be the stronger for the task you already tackled.<br><br>Then, when you pray again, an answer will come again. And you will move on to the next task, at peace and not complaining.<br><br>Sometimes you may not feel an answer to your prayer because your Master may not care which task you start next. But He will care that you asked. And whatever you choose to do next, you will know that the residue is in His hands.<br><br>You will in time come to see that your Master is not using you but drawing you to Him. You will come to know that the scripture is for you that says, "For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13).<br><br>When you have long enough prayed, listened, and obeyed, He will no longer be a stranger to you and you will begin to know the thoughts and intents of His heart. Then you will come to know that another scripture can apply to you. This is what the Savior said to His beloved servants during His mortal ministry when they had begun to understand His heart and His mind and that of His Heavenly Father:<br><br><i>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</i><br><br><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</i><br><br><i>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</i><br><br><i>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</i>[John 15:12–15]<br><br>You may not be asked to face death in the service He requires of you, but you will be asked to love and to sacrifice for a lifetime. And you will be blessed by your faithful and loving Master beyond what you would have asked of Him. And, above all, you will, as the faithful servant, become His friend.<br><br>As you go forth to serve Him, rather than being demeaned, you will be lifted up. And in the world to come you will find yourself in His exalted presence.<br><br>As His servant I testify to you that His commands are kind and His promises sure. Our Heavenly Father lives, and He loves us. Our Master, the Lord Jesus Christ, is our Savior and Redeemer, and He lives and leads us and comforts us. I leave you my blessing that you will find happiness in a lifetime of service--not in spite of the demands of the tasks you will be given, but through them. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><p class="p1"><i>Henry B.

<h1>Out, Hooking Up, and Celestial Marriage - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The topic I selected to discuss this morning was motivated by a research report I read last summer. A study of young women attending colleges and universities across the United States reported that dating has disappeared from campus, and young women have been left to wander in a social wilderness in their search for Mr. Right. The vast majority of the young women interviewed stated that marriage is a "very important" goal for them. In addition, a majority indicated they hoped to find Mr. Right while attending college. They lamented that dating has been replaced by hanging out with acquaintances and then hooking up with young men. Hooking up generally involves drinking alcohol and some degree of sexual activity. These young women, more often than not, felt frustrated and lonely, and most reported they had not found Mr. Right. Drinking and promiscuity are not the Lord's way to find someone to marry! Heavenly Father loves you and desires you to be happy, and thus He has given you righteous procedures to follow in your pursuit of an eternal marriage.<br><br>In response to this study, my friend and colleague Brent Top--a member of the Religious Education faculty--and I decided to examine the dating culture among LDS youth, particularly those young adults at BYU. Let me compare the desire to marry among college women across the nation to both women and men attending BYU. As mentioned earlier, marriage is a very important goal to 83 percent of the national sample of women college students. Happily, marriage is very important to nearly all BYU students--both men (95 percent) and women (97 percent). It appears almost all of you have the appropriate goal; it seems that it is the implementation that falls a little short.<br><br>I am confident that each of you has a copy of the proclamation on the family. This is pure doctrine straight from the Lord through His prophet and apostles. There have been only four proclamations in this dispensation, and each teaches important eternal truths. Please take the time to read, ponder, and pray about this counsel from the Lord concerning the eternal significance of the family.<br><br>Satan still thinks he has a chance to win the war he initiated against God's plan in the premortal existence. One of his most cunning strategies is to turn away the sons and daughters of God from eternal relationships sealed in holy temples. Satan is giving special attention to you, my young friends--both single and married--to create doubt in your minds about marriage and your being ready to marry, increase your fear of failure to find the right one and your fear of divorce, and heighten your concern about having children. He is providing alluring sexual temptations. All are designed to hinder your embracing and keeping sacred covenants with your companion.<br><br>Today I want to share with those of you who are single some of the appropriate ways to establish an eternal relationship. For those of you who are married, these suggestions will assist you in nurturing a strong marriage.<br><br>One of the joys of teaching at BYU is the opportunity to mingle scripture with the philosophy of men in a righteous fashion. I appreciate teaching sociology within a gospel context by linking intellect with inspiration. This morning I will mingle a little social science with the scriptures--revelation with the best research and sound reason.<br><br>I have five suggestions that I want to share with you today to assist in establishing and strengthening a celestial marriage.<br><br>The first suggestion is<i>for all Cinderellas and Prince Charmings to throw away their glass slippers</i>. Following Satan's encouragement, contemporary society greatly emphasizes courtship, the hunt, or the conquest. The rest of the story, the most significant part of the life story, is dismissed with six words: "And they lived happily ever after."<br><br>There is a very dangerous misperception embedded in this Cinderella and glass slipper syndrome. It is the focus on finding the perfect person to marry with whom you will live happily ever after. I am convinced that the Lord's plan is to find<i>a</i>right one rather than<i>the</i>one. I admit there may be rare cases where two people covenanted in the premortal existence to find each other and marry in this life. They see each other across the Marriott Center parking lot, and it is love at first sight. Occasionally students ask if I knew my wife in the premortal existence. What can I say? Of course I did. But then I add that I knew all of my sisters in the premortal existence, and no matter who I married, she would be an acquaintance. Let me be crystal clear: this is not Church doctrine; rather, it is a flippant response to a question for which I don't have an answer. The First Presidency has affirmed that premortal covenanted marriages--glamorized by<i>Saturday's Warrior--</i>are rare indeed. To most of us Heavenly Father says, "There are thousands of my sons and daughters attending BYU who are worthy to enter my house and covenant to be your eternal mate. You pick one you like who is worthy, and I will give you my blessing." There are actually many whose foot will nicely fit within the glass slipper.<br><br>A second suggestion is<i>don't wait for others to carry your glass slipper about the campus looking for a match.</i>In other words, don't wait for your Heavenly Father to write the name of the person you are to marry on your kitchen wall or to deliver him or her to your front door. Instead, be a little more proactive and seek someone you like, someone who is worthy, and someone who inspires you to be a better person. The Spirit will guide you but won't do the courting or make the choice for you.<br><br>Those of you who are married will agree that this Cinderella mentality of "If I marry the right person, we will live happily ever after" fails to prepare couples for married life. When problems arise in a marriage--and they will arise--a husband or wife is tempted to think, "Oh no, I married the wrong person because I am not happy ever after." Nonsense! Good marriages are created after you get up from your knees at the altar of the temple. Strong marriages emerge out of helping each other obtain your education, struggling financially, dealing with sickness, and coping with the shock produced by the birth of your first child. Life changes and moves ahead in many unanticipated ways. Changing jobs, moving to a different city, raising teenagers, caring for an aged parent, retirement, and similar activities and events are what produce eternal marriages. Overcoming these problems as a team--helping and supporting each other along the way--are what produce a happy marriage. I loved my dear wife when we married 40 years ago this summer, but the love I felt for her then is insignificant to my love for her after these many years of trials and triumphs.<br><br>There are no written "money-back" guarantees for marital happiness. There is no antidivorce insurance. Occasionally a spouse changes in ways that make maintaining a marriage impossible. But I fear that the Cinderella complex encourages people to give up on a relationship too quickly and to start another search for the perfect spouse. The best marriage guarantee you can have is the one you sign in the presence of your bishop--and it has to be renewed once a year. Using this recommend in the companionship of your husband or wife is the best antidivorce guarantee available--not just because you have entered the temple but also because of what temple worthiness represents. This guarantee requires supporting each other in Church callings, working out the payment of tithing, praying together, studying the scriptures together, and giving service together.<br><br>In rejecting the Cinderella complex, I am not suggesting that you marry just anyone. But I am suggesting that some of us may have raised the bar a little too high. There are very few perfect people in the world, and if you do get lucky and find one, he or she probably won't want to marry you anyway. But don't despair. The traits and characteristics we are looking for in a spouse will emerge out of the years of experience together. My advice is to look for the potential in a spouse and then help each other achieve your desires. In other words, good marriages are earned by experience, not found with glass slippers.<br><br>My third suggestion is<i>to exercise faith and to have courage in dating and marriage.</i>It is scary to marry! It is scary to stay married during troubled times! It is scary to be responsible for children! Some people are afraid of marriage and parenthood. Perhaps their parents or close friends divorced and they fear the same happening to them.<br><br>Have faith in God your Father and in His Son. They will guide and strengthen us because we are on Their errand of creating eternal families and raising children in righteousness. This message is simply stated in the words of President Ezra Taft Benson to young adults: "Those fears must be replaced with faith" ("To the Single Adult Brethren of the Church,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1988, 52).<br><br>Let me share a scriptural example that I think is applicable to those considering marriage or parenthood. The children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years because they<i>feared</i>to enter the land promised them by Jehovah. They eventually wandered up the east side of the Jordan River. They were camped on Mount Nebo, looking across at the promised land. Moses was instructed to pass the prophetic mantle to Joshua. Jehovah was ready to perform a miracle to impress upon the children of Israel that Joshua was the new prophet and also to test their courage one last time. A miracle parallel to Moses' parting of the Red Sea was to demonstrate the Lord's power resting on Joshua.<br><br>Joshua had the camp of Israel move close to the river and asked each man and woman to "sanctify" themselves (Joshua 3:5). In this day that would mean to wash your clothes, turn off trashy television, catch up on your tithing, read the scriptures for an hour, and say your prayers. These activities would encourage the Spirit to dwell with you. In the morning the children of Israel were not left as spectators high on the riverbanks when it was time to part the waters. Rather, 12 men carried the ark of the covenant to the water's edge. Then, as the Lord explained:<br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</i>[Joshua 3:13]<br><br>It took faith and courage for those 12 men and the children of Israel who followed to step off the bank into the swirling waters of the spring runoff. As the water covered the soles of their feet, the miracle then happened, and the waters were stopped.<br><br>So it may be with you in your quest for an eternal partner or for an eternal relationship. We cannot sit in our apartments, we cannot spend long hours at work, we cannot endlessly play video games and wait for the Lord to bring a spouse to the altar for us. We cannot wait for the Lord to create a special love between our spouse and us. He does not magically cause the perfect family to appear when there has been little, if any, effort on our part. Waving at a group of girls or guys across the cultural hall, driving your spouse to the grocery store once a week, or just knowing the names of your children is not resting the soles of your feet in the waters of marriage and family life.<br><br>During the 1970s cohabitation became popular, allowing couples to<i>ease</i>into marriage, to try out being married without the commitments and responsibilities of marriage. Social scientists in general applauded this emerging social custom and argued that cohabiting would increase marital satisfaction and reduce divorce. They reasoned that cohabiting is an opportunity to confirm real compatibility and that a marriage that followed would be happier and more stable. This pronouncement was not one of social sciences' finest hours. The truth of the matter is that 30 years of research has made it clear that couples who cohabit and then wed are less happy and are more likely to divorce! Why? Because cohabiting couple are not willing to exercise the faith to make a lifelong commitment, and their commitment does not increase much when they marry.<br><br>In defense of the social sciences, they are starting to figure this marriage thing out a little better. For example, a recent book entitled<i>In Defense of Marriage</i>analyzes mountains of statistical data demonstrating that married men and women are happier, healthier, and live longer than single or divorced men and women. Marriage is part of God's great plan. It is good for both the body and soul.<br><br>I realize that not all will have the opportunity to marry in this life, but, with faith and courage, most will. And eventually all righteous men and women will share these blessings. It is estimated that 95 percent of all Americans have been married at least once by age 45. Please don't wait until you are 44 to seriously pursue marriage. Social research reveals that marrying in the 20s somewhat increases marital happiness and reduces the likelihood of divorce. I promise you that if you pursue marriage and family life with sincere intent that the Father will bless you to eventually achieve this blessed state.<br><br>The fourth suggestion that I offer to establish and nurture an eternal relationship is<i>to keep physical intimacy at an appropriate level so as to enjoy the presence of the Spirit and to be worthy to seal your commitment to each other in the temple.</i>Elder Holland gave a talk here at BYU entitled "Of Souls, Symbols, and Sacraments." Because of its powerful, pure doctrine, he was asked to repeat it in general conference. If you don't have a copy, please ask your campus bishop for one. It is pure doctrine that lovingly explains how chastity is a necessary condition for eternal life.<br><br>As I mentioned in my introduction, hooking up and dating among non-LDS almost always involve sexual activity. Such must not be the case for Latter-day Saints. I am happy to report that Brother Top's and my research with LDS high school students reveals that their premarital sexual activity is substantially below the national level. But at times it seems like we members of the Church get caught up in the ways of the world and end up adopting them to a degree. We may not be going as fast as the world, but, unfortunately, we sometimes are headed in the same direction.<br><br>Let me illustrate this worldly marching attitude with an example. A friend of mine was serving as the bishop of a BYU ward. He was teasing the elders quorum president about not being married.<br><br>He received the stock reply from the quorum president: "I just haven't found the right girl yet."<br><br>My friend then asked, "What kind of girl are you looking for?"<br><br>The reply was, "A girl worthy to go to the temple." But then, with a grin, the elders quorum president added, "But just barely."<br><br>What was this young man saying? He was joking, I hope. But it sounds like he was willing to keep the strict letter of the law but wanted to push as close to the edge of serious sin as he could get. It is highly unlikely that the Spirit will be companion to anyone holding such an attitude. Such a person is heading in a worldly direction away from God's plan.<br><br>I am not suggesting that you never kiss someone until you kneel across the altar, but I am suggesting that you keep physical intimacy within the bounds set by the Lord. I don't have time to say any more about appropriate intimate behavior, but I am sure your campus bishops frequently discuss the topic.<br><br>I do want to say a word or two about a different consequence of inappropriate intimacy. Young people sometimes justify inappropriate intimacy on the grounds that it is an expression of their special love and that it strengthens their relationship. I am convinced that more often than not such activity actually destroys a potential eternal relationship. Let me illustrate with a scriptural example.<br><br>This example involves two of King David's children. His son Amnon fell "in love" with his half-sister, Tamar. They had the same father but different mothers. He had it bad. He thought about her all day and dreamed about her all night. His friend--actually his cousin--noticed Amnon's funk and offered to help him in his pursuit of the maid Tamar. The scriptures say Jonadab, Amnon's friend, was "a very subtil man" (2 Samuel 13:3). In other words, he was a devious man. Jonadab suggested that Amnon fake illness, and when his father asked about his sickness, he should plead that Tamar be sent to cook him some cakes--the Hebrew equivalent of chicken soup. The plan worked perfectly. When Tamar finished cooking the cakes, Amnon sent away the servants and made a strong advance. Tamar resisted: "And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly" (2 Samuel 13:12).<br><br>In modern English, she told him to stop, that what he was doing was wrong and also rather stupid. She explained that their father, King David, loved Amnon, that he was his favorite son, and David would give him anything he asked, including her as a bride. But Amnon was beyond reason and was driven by his passion: "Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her" (2 Samuel 13:14).<br><br>What had happened was really bad. But now comes the point I want to make from this example of inappropriate intimacy: "Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone" (2 Samuel 13:15).<br><br>Amnon did not send Tamar flowers, nor did he call her to express his undying love. Instead, he hated her so strongly that he shamed her before the king's court and all of Israel. He loved her, and then a half-hour later he hated her. Why? Tamar was associated with the guilt he felt for the terrible deed he had done. In his mind she became the cause of his sin, and thus he hated her. So it is in today's world. A couple may have the potential for a celestial marriage, but if they become too intimate, then the feelings of tenderness and love turn to guilt, then to dislike, and perhaps even to hate. Too much intimacy too soon is not the Lord's way.<br><br>In this example I have focused on the single members of the Church, but let me stress that married couples have the same responsibility to obey the law of chastity. Forbidden love will have the same terrible consequences. Chastity--which requires virtue in our minds and hearts as well as in our actions--is absolutely necessary for an eternal marital relationship.<br><br>My final suggestion is appropriate for those seeking a mate, for married couples, and for everyone else, for that matter. Many years ago a couple asked if I would provide them marriage counseling. I resist such requests since I am not a trained counselor--and, besides, I really don't enjoy doing it. But occasionally circumstances conspire against me and I am forced to do so. This was one of these cases. I had worked with the couple for several weeks, and they had not made any real progress in reducing the anger and conflict. One evening as I waited for them to come to our home, I had a few minutes and opened the scriptures. I decided to read the New Testament to get me in a spiritual mood. One of my favorite sections of the New Testament is the Sermon on the Mount. When I read Matthew 5:43–44, I was struck with a powerful insight.<br><br><i>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</i>[Matthew 5:43–44]<br><br>When the couple arrived, I had the husband wait in the living room while I met with the wife in the family room. When I asked her if we could kneel and pray for her husband, she looked at me like I was crazy. When I explained that I did not want her to pray that he would get run over by a large truck, develop a disfiguring disease, or obey her every wish but rather wanted her to sincerely pray for the Father to bless her husband with those things that would bring him true happiness, she simply replied, "I can't do it." I had anticipated this response. It is not easy to love your enemy or to do good to him. But I was hoping we could at least pray for him. I asked if we could kneel and pray that she be given the compassion, mercy, and love necessary to do so. We both took turns voicing a prayer, and after she shed a few tears she informed me she was ready to pray for her husband. She then offered a beautiful prayer for him. A remarkable change in her demeanor toward her husband was immediately obvious. This was real progress.<br><br>I ushered her into the living room and invited the husband into the family room. We repeated the same sequence of events. His initial reaction to my request was one of shocked dismay. But later, after offering a sincere prayer for his wife, his attitude and his feelings toward her changed, and some of the earlier love reappeared. I could see it in his countenance, and he could feel it in his heart.<br><br>This was our last counseling session. I think the story had a happy ending for the couple. I haven't seen them for several years, but the last time we had contact they were still happily married.<br><br>I don't know whether they ever repeated this simple exercise. But I learned a great lesson that has affected how I live my life, and I pass it on to you as my fifth suggestion:<i>"Pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."</i>Most of us probably don't like those who hate us, and, sadly, these feelings of dislike canker our souls. Amazingly, praying for our enemies reverses our feelings. Maybe the person still hates you, but that does not matter. What matters is that your heart is softened and the Spirit abides with you. Usually a change in your feelings and subsequent actions will initiate a reduction of the other person's hatred of you. Perhaps even reconciliation may occur.<br><br>Whenever I have been angry over the years with my wife, Carolyn, I kneel and pray for this good woman. She is such a kind and loving person that my anger is usually my own fault. Whatever the cause, my angry feelings are turned to increased love by sincere prayer.<br><br>On Sunday afternoon Carolyn saw me editing my remarks and asked if she could read them. She offered some insightful suggestions. Later that night, just as we were drifting off to sleep, she whispered to me, "I heard you share your experience about praying for your enemies when you taught our Jerusalem students during the Mount of the Beatitudes field trip. Since then, whenever I have been angry at you, I have prayed for you. It has worked every time."<br><br>I did not know how to respond. I did not know whether to be miffed that she had felt I'd done things that justified her anger or to be happy that she had discovered the same results that I had in applying the Savior's words. If I were miffed at her, I would have had to get out of bed and pray for her, and since I was very tired, I decided to just go to sleep a happy man. It should be no great surprise that good things come from following the teachings of the Master.<br><br>Besides this suggestion to pray for your spouse, the implication for those of you who are single is<i>to not only pray for yourself in a dating relationship but also to pray for the young man or woman in whom you are interested.</i>Pray for what is best for them, which may turn out not to be you. But that is okay. The Lord will bless you, and good things will follow. This simple action will change feelings between husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, children and parents, and neighbors and co-workers. When you are angry, when a relationship is stretched thin to the limit, sincerely pray for the person who at that moment "hates" you. It will bring a mighty miracle in your feelings and in your ability to bear affliction.<br><br>In conclusion I want to encourage you to remember the importance of marriage and family and place them first in your priorities. I want to spare you an experience similar to one I had 15 years ago.<br><br>Our family was sharing a Christmas afternoon with another family, and at some point we started playing games like Trivial Pursuit. One game was based on Freudian psychology and involved identifying dominant personality traits. My wife and three sons independently wrote their estimation of my dominant personality trait on small pieces of paper. I was confident I would be labeled by my family as "kind," "righteous," "loving," or similar positive traits.<br><br>Imagine my surprise when my wife's paper said, "Bruce is a workaholic." I thought to myself, "That ungrateful woman! The pleasant quality of life she enjoys is the fruit of my hard work." But it was Christmas, and I did not want to spoil the day, so I did not respond.<br><br>My three boys confirmed her diagnosis! One son also used the hated<i>workaholic</i>word. The other two used similar words that made it clear that in their eyes my career, profession, or work was the most important aspect of my life. At this point, even though it was Christmas, I protested a little.<br><br>One of my sons replied, "Dad, we never went on a family vacation that did not involve your work."<br><br>Again I wanted to reply: "True, but you--ungrateful son that you are--have been to Disneyland as well as to Walt Disney World, traveled to Central America, traveled Europe, visited the Holy Land, and lived two summers in a beach house on an island in the Pacific Northwest." But it was Christmas, and I did not want to be a poor sport, so I remained silent.<br><br>In the days that followed I tried to justify how I lived my life to myself. But it did not do any good. No matter how I rationalized things, my dear family felt that my career was more important to me than they were. This is not and was not true. But the fact remained that that was the impression I had given by my actions. Since that time I have tried to make my priorities more visible. I occasionally say to Carolyn on Friday morning, "I will be done teaching at noon. Would you like to go to the temple this afternoon? Or go ride around the Alpine Loop, see a movie, or visit the gardens at Thanksgiving Point?" Or, if I am really feeling expansive, "Would you like to go shopping?"<br><br>I hope during the past 15 years that somehow I have altered the perceptions of my family. They are most important to me. I share this experience in the hope that you will be spared the anguish of confronting who you are at age 45 or 50 and being disappointed. I don't want a list of my publications or administrative positions chiseled on my headstone. Rather, I hope that the following words reflect my life: "Bruce Chadwick, a devoted husband, loving father, and humble follower of Jesus Christ."<br><br>My young friends, remember that marriage is essential to eternal life and that a good marriage and family life is crafted, not found. Please make this an important priority as you finish school and launch a career. Be courageous in seeking after an eternal partner. If you have found him or her, then work together creating an eternal relationship. This is not hard work. In fact, it is rather pleasant and will bring great joy into your life.<br><br>May God bless you in your studies at BYU. Be sure to study both the sacred and the secular. You have a great opportunity to do both here at BYU.<br><br>I bear testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, especially of the importance of eternal families. I share this testimony in His name, Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Bruce A.

<h1>or&#039;s Example in Doing the Father&#039;s Will - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is a privilege for me to speak to you this morning. I would like to begin my remarks by showing you two pictures. One of these has already been shown during a devotional several months ago, but it is so remarkable I hope you won't mind if I show it again. The image is called by astronomers "the Hubble Deep Field," and it is the deepest picture of the universe ever taken. Every swirl of light in this photograph is a galaxy containing billions of stars. Although it only covers a portion of the sky equal to a grain of sand held at arm's length, scientists can count more than 1,500 galaxies in the deep field image.<br><br>Now I wish to show you another picture that is quite different from the first. It is a photograph of my grandson Joshua. Joshua, born prematurely, weighed just three pounds and seven ounces at birth. This picture was taken through the window of his isolette at the hospital. He is grasping the finger of his father.<br><br>What is the connection between these two pictures?<br><br>In 1 Nephi 11:16, Nephi was asked the question "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" Nephi was then shown the birth of the Savior. In a wonderful essay on the question asked of Nephi, Dennis Rasmussen of the BYU Philosophy Department wrote, "The hands that made the world and hung the stars in the sky were now just large enough to grasp a mother's finger" (in<i>The Lord's Question: Thoughts on the Life of Response</i>[Provo: Keter Foundation, 1985], 60). And so when I look at these two images together, I gain a new perspective on the question "Knowest thou the condescension of God?"<br><br>Today I wish to speak of a particular aspect of the Savior's life, of a particular example He set for us. I refer to His desire to do the Father's will in all things. In speaking about the divinity of the Savior, President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>The entire ministry of the Master was characterized by His voluntary subordination to His Heavenly Father's will. "For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me" (John 6:38).</i>[In "Five Marks of the Divinity of Jesus Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 2001, 11; from a fireside address given at the University of Utah Special Events Center on 9 December 1979]<br><br>This scripture comes from the book of John, and, indeed, doing the Father's will is one of the themes of the book of John. Let us look at just the references in chapter 8:<br><br><i>For I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. . . .</i><br><br><i>I speak that which I have seen with my Father. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . But I honour my Father.</i>[John 8:16, 19, 28, 38, 42, 49]<br><br>Thus, in this one chapter there are six references to the Savior doing and teaching only what He has learned from His Father. Now I wish to discuss a very particular instance of the Savior following the Father's will. But before I do so, I will digress and mention a nongospel example that I hope will be helpful.<br><br>Several years ago I read an account of what was referred to as the Mount Everest Disaster. The account tells how several groups, made up of more than 20 people, attempted to climb to the top of the mountain on the same day in 1996. On their descent from the summit, exhausted and out of oxygen, the groups were engulfed in a blinding snowstorm that created windchill in excess of 100 degrees below zero. Ultimately, eight died. In the preface to a chapter where the author talked of actions and decisions that seem to the reader cruel or uncaring or selfish, the author quoted the following:<br><br><i>I distrust summaries, any kind of gliding through time, any too great a claim that one is in control of what one recounts; I think someone who claims to understand but is obviously calm, someone who claims to write with emotion recollected in tranquillity, is a fool and a liar. To understand is to tremble.</i>[Jon Krakauer, quoting Harold Brodkey from "Manipulations," in<i>Into Thin Air</i>(New York: Villard Books, 1997), 217]<br><br>I want to hang onto the phrase "to understand is to tremble," for I think it applies to the situation we will discuss.<br><br>That situation, and the particular instance I wish to discuss, is when the Savior accomplished the Atonement--specifically, the night in the Garden of Gethsemane. In discussing this, I feel we are treading on sacred ground, and we need to metaphorically "remove our shoes." I desire to speak with the utmost reverence. I don't wish to focus on the doctrinal aspects of the Atonement as much as on what it was like for the Savior to do it. Sometimes I think about the offering by the Savior in the following way: Of course the Savior accomplished the Atonement--after all, He is the Firstborn of the Father, a member of the Godhead, the only one without sin, and the Creator with the Father of the heavens and earth. All of this is true. But in so thinking I feel I am not recognizing what it cost--I fail to appreciate, to understand, and to tremble.<br><br>That is, on one hand, we recognize the Savior as a person of perfect integrity who committed to undertake the Atonement in the premortal existence. And, indeed, so sure was this commitment that for thousands of years people repented and were baptized and took advantage of the Atonement as if it had already occurred. And yet, on the other hand, we need to understand how difficult it was to keep that commitment. "The mortal mind fails to fathom," continued President Benson, "the tongue cannot express, the pen of man cannot describe the breadth, the depth, or height of the suffering of our Lord--nor His infinite love for us" ("Five Marks of the Divinity," 12). He was not compelled to take upon Himself this burden. He did so voluntarily. And as He made that choice, what was it like for Him?<br><br>The references in the scriptures are quite brief--about four verses each in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They challenge us to understand. Let us read from Luke:<br><br><i>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</i><br><br><i>Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</i><br><br><i>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</i><br><br><i>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and he sweat as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</i>[JST Luke 22:41–44]<br><br>The accounts in the New Testament are secondhand accounts, written by others. In surely one of the most remarkable verses in all of scripture, in Doctrine and Covenants 19:18, the Savior Himself told us what it was like:<br><br><i>Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink.</i><br><br>In all of these accounts we are told the Savior asked if it were possible that this cup be taken from Him. But this request was always followed with an affirmation of His desire to do the Father's will. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has written:<br><br><i>In the extremity of his suffering, Jesus beseeched the Father to take the cup from Him "if it be possible" (Matthew 26:39). The agony--though anticipated by Him from premortal times--apparently was so much worse than even Jesus had imagined. . . . "Nevertheless," said the ever-submissive Savior, "not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39).</i>[<i>"Not My Will, But Thine"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), 46–47]<br><br>What began in Gethsemane continued at Calvary. Although I do not fully understand the ebb and flow of suffering between the garden and the cross, Elders James E. Talmage and Bruce R. McConkie indicate that the agonies of Gethsemane may have recurred during the Crucifixion (see<i>Jesus the Christ</i>[Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1916], 661; and<i>The Mortal Messiah</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979–81], 4:224–26). I find significant the Savior's last words as given in the Joseph Smith translation of Matthew: "Father, it is finished, thy will is done" (JST Matthew 27:50).<br><br>I am profoundly impressed by the lesson we are taught here. During the most important event in all of history, when the Savior trembled and prayed that the cup might be removed, His overriding desire and freely made choice was to do the Father's will.<br><br>The Savior's submission is emphasized at another place in the scriptures. As discussed by former BYU president Jeffrey R. Holland in a devotional given on campus more than 10 years ago, we should note how the Savior introduced Himself when He appeared to the Nephites (see "The Will of the Father in All Things,"<i>Brigham Young University 1988–89 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1989], 75–84). Imagine, if you will, the drama of this scene. The cities of the Nephites have largely been destroyed in cataclysmic events. Those who have survived hear the voice of the Father declare, "Behold my Beloved Son" (3 Nephi 11:7). They see the Savior descending out of heaven. How does the Savior introduce Himself? Think of all the different names or descriptions He might have used. What did He say?<br><br><i>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world.</i><br><br><i>And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.</i>[3 Nephi 11:10–11]<br><br>What does the Savior's example mean in our lives? I have been interested to contemplate what the Savior's example means to me. Let me share three examples from my family.<br><br>Some five and a half years ago, my wife, Christina, began to experience some unusual physical symptoms. She wasn't sick, but something wasn't right. It did not seem, at the time, to be serious. Doctors began some tests. I can still clearly remember receiving a message that our physician wished to meet with both of us at eight o'clock that night in his office. I didn't know doctors made appointments for eight o'clock at night. Since I was supposed to be somewhere else at that time, I inquired if we might postpone the appointment until the next day. "No," the answer came back, we needed to meet that night. Confused and somewhat apprehensive, we kept the appointment. The doctor explained that tests showed Christina had cancer in multiple places in her body. The outlook for a cure was not promising.<br><br>Now, as have many of you, we have friends or relatives who have faced this threat. And we have tried to do what we could to help make that burden somewhat lighter. But I did not understand even the beginnings of what they went through until this happened to Christina.<br><br>That night we met with our children. We felt we should be honest with them. One daughter was so overwhelmed she ran out of the house and down the street and collapsed into the arms of a startled but compassionate neighbor.<br><br>I felt I should give Christina a blessing. We discussed with our children beforehand that receiving a blessing does not always mean the person will be healed. The result of the blessing was peace. We did not know what the outcome would be, but we felt great peace.<br><br>Christina was the only one, I believe, who slept soundly that night. With great faith she accepted the will of Heavenly Father in this matter--regardless of the outcome. Some weeks later, exploratory surgery revealed Christina did not have cancer, although she did have a serious but manageable illness. Everyone was relieved--everyone but Christina, who said she felt a deep sense of gratitude at being given more time on earth. Relief was not the emotion she felt, for, either way, she fully trusted her Heavenly Father.<br><br>The second experience I would like to discuss involves my oldest daughter, Catherine. This experience, although not as dramatic as the first, is perhaps more relevant to most of you, for it involved making a decision regarding what I call "the three Ms": choosing a major, serving a mission, and considering a proposal to marry. When Catherine was 18, she began to date a fine young man who was 24. Friendship developed into romance, and soon they were meeting every day. Catherine, who is here today, will probably blush as I mention that I sat her down one day to explain where this was heading. After all, what are fathers for? Sure enough, a proposal of marriage was made shortly after the end of her freshman year.<br><br>In this decision Catherine wanted to make the right choice, and she prayed fervently to obtain guidance. The difficulty was not so much about whether she was marrying the right person--rather it was about timing. You see, Catherine (and her father) hadn't ever thought she would marry so young. This wasn't how she had planned things. She was enjoying her experience at BYU and wanted to take advantage of all it has to offer. She anticipated participating in Study Abroad. She wondered if she might serve a mission. If she accepted this proposal, all of this would change. Why couldn't this proposal have come along a few years later? Then she would have been ready. As American author Betty Talmadge once said, "Life is what happens to you while you're making other plans."<br><br>My daughter Catherine's sense from her prayers was that accepting the proposal was the right thing for her to do. Yet it was hard. It took real faith for her to make this unplanned step. Indeed, I have noticed it is relatively easy to talk about doing Heavenly Father's will when it is someone else's life being discussed, but when it is your life, that is altogether a different matter. As a result of that decision, she went year-round at BYU to finish two years later. She did not attend Study Abroad, and she did not serve a mission. The day after her graduation she gave birth to her first child. A week later she and her husband and son moved to Los Angeles. As she looks back, Catherine knows she made the right choice, but it has still been somewhat hard for her to have her younger sisters travel or serve missions. Moving ahead in faith is not always easy.<br><br>As discussed in a devotional given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks several months ago, this experience is representative of many situations in life where things don't always happen according to the time line we would choose (see "Timing" [29 January 2002], in<i>BYU 2001–2002 Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 2002], 187–93). Indeed, although in this case events happened sooner than expected, often the reverse is true, and we endure the real trial of having patience.<br><br>The third experience involves me. Since I am the slow one in the family, this experience is more ambiguous than the other two. Some years ago I had the opportunity to make a choice about the path I would take in my career. The two choices offered to me were both good and honorable. I wanted to travel both paths, but that wasn't possible. I felt I knew which path would be best. It was a path for which I felt I was well suited and that appeared bright with opportunity. Nevertheless, I prayed to know if I was making the right decision. I was surprised at how hard it was to be open and submissive when I had a bias about what I wanted the answer to be. I did not receive a clear direction about which path to take, so I moved ahead and made the best decision I could.<br><br>Given that I was unsure what I should do, what is the point of this example? It wasn't too long after I made my decision that the path I chose--which appeared bright and promising at the time--turned dark and difficult. I lay awake many nights wondering how to address the problems before me. Just because the path I chose did not turn out as I expected does not mean it was the wrong path. In fact, just the opposite might be the case. Perhaps I learned lessons I could not have learned otherwise or I rendered service that I needed to give. But as I look back, I feel that if the same situation were to occur again--that of having to choose between two good paths--I would be less inclined to think I knew which path was best for me and less sure I knew what the future would bring. I would be, I hope, more submissive, more trusting, more open.<br><br>I reflected on this experience some months ago when in Sunday School the class discussed the ministry of President Spencer W. Kimball. I can remember as a student your age hearing President Kimball ask, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?" in reference to being prepared for the gospel to be preached to the Communist bloc countries. This was at the height of the cold war. I marveled at his faith. I doubted I would see the day this would happen. Last year, in joyful irony, I welcomed back my daughter Emily from a mission to Russia. President Kimball yearned for the gospel to go forth to all nations and peoples. You may recall that during his presidency he received a revelation extending the priesthood to all worthy males. In an area conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, President Kimball talked about the circumstances surrounding that revelation:<br><br><i>Day after day I went--and with great solemnity and seriousness--alone in the upper rooms of the temple, and there I offered my soul and offered our efforts to go forward with the program. And we wanted to do what He wanted as we talked about it to Him, and we said, "Lord, we want only what is right. We are not making any plans to be spectacularly moving. We want only the thing that Thou dost want, and we want it when You want it and not until." We met--all of the Council of the Twelve Apostles--time after time in that holy room, and finally we had the feeling and we had the impressions from the Lord, who made them very clear to us, that this is the thing to do to make the gospel universal to all worthy people.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, 1978 area conference in Johannesburg, South Africa; audiotape transcription by Alan Parkinson]<br><br>There are many lessons to learn here, but the one I wish to emphasize is the desire of President Kimball to do Heavenly Father's will and to be submissive.<br><br>The examples I have discussed have involved fairly major situations: trusting Heavenly Father in the face of serious illness and following Heavenly Father's will in making major decisions. In the Savior's life it is clear that His day-to-day actions were influenced by His desire to do His Father's will. Is this true for us also? Does a desire to do the Father's will have implications for us in the commonplace day-to-day aspects of our lives? I would submit that it does.<br><br>Striving to understand and do the Father's will is connected with what it means to go throughout each day with a prayer in your heart. Such a prayer is accompanied by a desire to be open to the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Further, as we seek Heavenly Father's will, we adopt an attitude of humility and submissiveness that helps open the door to feel those promptings.<br><br>When we direct our thoughts and desires toward our Heavenly Father, we turn ourselves outward. We focus more on helping others and on helping to build the kingdom than on ourselves. Thus we are able to lose ourselves--but, paradoxically, we are then able to find ourselves. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell has stated, "Only by aligning our wills with God's is full happiness to be found," and, "Progression toward submission confers . . . an enhanced capacity for joy" ("Swallowed Up in the Will of the Father,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 23, 24).<br><br>When we direct our desires toward our Heavenly Father, the difficulties and trials of life have a refining influence. We are not so prone to ask "Why me?" as we are "What am I to learn from this?" As we journey through our personal wilderness, trials have the effect of softening us--as they did Nephi--rather than hardening us--as they did Laman and Lemuel. As the Savior explained to Joseph Smith, "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7–8).<br><br>The topic of enduring well could be a devotional in itself. Although our time today is short, I would like to briefly mention an experience of Elder Robert D. Hales that has deeply impressed me. Elder Hales related in the October 2000 general conference that he had sought the Lord during the previous two years as he experienced intense pain associated with three major surgeries. He said:<br><br><i>On a few occasions, I told the Lord that I had surely learned the lessons to be taught and that it wouldn't be necessary for me to endure any more suffering. Such entreaties seemed to be of no avail, for it was made clear to me that this purifying process of testing was to be endured in the Lord's time and in the Lord's own way. It is one thing to teach, "Thy will be done" (Matt. 26:42). It is another to live it. I also learned that I would not be left alone to meet these trials and tribulations but that guardian angels would attend me. There were some that were near angels in the form of doctors, nurses, and most of all my sweet companion, Mary. And on occasion, when the Lord so desired, I was to be comforted with visitations of heavenly hosts that brought comfort and eternal reassurances in my time of need.</i>[Robert D. Hales, "The Covenant of Baptism: To Be in the Kingdom and of the Kingdom,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 6]<br><br>I am sobered by the thought that just as Heavenly Father sent an angel to sustain the Savior, so He might also do for us in our time of trial.<br><br>Striving to do Heavenly Father's will helps us move forward in faith. Sometimes we can be anxious about the future. I have talked with students who were fearful about getting married, raising or providing for a family, and whether they could compete in graduate school or have successful careers. But when you sense that a particular path is right for you and is acceptable to your Heavenly Father, it helps you move ahead in faith, knowing He will bless and help you. I know from personal experience that if you move ahead in faith and humility, even though the path ahead appears daunting, the Savior will "make weak things become strong unto [you]" (Ether 12:27).<br><br>Finally, as we try to do Heavenly Father's will, in ways I feel but have a difficult time articulating, I believe we open ourselves, day by day, to the sanctifying power of the Atonement (see Moroni 10:33).<br><br>In closing, I wish to express my gratitude for the Savior. He is our Exemplar in all things--in how He lived day to day and how He met the supreme challenge of His life. Though the Savior trembled, yet He was submissive and trusted in His Heavenly Father. The Savior's capacity to nurture us expanded because of what He went through in Gethsemane and at Calvary (see Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>May we appreciate and tremble as we contemplate His example and sacrifice. And may we realize that our own capacity to be like Him will grow as we are submissive and yield our will and heart to our Heavenly Father. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Alan Parkinson was a BYU professor of mechanical engineering when this devotional address was given on 14 May 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>e: The Act of Showing Respect - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful to be here with you this day, and I pray for the light of our Father in Heaven to direct my thoughts and to enlighten our minds.<br><br>I feel honored each and every day to be numbered with you here at Brigham Young University. Our university community is unlike any other community in the world. Here, in a relatively small area, there are thousands of young adults who believe in the Savior--even Jesus Christ--who live each day of their lives striving to emulate His example in an effort to become more like Him. Do you realize just how peculiar and unbelievable this must seem to the rest of the world?<br><h2><b>Arise and Shine Forth</b></h2><br>Indeed, we are a peculiar people. President Gordon B. Hinckley explained it this way:<br><br><i>Of course, we're different from the world. If the world continues to go the way it is now going, we will become even more peculiar. We will stand for truth. We will stand for right. We will stand for honesty. We will stand for virtue. We will stand for personal cleanliness. We will be more and more a peculiar people. (Miami Florida Fireside, November 17, 1996.)</i>[<i>TGBH,</i>676]<br><br>The Lord has declared, "For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth" (Deuteronomy 7:6).<br><br>In a world founded upon opposition, we, as Latter-day Saints, must distinguish ourselves among nations through our expressions of total respect toward one another, our reverence for deity, and in glorifying all that is sacred and holy. "Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations" (Doctrine and Covenants 115:5).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we are a special people unto the Lord, and we have been chosen to set a standard for the rest of the world. Today I would like to speak of a true principle that the world would deem strange or foolish: the importance of understanding and demonstrating proper reverence and respect for one another, for deity, and for all that is sacred and holy.<br><br>A concern for our lack of reverence and respect is not at all new. Let me share with you a short sermon given by President Wilford Woodruff:<br><br><i>I have heard President Young and President Taylor a great many times from this stand ask the people to keep quiet until the meeting was dismissed; but as soon as the sermon ends there are a hundred of them</i>[who]<i>rush for the doors. I do not like it. It pains me to see the President of the Church make this request, and the people pay no attention to it.</i><br><br><i>Now, in this fast age we are passing from a polite age to a very rude one in many respects. When I was a boy sixty-five years ago, and went to school, I never thought of passing a man whom I knew in the street, or a woman, without taking off my hat and making a bow. I never thought of saying "yes" or "no" to those that were placed over me. I was taught to say "yes, sir," and "no, sir"; but today it is "yes" and "no," "I will," "I won't," "I shall" and "I shan't." Now, when I see this rudeness amongst us, I sometimes wish that the spirit of the New England fathers was more among the people. But I do hope, brethren, sisters and friends, when a man stops talking and the choir rises to sing, that you will keep your seats. You can afford to do this as well as the President of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, or others who are sitting on this stand. You don't see us jump and run for the door the moment a speaker is done. The Lord is displeased with any such thing.</i>[<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), 183]<br><br>It almost sounds like President Woodruff has attended some of our BYU devotionals!<br><h2><b>Respect Is Expressed in Many Different Ways</b></h2><br>While serving a mission to the people of the Samoan Islands, I quickly learned about the importance of showing respect. The traditions of Samoa, locally known as "Fa`asamoa," are very specific as to what is correct or not correct for a given situation.<br><br>For example, when walking through a village, it is common to be invited into a person's home to rest and share a meal. A person will call to you from their home (and I do not mean on a telephone), and there is a special way that this is done. In return, the prospective guest knows the proper way to politely refuse or accept this invitation. If accepted, footwear is first removed before entering the person's home or "fale." Then, before casual conversation begins, formal speeches are exchanged. In each speech a person's position within the community and also their appropriate rank or title within the Samoan system of chiefs are recognized. Each person present in the home and their status within the village is acknowledged, beginning with the highest chief and concluding with the children. There is a special way to do this. Every person must be knowledgeable of this procedure in order to function appropriately within the village. In addition, a special form of language is employed during these speeches-dev. Words are selected carefully. This "chief's language" accords due respect to the recipients of the speech, and the knowledge thereof brings respect in turn to the person who articulates it correctly.<br><br>Here at home in the United States we also have many simple practices whereby we demonstrate respect for one another, an office, or a position. For example, when a woman walks into a room of seated men, they commonly stand to acknowledge her. We are also taught from a very early age that it is polite to first knock on the door of someone's home before entering. And when we are being addressed by another, we know the importance of turning our attention away from other distractions to focus on the person speaking to us. We have learned to open doors for one another. In many communities of our southern United States, individuals address their elders as "Sir" and "Ma'am." We address the president of the United States as "Mr. President."<br><br>In the Church we have also preserved particular traditions of respect. When our prophet enters a room, we show our love and respect by standing. As we worship together, the presiding authority is always offered the sacrament before the rest of the congregation. We do not refer to our Church leaders by their casual names but instead address them as "President," "Bishop," "Elder," "Brother," or "Sister." When Christ appeared in the Americas, "the whole multitude fell to the earth" (3 Nephi 11:12).<br><br>By displaying this type of respect, we are not necessarily esteeming the person. More often we are expressing respect and reverence for the position or calling they hold. In the Church these callings are considered holy and sacred.<br><h2><b>By Definition</b></h2><br>The secular world defines the word<i>respect</i>in the following manner: to "esteem," "to acknowledge the . . . integrity or worthiness of; . . . to show consideration for" (<i>Reader's Digest Illustrated Encyclopedic Dictionary,</i>1987, s.v. "respect," 1430).<i>Reverence</i>is the "act of showing respect." It is "a feeling of profound awe and respect, and often of love" (s.v. "reverence," 1435). The world and the Church do not differ on these definitions.<br><h2><b>By Commandment</b></h2><br>Through the ages men have been taught the principle of reverence through commandments. All of us are familiar with the account in Exodus of the Lord's appearance to Moses at the burning bush. When the Lord called, Moses answered, "Here am I" (Exodus 3:4). And then the Lord commanded, "Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5).<br><br>The Ten Commandments instruct us further regarding this subject: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain"; and, of course, "Honour thy father and thy mother" (Exodus 20:7, 12).<br><h2><b>Five Ways to Increase Our Reverence</b></h2><br>Today I would like to examine five suggestions for improving the ways in which we demonstrate respect.<br><h3><strong><i>1. Develop an Attitude of Reverence and Respect in Your Personal Life</i></strong></h3><br>Make a list of those things in your life that deserve your respect. Consider those people you love the most: your parents, your children, your husbands, and your wives. Consider those things that are sacred. This list should include the laws and covenants of the gospel and the holy priesthood (see<i>MD,</i>s.v. "reverence," 651). Consider the people who have been placed over you in your family, in school, in the workplace, and in the organization of our Lord's Church. Remember, it is the position, office, or calling that deserves our reverence and esteem. For example, we should always address the bishop with the title "Bishop" preceding his surname to show proper respect for his office.<br><br>In a world where we have too frequently allowed casual attitudes to dictate our dress and our language, we who are members of the Lord's church must not become casual concerning those things that we consider sacred. We cannot allow the popular fashion of improper dress and language to lead us from the "strait and narrow path" we have chosen to follow.<br><h3><strong><i>2. Avoid the Too Frequent Repetition of Sacred Names</i></strong></h3><br>Christ set this example as He prayed: "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (Matthew 6:9).<br><br>Joseph Fielding Smith taught:<br><br><i>The great lesson for us to learn, in all our preaching, writing, and conversations, is to use the titles of Deity sparingly, not with familiarity, or with lack of reverence. . . .</i><br><br><i>There is nothing that should be held in more sacred reverence and respect than the name of the Supreme Being and the name of his beloved Son, our Redeemer. . . .</i><br><br><i>Even in the preaching of the gospel, the elders of Israel should exercise great care not to repeat these sacred names too frequently and needlessly when other terms of designation will suffice.</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 195456), 1:16, 3:121]<br><br>In the revelation on priesthood given March 28, 1835, the Lord teaches us this important principle:<br><br><i>There are, in the church, two priesthoods. . . .</i><br><br><i>Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high priest.</i><br><br><i>Before his day it was called</i>the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God.<br><br><i>But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:1–4; emphasis in original]<br><h3><strong><i>3. Learn Prayer Language</i></strong></h3><br>Elder Didier of the First Quorum of the Seventy (and who, by way of interest, is personally fluent in seven languages) states that "language is of divine origin" (Charles Didier, "Language: A Divine Way of Communicating,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1979, 25). And Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught us about what he refers to as "the special language of reverence and respect." He wrote, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches its members to use special language in addressing prayers to our Father in Heaven" ("The Language of Prayer,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1993, 15).<br><br>A friend of mine recently related to me the way by which he had discovered the importance of prayer language. When he was younger he had felt a desire to speak to Heavenly Father in the same manner he would speak to his earthly father. He was very sincere as he strove to further this type of relationship with his Father in Heaven. However, with increased understanding and a few more years of wisdom--and a wife who unabashedly corrected him--his understanding of prayer language has changed. He can no longer contemplate how any individual could justify speaking to Heavenly Father--who is King of Kings--in the same fashion he or she would talk to an ordinary man.<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball taught, "In all our prayers, it is well to use the pronouns<i>thee, thou, thy,</i>and<i>thine</i>instead of<i>you, your,</i>and<i>yours</i>inasmuch as they have come to indicate respect" (<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1978], 201).<br><br>Scripture has recorded three beautiful prayers offered by the Savior during His earthly ministry. They are found in Matthew 6:9–13; John 17:1–26; and 3 Nephi 19:20–23. They are models by which we all can emulate our Savior when He prayed.<br><br>Modern revelation also gives us important instruction in prayer. If we review carefully the few prayers that we are instructed to pronounce word for word while performing such sacred ordinances as baptism and the sacrament, we will immediately recognize many of the correct principles of showing proper respect to deity.<br><br>Elder Oaks reminded us:<br><br><i>Literary excellence is not our desire. We do not advocate flowery and wordy prayers. We do not wish to be among those who "pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom." (Alma 38:13.)</i>["The Language of Prayer," 17]<br><br>However, this is not a valid excuse for not learning prayer's divine language.<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith was clear when he said:<br><br><i>The Father and the Son should always be honored in our prayers with the utmost humility and reverence. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The changing of the wording of the Bible to meet the popular language of our day, has, in the opinion of the writer and his brethren, been a great loss in the building of faith and spirituality in the minds and hearts of the people.</i>[<i>Answers to Gospel Questions</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1958), 2:15, 17]<br><br>Our Church leaders produced a special issue of the<i>Ensign</i>in January of 1976 that was dedicated to prayer (see Don E. Norton, "The Language of Formal Prayer,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1976, 44–47). It affords us tools that instruct us in the use of formal prayer language, and I encourage each of you to study its contents.<br><br>As parents, part of our stewardship is to teach our children to pray (see D&amp;amp;C 68:28). "We should give our children the privilege of learning this language by listening to their parents use it in the various prayers offered daily in our homes" (Dallin H. Oaks, "The Language of Prayer," 18).<br><h3><strong><i>4. Avoid Vain Repetitions</i></strong></h3><br>Being attentive to what we say in our prayers and testimonies is necessary to avoid the use of vain repetitions. We then are better able to carefully consider and construct the thoughts we wish to communicate (see Matthew 6:7 and 3 Nephi 13:7).<br><br>One common misuse of language among some members of the Church today often occurs as they conclude a testimony, talk, or sermon. Unthinkingly, people sometimes close by saying, "I testify of these things in the name of Thy Son." But the group being spoken to is still the congregation. This common mistake is probably due to the fact that members of the Church regularly use this phrase in their personal prayers when speaking directly to our Father in Heaven. In that case it is very appropriate. However, it is not correct usage when speaking or testifying to others. In a testimony or talk we should close with such phrases as "in the name of our Savior," "in the name of the Son," or, simply, "in the name of Jesus Christ."<br><br>The important principle here is that we become more attentive to and selective of the words we employ and not allow ourselves to use vain repetitions when speaking of deity in our testimonies and prayers.<br><br><i>5. Become Sensitive to the Whens and Wheres of Proper Behavior</i><br><br>The temple, our chapels, and our homes are sacred sanctuaries. We should treat them as such. In the Bible Dictionary we learn:<br><br><i>A temple is literally a house of the Lord, a holy sanctuary. . . . A place where the Lord may come, it is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth. Only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness.</i>[Bible Dictionary, s.v. "temple," 780–81]<br><br>President Marion G. Romney wrote:<br><br><i>Our reverence for</i>[the Lord]<i>increases as our love for him grows.</i><br><br><i>. . . When one recognizes the house in which he is meeting as the dwelling place of the Lord, whom he loves with all his heart, then it is not difficult for him to have reverence for it.</i>[Marion G. Romney, "Reverence,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1982, 3–4]<br><br>In speaking of our sacrament services, Joseph Fielding Smith said:<br><br><i>I think this is an occasion when the gospel should be presented, when we should be called upon to exercise faith, and to reflect on the mission of our Redeemer, and to spend time in the consideration of the saving principles of the gospel, and not for other purposes. Amusement, laughter, light-mindedness, are all out of place in the sacrament meetings of the Latter-day Saints. We should assemble in the spirit of prayer, of meekness, with devotion in our hearts. I know of no other place where we can gather where we should be more reflective and solemn and where more of the spirit of worship should be maintained.</i>[Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>2:342]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley observed:<br><br><i>Socializing is an important aspect of our program as a Church. We encourage the cultivation of friends with happy conversations among our people. However, these should take place in the foyer, and when we enter the chapel we should understand that we are in sacred precincts. . . .</i><br><br><i>We do not ask our people to remove their shoes when they come into the chapel. But all who come into the Lord's house should have a feeling that they are walking and standing on holy ground and that it becomes them to deport themselves accordingly.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Reverence and Morality,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1987, 45–46]<br><br>Often we just need to remind ourselves of where we are and why we are there.<br><br>Members of BYU's The Dancers Company, Living Legends, Young Ambassadors, and the International Folk Dance Ensemble had the privilege of performing in the Church's production of<i>Light of the World</i>during the recent Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympic Games. One evening at the conclusion of a special preview for a majority of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, members of the cast awaited with anticipation as the apostles approached the stage. No one instructed even the youngest members of the cast as to how they should act in the presence of these holy men. No one had to. Everyone quickly and quietly sat down. Not a word was spoken. The feelings of the Spirit were very strong and unmistakable. Love, admiration, and respect for these special witnesses of Christ filled the air. All attention was focused on Elder Packer as he addressed us. There was total concentration. No one wanted it to come to an end. When these Brethren finally did leave, the Spirit remained with us. Our behavior had changed in their presence.<br><br>I believe that if we will approach all our meetings with a desire to become one with the Holy Spirit, our feelings of the Spirit will dictate our actions, and without prior thought or instruction we will act and speak accordingly. We do change in the presence of deity.<br><h2><b>Blessings Await Us</b></h2><br>Finally, in a prayer offered at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph Smith referred to blessings that are "ordained to be poured out upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house" (D&amp;amp;C 109:21). Each one of us may be recipients of those blessings that are waiting to be poured out upon those who sincerely emulate the qualities of our Elder Brother. His actions and words define the deep respect He has for His Father. May we also learn to glorify our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ through deeds and words that are pure and undefiled.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father lives. Jesus is the Christ, and He has atoned for our sins. President Gordon B. Hinckley is a true prophet, seer, and revelator appointed to lead Christ's restored church today. We all can be partakers of the fullness of His gospel and its blessings if we will reverently continue in faith and choose to live such that the Holy Ghost will be our constant companion. Of this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Edwin G.

<h1>he Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I am so grateful for the assignment to be here with you today. I trust that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us and that I might be able to express the thoughts that are in my heart. As I have thought about what the Lord would have me say today, I have been impressed with how blessed we are as a people to be living in this day and age when the gospel of Jesus Christ and the keys of the priesthood have been restored and the Church is moving forward in such a remarkable way.<br><br>It all began on a spring day in 1820 when a young boy walked into a grove of trees to pray. That was the beginning of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days. It was through that young boy, Joseph Smith, that we learned the true nature of God and His Son, Jesus Christ. In time he brought forth the Book of Mormon. He received the priesthood from those who held it anciently. He organized Christ's church upon the earth today. He built temples so that men and women could make eternal covenants with God and enjoy the blessings of eternal life together as families.<br><br>How fitting it is that President Gordon B. Hinckley will dedicate the 113th temple of the Church in Nauvoo, Illinois--the City of Joseph--on June 27, the 158th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The temple, which is built on the original building site, will complete what Joseph left unfinished as he rode to Carthage and to martyrdom.<br><br>I am so grateful for the Prophet Joseph Smith and the role he played in helping the Lord bring about the restoration of the gospel and the establishment of the Church. I am grateful for the prophets who followed him and for our living prophets today. We sustain 15 men as prophets, seers, and revelators. President Gordon B. Hinckley holds the keys of the kingdom. He is the Lord's chief apostle on the earth today. In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord said:<br><br><i>For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.</i><br><br><i>And this ye shall know assuredly--that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 43:2–3]<br><br>God's prophet is the Lord's mouthpiece. He gives us direction and guidance.<br><br>Many people in today's world are seeking guidance and direction in their lives. A few years ago, while serving in the Philippines, I was assigned to reorganize a stake presidency in Northern Luzon. At the Sunday general session of stake conference, I asked the wife of the newly called stake president to bear her testimony.<br><br>She told of being raised in a good, religious home not of our faith but with wonderful, caring parents. She told how her father and mother would call the family together every day and read from the scriptures. As they read of the prophets of old, she asked her parents why the Lord did not have prophets on the earth today. They answered that God had spoken through the scriptures and that a prophet was no longer needed.<br><br>At the parochial schools she attended, she would ask her teachers why there were no prophets on the earth today. Again, she received the same answer. She could not understand why God would give some of His children prophets and not give them to others. When she reached college age, her parents sent her to Manila to study at one of the finest universities. She asked her instructors there the same question, and again she received the same answer.<br><br>One day while eating lunch at a small fast-food establishment near the university, she noticed two young men come in and sit down not far from her. She could see the name of Jesus Christ on the black badges that they wore. She boldly stood up and approached the young men.<br><br>She asked, "Are you ministers?"<br><br>"Yes," was their reply. "We are missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."<br><br>"Then may I ask you a question?"<br><br>"Of course," was their response.<br><br>So she asked, "Does the Lord love the people today as much as He loved the people in biblical times?"<br><br>"Yes, He does," they answered. "God loves all of His children equally. He is no respecter of persons."<br><br>"Then why does not God send prophets to us today as He did to them?"<br><br>Well, you can imagine the excitement of those two missionaries: "He does! He does! We<i>do</i>have prophets on the earth today. Can we tell you about them?"<br><br>They taught her the six discussions, her questions were answered, and within a short time she was baptized. A year later she was serving as a missionary, sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with others and telling them about the Lord's prophets. She faithfully served an honorable mission, came home, and later married the young man who had been called to serve as the new stake president.<br><br>What a blessing it is to know that a prophet of God is on the earth today. On April 6, 1830, the Church was organized, and Joseph Smith was called as the prophet. On that very day the Lord gave a revelation to the Church directing them to follow the prophet. In section 21 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i><br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:4–5]<br><br>Does it take patience and faith to follow the prophet? Of course it does. His counsel may interfere with our lifestyle. He may say things that we don't want to hear. President Marion G. Romney related the following:<br><br><i>It is an easy thing to believe in the dead prophets, but it is a greater thing to believe in the living prophets. I will give you an illustration.</i><br><br><i>One day when President Grant was living, I sat in my office across the street following a general conference. A man came over to see me, an elderly man. He was very upset about what had been said in this conference by some of the Brethren, including myself. I could tell from his speech that he came from a foreign land. After I had quieted him enough so he would listen, I said, "Why did you come to America?"</i><br><br><i>"I came here because a prophet of God told me to come."</i><br><br><i>"Who was the prophet?" I continued.</i><br><br><i>"Wilford Woodruff."</i><br><br><i>"Do you believe Wilford Woodruff was a prophet of God?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes," said he.</i><br><br><i>"Do you believe that his successor, President Lorenzo Snow, was a prophet of God?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes, I do."</i><br><br><i>"Do you believe that President Joseph F. Smith was a prophet of God?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes, sir."</i><br><br><i>Then came the "sixty-four dollar question." "Do you believe that Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God?"</i><br><br><i>His answer: "I think he ought to keep his mouth shut about old age assistance."</i><br><br><i>Now I tell you that a man in his position is on the way to apostasy. He is forfeiting his chances for eternal life. So is everyone who cannot follow the living prophet of God.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1953, 125]<br><br>After the Lord gave the Saints the commandment to follow the prophet in patience and faith, He listed the promised blessings we will receive if we keep that commandment. Continuing on in section 21, the Lord said:<br><br><i>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 21:6]<br><br>These are wonderful promises. They are especially significant in today's world when Satan has marshaled all his forces and is determined to thwart the plan of God and lead our Heavenly Father's children away into sin and despair. We are promised protection from the buffetings of Satan if we but follow the words of the prophet.<br><br>How closely do we listen to and heed his words? President Hinckley has given us counsel and direction that will bring great blessings into our lives and the fulfillment of these wonderful promises. You will remember in his last October general conference address that he expressed concern over the times in which we are living:<br><br>President Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>Life is fragile, peace is fragile, civilization itself is fragile. The economy is particularly vulnerable. We have been counseled again and again concerning self-reliance, concerning debt, concerning thrift. So many of our people are heavily in debt for things that are not entirely necessary. ... I urge you as members of this Church to get free of debt where possible and to have a little laid aside against a rainy day.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 73]<br><br>You might have thought when you heard this counsel that it was good advice for your parents or for others. But, my dear brothers and sisters, it is great counsel for you and for each one of us. Our economy<i>is</i>particularly vulnerable. Today the world in which we live is much more complex than ever before. So many external influences, as well as internal influences, affect us. No one can accurately predict what will take place in even a few months from now--let alone a few years. Consequently we must make preparations for whatever lies ahead.<br><br>Our prophet has counseled us to stay out of debt. This is a principle you need to learn, even as students here at BYU. We have been told that there are few things worth going into debt for. Some of you have needed to take out loans to pay for your schooling. This may be a necessary thing to do to get your education. In the future when you buy a home, a loan may be necessary to help you meet that need. But there are too many people who do not differentiate between wants and needs.<br><br>An article published this spring reported that "C. Britt Beemer, chairman of Charleston, S.C.–based America's Research Group, estimates that the under-30 age group has an average credit card debt of $10,000 to $12,000, up 50 percent from five years ago" (Anne D'Innocenzio, "Held Hostage by Debt,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>8 March 2002, C8.) Brothers and sisters, this is a frightening statistic. When we assume personal debt, we are gambling on our future earnings. This can be very dangerous. A poor economy, unemployment, natural disasters, illness, or other emergencies can affect our lives and make it difficult, if not impossible, to repay those debts.<br><br>A recent<i>Deseret News</i>editorial was entitled "Woeful Bankruptcy Trend." It stated that "the number of bankruptcies filed in Utah during 2001 is alarming." It is up 28 percent from the year 2000. The article stated that lax credit policies "make it easy for people to get into serious debt." Consumers are flooded with mail solicitations enticing them to use easy credit. "Unfortunately, it is far too easy for too many people to get in over their heads because of virtually unrestricted use of credit cards." This article stated that "better laws and more restrictive credit card policies are just part of the equation to reverse this trend. The real key is individual commitment. People need to discipline themselves in a way that does not put themselves financially at risk." ("Woeful Bankruptcy Trend,"<i>Deseret News,</i>19 January 2002, A8.)<br><br>President Hinckley has said:<br><br><i>I commend to you the virtues of thrift and industry. In doing so, I do not wish you to be a "tightwad," if you will pardon that expression, or to be a freeloader, or anything of the kind. But it is the labor and the thrift of people that make a nation strong</i>[and]<i>the family independent.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "Thou Shalt Not Covet,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 1990, 4]<br><br>We teach the importance of self-reliance. It is a prerequisite to service and giving. Each of us must become self-reliant before we can effectively help others.<br><br>Years ago I was on an airplane sitting by one of our small sons. The flight attendant was giving instructions. She said that in the case of an emergency an oxygen mask would automatically drop from the ceiling. She then described how to put the mask on so that oxygen would flow. Then she said something that bothered me. She said, "In case you are traveling with small children or someone who needs assistance, put on your own mask first and then proceed to help them." I thought of how much I loved my son and that I would take care of his needs before my own. Then the thought came to me, "How can you help him if you are struggling?" That taught me a great lesson of self-reliance. In order to help someone else, we ourselves must be in a position to help.<br><br>We must listen to the words of our living prophet and take care of our temporal needs. He advises us to stay out of debt, live within our means, be thrifty and industrious, and become self-reliant so that we can reach out and help others. This is good advice for each of us and will bring blessings to our lives.<br><br>President Hinckley is also concerned about our spiritual needs. He reminds us that we must be examples of honesty and integrity in all our dealings with our fellowmen. He has said:<br><br><i>In all this world there is no substitute for personal integrity. It includes honor. It includes performance. It includes keeping one's word. It includes doing what is right regardless of the circumstances.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "These Noble Pioneers,"<i>Brigham Young University 1996–97 Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1997), 178]<br><br>A few years ago, Warren Buffet, chairman of the board of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., and one of the world's wealthiest men, accepted an invitation to speak at the BYU Marriott School of Management. During a question-and-answer segment he was asked by one of the students, "What do you look for in your managers and those you hire to work for you?"<br><br>Mr. Buffet stated that he looked for three things: "First, integrity. Second, intelligence. And third, effort." Then he added, "If you don't have the first one--integrity--the other two will make no difference."<br><br>As important as it is to be honest with our fellowmen, it is even more important to be honest with our God. In Malachi we read:<br><br><i>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</i>[Malachi 3:8]<br><br>President Hinckley has told us it does not take money to pay tithing; it takes faith. He counsels us: "Pay your tithes that you may be worthy of the Lord's blessings" (Gordon B. Hinckley, "Pillars of Truth,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1994, 7). If we fail to pay our tithing, we are depriving ourselves of temple blessings.<br><br>In temples we receive the greatest blessings that can come to us from God. You can see why temple building is so important to our prophet. You can see why he pleads with us to put our spiritual lives in order so that we can receive the blessings of the temple. Only in temples can all of His faithful children receive the blessings of eternal life with God and with those they love.<br><br>One afternoon while in my office in Manila, a man came to see me. I invited him in. He had such a sweet, peaceful countenance that he almost glowed. Yet I could tell that he was a man of very humble circumstances. He told me that he lived on one of the outer islands and had come to Manila to take his family to the temple. From his pocket he pulled out a letter written to me by his district president.<br><br>The letter told of the man's faithfulness. He and his family had joined the Church four years earlier. Since that day they had worked to save enough money to go to the temple in Manila. The fare for the long boat journey seemed almost impossible for this family to save. They had hoped to go to the temple the previous year, but they hadn't been able to save enough money for the trip. Attending the temple this year was so important to them that they sold most of their worldly possessions to buy tickets for him, his wife, and their two daughters. The letter indicated that his wife was not well and asked if we could arrange to have her see a doctor while she was in Manila.<br><br>I was touched as I read of the faithfulness of this humble man and his family. I asked him where his wife and daughters were. He said that they were waiting for him outside. We went out and invited them in. He was so proud of his wife and his two beautiful teenage daughters.<br><br>I could tell that his wife was not well. When I asked about her health, she said that she was plagued by constant, severe headaches. She took off the scarf she was wearing and showed me that her hair was falling out. She said that sometimes she would pass out and fall. Then her husband spoke and said, "President, I love my wife and my daughters. I don't know what will happen to my wife. I don't know whether she will live or die." As he stopped to wipe away some tears, he looked out the window across the street to the beautiful Manila Temple. "President, this morning we were sealed as a family together in the holy temple. We don't know what the future will bring. But whatever happens, it will be okay because we now can be together forever. This is the happiest day of my life." That humble, faithful Saint from the Philippines did not know what the future might bring for him, his wife, or his family, but there was peace in his heart because of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Last year in President Hinckley's October general conference address, he said:<br><br><i>I do not know what the future holds. I do not wish to sound negative, but I wish to remind you of the warnings of scripture and the teachings of the prophets which we have had constantly before us. ...</i><br><br><i>... I do not wish to be a prophet of doom. I am optimistic. ... There is so much of the Lord's work yet to be done. We, and our children after us, must do it. ...</i><br><br><i>Are these perilous times? They are. But there is no need to fear. We can have peace in our hearts and peace in our homes.</i>["The Times in Which We Live," 73–74]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, there is no need to fear. The Lord tells us in section 38 of the Doctrine and Covenants, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30). President Hinckley is encouraging us to be prepared, both spiritually and temporally, so that we might receive all the blessings Heavenly Father has in store for His children.<br><br>How blessed we are to live in this day and this age and to have a living prophet to guide us. I want to bear solemn witness and testimony that President Gordon B. Hinckley is the Lord's prophet on the earth today. I pray that we will have faith to heed his words and follow the prophet, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sheldon F.

<h1> Mammon: Harnessing the Power of Money in the Service of Virtue - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of my colleagues recently boasted that he had won his struggle with money and no longer had any desire to be rich. But when I asked him if that meant that he had all the money he wanted, he replied: "Of course not! I'd love to have more money; lots more!"<br><br>We would all like to have more money. Indeed, our desire for it is so strong that frequently it is the determining factor in some of our most important decisions, including where to go to school, what to study, what career path to follow, where to work and live, and whom to befriend--and sometimes even whom to marry. In the extreme it may induce us to neglect weightier matters or even engage in unethical or illegal conduct. I suspect that is what the Apostle Paul had in mind when he characterized the<i>love</i>of money as "the root of all evil" and observed that those burdened by it (the<i>love</i>of money) "have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows" (1 Timothy 6:10).<br><br>Our yearning for more money in large part is fueled by the popular myth--carefully cultivated by the commercial media--that the ability to access high-quality goods and services is the measure of a happy and meaningful life. In that regard, consider the Lexus commercial that concludes with this enticing observation: "Anyone who believes that money can't buy happiness hasn't driven a Lexus."<br><br>Because our ability to access more and better goods and services is measured and limited by the amount of money at our disposal, it is not surprising that most of us believe that more money will bring us a greater sense of well-being and personal fulfillment. Of course the fallacy on which that belief is based is that the physical, psychological, and social gratification associated with material abundance is the equivalent of "the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God" (Mosiah 2:41). In the Savior's words, as recorded in Luke 12:15, "A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."<br><br>The Savior then vividly illustrated the foolishness of relying on material possessions as a source of happiness with the parable of a farmer who had been blessed with a bumper crop:<br><br><i>And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</i><br><br><i>And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</i><br><br><i>And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</i><br><br><i>But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?</i><br><br><i>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</i>[Luke 12:17–21]<br><br>The plight of this successful but misguided farmer gives new meaning to the old adage that "a fool and his money are soon parted." (Or is it "a fool and his money are some party"?)<br><br>The parable also calls to mind the old saying about the robber who confronted his victim with the demand "Your money or your life!" to which the victim responded, "Take my life. I'm saving my money for retirement."<br><br>The central message of the parable of the foolish farmer is that whereas the pursuit, accumulation, and expenditure of money may bring temporal comfort, enjoyment, and even some security, it cannot of itself produce the happiness that is the promise and end of our existence as children of a divine and eternal Heavenly Father.<br><br>The term<i>happiness</i>in the gospel sense embodies a mix of spiritual attributes that defies precise description. Attempts to identify the elements of happiness commonly allude to such qualities of being as love, joy, peace, bliss, contentment, and enlightenment. For present purposes, suffice it to say that true happiness is that profound sense of spiritual well-being that is the product of living our lives in harmony with our core values, as informed and shaped by our devotion to and desire to please God.<br><br>It follows that if we pursue and spend money to ends that contravene our gospel-based values, we will experience a sense of alienation and diminished well-being. (The negative consequences of misusing wealth have been the subject of several recent publications; see, e.g.,<i>Affluenza,</i>videorecording, prod. John de Graaf and Vivia Boe [Oley, Pennsylvania: Bullfrog Films, 1997]; Jessie H. O'Neill,<i>The Golden Ghetto: The Psychology of Affluence</i>[Center City, Minnesota: Hazelden Information and Educational Services, 1997]; Juliet B. Schor,<i>The Overspent American: Upscaling, Downshifting, and the New Consumer</i>[New York: Basic Books, 1998].) It does not follow, however, that the pursuit and expenditure of money are vain endeavors that should be eschewed in favor of more virtuous activities. On the contrary, prudent involvement in financial matters provides a rich and varied context in which gospel principles can be expressed, validated, and understood. In that sense, the accumulation and expenditure of money can at least facilitate the pursuit and attainment of true happiness.<br><br>Money has no value apart from the purposes to which it is applied. The functional essence of money is power over the development, management, consumption, and disposition of personal and community resources. If that power is exercised in a manner that enhances spiritual growth, its value as an agent for contributing to an authentic state of happiness and personal fulfillment is readily apparent.<br><br>Proper perspective is the key to pursuing and spending money to worthy ends. If we view money primarily as a means of experiencing the self-indulgent pleasures associated with consuming goods and services, we likely will save little, borrow excessively, and, in the end, find ourselves dependent on others for financial security. If we believe that having money is the proper measure of success and self-worth, we likely will pursue it obsessively, hoard it anxiously, and, in the end, curse it mournfully. In neither case will our financial endeavors yield any appreciable contribution to our spiritual growth. Consider in that regard King Solomon's reflections on his quest for personal fulfillment through pursuing pleasure and constructing grand monuments to himself and his reign: "Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit" (Ecclesiastes 2:17). King Solomon's undisciplined spending of the royal treasure brought him momentary pleasure and lasting emptiness and pain. Following the lament previously quoted, he declared: "For God giveth to a man that is<i>good in his sight</i>wisdom, and knowledge, and joy" (Ecclesiastes 2:26; emphasis added).<br><br>How can we engage the world through its principal medium of exchange and still be good in God's sight? The answer to that question is suggested by the Savior's parable of the dishonest steward found in Luke 16:1–15. The parable is about a man who was entrusted with the management of another man's wealth. His master, upon learning that the steward had violated that trust, summarily discharged him. In response the steward compounded his offense by partially forgiving his master's debtors their debts. His objective was to gain the debtors' favor so that they would "receive [him] into their houses" (verse 4). In commenting on the steward's behavior, the Savior observed that "the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light" (Luke 16:8). He then admonished His disciples to use money to make friends, "that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations" (Luke 16:9).<br><br>In admonishing His disciples to imitate the steward's shrewdness, the Savior was not condoning the steward's dishonest behavior. Rather, He simply was suggesting that although money is often acquired by dishonest means and employed to unrighteous ends, it can also be used as a means of establishing and nurturing meaningful personal relationships through which we can connect with the saving power of the gospel. Please understand, the Savior was not suggesting that we should use money to "buy friends." Nor was He implying that it is appropriate for us to take advantage of another's loneliness by feigning affection in return for financial reward. Manipulation, exploitation, and insincerity have no place in the foundation of eternal relationships. What the Lord<i>is</i>saying is that our wealth--be it meager or abundant and however acquired--is a gift from God, entrusted to us for use in blessing those who come within the sphere of our influence: "For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings" (D&amp;amp;C 104:13). As we honor that trust, we necessarily will establish and strengthen bonds of eternal fellowship, both with those who are the objects of our munificence and with the Savior Himself. And when we fail--that is, when we die and our money is no longer of any utility--they will stand as our friends to welcome us into "everlasting habitations."<br><br>Before turning to the practical significance of viewing money as an instrument of social virtue, permit me to sound a note of caution. As inhabitants of a society that extols personal gain as its defining value, we are culturally conditioned to assess the worth of ourselves and others based on financial success. To succumb to that inclination and justify doing so by paying lip service to a higher purpose is to turn principle into platitude and forfeit the opportunity to gain true riches. In the Savior's words to the covetous Pharisees, "Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God" (Luke 16:15).<br><br>To avoid money's corrupting influence, we must love only God and our fellowman and embrace only virtue as the defining and motivating force in our lives. If we do so, we will define and validate our financial objectives with reference to gospel principles. We will not spend time accumulating additional wealth if to do so will leave us insufficient time to tend to more important matters. We will strike the balance between saving and consumption that best serves our immediate and long-range gospel-based priorities. We will seize opportunities to use our wealth to enhance the personal growth and well-being of the members of our families and to address the needs of our neighbors and communities.<br><br>An essential first step in redirecting our financial endeavors to virtuous ends is to formulate a personal financial plan based on gospel principles. The gospel principles that will govern the formulation of the plan include self-reliance, gratitude, integrity, stewardship, prudence, justice, loyalty, trust, tolerance, kindness, compassion, sacrifice, and generosity. The strategic elements of a plan founded on and informed by those principles necessarily will include (1) generating sufficient disposable income to maintain a comfortable but prudent standard of living for ourselves and our families, (2) enhancing and maintaining our earning capacity through the pursuit of education and the development of good work skills and habits, (3) avoiding debt as a means of financing consumption, (4) implementing a savings and investment program to meet anticipated expenditures and provide a source of capital to compensate for our diminishing earning capacity as we age, (5) faithfully paying our tithes and offerings, (6) directing our expenditures to virtuous ends, and (7) applying our surplus resources to enhance the self-reliance and spiritual well-being of others.<br><h2><b>Maintaining a Prudent Standard of Living</b></h2><br>Our "standard of living" corresponds to the amount of goods and services we consume. Most of us strive for levels of consumption that will not only meet our basic needs for food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education but also provide us with the comforts widely enjoyed by those in the mainstream of economic life.<br><br>Wisdom, self-discipline, foresight, and moderation should be our guiding principles in establishing an appropriate standard of living. Certainly we should follow the prophet's repeated admonition to live within our means. But we should also have the foresight and self-discipline to curtail consumption to the extent necessary to pay our tithes and offerings, contribute to the material well-being of others, and accumulate sufficient savings to finance our anticipated needs and wants and protect against the risk of economic hardship.<br><h2><b>Enhancing Personal Earning Capacity</b></h2><br>Our earning capacity is based on the market value of our personal services and the quantity of our invested capital. Early in our economic life cycle, earnings from personal services represent our principal source of income. Later in life, as our physical and mental capacities wane, income from invested capital first supplements and then eventually replaces earnings from personal services as the measure of our earning capacity. Accordingly, it is imperative that we attain the level of education and develop the mix of marketable skills necessary to enable us to produce sufficient income and savings to fund both our current and anticipated needs, wants, and obligations. In the words of Benjamin Franklin: "If a man empties his purse into his head, no one can take it away from him. An investment of knowledge always pays the best interest."<br><br>Of course, if we determine that our interests and aptitudes make us unsuited to the kind of career that will sustain the level of income necessary to fund our desired standard of living, we may have no choice but to moderate our needs and wants. A higher standard of living is not worth spending our working life in a job we dislike or to which we are not well suited. To paraphrase Bob Dylan, we are successful if we get up in the morning and go to bed at night and in between do the things we want to do. As Joseph Campbell advised us: "Follow your bliss" (in<i>The Power of Myth,</i>with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers [New York: Doubleday, 1988], 148).<br><h2><b>Avoiding Debt</b></h2><br>When our income is insufficient to meet our perceived needs and wants, we may be tempted to resort to consumer debt to make up the shortfall. And it is so easy, isn't it? We are bombarded by offers of preapproved credit cards, so-called "payday loans," and financing arrangements with "zero down, no payments until next year." Rarely is it advisable to fund consumption through borrowing. Debt must be repaid<i>with interest.</i>It thus limits the borrower's ability to fund consumption in the future, and the high rates of interest associated with consumer debt significantly increase current consumption costs. In the words of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.:<br><br><i>Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1938, 103]<br><br>More recently, President Hinckley expressed alarm over the crushing debt load borne by members of the Church and concluded with the following admonition:<br><br><i>I urge you to be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1998, 72, and "To the Boys and to the Men,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, 54]<br><br>Of course, not all debt is inappropriate. Generally it is prudent to incur debt to finance our education and to develop and maintain work skills. We can also defend borrowing to finance tools and equipment, a personal automobile, and a personal residence. Of course, even when borrowing is justified in principle, prudence dictates that we should incur no more debt than we can comfortably repay and that we should pay it off as quickly as possible.<br><h2><b>Saving and Investing</b></h2><br>To ensure that there will be sufficient income from investments to replace our diminishing income from personal services, it is important to regularly save and invest a portion of our income from personal services. In formulating our savings and investment strategy, prudence should be our guiding principle. A prudent investor invests with a view toward preservation rather than speculation. He understands the relationship between risk and return and appreciates the wisdom of diversification. When presented with the prospect of high returns, he does not let greed blind him to the associated risk or induce him to invest more than is warranted.<br><br>A prudent investor also understands that past performance is not necessarily an accurate predictor of future performance. There are just too many imponderables and too much randomness in the financial markets to assume that we can accurately forecast investment results based solely on past performance. In my personal experience, the only prediction that can be made with reasonable certainty is that if<i>I</i>invest in it, the value will go down!<br><br>Some seek to justify their imprudent investment decisions on the ground that the Lord will ensure their success because of their righteous lives. I hope no one here believes that there is necessarily a direct correlation between righteousness and financial success. In an economy that is as random as it is rational and that tolerates misrepresentation, market manipulation, insider trading, and questionable accounting practices, the unrighteous will often succeed and the righteous will often fail. Although we should count whatever financial success we achieve as a blessing, we make a grave mistake if we interpret it as a sign that we have found favor with God. We likewise err if we consider financial failure a sign that we have lost favor with God.<br><h2><b>Paying Tithes and Offerings</b></h2><br>As the source of all our gifts and blessings, our Heavenly Father has first claim on our income and accumulated wealth. And yet He requires of us only tithes and offerings. Paying a full and honest tithe and generous offerings is our way of acknowledging our dependence on God for all of our sustenance. It is also an expression of trust in Him and in His promise that if we pay our tithing He will bless us.<br><br>While in graduate school, Sister Neeleman and I, like many of you today, had to make do on a very meager income--so meager, in fact, that I could not see how we could pay our tithing and stay in school. Sister Neeleman, alarmed by my faithless attitude, insisted that we counsel with the bishop. The bishop, after listening patiently to my rationalizations, made me an offer I couldn't refuse: "Pay your tithing each month, and if you don't have enough to meet your other obligations, I'll personally make up the shortfall." I readily agreed to the bishop's generous terms. But then he administered the coup de grâce: "Brother Neeleman, why are you so willing to trust me to meet your needs and so unwilling to trust the Lord?"<br><br>His words struck hard, knocking me firmly onto the path to a lifetime of tithing faithfulness. I have since learned that Bishop Goodsell's ploy did not originate with him and is commonly used by bishops to encourage reluctant tithe payers. It nevertheless serves as a constant reminder to me that paying tithing is a matter of faith and trust and has priority over all other expenditures.<br><h2><b>Spending in Pursuit of Virtue</b></h2><br>Our expenditures for goods and services have consequences beyond the immediate satisfaction of our needs and wants. To understand those consequences is to appreciate the power of money as an instrument for fostering virtue in our communities and the larger society.<br><br>In a society founded on the principles of democratic capitalism, the conscious expenditure of money often has a greater influence on formulating public policy, allocating resources, and developing and maintaining public morality than does exercising our right to vote. Consider, for example, the tremendous influence lobbyists for major corporations and trade groups have on the outcomes of elections, legislative debates, and administrative deliberations. The lobbyists' salaries are paid from coffers filled with dollars spent by us for the goods and services their corporate employers offer for sale to the consuming public. Consider also the effect our expenditures have on the allocation of resources and the content of entertainment. Companies design their products and services based on demand. If we don't like what they offer, we should simply refuse to buy. If enough of us exercise our franchise in that manner, the products and services will change to our liking.<br><br>In exercising our franchise as consumers of goods and services, we should not underestimate the power of advertising in shaping our preferences. Through sophisticated sales pitches and so-called "atmospheric techniques," purveyors of goods and services assail us with seductive messages that appeal to our vanity, our desire to belong, and our need for approval. The best defense against commercial manipulation is to pay attention to both the message and our reaction to it. Such mindfulness will not only reveal the manipulative power of advertisements and commercial programming, it will also leave us free to make our buying decisions based on principle rather than emotion.<br><h2><b>Applying Surplus Resources to Bless Others</b></h2><br>The ultimate test of our commitment to stewardship as the framework for our relationship with money is our willingness to apply our surplus in pursuit of virtuous causes. A worthy steward uses the resources entrusted to him to further the master's purposes. With respect to our financial surplus, our Heavenly Father is the Master, and His purpose is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His children. To that end He expects us to seek and seize opportunities to generously share our abundance in ways that will enhance the self-reliance and spiritual well-being first of our families, then of those who are of "the household of faith" (Galatians 6:10, D&amp;amp;C 121:45), and, finally, of others who cross our paths. All of us, in some manner and degree, have been both the benefactors and the beneficiaries of such selflessness. And in the process we have gained true and enduring friends with whom we will find place in eternal habitations.<br><br>In conclusion I direct your attention again to Luke 16. In verses 10 through 12, the Savior emphasized the relationship between the proper use of our material blessings and our prospects for eternal life:<br><br><i>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</i><br><br><i>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</i><br><br><i>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</i>[Luke 16:10–12]<br><br>The measure of our faithfulness in respect to our relationship with mammon comes down to our willingness to deal justly with our neighbor. To "deal justly" means to give each person with whom we have commerce his due as a child of God. It means giving our employer a day's work for a day's pay; it means marketing ourselves and our wares without pretense or puff; it means competing fairly and honestly; it means eschewing techniques that take advantage of a potential customer's naïveté or other vulnerability; it means paying our taxes and other obligations; it means being generous in our tithes and offerings; it means sharing our abundance with those in need, expecting nothing in return. Only if we deal with others on that basis will the Lord entrust to us "the true riches" of which He speaks. That we all may strive to that end, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Stanley D. Neeleman was a professor at the J.

<h1>l Dilemma of Doing Good - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A few years ago I awoke in the middle of the night after dreaming that I had been asked to be a speaker in a BYU devotional. In that dream the complete outline of what I was supposed to talk about was clear to me. For the first time in my life I groped in the dark for a pencil and a Post-It pad on the nightstand and wrote the title of this talk. I promptly went back to sleep. The note was barely readable the next morning, and, worst of all, the memory of the details of the talk had faded from my mind just like dreams normally do. When I told my wife about this dream and showed her the note, we joked about the unlikely possibility of ever having to give the talk. During the next few years, however, I was intrigued by the topic and occasionally jotted down notes in my journal, not really thinking that I would have this opportunity.<br><br>Elder Scott's advice to immediately write down spiritual impressions you receive is important for all of us. Imagine how much more I might have remembered had I followed the impression of my dream by not just recording the title but getting up and recording the impressions of that dream. I am eternally grateful for how patient and long-suffering our Heavenly Father is.<br><br>The title on the Post-It note was "The Moral Dilemma of Doing Good." A dilemma is defined as an argument necessitating a choice between equally unfavorable or disagreeable alternatives or any situation in which one must choose between unpleasant alternatives. A synonym for<i>dilemma</i>is<i>predicament.</i>A moral issue involves choices between right and wrong. Why might doing good present a moral dilemma? Or, in other words, why might doing good present us with potentially unfavorable consequences? If I have choices between two good things, does it really matter which I choose? Immediately upon asking this question, I think you will realize that when we are trying to do good things with our lives, then frequently these are just the choices we have to make. These are not choices between good and evil but between two or more good things. If we choose to avoid evil, it is likely that more and more of our choices will be between good things. We are so blessed as members of this great church to have so many good things to choose between.<br><br>Let me describe for you a recent situation involving good choices. I have been an advisor for several years for an extracurricular project involving mostly undergraduate students from BYU, the University of Utah, and Utah State University. They have been designing, building, and testing large hybrid rockets.<br><br>The latest rocket was scheduled to be launched September 13 of last year. Years of effort, including designing, building, and testing the various components of the rocket, had preceded this scheduled test. The events of September 11 postponed the test but gave additional time to refine details of the design and operation of the rocket.<br><br>In mid-April of this year we assembled the rocket out in the middle of the test area located in the west Utah desert area of the air force's Utah Test and Training Range. The years of planning and building, of component testing and refinement, and of repeated safety and operational evaluations to meet the air force's requirements for operation on their property had culminated in a completed rocket, detailed test and launch plans, and our being at the launch site. Every contingency had been considered and included in the launch plans. All of the procedures for preparing the rocket and launching and recovering it were in place. We assembled in the blockhouse a hundred yards from the launch site and began the countdown. The air force had three remote cameras and a tracking radar focused on the rocket, prepared to track it in its flight to the planned altitude of 10,000 feet above ground. Later, after we had demonstrated our ability to control the rocket, we hoped to launch this same rocket to an altitude of more than 100,000 feet.<br><br>The countdown proceeded: five, four, three, two, one, zero. The motor fired at zero. A cloud of dust enveloped the launch site, and we waited to see the rocket emerge and accelerate for the seven seconds the engine was supposed to burn. Seven seconds later, data was still coming from the rocket and black smoke was appearing on the video screens showing the launch site. The rocket was still sitting in place on the launch rail. Forty seconds later the engine stopped. Fire engulfed the end of the launch rail and the trailer it was sitting on.<br><br>What went wrong? Obviously, despite all of our good planning, design, and testing, there was something more that we should have done. We were not totally successful, despite all of the good work that had been done on the rocket. The air force people were very sympathetic, telling us that million-dollar programs often do the same thing.<br><br>Is the experience of our mortal probation here on earth like our rocket experience? Will we reach the end and possibly fail because we didn't do everything right, even if we tried as hard as we could to do it right? How do we make the right choices? How can we do everything we are supposed to do?<br><br>As I thought about choice and the significance of our earthly experience--this mortal experience where we are exploring our agency--Adam and Eve's experience kept coming to my mind.<br><br>The first commandment to man as recorded in Moses 2:28 was "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth." In the second commandment to Adam, God stressed the importance of agency. As recorded in Moses 3:16–17, the Lord said:<br><br><i>And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</i><br><br><i>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i><br><br>Was this a dilemma for Adam and Eve? "Thou mayest choose for thyself." What an ennobling concept that is. What a potentially frightening concept that is. If I can, or must, choose for myself, then what are the consequences of my choice? Can I choose the consequences of my choices somehow independently of my choices? As an engineer and mathematician, I do not have the luxury of independently choosing the values on both sides of an equation. This is certainly true of relationships in the world of physics or engineering. Is it also true in the world of moral relationships? I think it is.<br><br>The Lord told Adam and Eve that if they partook they should surely die. Why would they have been willing to partake--as they subsequently did--if they knew they would die? What if someone you know and trust connected two wires to a wall outlet and told you that if you grabbed one of them in each hand that you would certainly die. Your friend would tell you that, of course, you can choose for yourself. Would you be likely to grab the wires? What if someone you didn't really know told you that you would not really die but that your hair would become naturally curly if you grabbed the wires? Would you be likely to grab the wires? Evidently something more complicated than is indicated in these brief verses of scripture must have been known by Adam and Eve.<br><br>Certainly Adam and Eve understood that they had a choice and that it was not as simple as just dying if they partook. They must have understood that they could remain in the idyllic existence in the Garden of Eden if they chose. They would not be forced out, but by remaining there they would not be able to fulfill the purpose of their creation. They could continue to dress the garden and enjoy the beauties that surrounded them. But there could be no progress in becoming like God without understanding, by their own experience, the difference between good and evil. The dilemma Adam and Eve faced appears not to be a choice between good and bad. It was a choice between good things that both had unpleasant or difficult consequences. The unpleasant consequence of remaining in the Garden of Eden was that they could not become like their Father. However, choosing to experience good and evil put them in a world where there were thorns and thistles. God told them, "Because thou hast ... eaten of the fruit of the tree ... , cursed shall be the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life" (Moses 4:23).<br><br>Notice carefully that the ground was cursed for their sake. This was a blessing for them. Their world was to be one of opportunity where they could learn to exercise faith and agency. Choices had to be made between good and evil. Significantly, also, choices had to be made between good and better. How grateful we should all be that they chose wisely. Our opportunity to experience this mortal probation was a direct consequence of a correct choice in the moral dilemma Adam and Eve faced. It was a choice that our Father could not make for them without compromising their agency.<br><br>What about us? There is no doubt that we all face choices between good and evil. We have ample warning about those choices. We know clearly that it is not right to murder, to steal, to bear false witness, to abuse our bodies with drugs, or to commit adultery and many other similarly wrong things. The scriptures are replete with injunctions against these evils. Modern prophets warn us continually about these and modern-day evils like pornography on the Internet. We also receive guidance about the good choices that we should consider. Always, however, behind all of this direction is the imperative "Thou mayest choose for thyself."<br><br>We may feel like the man who approached the Savior and asked, "What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" (Matthew 19:16).<br><br>Jesus responded with an abbreviated list of the "thou shalt nots" and some "thou shalts" like we have just mentioned. The young man said that he had done all of these things and wanted to know what was lacking.<br><br>"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me" (Matthew 19:21).<br><br>We may feel that we have, from our youth up, also kept the commandments and repented appropriately when we have done something wrong, and yet we may also ask the question "What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" Then comes the dilemma. Do I need to do more good things? One good thing more and the rocket launch might have been a success.<br><br>We are not left without further counsel. Joseph Smith was commanded of the Lord, "Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided" (D&amp;amp;C 10:4).<br><br>Although this applied to Joseph's translating, it must apply also to us. There really is only so much that we can have the strength and means to do. Are we to be judged by the quantity of good that we do? Can you imagine the Savior at the Judgment Day saying that only the swift, the strong, and the powerful may enter in? No, even the little child may enter in. More significantly, the Savior expects us to come to Him as a little child:<br><br><i>Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.</i>[3 Nephi 9:22]<br><br>If it is not just the quantity of good that we do, then perhaps it is the quality of good that we do. We have all heard counsel that if we do our best then everything will be all right.<br><br>Once again, however, we are faced with a dilemma--perhaps even a moral dilemma. What does it mean to do my best? How many things can I choose to do my best at? I don't know if I have ever done my best. It seems that even when I tried to do my best that I could probably always have done just a little bit better. If doing my best is what is required, I fear I have failed.<br><br>Fortunately there is hope. Our Heavenly Father loves us and knows what we need to become like Him. A plan was prepared from before the foundation of the world. We were there when the plan was discussed, and we "shouted for joy" (Job 38:7) at the opportunities it presented to us. A world was organized where we would have the opportunity to live and experience all of the joys and sorrows of mortality and the opportunity to experience good and evil and make choices. The challenge is recorded in Abraham 3:25: "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."<br><br>A Savior was chosen who would be willing to come to earth--the Only Begotten in the Flesh, the Son of God, who would redeem us by offering a perfect, eternal sacrifice. He would take upon Himself our sins, if we would be willing to follow Him and keep His commandments. A perfect and sinless Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross at Golgotha took upon Himself the sins of all who would receive Him. This was an eternal and infinite sacrifice. It was not something that we could do for ourselves. It was done willingly and lovingly, but at such a terrible cost in pain and suffering. It was done so that we would not need to suffer so much if we would repent and follow Him.<br><br>How does that redeeming sacrifice help with the dilemma of how to do what is needed in choosing between good things to find the course we should follow? One answer that has given me great hope--an answer that has helped me understand the personal significance of Jesus' atoning sacrifice--is found in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In this section we are counseled regarding spiritual gifts. Spiritual gifts are, among other things, blessings that help us fulfill the purposes of this mortal probation. Let us consider the instruction in verse 7:<br><br><i>But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:7]<br><br>In this verse there is much to consider. We are commanded to ask. We must listen to the Spirit and do what it testifies to us. We need to walk uprightly--that is, do what we know we should be doing. We should do all that we do with prayer and thanksgiving.<br><br>Verse 8 continues: "Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given" (D&amp;amp;C 46:8).<br><br>Not only do we need to ask, listen, and do what the Spirit testifies, but we need to earnestly seek the best gifts. If we do not have these gifts then we may be deceived. I think at this point it is important to consider what "seek" might mean.<br><br>A newly returned missionary is preparing for his first date with the young woman who has so faithfully waited for him the two years he has been gone. That is how it is supposed to work, isn't it? He lives in Orem. She lives in Spanish Fork. It is time to leave to pick her up, and he can't find the car keys. Does he just "look" for them or does he "seek" for them? I think<i>seek</i>implies significantly more anxious activity than just<i>looking,</i>don't you?<br><br>Now let's read the beginning of verse 9: "For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments" (D&amp;amp;C 46:9).<br><br>I think I have a little problem here. I do love God, but I am a little unsure about how I am doing in keeping all of His commandments. I am in trouble here because although I certainly am trying to keep the commandments, I am sure that I am not doing it perfectly. If perfection or even just doing my best is required, then I fear I have failed again. As much as I would like to benefit from the gifts that I know I need if I am ever to become perfect, I am just not sure that I qualify.<br><br>The next words in verse 9, however, have helped me to understand an essential part of the Atonement and how it critically affects my life. Let me repeat the first part of the verse as well: "For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do" (D&amp;amp;C 46:9).<i>And him (or her) that seeketh so to do.</i>The Lord says that they are given for the benefit of those who love Him and keep all His commandments. That can include me, also, because I am seeking to love Him and keep all His commandments. It can include all of us when we are trying and perhaps not really even succeeding very well. We can be blessed just as if we had succeeded if we are trying. Is that what it really means?<br><br>I hope my daughter will forgive me for using her as an example. There were many mornings when I would go down to her room after calling a few times from upstairs and say, "Sherry, it's time to get up."<br><br>Her initial response would often be: "I'm trying."<br><br>It was impossible to see the slightest movement of mouth or lip or anything else. I knew, however, that she really was trying, though without any visible sign. I believe that Heavenly Father is equally understanding of our efforts. My experience, and probably yours, says that He is.<br><br>Consider how many times you have received blessings that you did not totally deserve--blessings that you had not really earned yet. It happens all the time, doesn't it? What does that mean? I believe it means that Heavenly Father and our Savior truly love us and want us to succeed. I believe it means that They will do anything to help us succeed that does not violate our agency to choose. I believe that it would be impossible for us to become perfect if we did not receive the blessings that enable us to become increasingly better. And often those blessings are necessary for us to be able to take the next steps to becoming better. I believe that those blessings help protect us from the deceptions in the world around us.<br><br>We have an important part in the process. The Lord has blessed us with the scriptures; we must search them and do what they teach us. The Lord has blessed us with a prophet; we must listen to him and do what he asks of us. We must seek and ask for the best gifts and use them to bless the lives of all around us. We must seek and strive to love God and to keep all His commandments. And we must be thankful and even rejoice in the great blessings and opportunities we receive from our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Yes, and even the rocket launch attempt wasn't really a failure because of all the good things we learned from it. How we will strive even more to get it to work!<br><br>What do we have that we can offer in return for all the good gifts of our Father in Heaven and His Son Jesus Christ? We can offer our hearts and our free will--our obedience. We can sacrifice a broken heart and a contrite spirit. The promise is that He will baptize us with fire and with the Holy Ghost. Like the Lamanites who received this blessing, we may already have this great blessing and "[know] it not" (3 Nephi 9:20).<br><br>We are loved, we are blessed--even when we have not totally earned the right to the blessings. The Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ, has made it possible for us to receive blessings that will make us worthy to return to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>We have President Gordon B. Hinckley, a prophet, to guide us. The Holy Ghost has been given to us to teach us how to resolve the moral dilemma of doing good. We can make right choices between good things. With this help we can make the righteous choices that will enable us to reach our eternal goals. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Paul F.

<h1>ide Ye in the Liberty Wherewith Ye Are Made Free&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I take my title today from D&amp;amp;C 88:86: "Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made free." I want to consider liberty for a moment, then observe how it is obtained, and, finally, look at how it is that we abide in it.<br><h2><b>Liberty Considered</b></h2><br>Liberty is essential to the Lord's plan of happiness. the scriptures we see evidence of the Lord's deep commitment to liberty. Take King Benjamin for example. He said:<br><br><i>I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</i><br><br><i>But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;</i><br><br><i>Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you--</i><br><br><i>And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne--and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</i>[Mosiah 2:10–14]<br><br>King Benjamin emphasized three forms of liberty: economic, political, and spiritual. His commitment to the economic liberty of his people was so deep that he took no wages to serve as king, neither would he impose taxes on the people. His commitment to political liberty was such that there were no political prisoners kept in dungeons, no second-class citizenry, no castes, and no slaves. His commitment to spiritual liberty was evident as well. He would not suffer any manner of wickedness, theft, or adultery. He did it all so "that there should nothing come upon [them] which was grievous to be borne." He wanted his people to be free.<br><br>You are familiar with the effect of King Benjamin's address on the people. They recognized their sins. They repented. They entered into a covenant to be obedient to God's commandments. They said, "We are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days" (Mosiah 5:5).<br><br><i>And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</i><br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i><br><br><i>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free.</i>[Mosiah 5:6–8]<br><br>King Benjamin was foreshadowing a conversation that Jesus would have years later on another continent:<br><br><i>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i><br><br><i>They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</i><br><br><i>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</i><br><br><i>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</i>[John 8:31–36]<br><br>Liberty is clearly an essential feature of the Lord's plan of happiness.<br><h2><b>Liberty Obtained</b></h2><br>How is this great economic, political, and spiritual liberty obtained?<br><br>Liberty is always<i>obtained by sacrifice.</i>Sometimes the sacrifices are palpable and sometimes they are more subtle. Nevertheless, you can always trace the reception of any liberty to a sacrifice.<br><br>Let me illustrate this by relating a part of my own family history. I do this so that it can be real to you. I asked my son when he returned from serving a mission, "What was the most important lesson you learned?"<br><br>His answer surprised me. He simply said, "People are real." He explained that every person he taught had ideographic trials and hopes and strengths and weaknesses and fears. They weren't two-dimensional images in a photograph from an exotic country. They were real.<br><br>I have snippets from census records, ship manifests, family lore, and film images with which to piece together a story of sacrifice and liberty. In an old photograph of my great-great-grandparents taken in 1905, they are surrounded by their surviving children and the fiancés of the two eldest children. They wear the typical formal clothing for a family portrait taken in 1905, with heavy fabric, high collars, and lace for the girls. The men wear stiff white shirts, collars, and heavy coats. As in most such old photographs, none of them are smiling. However, if you look closely in their eyes, you will see a peace, a hopefulness, and a sense of satisfaction.<br><br>The parents are Shulin and Pesse Blumenfeld. Morris is the eldest son with his wife-to-be, Eva. Schaindle is the eldest daughter with her husband-to-be, Morris Schreiber. Schaindle is her Yiddish name. It means "pretty girl." Schaindle was my great-grandmother. In the picture she is 19 years old with a young face, dark eyes, and thick hair piled high on her head in the mode of the day. The other children are Fanni, Mordche (whose name was Americanized to Max), Chai (whose name was Americanized to Ida), Golda, Mala (Mollie), and Bela (Belle).<br><br>Not pictured are Anna and Tobie, who would be born later, and Charlotte and Isadore, who were buried back in Botosani, Rumania.<br><br>These people were eastern European Jews who immigrated to the United States. But they did not come all at once. I have no documentation about when the eldest son, Morris, entered the country. I know far more about Schaindle and the others. Schaindle told this story, which I have only partially proven through my research. It is a story of sacrifice bearing the fruit of liberty.<br><br>When Schaindle was nine years old, she was sent to live with and work for a tailor threading needles and caring for his children. She sent her wages home. At age 16 she was sent to America with her uncle in a group of nine extended family members to work, send money back to Rumania, and prepare the way for her family to come to America. She said that they were very frightened because they didn't know if an extended family group like theirs would be allowed to enter the United States. She said she lied about her age and her name to enter. When her uncle was confronted by an immigration official who asked, "Are these all your children," he pretended not to understand. He said, "Ve are nine people." The official held them on the ship and continued to ask them questions. The only answer her uncle would give, pretending not to understand, was "Ve are nine people." Eventually the official grew tired, and, probably not seeing a threat of anarchy in a group of so obviously ignorant immigrants, he let them in. I can hear him in my imagination: "Yes, I know you are nine people. Enough already, just get off the ship. Go stand in that line." One of these days I'll ask Schaindle to tell me the whole story because I'm having a tough time documenting and triangulating the details of her entry in America. (It doesn't help genealogy research when you lie about your name and age on official documents.)<br><br>My best estimate at this point is that Schaindle entered America almost exactly 100 years ago on July 5, 1902. Schaindle immediately went to work in a sweatshop sewing clothes. After all, she had begun working for a tailor at age nine. She sent her wages home to her family in Rumania. She said that whenever she had the urge to purchase an apple, she would deny herself, take the coin the apple would have cost, place it in a jar, and add it to her total to send home to Rumania. I have documentation showing that eventually Salomon and the next oldest daughter, Fanni, entered the U.S. on February 15, 1904.<br><br>Seven months later, on September 2, 1904, Pesse arrive with Mordche, who, at 10 years old, was her helper to care for Chai (age 8), Golda (age 4), Mala (age 3), and Bela (9 months old). I was thrilled to eventually locate the ship's manifest. I didn't know them by their Yiddish names, and it was only through Golda that I eventually found them together as a group. They arrived on the steamship<i>Carpathia,</i>which you will recognize as the first ship to respond to the<i>Titanic.</i><br><br>Imagine Pesse's 10-day voyage in the steerage of the<i>Carpathia</i>with five children ranging in age from nine months to 10 years old. Imagine Pesse's anxiety as she sent her eldest children and her husband to America. The baby Bela had just been born when Shulin began his trip to America. Any mishap along the way could have left her alone in Botosani with five mouths to feed and a 10-year-old boy to earn their daily bread. But the promise of liberty was so great that risks had to be taken and sacrifices had to be made.<br><br>Eventually they were all united in Chicago in late 1904. In 1905 the portrait was taken. When I look at Shulin and Pesse surrounded by<br><br>all their surviving children, I sense the greatest relief, peace, hopefulness, and satisfaction. What a travail it must have been! A course of self-sacrifice by many members of the family made it possible for this simple portrait to be taken. I imagine all the ways it could have gone awry through accident, iceberg, persecution, or bigotry. The risks and sacrifices obtained liberty for all of the children and eventually for me. If they hadn't obtained this liberty, imagine what would have been their course living in eastern Europe as Jews in the first half of the 20th century. But of course that is hypothesis contrary to fact. They did sacrifice and obtain liberty. I inherited this liberty from them, and I am grateful.<br><br>We have found Shulin's family on both the 1910 and 1920 censuses. In 1910, Schaindle and Morris and their two children were living with Shulin and Pesse in a group of 13 people in a Yiddish neighborhood in Chicago. The census records that Shulin was a peddler, and his product was listed as "rags." He and Pesse spoke only Yiddish. He could read and write, but Pesse could not.<br><br>Two of the older children, Max and Ida, were listed as working in a tailor shop. Max could neither read nor write, but Ida could. They all labored to support the extended family. Ten years later, on January 7, 1920, the family was enumerated on the next census. The household had shrunk to nine. Max was dead, having never married. He died in 1919 at age 24 or 25. Golda and her husband were living with Shulin and Pesse. They had a two-month-old baby named Max.<br><br>As I studied the census record, I pieced together a probable story. I suspect that Max probably died in the influenza epidemic that ravaged America from 1918 to 1919. Living in close quarters spread the disease quickly. I imagine how many other members of the family were fevered and near death. I imagine Golda, pregnant and cramped in a small tenement, fearful for her coming baby and for her family. In January 1920 the baby was two months old, and they named him Max. It is typical of Yiddish families to name children after a dead relative who was beloved. Mordche, called Max, was the big brother, the 10-year-old helper from across the ocean, the presser in a tailor shop who never married whose wages were contributed to supplement the earnings of a father who spoke only Yiddish and peddled rags for a living. Mordche, who never learned to read or write, who never enjoyed the blessings of education but who cared for the family, had died in 1919, and Golda, six years younger, delivered her baby safely and named him Max as a memorial to her beloved older brother who had sacrificed so much to care for his father's family.<br><br>Schaindle and Mordche sacrificed for the sake of liberty. Look at how far-reaching have been the benefits of their sacrifices. For example, while my ancestors toiled under very limited education, I have been blessed by their sacrifices and have received an excellent education and serve as a faculty member at a precious university. I am grateful.<br><br>One wonders what the limits are to people's sacrifices. Is there a sacrifice that has the greatest cost and the greatest effect on liberty?<br><h2><b>The Great and Last Sacrifice</b></h2><br>Amulek was poignantly aware of this question. He taught:<br><br><i>And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</i><br><br><i>For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</i><br><br><i>For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice....</i><br><br><i>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</i>[Alma 34:8–10, 14]<br><br>What is the effect of that great and last sacrifice? What liberty is obtained by that sacrifice? In the BYU sculpture garden there is a piece entitled<i>The Grave Hath No Victory</i>by Franz Johansen. It is an image of the Resurrection. Inscribed at the base of the sculpture, quietly hidden, is the scripture from Romans 6:5: "We shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection." Also at the base are found small flowers emerging from the rock, alive and growing out of dead stone. The image is of a body arising from the earth. The body is partially wrapped in burial windings. The death clothes made of gauze are unraveling and slipping to the earth as life is being restored to a powerful body.<br><br>This sculpture is an infinite art form in many ways. I love to observe how the light and shadows change on it from day to day and from hour to hour. The positive and negative spaces change as one circumnavigates it. In fact, if you walk around this sculpture, the body seems to elevate slowly in space. I invite you to take a moment in the garden to walk around the sculpture and see it move through space.<br><br>The scriptures teach us that "the dead had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage" (D&amp;amp;C 138:50). At the time when the Savior's own body lay in the tomb, His spirit visited the spirits who had been faithful in mortality. Joseph F. Smith reported:<br><br><i>As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.</i><br><br><i>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality;</i><br><br><i>And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.</i><br><br><i>All these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection, through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.</i><br><br><i>They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death.</i><br><br><i>Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy.</i><br><br><i>While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138:11–18]<br><br>The Savior declared universal liberty through resurrection. As Paul indeed testified, "we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection." For myself and my beloved ancestors, to be liberated from death is an amazing blessing that flows from that great and last sacrifice. It is given as a free gift to all of God's children who pass through mortality. This is not an abstraction. Schaindle will be resurrected. Good, dutiful Mordche will be resurrected. These are not two-dimensional photographs. People are real. They are real people with hopes and fears and sorrows and joys. They currently experience the long separation of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage.<br><br>The prophet Jacob spoke of liberation from two forms of death:<br><br><i>O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.</i><br><br><i>And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.</i><br><br><i>And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.</i>[2 Nephi 9:10–12]<br><br>Liberation from sin through repentance also depends on that great and last sacrifice. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ we can be liberated from sin on condition of repentance. There is no greater liberation. As Jesus said, "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed" (John 8:36).<br><h2><b>Abide Ye in Liberty</b></h2><br>Once liberty is obtained, how do we abide in it?<i>We abide in liberty by keeping our covenants.</i>Moral agency and obedience are integrated in the process of covenant. You might hear people argue that either obedience or agency have primacy in the Lord's plan and that one supersedes the other. Indeed, both agency and obedience are crucial aspects of the Lord's plan of happiness. However, the putative tension between them is resolved by the transcendent term<i>covenant.</i>Under the rubric of covenant, agency and obedience are integrated into a peaceful whole. I think that is why the gospel of Jesus Christ is sometimes referred to as the new and everlasting covenant of the gospel. It was the Father's plan from the beginning that agency and obedience should be integrated under covenant. If Lucifer presented a plan to the Father that separated agency and obedience, he was creating a false dichotomy and presenting a false dilemma. To choose either, while excluding the other, would lead to failure of the plan. Lucifer was a liar from the beginning, and such a logical trap was characteristic of his sophistry. I don't think that Jesus articulated an alternative plan that emphasized agency over obedience. To do so would be to accept Lucifer's false dilemma. I believe the Father's plan integrated both agency and obedience under the rubric of covenant. And the covenant depended on a great and last sacrifice and an infinite atonement.<br><br>We maintain our liberty by keeping our covenants. As we read in Mosiah:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i><br><br><i>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</i>[Mosiah 5:7–8]<br><br>By our covenant at baptism and our covenants in the temple, we, of our own free will, choose to obey. And in doing so, we are kept free.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>It seems apparent to me that liberty is a central feature of the Lord's plan of happiness. It seems evident that liberty is obtained by sacrifice. It seems that liberty is maintained by covenant. These are nice abstractions, but what about the real people? There is a promise I need to keep. As Shulin and Pesse and Mordche and Schaindle are real people who made sacrifices in mortality--the fruits of which I enjoy--I can reciprocate by making a sacrifice that will provide liberty to them. I made a promise to those people before this mortality that if they would come and prepare the way for me, then when I obtained the knowledge of the gospel I would search them out and perform vicarious ordinances that would liberate them. It is incumbent on all of us who have received the great treasures of the gospel to provide its blessings to our ancestors.<br><br>I bear witness that we are liberated from death and hell through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Our Savior was resurrected, and we will be, too. We can be freed from sin. And if the Son makes us free, we shall be free indeed. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Lane Fischer was the dean of students at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 2 July 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Bear Reproof? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In the summer of 1971 I was an undergraduate here at BYU and had been home from a mission for less than a year. I was in school and working hard in classes and at a part-time job.<br><br>I was assigned by my elders quorum president to home teach several people that summer.<br><br>My companion and I began contacting our people, two of whom were not much involved in the Church at the time. One of these was an attractive young lady who lived alone in a basement apartment. She seldom attended Sunday meetings and didn't "do appointments" with home teachers. She would talk to us if we happened to catch her at her apartment. It usually took several attempts each month to connect with her. As the weeks passed, we made a special effort to get to know her. I think she was beginning to trust us, and even like us. She was becoming less evasive and guarded.<br><br>She was an interesting and engaging person. Attractive and witty, she held her own in conversation. She resisted being anyone's service project and telegraphed just enough cynicism and mistrust to keep herself isolated from the well-intentioned. I sensed that she had been injured by people she had trusted the most and that her edginess and cynical humor were worn for self-protection. I was beginning to take on this relationship as a personal challenge, and I'll admit that I was beginning to enjoy the challenge.<br><br>One day, walking alone past her apartment on my way to campus, I decided to stop and knock on her door and see if I could catch her at home. I had some pretext for stopping. I don't remember what it was, but it was enough of an excuse to make the call seem comfortable. No one answered the door, so I went on my way.<br><br>A few days later I was in the company of my brother, Gene, who was serving in the bishopric of the same ward I was attending. He had just extended a calling to me in an interview and we were visiting for a few minutes before his next appointment. He asked me about my home teaching assignments and particularly how our efforts were going at helping this young lady. I mentioned casually that I had recently stopped by her place on my way to the campus but hadn't found her home.<br><br>At that moment the expression on my brother's face changed visibly. He looked carefully at me, put his hand on my forearm, and with that voice and expression I had come to know so well--the voice of the older brother--he said, "Michael, don't ever, ever go over there on your own. Don't risk being alone with her by yourself. Take your companion or call one of your quorum leaders or call me, but don't go alone."<br><br>I nodded and mumbled something like "fine" or "okay" and changed the subject to something that would let me quickly end the conversation. I ended it and left. I don't know to this day if my brother heard the edge in my voice or noticed that I was suddenly very turned off. I was eager to get out of there and to get away from him. I was mad. He had given me some very direct counsel, and I had chosen, in an instant--as we so often choose on those occasions--to take offense.<br><br>Looking back on it, my reaction embarrasses me. It is very clear to me now why I was so offended. This response from my brother had cut me to the quick. He had felt impressed to tell me in that moment exactly what I most needed to hear. He had spoken the truth in love and courage, and I had retreated in resentment to sulk.<br><br>Ironically, his uninvited counsel worked. I followed his advice, and I was a lot more careful about home teaching and lot of other things throughout the rest of that summer. The effectiveness and care of my service improved. I don't have much to report about the other events of that season. The summer passed quietly with no drama and no heartbreak. By the way, that young lady moved from the ward at the end of the summer feeling better about her relationship with the Lord and with His church.<br><br>I truly believe now that through that one moment of unsolicited warning, delivered by an inspired messenger, I had been rescued from a temptation I was beginning to caress in my mind and heart.<br><br>But I rewarded my rescuer with a cold shoulder for several days afterward.<br><br>A cold shoulder and the resentment of another are often the reward for speaking the truth in love and courage. But that speaking out and reaching out are what great and inspired people do. My brother had put up a guardrail for me to glance off of. I was close to an edge that I did not see--or did not want to see.<br><br>As Elder Maxwell says:<br><br><i>To withhold deserved reproof</i>[as my brother might have done to avoid embarrassment or discomfort to both of us]<i>may be to withhold a warning that is urgently needed. Reproof is often a last railing before an erring individual goes over the edge of the cliff.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell, "Insights from My Life,"<i>1976 Devotional Speeches of the Year</i>(Provo: BYU, 1977), 192]<br><br>That conversation with my brother had triggered a very natural reaction in me--the reaction of the natural man. Again, Elder Maxwell describes this natural response with surgical precision:<br><br><i>Behold the natural man! Selfish, impatient, short-tempered, easily offended, unforgiving, proud, envious, covetous, carnal, and drenched in ego! No wonder he is to be "put off."</i>[<i>That Ye May Believe</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1992), 18]<br><br>I can be grateful that my brother did not put off his prompting to issue a warning. He had handled his end of the process much better than I had.<br><br>This, brothers and sisters, is my theme today: Who will give loving and wise reproof, and who will bear it with meekness?<br><br>I know this theme is not among the sentimental favorites of LDS audiences or of any other audience that I can imagine. It certainly doesn't "market well," as we say in the Marriott School. But I feel a need to say that this theme of giving and bearing reproof has been at the very heart of my own labors to become a disciple of the Master lover and reprover of the human family.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith described this duty as integral to his calling as prophet and dispensation head. He said:<br><br><i>I frequently rebuke and admonish my brethren, and that because I love them, not because I wish to incur their displeasure, or mar their happiness. . . . But these rebukes and admonitions become necessary, from the perverseness of the brethren, for their temporal as well as spiritual welfare. They actually constitute a part of the duties of my station and calling.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:478]<br><br>In another place Joseph talked about the effects of an inspired reproof. It can purge the bad motives and double-mindedness out of the one reproved--if there's enough humility and good sense there to take the licking and be better for it. If not, everything gets suddenly worse, and dark motives turn black.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph said, "When a corrupt man is chastised he gets angry and will not endure it" (<i>Teachings,</i>195). He also said:<br><br><i>A frank and open rebuke provoketh a good man to emulation; and in the hour of trouble he will be your best friend; but on the other hand, it will draw out all the corruptions of corrupt hearts, and lying and the poison of asps is under their tongues; and they do cause the pure in heart to be cast into prison, because they want them out of their way.</i>[Joseph Smith,<i>HC</i>3:295]<br><br>That principle sobers me. At the moment of that reproof I received many years ago, I wanted my brother out of the way--or, at least, I wanted to be out of the way of my brother. Laman, I'm sure, often wanted to be out of the way of Nephi, until he could stand his presence no longer, and then he was convinced he<i>had</i>to have Nephi out of the way.<br><br>Joseph also gives us this haunting insight about one who absolutely refused to bear a reproof from the Savior: "Judas was rebuked and immediately betrayed his Lord into the hands of His enemies, because Satan entered into him" (<i>Teachings,</i>67).<br><br>Somewhere, Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, "Pride grows in the human heart like fat on the body of a pig." Pride, and the prickliness that accompanies it, can insulate us from the things we most need to learn.<br><br>I spend a lot of time with my graduate students in the Marriott School. The nature of some of the courses I teach requires that I evaluate the students, and they evaluate each other on their performance as writers and presenters of ideas and proposals. Most of them seem to take this feedback with a good heart. Some even express gratitude that someone--anyone--has paid enough attention to their efforts to give them a specific, detailed assessment. A few--not many--seem to say to me and others, "If you have anything to say to me other than 'That was great' or 'It could not be better,' please keep it to yourself. I just do A's and success. I don't do the other stuff." These people, with all their talent, are asking either to be flattered or left alone.<br><br>Isaiah said it well, didn't he:<br><br><i>This is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord:</i><br><br><i>Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.</i>[Isaiah 30:9–ndash;10]<br><br>Now, something must be said about giving reproof: when and how. We cannot script this process. There are no rules, only a few principles. We should give correction far less often than we give commendation and praise. Praise should come often, and it should be specific and concrete. Praise is a way of saying to another, "I'm looking at you. I'm observing you, and I like what I see." When our praise is abstract or general, or if it is shoveled out indiscriminately, it loses its power and becomes flattery.<br><br>On those rare occasions when we take up a chastening rod, or offer even a mild caution, we have to be in possession of a lot of other things to go with the chastening. Among these is what President Young called "the healing balm" (<i>JD</i>9:125). He said: "If you are ever called upon to chasten a person, never chasten beyond the balm you have within you to bind up" (<i>JD</i>9:124–ndash;25).<br><br>I have been in situations where I felt a person needed a gentle correction, but I wasn't in good enough shape to give it: not enough love, not enough charity or commitment toward the other person; not enough trust in the bank to have earned the right. No, in those situations silence or a listening ear is the safest response.<br><br>President Kimball was a man who spoke the truth in love. His love was, in fact, legendary among the Saints. In Elder Bruce Hafen's recently published biography of Elder Neal A. Maxwell, he mentions an encounter a young Neal Maxwell had while sitting on the stand next to President Kimball in a sacrament meeting. President Kimball turned to him and said, "Do you know that I love you with all of my heart?" Seeing Elder Maxwell again a few days later, President Kimball asked, "Do you remember what I said to you last week?" (in Bruce C. Hafen,<i>A Disciple's Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2002], 422). This is love showing later an increase of love. It is water in the desert, and it melts the human heart.<br><br>President Kimball said once:<br><br><i>Because Jesus loved his followers, he was able to level with them, to be candid and forthright with them. He reproved Peter at times because he loved him, and Peter, being a great man, was able to grow from this reproof. . . .</i><br><br><i>Jesus saw sin as wrong but also was able to see sin as springing from deep and unmet needs on the part of the sinner. This permitted him to condemn the sin without condemning the individual. We can show forth our love for others even when we are called upon to correct them. We need to be able to look deeply enough into the lives of others to see the basic causes for their failures and shortcomings.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>481–ndash;82]<br><br>I have noticed over the years that some of the most challenging corrections and cautions come to our local Church leaders from the Brethren. When the Saints sit in stake conference sessions, they are often praised and encouraged by these great men--and rightly so. We need the encouragement and confidence of our leaders. But the Saints don't often hear the more candid and rigorous conversations the Brethren hold with our local leaders in private.<br><br>I read not long ago a passage in a book by Elder Gene R. Cook of the First Quorum of the Seventy that illustrates this process very well. In fact, I am bold enough to say that this experience shared by Elder Cook is the most unnerving account of correction and challenge issued by a contemporary Church leader that I have ever heard of. It is unnerving because it is the kind of counsel that could be given to many of us--you and me--in our own callings. I have read it time and again, almost haunted by the question "How would I have responded in this situation?" We may smile as we read about the blistering reproofs of a Brigham Young. We don't have to respond to those reproofs because they were not directed toward us.<br><br>But reproofs and corrections are still meted out by inspired leaders. They are given out of inspiration, not ego or impatience. And when they come, we are bound to respond in meekness and submissiveness. Here is Elder Cook's account of one such correction.<br><br><i>At a stake conference I was amazed at the number of worthy young men who had not been on a mission, even though they were of age. There were so many at the conference that I had them stand up. Seventy-six of them stood. I was overwhelmed. And I wondered in my heart, where are our leaders?</i><br><br><i>After the conference I called a special meeting of the stake presidency and bishops. When we were finished I left them with a challenge: "Brethren, I'd like to ask you to interview every one of those young men, all seventy-six of them. Talk to them in the Spirit of the Lord and invite them to respond to his call. Please get back to me in a couple of months and give me a report on each one."</i><br><br><i>About six weeks later, the stake president came to me with a report. He said, "Elder Cook, we've completed every one of the interviews."</i><br><br><i>"That's great," I responded. "How many are going on missions?"</i><br><br><i>He paused. He was pleased that all the young people had been interviewed, but he didn't want to tell me how the interviews had turned out. Finally he said, "Well, there are three or four. And there are five or six others who will probably go next year."</i><br><br>Elder Cook then wrote:<br><br><i>I prayed. What should I say? Then I felt that the Lord wanted me to speak boldly, and I said, "President, I can come to only one of two conclusions."</i><br><br><i>"What's that?" he asked.</i><br><br><i>I said, "It may be that this is the most unworthy, unresponsive group of young people I've ever met."</i><br><br><i>He shook his head. "No, that's not right, Elder Cook. These are great young people."</i><br><br><i>"I know they are. I visited with a number of them at the conference."</i><br><br><i>We talked about the youth for a few moments, and then he said, "What's the other conclusion?"</i><br><br><i>I said, "I guess this one has to be true then, if the other one was false."</i><br><br><i>"And what is that?"</i>[the president asked.]<br><br><i>I would never have answered him if the Lord hadn't directed me to, but I could tell it was important that I be very forthright. I said, "I guess I've found the most ineffective group of priesthood leaders I've ever met." And I didn't crack a smile.</i><br><br>Let me interrupt Elder Cook's narrative with a question: How do you think you would have handled this if you had been in the shoes of that stake president? The natural man might have said any number of things, such as "Well, I'd like to point out that my counselors and I feel we are doing the very best we can. We don't make other people's decisions for them. We have invited these young men to serve. They have their agency, and I think we have to honor their choices to go or not go on missions."<br><br>Or another natural reaction might be to hide one's sense of hurt and offense and say something like "Well, maybe you<i>have</i>found an ineffective stake president" and then retreat to sulk in silence and resentment.<br><br>Now let's return to Elder Cook's account and hear the rest of the story:<br><br><i>The stake president took it hard, and I knew he would. But the bottom line was that he needed it. He was not acting as humbly as he should have. He had gone out and operated like a man, and that's why he got the results he did.</i><br><br><i>As we concluded the interview, I put my arms around him and I loved him. We knelt and prayed together. Then I bore my witness to him: "President, you go out now and act in the authority of God, and he will respond. You go into the homes of those young men and kneel down and pray with them. You ask each one to explain to the Lord in your presence why he can't go on a mission. Then if the Lord says he doesn't have to go, it's okay with me. But if the Lord says he has to, then tell the boy to be honorable enough and get on with it." We agreed we'd meet in another six weeks and he would give me another report.</i><br><br><i>After the meeting I called his regional representative and said, "I just had this difficult meeting with President So-and-so. I'm sure he's feeling pretty low. Will you go to him and strengthen and bless him?"</i><br><br><i>Six weeks later this stake president came back with his report. Here's what he said:</i><br><br><i>"Brother Cook, I went out of your office terribly offended. I was humiliated and angry. I stewed for a whole week. During that whole time, I was absolutely miserable.</i><br><br><i>"Finally I mentioned it to my wife. She heard me out, and then said, 'My dear, I don't want to offend you either, but a servant of the Lord talked to you and I feel a burning in me that tells me he spoke for the Lord. He's only asking you to go and talk to them again. Quit fighting it. Do it.'</i><br><br><i>"I knew she was right. For the first time I humbled myself and desired to do it the Lord's way. We knelt and prayed together, and a great power came over me. I felt I could do anything, even move a mountain, and I said, 'I will go and do it without further excuse.'"</i><br><br><i>So he went out and, with the help of his bishops, began to interview these young men again. After six weeks he had interviewed twenty-seven men. Twenty-five of them had agreed to go on missions and were filling out their papers. Prayer had softened his heart and enabled him to go forth, and prayer softened the hearts of the young men, that they would respond.</i>[Gene R. Cook,<i>Receiving Answers to Our Prayers</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996), 113–ndash;15]<br><br>I have no idea who that stake president is or where he is. But you will believe me when I say that I revere him. I am awed and touched by his humility and his courage, just as I am awed by the courage of Elder Cook, who spoke the inspired truth--the sharp, diamond-edged truth that in one pivotal moment called a man to do the work of a ministering angel. Notice how Elder Cook described the stake president's initial effort: "He had gone out and operated like a man, and that's why he got the results he did." Most of us would have left a man to operate like a man, or a woman like a woman. Elder Cook pursued a more courageous path.<br><br>Can we, in our sphere, walk that same path? Can we speak, as Samuel the Lamanite did and as Elder Cook did, and say "whatsoever things should come into [our] heart[s]" (Helaman 13:3)? Each day as I walk into the Tanner Building on this campus, I wonder, "What conversations will I have today? What people will I encounter?" On most days I have the sense to pray that my thoughts will be the Lord's thoughts and my words the Lord's words. Isn't it stunning to realize how much of our behavior is verbal behavior? Most human action takes the form of talking and listening. These conversations, even casual ones, are not to be taken too casually. Inspired lines from a hymn I love capture the thought:<br><br><i>By a whisper sow we blessings;</i><br><i>By a breath we scatter strife.</i><br><i>In our words and thoughts and actions</i><br><i>Lie the seeds of death and life.</i><br>["We are Sowing,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 216]<br><br>This inspired level of performance is required not just of general authorities and stake presidents. You and I are called to drink from the same cup. We have within our own sphere of influence just as sacred a duty to seek and speak the truth in love and courage and to submit in meekness to inspired counsel.<br><br>May we be among those who give and receive counsel and commendation as moved upon by the Spirit of Him who knows and loves us best. I pray this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Michael P.

<h1>n the Wall - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. It's good to be with you. I consider it a rare privilege to be invited to speak at a BYU devotional. It has been some years since I last had this opportunity, and, realizing that it will likely not come again, I have struggled in an unusual way for guidance in selecting a subject and developing some thoughts that would do justice to your being here this morning. My prayers and pleadings have been many.<br><br>It seems to me that our needs and interests change as we pass through the different seasons of our life. As I have grown older and have experienced many of the needs that are common to every season, I have come to realize that each period has its own different and unique challenges.<br><br>I have also come to understand that there are many, many good things that matter in life and that as each one is pursued, our joy and happiness will increase. But because we can't do every needed thing all at once, we often get frustrated with our performance as we try to pick and choose our particular course of action. We often speak of "coming unto Christ," but we are not always sure just what that means or the path to pursue or the process we should follow. There are so many good choices to be made.<br><br>I have found the greatest challenge in life--regardless of the season you are in--is to find those things that really matter the most and put them on center stage in our lives and concentrate on their development. As we do this, unnumbered and unusual blessings begin to unfold.<br><br>When the most important things are attended to first, then all else that is really important in life will fall appropriately into place.<br><br>Most of us are busy doing a host of things that do matter in our lives; however, some of them are being done at the expense of other efforts that are even more important. The weightier matters are too often set aside to be attended to later. I have also found out that often the issues we face are not always decisions between right or wrong; they can be and often are between two right choices.<br><br>So first I will address the question of what does matter the most. To begin with, I would like to visit with those of you who have become discouraged in your personal prayers--the ones you say when no one else is listening. I'd like to visit with those of you who have stopped praying or who don't pray as frequently or as fervently as you once did. Perhaps you find it difficult to pray because you aren't sure the Lord is listening; maybe you aren't sure He is even there; or maybe you feel guilty or unworthy. But whatever the reason, your communication isn't what it ought to be--or what you would like it to be.<br><br>Have you ever knelt down alone and asked the Lord for something that is really important to you and then found that your prayer wasn't answered as you had hoped? I have. Have you ever prayed and prayed for days and days for something special, and then found that it didn't work out the way you had wanted? I have. In times past, on more than a few occasions, I have gotten up off my knees and wondered in despair, "What's the use? He isn't even listening," or "Maybe I just don't understand the signals."<br><br>A few years ago, after one such frustrating experience in prayer, I was reflecting on my experiences with my earthly father, who has been gone several years now. I remembered that when he was alive I could always go to him and talk to him about anything and he would listen to me. Even when I had made a mistake or had done something wrong he would listen. My dad was not a perfect man--though nearly so--but he would listen every time. Surely a perfect Father in Heaven would also listen--every time.<br><br>I want you to know that I know that whenever one of Heavenly Father's children kneels and talks to Him, He listens. I know this as well as I know anything in this world: Heavenly Father does listen to every prayer from His children. I know our prayers ascend to heaven. No matter what we may have done wrong, He listens to us. He hears our pleadings and cries for help.<br><br>Now I also believe He answers us. Often we forget that His timetable for answering and ours are not always the same. I do not believe He ignores His children when they talk to Him. Often the problem in our communication with the Lord is that not all of us have learned how to listen for His answers--or perhaps we are not prepared to hear Him. I believe we receive His answers as we prepare ourselves to receive them.<br><br>Now let me explain this to you. Last month my wife and I went to the beautiful Lake District in northern England. There we saw some of the greenest lush meadows and hillsides in the world. They were very picturesque, with scores of white sheep contentedly grazing there. On these rolling hills we could see miles and miles of stone walls made of rock of all sizes and shapes--all held together without mortar. They looked like outlines in a giant puzzle. The walls were placed there hundreds of years ago, built by sheepherders to separate their flocks and to identify their lands. We marveled at them.<br><br>As we go through life, some of us build a similar rock wall, as it were, between ourselves and heaven. This wall is usually made up of our uncorrected mistakes or of unrepented sins. For example, in our wall there may be stones of many different sizes and shapes. There could be stones placed there because we have been unkind to someone. Criticism of leaders or teachers may add another stone. A lack of forgiveness of others may place another. Vulgar thoughts and actions may deposit some rather large rocks in this wall. You may be sure dishonesty will set one in place, selfishness another, and so on. If we are not careful, this wall will develop into a very formidable barrier.<br><br>In spite of the wall we may have built between us and our Heavenly Father, our heartfelt cries do get through. However, when He sends His messages back to us, His inspiration often cannot penetrate this wall we have built around our hearts, and we suffer. We may even say, "He doesn't hear" or "He doesn't answer" or "He doesn't really care."<br><br>One of our greatest challenges in life is to destroy this wall stone by stone--or, if you please, to cleanse ourselves, to purify this inner vessel so that we can be in tune and receive His answers to our petitions for help.<br><br>We must also keep in mind that often He uses others as His helpers in taking care of our needs and answering our prayers. I have found that even at times when a great effort has been made toward cleansing and purifying this inner vessel, it is still possible on occasion to be frustrated in our efforts to communicate with heaven. I have learned much from my study of section 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The Lord's instruction to Oliver Cowdery is so clear as Oliver attempted to translate the Book of Mormon. Remember what the Lord told him:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7–9]<br><br>On more than a few occasions I have put these instructions to the test and have had an abundance of positive experiences in the answers I have received. However, there have been those few times when I have drawn a complete blank. On those occasions it seemed that no matter which side of an issue I submitted for confirmation, I would get neither a positive nor a negative feeling. I couldn't figure it out nor understand why. Then some years ago I received a startling personal revelation. I was reading from one of President Brigham Young's talks found in the<i>Journal of Discourses.</i>Here was the answer I had been praying for. It let me know I was not left alone in my request for help:<br><br><i>If I ask Him to give me wisdom concerning any requirement in life, or in regard to my own course, or that of my friends, my family, my children, or those that I preside over, and get no answer from Him, and then do the very best that my judgment will teach me, He is bound to own and honor that transaction, and He will do so to all intents and purposes.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:205]<br><br>So now I think I understand the process better than I did before. When I have studied it out in my mind and fervently prayed over the issue and still do not get the positive or negative feeling that I am looking for, then I just go ahead, using the best judgment my mind and heart can give me, and I have the assurance that the Lord will stand behind me and support me in the decision.<br><br>Now I would like to tell you some of my feelings about removing a couple of the larger stones that may be in your wall of spiritual resistance.<br><br>I suppose we have all had someone do something to us or say something to us that we didn't like, that made us angry. We can't forget it--and we may not even want to forget it. In other words, we are unforgiving. The Lord has had some very strong words to say to those of us who will not forgive one another. Remember those words in Doctrine and Covenants 64:8–10:<br><br><i>My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.</i><br><br><i>I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.</i><br><br>Many years ago I had one of my experiences in being unforgiving. I felt I had been taken advantage of, and I did not like the person. I did not want to be around him. I wouldn't talk to him unless I absolutely had to. Long after the issue should have been closed, it was still cankering my soul.<br><br>One day my wife--who is very astute and knows how to read me--said, "You don't like so-and-so, do you?"<br><br>"No, I don't," I said, "but how could you tell?"<br><br>"Well, your feelings show when you are around him. It's in your countenance. It shows. Why don't you do something about it?" she asked.<br><br>"Like what?" I asked.<br><br>"Why don't you pray about it?"<br><br>I said, "Well, I did pray, and I still don't like him."<br><br>"No," she replied, "why don't you<i>really</i>pray about it?"<br><br>I thought, "How do you<i>really</i>pray about something?" Then I began to think, and I knew what she meant. So I decided that I was going to pray for a better feeling about this person until I had one. My spiritual life was on the line.<br><br>That night I got on my knees and prayed and tried to open up my heart to the Lord. But when I got up I still didn't care for that person. The next morning I knelt and prayed and tried again to have a feeling of goodness toward him, but when I finished, I didn't feel any different. This process continued for several weeks, with the same negative result. Every night and every morning I prayed, but finally I noticed that my prayers had turned to pleadings. I have found that pleading raises prayer to another level. It happens when you really open up your heart to the Lord and let Him see the real intent and purpose of your petition to Him--a petition based on a deep love for the Lord as well as for each one of His children.<br><br>I don't remember a specific time that it happened, but I do know that the time finally came when I knew that if I were asked to, I could stand before the Lord and, at least in this instance, He would find that I had a forgiving heart.<br><br>The stone of unforgiveness needs to be removed by all of us. If it happens to be there, I suggest that persistent prayer and even pleading might be a way to remove it.<br><br>One of the stones that presents a very real problem for many is unworthy and unclean thoughts. Many are the stones that are placed in the wall between us and heaven because of vulgar thoughts and actions.<br><br>Remember the words of Moroni 10:30: "And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing."<br><br>The very devil and the father of all lies has slyly and slowly lowered the social norms of morality to a tragic and destructive level. In magazines and books, on CDs and tapes, on our television, computer, and theater screens is portrayed more and more often a lifestyle that might even rival the excesses of those who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah. The screens, music, printed materials, etc., are filled with a profusion of sex, nudity, vulgarity, and foul language.<br><br>One of the great tragedies is that too many of us are watching and listening to this type of so-called entertainment. Some do it only casually at first. They think they are spiritually strong and will be immune to its influence. This trash is nothing more nor less than a gateway to pornography--one of the master deceiver's most effective products.<br><br>Part of the tragedy I speak of is that many do not recognize they are trapped or soon will be. Unfortunately I fear even some within the sound of my voice have an addiction and do not realize it. They see this as a form of entertainment that serves as a relief from the troubles of the day. In reality it is only relieving them of their spirituality and their capacity to draw on the powers of heaven in times of need.<br><br>We must come to understand fully the consequences of having an appetite for such trash. None of us here today can look at, read about, or listen to such explicit vulgarity, even in its mildest form, without bringing sorrow to a loving God and a terrible injury to one's own spirit. We cannot look at or listen to these unholy depictions without suffering the consequences--and those consequences are very real.<br><br>We must remember that our rewards for righteous living are only partially enjoyed in this mortal life. Likewise, our miseries for breaking the commandments of God will not all be realized fully as we live here on earth. Eternity is a long, long time.<br><br>Remember, our mind is a wonderful instrument. It will record and keep whatever we put into it: both trash and beauty. When we see or hear anything filthy or vulgar, whatever the source, our mind records it, and as it makes the filthy record, beauty and clean thoughts are pushed into the background. The brightness of hope and faith in Christ begin to fade and, more and more, turmoil and discontent become our companions. We are not as happy as we used to be. We find less peace and contentedness in our hearts and in our homes. We do things that later we wish we had not done.<br><br>Now, if you have this problem we speak of, if imbedded in the wall are desires or habits that keep heaven-sent messages from entering your heart, let me give you hope and help.<br><br>You may need to go to your spouse, your parents, or your bishop for help. Most certainly each of us must go to the Lord. Stopping the activity and cleansing the spirit of the impurities of which we have been speaking will not be easy, and it will not be quick, but it can be sure. Let me repeat something I have said before:<br><br>The secret of cleansing the spirit of impurities is not very complicated. It begins with sincere, heartfelt prayer every morning and ends with prayer every night. This is the most important step I know in the process. It may simply be a prayer for strength to turn from bad habits or a prayer that sin will be distasteful to you.<br><br>Meanwhile, remember that not all prayers are answered the same day or even the next day. Sometimes it takes a long time. But with this step securely in place, I have seen hundreds of miracles take place. Without it, there is continued frustration, unhappiness, ineffectiveness, and despair. If you have tried and have given up, I plead with you to try again and again and again. Our Heavenly Father will not forsake your efforts if you sincerely persist. (See H. Burke Peterson, "Purify Our Minds and Spirits,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, 39; "Purify Your Thoughts,"<i>Brigham Young University 1983–84 Fireside and Devotional Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1984], 21; "Clean Thoughts, Pure Lives,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1984, 73; and "Touch Not the Evil Gift, Nor the Unclean Thing,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1993, 43–44.)<br><br>In closing, I testify to you, my dear friends and brothers and sisters, that there is a God in heaven who knows you, who loves you, and who will help you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>H.

<h1>and the Pure Love of Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In response to a lawyer's question, "Who is my neighbour?" Christ told the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:29–37). I'm sure you remember the story of the man who was robbed, stripped of his clothing, beaten, and left half dead by the side of the road to Jericho. Both a priest and a Levite saw the man but ignored his need, passing by on the other side of the road. Finally a man from Samaria stopped to help. Now, what was the difference between the three men--the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan? They were all men of good intention and subscribed to a similar moral code. What motivated the Samaritan differently?<br><br>The priest had a very important responsibility as a mediator between the people and God. He was, by definition, close to God, whereas the people, because of their sins and infirmities, were distant from God. Perhaps he wished in this case to distance himself from the man, thus not polluting his priestly role. The Levite was probably a temple worker and may have been late for his shift. He wouldn't have had time to stop. We don't know the occupation of the Samaritan. We do know, however, that Samaritans were regarded as inferior and were despised by the Jews. Christ emphasized that the response of the Samaritan was motivated by "compassion" (Luke 10:33). Perhaps that compassion came from the Samaritan's own experience of being ignored and mistreated. He must have known something of what that half-dead man by the side of the road was feeling. We call such regard for another person's feelings empathy. I believe empathy was the motivating force behind the Samaritan's charitable actions.<br><br>Empathy has been a key factor in my own emotional and spiritual growth, as well as my professional success as a social worker. Within the context of empathy, my profession has made me a better Christian, and my spiritual values have made me a better professional. This morning I would like to share a little about my understanding of the importance of empathy and discuss four ways in which we can enhance our ability to feel and convey empathy.<br><br>As an introduction to my topic, allow me to share an important childhood memory. I was sitting on a bench with other children waiting for Primary to start. (I must have been about four or five years of age.) Admiring the brand-new shoes I was wearing for the first time that day, I was not bashful about sharing my pleasure with the other children. Helene Jones (I still remember her name) could take only so much bragging. She finally responded, "We don't like new shoes. We like our old shoes." What a shock that was for me. How could anyone not like new shoes? Then it occurred to me that my new shoes looked different through Helene's eyes than they did through mine--a lesson in empathy. I was forced to borrow Helene's lenses and ask myself how I would feel if she were bragging about her new shoes to me.<br><br>Harper Lee elaborated on this lesson in the book<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>In this story an inexperienced teacher punishes Jean Louise, or Scout, unfairly on the first day of school. That evening, Scout's father, Atticus, explains empathy to her:<br><br><i>If you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.</i>[Harper Lee,<i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>(1960; reprint, New York: Warner Books, 1982), 30]<br><br>1.<i>Empathy is enhanced by borrowing different lenses through which to view circumstances or events--seeing things from different perspectives.</i>As a visual aid, I brought along a map of the world. Can you find the United States? There is something familiar about this map, but it doesn't look quite right, does it? Australia is not supposed to be at the top. Let's turn the map around. Does that look more familiar? When my Australian friends first introduced me to an upside-down map of the world, it was an interesting realization for me that the directions north and south and up and down on the map were simply arbitrary decisions made by someone many centuries ago. Maps or pictures look different depending upon your orientation--your perspective.<br><br>Now, let's go back to the story of the good Samaritan. I'm wondering how that picture of the man by the side of the road looked different to the Samaritan than to the priest and the Levite. The priest and the Levite were probably focused on something else--they hardly noticed the man. But the Samaritan viewed that scene through lenses colored or cleansed by his own painful learning experiences. He saw the pain and was compelled to act.<br><br>Because of our unique set of personal experiences, we have been conditioned to look at people from different perspectives. We could all be looking at the same person. Some of us would see the background. Others would see the clothing the person is wearing. And some would notice the facial expression and imagine what the person might be thinking or feeling. I am reminded of God's admonition to Samuel in the Old Testament: "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).<br><br>Empathy is looking on the heart--a deep understanding of the feelings of others. Empathy should not be confused with sympathy, which is sharing the same feeling. In professional counseling we don't want too much sympathy because it takes away our objectivity and our ability to be useful. An example of sympathy that is not useful is a husband who has morning sickness along with his pregnant wife. (I have been told it does happen on occasion.) This husband has a perfect understanding of what his wife is experiencing because he shares the feeling--he is sick, too, but he is in no condition to be useful in helping her while she is sick. Social workers must understand and respond to the breadth and depth of all kinds of feelings while remaining objective and able to help.<br><br>As a social work educator I try to be like Atticus Finch. I teach my students that they cannot help a client unless they have a good understanding of how that client feels. So we work in class at developing the skill of empathy. We practice identifying feelings by asking ourselves, "If I were in that situation, how would I feel?" Then we practice conveying that understanding by verbalizing the acknowledgement "You must be feeling mad, sad, glad, angry, etc."<br><br>There is nothing quite like the feeling of being completely understood by another person. In fact, feeling understood may be more important to a client than getting specific help in resolving a problem or accomplishing a task.<br><br>In supervising my students'beginning experiences as professional counselors, I find a common theme. Inexperienced counselors generally focus prematurely on identifying and solving the client's problem--such as failing grades, failing relationships, substance abuse, etc. These student counselors often come to supervision sessions frustrated--wondering why they can't get the client to recognize the problem, accept responsibility, or be motivated to change. As the student and I watch the videotape of the counseling session together, I find myself asking the same question over and over again: "What do you think the client is feeling right now?" As these novice counselors become more sensitized to the feelings of their clients and acquire skills in conveying that understanding with empathetic responses, we usually see progress. We find that the clients--even those with the most profound problems--have remarkable ability and motivation to change and to solve their own problems once they really feel understood.<br><br>I need to insert a caveat here: There is much more to professional counseling than simply conveying empathy. However, without empathy, you don't get very far.<br><br>Understanding with depth and sensitivity how another person might feel is not easy. You have to be able to relate to experiences in your own life to imagine another person's feelings. For example, I am fascinated by the Lord's directive to the Israelites in Exodus 23:9: "Thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." The Lord used the principle of empathy in teaching the children of Israel, even when they were not ready for the higher law introduced later by Christ.<br><br>2.<i>Empathy is enhanced by valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others.</i>We don't have to have the same life events to feel the same feelings, but we do have to have experiences in our lives that teach us about the range of feelings. Our personal experiences that make us feel afraid, excited, frustrated, or angry become our teachers and give us tools to connect to other people.<br><br>As a professional counselor I learned that I could use my own personal experiences to not only feel empathy for my clients but also to provide perspective (different lenses through which to view the world) to help my clients see beyond failure, anger, or fear to the possibility of hope and resolution. Let me illustrate by sharing one useful experience.<br><br>Many years ago, when I was a little thinner and more physically fit, I completed a 30-day wilderness survival course. During the third week of that extraordinarily rigorous experience, we were left in groups of four or five students (without an instructor) and expected to find our way from one point on a topographical map to another point (a distance of about 50 miles). After two days of trudging through the snow in the tops of the Henry Mountains in southern Utah and getting lost on several occasions as we made our way down into the valley, my companions and I were extremely grateful on the third day to be able to identify our location with certainty. We arrived at a stream in the middle of a beautiful meadow. All we had to do was follow this river to our rendezvous point. It would be impossible for us to get lost again. So we gleefully walked along the riverbank, stopping occasionally to enjoy the scenery. The river was wide, slow, and shallow. When we chose to switch to the other side, it was easy to cross the stream by jumping from rock to rock. There came a time, however, when there was no bank. What started out as a grassy meadow had become something of a canyon. As I kept jumping from rock to rock, I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my boots dry. I hate wet boots!"<br><br>The stream was still slow, wide, and shallow, and when there wasn't a rock to jump to, it was a relief to find out that I could walk on flat sandstone with the water only a few inches deep. The water still would not get inside my boots. But after an hour or so of this kind of careful walking, the canyon became narrower, and there was no place to walk without getting my boots wet--inside and out. We were not interested in turning around and finding another route to the rendezvous point. We had spent too much time and energy getting this far, so we bravely continued with water just above our knees. I remember thinking, "If only I can keep my pack dry. It would really be a disaster if all my clothes and my blanket got wet." Fortunately the water was quite clear, and I was able to see where to walk in order to stay in the shallower parts of the river. After an hour or two of this kind of progress, I noticed that the canyon was becoming even narrower, and the inevitable happened--there was no shallow spot. We still were determined to press forward rather than backtrack, even though the bottom half of my pack was now drenched. Then, after another hour or so of carefully making my way in chest-high water, I took a step and felt nothing beneath my feet. My thoughts had evolved from "if only I can keep my boots dry" to "if only I can keep my pack dry" to "if only I can stay alive!" I paddled desperately for about 50 feet or so. And, finally, there was a welcome sight--a break in the canyon wall and a sandy bank. We climbed out of the water and examined our packs. Everything was soaked! We made a fire, and as I sat there drying myself, my clothes, and everything in my pack, I felt only gratitude. I remember reflecting on what a waste of time it had been to worry about getting my boots wet.<br><br>Now, having had that experience and other similar experiences, I can respond to a client with empathy. I can say, metaphorically, "I can see that you don't like to get your boots wet" or "You're worried about getting your pack wet" or "You must be afraid you are about to drown." I know what it feels like to be afraid you are going to drown. But even though I have empathy for my client's feelings, I won't share my client's anxiety because I also have a vision of that client sitting on the bank by a fire (metaphorically speaking) and feeling only gratitude.<br><br>I have learned over the years that empathy is important for everyone, not just professional counselors. Empathy is an essential ingredient for all positive interpersonal relationships. If we couldn't at least imagine what it feels like to be in someone else's shoes or skin, we wouldn't be able to connect; we would live our lives in isolation. Empathy is the skill or characteristic that makes it possible for us to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (see Matthew 19:19). It is empathy we demonstrate when we "bear one another's burdens," "mourn with those that mourn . . . , and comfort those that stand in need of comfort"--as taught by Alma (Mosiah 18:8–9).<br><br>3.<i>Empathy is enhanced and demonstrated by reaching out to others, by focusing on their unique feelings and needs.</i>For example, let's assume that your roommate shares with you the bad news that he or she received a failing grade in a chemistry exam. You may be tempted to convey empathy by sharing your own experience of failure. You could say, "I know exactly how you feel. I got a bad grade in physics once." Although you mean well, your roommate may not interpret your sharing as empathy--at least not initially--because you are focusing on your experience rather than on the experience and feelings of your roommate.<br><br>Some of you may have difficulty feeling empathy for such a roommate because you have always been straight-A students. You don't know what it feels like to receive a failing grade. I suspect, however, that you know what it feels like to experience personal failure. You could say to your roommate, "Yeah, I feel for you. I remember when I got a B in English lit." Needless to say, that comment will also not be interpreted as empathy. Empathy is more than just reaching out to others; it is reaching out by focusing on others'unique feelings and needs. So you might convey empathy to this roommate by remembering the feelings you felt when you got that B or D, and, instead of focusing on your experience, saying something like "You must really feel discouraged." With that simple acknowledgment you have opened the door to a meaningful conversation. At some point in that conversation you will probably share your personal experience of disappointment or failure, but the focus will be on your roommate's need rather than on your need to share.<br><br>I cannot address the subject of reaching out to others without quoting my favorite social worker, King Benjamin, whose directives are consistent with the parable of the good Samaritan:<br><br><i>Ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain. . . .</i><br><br><i>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just--</i><br><br><i>But I say unto you . . . , whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent . . . and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>For behold, are we not all beggars?</i>[Mosiah 4:16–19]<br><br>By imagining ourselves in the shoes or skin of the beggar, we can reach out appropriately--not just to appease our guilt but to do our part, whatever that part may be. Through empathy we will know exactly what that beggar needs. It might be cash or it might simply be a smile or a kind word. It might be a bowl of soup in the nearest restaurant. It might be information about needed resources. And, in a few cases, it will involve ignoring the begging in order to not reinforce inappropriate behavior.<br><br>4.<i>Empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of others'feelings.</i>Christ's ministry gave new meaning to the word<i>empathy.</i>The empathy we typically try to practice is consistent with the commandment Christ gave at the beginning of His ministry: "Love thy neighbour as thyself" (Matthew 19:19). But at the end of His ministry, after He had provided an example, His new commandment was "Love one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34). Christlike love is much more than understanding the feelings of another person. To love as Christ loves requires a perspective that surpasses our mortal ability; that is, we must share the vision and perspective of Christ. Thus empathy is enhanced by praying for the understanding of others'feelings that comes only through Christ.<br><br>A number of years ago I struggled through a difficult marriage and a painful divorce. My husband had broken his temple covenants and betrayed me. But he would continue as the father of my children, and I didn't want a miserable, adversarial relationship indefinitely. So I made it a matter of prayer. I said something like this: "Heavenly Father, I know you love all your children, so I know you love my husband. Help me to feel about him the same way you feel about him." The result was something of a miracle. The Lord couldn't answer my desperate plea to help my husband change--no amount of faith will take away another person's agency. But the Lord could take away my bitterness and help me feel empathy for my husband--not empathy in the sense that I could relate to his feelings completely, but empathy for him as a son of God. I knew that Christ had all the feelings of a tender parent for my husband, regardless of his behavior. The resulting empathy has made my life much easier.<br><br>"Love thy neighbour as thyself" is a commandment, not a suggestion. And Jesus'instruction to "love one another; as I have loved you" is also a commandment. As disciples of Christ we accept this higher mandate. My take-home message today is that we enhance our ability to obey both of these commandments by enhancing our ability to feel and convey empathy. I challenge each of us to increase our empathy by (1) borrowing different lenses for viewing other people, (2) valuing our own life experiences and using them to help us understand the feelings of others, (3) courageously reaching out to others--focusing on their unique feelings and needs, and (4) praying for the understanding of others'feelings that comes only through Christ. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Elaine Walton was the director of the BYU School of Social Work when this devotional address was given on 30 July 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
Sister Virginia U. Jensen, then first counselor in the general Relief Society presidency, spoke to the Faculty Women's Association at BYU in January of this year. She recalled the first time she had to give a talk in the Tabernacle on Temple Square. She noted that she had never had a desire to speak in the Tabernacle. I guess that is how I feel about my experience today. I have never really wanted to give a devotional speech at BYU. I take heart in the promise given in 1 Corinthians 2:3: "And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."<br><br>I want to begin by telling you a pioneer story. Clara Matilda Erickson was born on November 21, 1868, in Julita, Södermanland, Sweden. Her father, Karl Erickson, was a farm laborer at that time, but later he became a builder and carpenter. The family consisted of five children. Amanda Charlotta, the oldest child, died at the age of three years, and Emil, the youngest, died during his first year of life.<br><br>Herman H. Sundström was born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1860 and baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Copenhagen by Elder Andrew Jenson in 1880. Herman was called as a missionary to the Stockholm conference two months later. He was arrested in April 1882 and sent in chains to prison, where he was incarcerated for 19 days, tried on various charges, and then set free. In 1883 Elder Sundström was sent to Eskilstuna, where he baptized Clara Matilda Erickson and her family. It is further noted that he was responsible for baptizing 55 people, selling books to the value of 642 kronor, and traveling on foot about 10,000 miles.<sup>1</sup>He was released from his mission in 1884 and emigrated to Salt Lake City.<br><br>Clara left Sweden in 1889 at the age of 19, the only one of her family to come to the United States. She traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark, boarded a Church-sponsored steamship, and crossed the North Sea, arriving at Hull, England. She took a train from Hull to Liverpool and boarded the ship<i>Wyoming,</i>joining other Saints from the British Isles. She traveled second-class and landed in New York. The entire voyage took about six weeks. She was sick the whole trip. She took the train from New York to Salt Lake City. She never returned to Sweden and never saw her family again.<br><br>Clara met Carl Erik Hoaglund in 1891, and they were married. They had three children, two boys and a girl. Carl became sick with consumption (now known as tuberculosis). He wasn't able to work, so Clara did washing and ironing to support the family. Carl died in 1898.<br><br>In 1903 friends introduced Clara to Carl John Anderson. They were married that same year. They had four children, one daughter and three sons. Carl had been married previously. His wife had died and left him with five children. A son and a daughter from that marriage lived with Carl and Clara and were quite resentful that their father had remarried so soon after their mother's death. In 1916 Carl and Clara were divorced.<br><br>In 1934, at the age of 66, Clara received a patriarchal blessing. In that blessing it stated:<br><br><i>You were willing to sacrifice, to leave home and loved ones and cross the great waters to be here in Zion that you might do the things that the Lord would have you do. As a consequence, you have suffered and have had sorrow come into your life, but the Lord has been with you to support you and help you across the difficult places and peace and happiness have come to your soul and the satisfaction of knowing that you have done that which was right and honorable before the Lord.</i><br><br>The blessing continued:<br><br><i>I bless you to live yet many years to accomplish good, bless you that as you engage in the Temple work a great thrill may come to your soul as you release your ancestors and open the way for them to continue in their progression, for progression, as you know, is endless, and those whose relatives care for them in the House of the Lord are fortunate indeed.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Clara had sacrificed by leaving her homeland and loving parents and siblings and coming to a foreign land. She struggled with the language and had to raise seven children, basically on her own. However, she never complained. She saved enough money to hire a genealogist in Sweden to do research so she could submit names to the Salt Lake Temple and have ordinances performed for her family, ancestors, and her first husband.<br><br>Clara died at the age of 81. Clara was my paternal grandmother.<br><br>Economic and political turmoil in the 19th century led Scandinavians to search for new opportunities beyond the villages and byways of their ancestors. Ship captains hoping to increase business urged those seeking a better life to leave Scandinavia and journey to America, where it was rumored that land was free and economic opportunity unlimited. The poor and destitute of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were lured by tales of American abundance.<br><br>Many left ancestral villages and crowded into the port city of Copenhagen, there waiting on docks and piers for an opportunity to board a ship for the western land. An extreme image held by more than one was that American "pigs come ready cooked, with knives and forks in them, and are running round squealing to be eaten."<sup>3</sup>The less gullible scoffed at the story of the pigs but hoped that new land in a fledgling country would prove the solution to the dilemmas that plagued them. So eager were many emigrants to leave Scandinavia that to wait for the next ship was to experience angry frustration. Men forced to wait fought for a chance to purchase another's passage. Some became stowaways, and still others promised ship captains that they would stay in cargo hulls through the entire passage just to get away from Scandinavia.<br><br>During the early days of the Church some Norwegian immigrants living on the Fox Islands near the coast of Maine heard the preaching of Wilford Woodruff. A few accepted his preaching and soon ventured inland and traveled to Nauvoo to be with others of their faith. In Nauvoo they attempted farming and tried to meld into the Midwest Mormon society. Although this proved difficult for some, struggles seemed a small sacrifice compared to the privilege of associating daily with the Prophet Joseph Smith. One day, after speaking with a Norwegian convert, the Prophet told George A. Smith, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, "that the Scandinavians would in time come to play a significant role in the church."<sup>4</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith did not live to witness the fulfillment of his prophecy. He did not see Scandinavian John E. Forsgren march with the Mormon Battalion to California in 1847 or Scandinavian Peter O. Hansen trek with the first company of Mormon pioneers across the plains to the Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>At the October conference held in Salt Lake City in 1849, it was decided to send missionaries to the nations of the earth. The Scandinavian mission calls generated much excitement among Mormons living in the Rockies. Many believed that the harvest of converts in the Nordic climes would be great, but none imagined that it would match or even surpass the number of English converts migrating to America.<br><br>On October 19, 35 men answered President Young's call to serve. Among them were Elder Erastus Snow of the Council of the Twelve and Elders Peter O. Hansen and John E. Forsgren. Before Elders Snow, Hansen, and Forsgren left the Rockies, a farewell social was held in their honor. Friends not only extended well-wishes but generously gave of their means to help defray the expense of crossing the plains. Through their generosity the newly called missionaries had the necessary monies to journey in a wagon train to the Mississippi River. The missionaries preached beyond the river to gain additional funds for passage to Great Britain. The Saints in England and Scotland collected the remaining funds needed for them to continue their voyage to Denmark.<br><br>Elder Hansen arrived in Copenhagen, Denmark, on May 11, 1850. He immediately published a pamphlet entitled<i>A Warning to the People.</i>Elder Hansen's father, who had remained in Denmark, would not see him, and most of his old friends didn't want to listen to his message. Even after hearing this discouraging news from Elder Hansen, Elder Erastus Snow, who had spent some weeks among the Saints in England and Scotland, left London and arrived in Copenhagen on June 14, 1850. He was accompanied by Elder John E. Forsgren and George P. Dykes, who had introduced the gospel to a Norwegian settlement in La Salle County, Illinois, in 1842.<br><br>In Copenhagen the elders met the poor and destitute waiting on the docks for ship passage to America. When the poor learned that the Mormon elders were from America, they questioned them about American abundance, just as they had questioned the ship captains. Multitudes gathered to hear the elders tell stories of America and of an American church.<br><br>The missionaries bore their testimonies wherever they found an opportunity. Knowing that preaching Mormonism on the docks was disconcerting to government authorities, Elder Snow started "fireside preaching"<sup>5</sup>to small gatherings inside family dwellings. This quiet, modest approach proved effective. Elder Snow wrote to Brigham Young, "We thank God that the seed has sprung up, and has deep root."<sup>6</sup>A year later he wrote, "'The shell is broken' in old Scandinavia, and the work of the Lord will advance."<sup>7</sup>On August 12, 1850, Elder Erastus Snow baptized 15 converts. At the close of the year there were 130 members in Denmark and a Book of Mormon had been presented to the king of Denmark along with a copy of Elder Snow's pamphlet<i>A Voice of Truth.</i><br><br>In the meantime, Elder John E. Forsgren had been set apart to preach the gospel in Sweden. He proceeded to the city of Gefle on June 19, 1850. His younger sister had been told in a dream that a visitor was about to come with three books and that those who believed in them should be saved. She accepted the gospel when her brother came with the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Doctrine and Covenants. Her brother Peter had a lung disease that the doctors said had no cure. Elder Forsgren laid hands on his brother's head, and Peter was healed by the power of the Lord. Peter was the first to receive baptism in Sweden. He was baptized on July 26, 1850. His sister and two others were baptized on August 3.<br><br>Elder Forsgren was soon arrested and banished but found many opportunities to preach the gospel before the highest police officers and judges and in the courtrooms. With the help of the American consul and the captain of a ship bound for New York, he was able to escape to Denmark. He arrived back in Copenhagen on September 18, 1850. It was not until 1852 that attempts to establish the Church in Sweden were resumed. Peter Forsgren related the following concerning the preaching of the gospel in Sweden:<br><br><i>John Forsgren was one day summoned to the office of the public prosecutor, and the latter asked him if he had a picture of the Prophet Joseph. He procured a picture, and the officer set fire to it. While it was burning, Elder Forsgren had a vision in which he saw the city of Gefle destroyed by fire. He told his friends of this vision, and also that they would be in America, when the visitation would take place. Nineteen years from the date of the burning of Joseph's picture, the city of Gefle was almost totally destroyed by fire, and the conflagration started in the very house, where the picture of the Prophet had been sacrificed to the flames.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Why were the poor of Scandinavia so willing to unite with Mormonism? Although influences may include internal and external issues in northern Europe, the heartfelt answer is found in journal and diary entries. "As soon as I saw those men's faces I knew the testimony they bore was of God," wrote Jens Nielsen.<sup>9</sup><br><br>"It seemed as though every word the Elder spoke went right through me," added Carl Madsen.<sup>10</sup><br><br>"I heard them speak, and the first time I heard them I felt that Mormonism was true, and that it would comfort and satisfy me," said Hannah Sorenson.<sup>11</sup><br><br>New convert Hans Jensen Hals wrote, "I received a testimony that God had begun this work, therefore all the evil in the world was against it. . . . I felt more happiness than I had ever had before."<sup>12</sup><br><br>The new converts did not forsake Mormonism. "From that time on [meaning from the time of his baptism] all my former friends turned against me and spoke all kinds of evil against me, and that falsely," wrote Jens Nielson.<sup>13</sup>For him and for other converts, there was no turning back. To these faithful the only serious obstacle was obtaining a Danish copy of the Book of Mormon. "God's word is free, but paper, printing, binding, and our sustenance all the same cost money."<sup>14</sup><br><br>"Let the poor band together, three or four, to buy a Book of Mormon," said Mormon leaders.<sup>15</sup>Believers went without food to save means to acquire the book and then shared truths from the Book of Mormon with neighbors, friends, and strangers. Perhaps unknowingly they fulfilled the prayer of Elder Snow when he said: "O Lord, raise up labourers and send them into this harvest--men of their own tongue, who have been raised among them and are familiar with the spirits of the people."<sup>16</sup><br><br>It was on Monday, December 20, 1852, when the first large company of 294 Saints left Copenhagen, Denmark. They boarded the ship<i>Obotrit</i>and sailed from the customhouse under the direction of Elder John E. Forsgren. A great many Danish people gathered at the dock as the ship left. The atmosphere was filled with hate because fellow countrymen were disgracing themselves by following a "Swedish Mormon priest" and departing for America.<br><br>The journey to Kiel, Holstein (now part of Germany), was stormy and unpleasant, but the ship arrived safely on December 22, 1852. The journey continued by rail to Hamburg. On December 24 the Saints boarded the steamship<i>Lion,</i>which proceeded down the River Elbe. Because of fog, the ship's captain cast anchor and they celebrated Christmas Eve aboard ship.<br><br>On Christmas morning the ship sailed to the mouth of the river. Because of heavy headwinds the ship didn't reach the open sea until midnight. A terrible storm ensued as the ship sailed the North Sea. The ship's bridge was damaged, but the emigrants were not injured. On the evening of December 28 the ship steamed into the harbor of Hull, England. It was learned that about 150 vessels had been lost on the North Sea during the storm.<br><br>The Saints continued their journey by rail to Liverpool on December 29. On December 31 they boarded the packet ship<i>Forest Monarch.</i>Storms prevented the ship leaving port for about two weeks. One night the ship became entangled with another vessel and sustained some damage. A few days later, because of a storm, the anchors were pulled and the ship was set adrift. Two tugboats came to the rescue just before it ran aground.<br><br>Finally, on January 16, 1853, the<i>Forest Monarch</i>began its voyage to America. There were 297 souls onboard ship. Although very pleasant weather accompanied the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, a perfect calm hindered the journey for several days. Also, provisions were poor and the supply of fresh water ran out.<br><br>After arriving in America at the mouth of the Mississippi River, the Saints took a steamboat from New Orleans to Saint Louis. After about a month in Saint Louis, where commodities were purchased, they traveled to Keokuk, Iowa, by steamboat. There they spent several weeks receiving their wagons and teams of oxen. They left Keokuk on May 21 and finally arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on September 30, 1853. As many as 20 emigrants had died during the journey, some children were born, and a few had lost their faith amid all the hardships.<br><br>Once the faithful were in Zion, they sent letters to friends and relatives in Scandinavia urging them to follow. More than one letter announced, "The Lord is gathering out the best and the most pure material for his own use."<sup>17</sup>Such inspiring news led Mormon converts to migrate to Zion at an unprecedented rate. In time, the number of Scandinavian emigrants to Utah did surpass that of Mormon emigrants from the British Isles.<br><br>Many stories have been related concerning the missionary experiences of those called to serve in Scandinavia. August Carlson served three missions, first as a local missionary in Sweden. It was difficult. Fined on more than one occasion for preaching the gospel, he sometimes had to go without a companion. He became discouraged and was ready to quit, but his mother, who had been deceased for 10 months, appeared to him and encouraged him to continue. As recounted in a biography written by his wife, Caroline:<br><br><i>He was considering asking for a release from his mission, as everything seemed dark and useless; so he decided to write to the mission president the next day. In the early morning of that day, which was the 6th of February 1880, he heard a knock on the door to his room. Thinking it was one of the people he was staying with, he said, "Come in!" To his surprise his own mother walked in. . . . He stretched out his arms as to embrace her, but she said, "Touch me not, for I am only a spirit. I have asked permission to come to see you because I know of your hardships." Then she . . . told him to be faithful and finish the mission . . . and promised him that a way would be opened for him to get money so he could emigrate to Zion.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>His mother's spirit also told him to gather genealogical information for temple work even though, at that time, vicarious work for the dead was being practiced only in St. George.<br><br>The promise his mother's spirit made was fulfilled when August Carlson emigrated to Utah in August 1881 and located in Ogden. He returned to Sweden to serve two more missions, during the last gaining an audience with King Oscar and having the honor of introducing Heber J. Grant to him.<br><br>At the age of 12 years Anders Peter Anderson was orphaned. He had begun working in a woolen factory at age 10 because his family was poor. When he was 14 he heard the message of the missionaries, and in January 1878 he was baptized. As soon as it became known that he was a Mormon, the family that had taken him in when he was orphaned and treated him like a son drove him out. Called as a local missionary, Anders was frequently summoned before the Lutheran Church councils. In one city he was sentenced to 14 days in prison on bread and water, but he secretly moved to another area and escaped the punishment. During his mission he baptized 85 people. In the company of 270 other emigrants he came to America in August 1881. In 1889 he left America for another mission to Scandinavia, eventually serving as president of the Stockholm conference and baptizing 66 people.<sup>19</sup><br><br>Charles John Christensen was the first male child born in Fairview, Utah. He served four missions, two of them to Scandinavia. He was called in 1883 to serve in the Christiania, Norway, conference. Leaving behind his wife and two children, he wrote poignant letters and poems to them such as this one:<br><br><i>Oh! Happy Day when we shall meet,</i><br><i>Our joy and bliss will be complete.</i><br><i>Then never more from you I'll part</i><br><i>The fond affection of my heart.</i><br><br><i>Oh! Dearest Wife and Children two,</i><br><i>I want to live and die with you.</i><br><i>Now in my verse, I wish to say</i><br><i>God bless my darlings far away.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>Thoughts of the Lord and family sustained many missionaries until they could return home.<br><br>The native-born Scandinavians preached that Mormonism was gathering the elect to America--not the fanciful America described by seafaring captains or the America depicted in the childish game Going to America. It was an American Zion. The combination of the ideas of America and Zion was well received by new converts, especially those crowding the docks in Copenhagen.<br><br>Letters from family and friends who had already boarded seafaring vessels bound for Zion also encouraged emigration. P. F. Madsen of Brigham City wrote in 1873, "My orchard is heavy with fruit and I have to shore up the branches of my apple trees for fear they will break. I have never seen here a richer harvest of both grain and fruit."<sup>21</sup><br><br>The mere fact that letters were sent from Scandinavians living in American communities with such promising names as Springtown, Mount Pleasant, Fountain Green, Ephraim, and Fairview reinforced the image of a better life in Zion. To stay in Scandinavia was to experience war and rumors of war, mobbing, strikes, fires, poverty, unemployment, and financial panic.<br><br>To think of Zion as a place in America was to imagine utopia. To think of leaving family and of obtaining the means to board vessels bound for Zion was to cast shadows on the image. Encouraging the reluctant, missionaries reminded potential voyagers of the Book of Mormon migration to the promised land, telling and retelling the story of Father Lehi and his family courageously boarding a ship to reach a new land. The analogy of the ship proved so applicable to the Scandinavians that a typical toast among Danish converts was "May next year find us together in Zion."<sup>22</sup>This strange but irresistible longing for Zion was conveyed in rhyme:<br><br><i>Oh Zion when I think of thee</i><br><i>I long for pinions like the dove</i><br><i>And mourn to think that I should be</i><br><i>So distant from the land I love.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>For the few who could not imagine leaving ancestral homes aboard a Zion ship, a stronger approach was used by Mormon missionaries. Gathering to Zion became a "sign of one's faithfulness."<sup>24</sup>Not to gather was to not fully embrace Mormonism. Poems about Zion moved from refrains that ended with<i>love</i>and<i>dove</i>to concepts tainted with fear that God's judgment could not be restrained:<br><br><i>Ye Saints who dwell on Europe's shore,</i><br><i>Prepare yourselves with many more</i><br><i>To leave behind your native land,</i><br><i>For sure God's judgments are at hand.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, because of their number and their destitute circumstances, not all had the opportunity to emigrate. In 1869, of the 567 emigrants leaving Scandinavia, one-third received money from either relatives, friends, or the Perpetual Emigration Fund. One strong contributor to the Scandinavian emigration was the Relief Society in Ephraim, Utah. Women in that society donated proceeds earned from selling eggs laid on Sunday. "The hens, everyone swore, laid more eggs on Sunday than on any other day."<sup>26</sup>At one point, so great were the funds sent to Scandinavia "that the mission could scarcely function" because migration left local branches without priesthood leadership.<sup>27</sup>Historical reports reveal that by 1900 at least 30,000 Mormon converts had left Copenhagen bound for America.<br><br>We are indebted to the Scandinavians who did leave familiar shores to venture to the American Zion. These Saints were not blind to the risks they faced. They were prepared to sacrifice all to respond to the call from the prophet to gather to Zion. Their response is a tribute to their remarkable courage. J. M. Sjödahl, editor of the<i>Deseret News,</i>said in 1912:<br><br><i>Scandinavian Saints have performed their full share in the work of redemption and the building up of this region. . . . The Scandinavian pioneers and their descendants are found where strong arms are needed to cultivate the soil and fill the storehouses of the people with the good things of the earth. They are found in the literary field, in the seats of learning, in the offices of the Church and the State, from the highest to the lowest. They are found in the missionary field, and among the faithful workers at home. The first pioneers are nearly all gone, but their places have been taken by others whose aim is the triumph of the Church of Christ over the enemies of truth.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>We all have ancestors who have sacrificed to make our lives better. Now we may be called upon to sacrifice as well. Our sacrifices will probably be quite different from those early Scandinavian Saints. We read in 3 Nephi 9:20, "And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost." In Doctrine and Covenants 97:8 we are told:<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice--yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command--they are accepted of me.</i><br><br>Whatever our sacrifice, none has or will match the sacrifice of our elder brother, Jesus Christ, who gave His life that all may be saved. How grateful we should be that we may be asked to sacrifice just a small portion to build the kingdom. May we remain strong and add our strength and testimonies to the brave Saints who have shown us the way by their examples, I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Shauna C.

<br>
Elder Ballard, President Nadauld, President Bateman, faculty, ladies, gentlemen, and, most important, distinguished graduates, thank you very much for inviting me to be part of this special day. Since I didn't go to college, this honorary degree is especially meaningful to me. Thank you.<br><br>At a Senate hearing in Washington a few months ago, a senator and a cabinet secretary got into an argument over who was poorer growing up. Have you ever noticed that only when people become rich do they argue about how poor they were? Believe me, being poor is no great honor. In fact, what initially drove me in life was that I hated being poor.<br><br>The reason I mention all this is that when I was poor, I didn't know what true poverty was. And when I became rich, I didn't know what true riches were. Now I know a little more about true poverty and true riches. And that's what I want to talk about today as you set off on your life's journey.<br><br>I'm going to tell you some stories about lives that have crossed mine, and then I'm going to tell you what I think those stories mean.<br><br>It is really amazing how things work out. Because I have a big airplane that flies across the world at 35,000 feet, I came into contact with people who see the world by crawling on their stomachs and elbows.<br><br>I owe this blessing to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Although I'm not a member of the Church, about three years ago I was asked if I had room on my plane to drop off 15 tons of canned meat for refugees in Kosovo. Then the Church asked, "And is there any chance that you might have a little extra room to drop off some wheelchairs in Romania?"<br><br>I had never really thought about wheelchairs before. But after that trip I could think of little else.<br><br>When we dropped off the chairs, the doctor told me that disabled people in third world countries--such as many of the children in refugee camps whose legs have been blown off by land mines--are often just discarded and abandoned. Often families hide the disabled in the back room because they're ashamed. They don't even want their neighbors to know. Some of you on your missions overseas may have seen such things.<br><br>I've met people who have spent 25 years in a bed in a room with no windows. I met a girl who had spent the last 23 years lying flat on a mattress, looking at the ceiling without the ability to move or to be easily moved. Imagine not being able to see the outdoors unless someone carries you. No wonder so many dream that they're birds.<br><br>I wish you could meet the people I've met. They have taught me to use the word<i>love</i>much more freely than I would have thought possible.<br><br>When we were in North Vietnam, we put an elderly lady in a wheelchair. She asked the interpreter if she could thank me. She came over and said, "I'm 85 years old, and I've wanted to die, but I have not been able to."<br><br>I didn't know what to say.<br><br>Then she moved closer and took my hands. She looked at me and smiled. Then she said, "But now I don't want to die."<br><br>A young Guatemalan man's leg was swollen. He wanted to know if he could borrow a wheelchair to get him around so that he could come up with the money to have his leg taken off. It had gangrene, and he had 30 days to have it removed. The doctor wanted $100 to cut the leg off and another $25 to put him to sleep. I gave him the $125. He counted it out, and he handed me $25 back. He said, "That's okay. I don't need to be put to sleep." I gave the money back to him.<br><br>Three days later I got a call from down there. He had had his leg off and was getting around in a wheelchair. His wife had found a job, he was in the house taking care of the children, and they were going to be a very happy family.<br><br>When these people come to us, some are driven, some are carried, some come by wheelbarrow or hand truck. Some crawl.<br><br>In Zimbabwe a fellow crawled on his elbows for 17 kilometers to get to us. We put him in the wheelchair, and he was going around and around with a big smile on his face. After a while he pulled himself out of it and sat on the ground. We asked him why. He said, "I've had my turn."<br><br>He didn't realize he could keep it.<br><br>This year he came back with his children to show us that he had cared for the chair so well that it was just like new.<br><br>We gave a chair to a woman in South Africa who had not gotten one on a previous trip. She said to me, "I've prayed every day for two years that God would send you back with a chair, and here you are."<br><br>When you give people these chairs, they grab your hand, they cry, they thank you, they very often say a prayer. And they always smile.<br><br>Most of us think of a wheelchair as a confinement, but to millions of people it is not confinement, it is freedom--freedom to move, to go to school, to get a job. A chair is hope, self-reliance, independence. Most important, it is dignity.<br><br>In a way a wheelchair is to the body what the education you have received is to the mind. You would be overwhelmed by how much a little chair with wheels can mean--how it can change lives. A young South American woman who was going to school--just like you have been--got hit by a truck. She spent the next 11 years in bed. We gave her a wheelchair. The next day she came back and said she had reenrolled and was starting her studies the next day.<br><br>In a matter of moments a chair can change a personality. People go from not smiling to smiling. As soon as we put one young boy in a chair, he took off for a water fountain and started splashing the water. He splashed himself, he splashed other people, then he went and felt a leaf on a tree. These are such simple pleasures that we take for granted.<br><br>There is another story that means a lot to me. We had a woman from Mexico who has worked for us for 12 years. She heard we were going to Mexico City to deliver wheelchairs. She informed us that she had a nephew in Mexico City whose name was Angel. He had a terminal disease. He had first lost his eyesight and had now lost his mobility. She asked if we could give him a wheelchair so he could be mobile during the limited time he had to live. I said yes and told her to have his parents come to our distribution. His parents found us and were crying. They said that Angel had received his wheelchair and wanted to thank me. They brought him in his wheelchair, and I spoke to him so he would know where I was. He then took my hands and looked up with his blind eyes into my eyes and said, "I'll see you in heaven." I was not able to even answer him.<br><br>These people's stories may seem far removed from this beautiful campus, so what do they have to do with you graduates? I think these stories reveal a number of truths about life and how we live it.<br><br>Graduates, there is so much need out there in so many different ways. In terms of wheelchairs alone, between 100 and 130 million people worldwide cannot afford a wheelchair and need one. China needs 20 million chairs. India needs 30 million chairs. Next year we will give away 200,000 wheelchairs in 100 countries. Our goal is to provide one million chairs by 2005. The Church is really helping us with this ministry of mobility.<br><br>This wheelchair mission is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. I used to give money to good causes because I felt obligated to give back. Many people give because they feel obligated--which is good--but they don't feel the giving<i>with their hearts.</i>If I have any wisdom worth this honorary doctorate that you have so kindly given me, it is this: Giving is not a duty; it is a joy.<br><br>I wish every one of you graduates could lift someone into a wheelchair and look into his or her eyes. There are no barriers of race or religion or culture when your eyes meet. I want you to feel such joy. I want you to feel such humanity. Your lives are going to need similar experiences to be truly rich.<br><br>Let me close with one last story. When I was in Yugoslavia, this man was telling me about his teenage son. The man said he saw his son step on the land mine that blew him onto another one, which then blew him onto another one. By the time the father got to him, most of his life was gone. The man frantically found an old pickup truck to take the boy to a place where he could receive blood. The young man stayed 11 months. Although he lived, he lost an eye, his hearing in one ear, and both legs up to his hips.<br><br>The man said that although they were refugees, they had a house and they had food to survive. And now with this wheelchair he could give his son what he wanted most, and that was to go out and sit in the sun.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think that the desire of a human being to sit in the sun is too much to ask.<br><br>As you graduates leave here today full of brightness and possibilities, I ask that you not forget those who lie in the lonely depths of darkened rooms--immobilized perhaps physically, perhaps mentally, perhaps by poverty or despair.<br><br>As you leave this university to make your way in the world, I ask one thing of you. I don't care how rich you become. I don't care what position of power you someday hold. I don't care what you invent or create or build. I ask one thing of you.<br><br>I ask that along life's path you take the time now and then to help your fellowman sit in the sun.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><i>Kenneth E.

<h1>a Refuge from the Storm - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The first half of the year 2002 has been exciting in the history of the Church. In President Gordon B. Hinckley's pioneer commemoration address, given July 21 at the Conference Center, he said: "From my childhood I have had an appreciation for the pioneers. And that initial respect has been enhanced tremendously--far beyond my own expectations--by two recent events."<br><br>President Hinckley went on to say that the two events this year were the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and the dedication of the Nauvoo Temple. He talked about the miracle that "has come to pass from that pioneer day to our own" ("What a Miracle! Pioneer Day in Light of Recent Events,"<i>Church News,</i>27 July 2002, 3). I most heartily agree!<br><br>The Winter Olympics were wonderful. It was an exciting time to be in Salt Lake City. How we enjoyed mingling with the throngs of people from near and far, feeling the spirit of the Olympics. It was a time of great cooperation and unity in our city. Special care was taken to see that the Olympics did not become a "Mormon event." Church leaders worked very carefully so that the public did not observe proselyting as they came to visit. Visitors were warmly received by friendly, helpful volunteers.<br><br>The scriptures have declared that the "gospel might be proclaimed . . . before kings and rulers" (D&amp;amp;C 1:23). This surely occurred at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. "Kings and rulers" came from around the world asking for an audience with the First Presidency. The days were filled with such visits during the Olympic period. We had greater coverage from newspapers, television, radio, and the Internet than has ever been experienced before in the history of the Church.<br><br>We were exposed to the world. That exposure was almost completely positive. Many felt these were the best Olympic Games ever. Surveys taken following the Games showed a marked increase in public understanding of who we are and what we believe in. There was a remarkable increase in those who recognize us as Christians but different in our beliefs from the other Christian denominations.<br><br>The second event occurred in June with the dedication of the Nauvoo Temple. The sacrifice of the early Saints in building the Nauvoo Temple can never be forgotten. They were faithful in their tithes and participated in additional donation requests--which they gladly provided, though they were living in poverty. They also donated one day in 10 laboring to construct the beautiful building.<br><br>The Saints were driven from their beautiful homes in Nauvoo more than 150 years ago. After they left, the centerpiece of their beautiful city, the temple, was desecrated and burned to the ground. You can imagine their feelings as they crossed the Mississippi and took one long, last look at their beautiful city and the temple on the hill. Realizing they probably would not see it again, they turned their faces west to go into a desert wasteland and start all over again.<br><br>The Saints journeyed west to a land isolated from the world. Here they organized themselves and built a foundation of strength. With time and the blessings of the Lord, the gospel has flourished, and membership has expanded to almost all corners of the world.<br><br>Now there is a new dedicated temple in Nauvoo on the same spot where the original temple stood. To the communities that once had forced the Saints from their homes, thousands returned during the Nauvoo Temple open house. Visitors were curious about the temple, and others welcomed us back into their presence. The rebuilt temple has become a vital part of the community from which the Saints were once driven.<br><br>These two events mark the new era of understanding and acceptance of the Church by peoples of the world. With this new image of the Church come new and added responsibilities for the members of the Church. We must demonstrate by the way we live that we truly believe in the revealed doctrines concerning the gospel of our Lord and Savior. These two events were not staged for world acceptance, but they are truly representative of who we are and what we stand for.<br><br>In contrast with these two wonderful happenings this year, two other occurrences deeply trouble me. These are in addition to the "wars and rumors of wars" that are perpetuating themselves in most corners of the world (1 Nephi 14:15).<br><br>The first is in my esteemed profession of accounting. It has taken a big hit in what I thought were the very roots of this profession--integrity. Now we find that some of the most highly respected accounting firms have violated their dedicated trust. These firms have caused the reputation of this once-honored profession to be in question. They have bowed to corporate greed and have issued audit statements that have been found to be misleading and outright dishonest.<br><br>Imagine having to create a public "accountability board" to see that the integrity of the accounting profession is being upheld. The purpose of this board would be to address accountants' ethical lapses or competency deficiencies. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Harvey L. Pitt has declared: "This model . . . sends a loud and clear message that the era of self-regulation of the accounting profession is over" ("Proposed Rules to Create a Framework for a Public Accountability Board," 20 June 2002; http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch569.htm). Furthermore, Mr. Pitt went on to imply that the auditing standards are not a problem; rather, the problem lies with compliance and execution according to the standards of this profession. For years the profession has signed statements that the audit report represents fairly and accurately the information contained therein. Now the validity of that statement has to be clearly questioned because men have violated the standards of integrity that are so vital to public confidence in the credibility of the audit.<br><br>What a sad, sad commentary on the integrity of those we depend on for reliable information regarding the businesses of our nation. Unfortunately it is just a symptom of what is going on. People have become so possessed with the desire to achieve worldly recognition, power, and wealth that they have lost their sense of what is right. They have violated the standards that must be upheld for the sake of our nation or any other nation.<br><br>Brigham Young taught the Saints in his day:<br><br><i>We want the Saints to increase in goodness, until our mechanics, for instance, are so honest and reliable that this Railroad Company will say, "Give us a Mormon elder for an engineer, then none need have the least fear to ride, for if he knows there is danger he will take every measure necessary to preserve the lives of those entrusted to his care." I want to see our elders so full of integrity that they will be preferred by this Company for their engine builders, watchmen, engineers, clerks and business managers. If we live our religion and are worthy</i>[of]<i>the name of Latter-day Saints, we are just the men that all such business can be entrusted to with perfect safety; if it can not it will prove that we do not live our religion.</i>[Brigham Young,<i>JD</i>12:300]<br><br>Perhaps we need to paraphrase the words of Brigham Young and say: "I want to see our elders so full of integrity that they'll be preferred by corporate America as their accountants, auditors, clerks, business managers, and corporate executives."<br><br>President Nathan Eldon Tanner gave us this challenge:<br><br><i>There is far too much immorality, dishonesty, and lack of integrity in the lives of those who are leading and guiding the affairs of our nations, our schools, and our communities. Somehow we must get back to the lofty ideals and high-minded principles which characterized the lives of those who fought and died for truth, religion, and freedom.</i>[N. Eldon Tanner, "Remember Who You Are,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1983, 3–4]<br><br>The second major concern that troubles me is the decline of those who desire to affiliate with a Christian religious denomination. Although they continue to profess a faith in Christian principles, many no longer have confidence in the structured organization that is supposed to help them retain that faith. Recently it was reported that confidence in the religious organization has declined since the early 1990s from 60 percent to 42 percent (Frank Newport, "Americans' Confidence in Military, Presidency Up; But Business, Organized Religion Drop," Poll Analyses, Gallup News Service, 28 June 2002).<br><br>We now face the challenge of almost standing alone in declaring to the world that the heavens are not closed. The Lord continues to reveal His will to mankind through the structure He has established to bring order, unity, and consistency in building His gospel kingdom.<br><br>Remember how early in His ministry He called 12 others to assist Him? As the work expanded, 70 more were called to declare their witness of our Lord and Savior to the world. After His death, we find Paul declaring the need for such a structured organization:<br><br><i>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</i><br><br><i>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</i><br><br><i>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</i><br><br><i>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</i><br><br><i>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</i><br><br><i>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</i>[Ephesians 4:11–16]<br><br>So here we are, in a world of turmoil but with the Church stronger than it has ever been. We have come to this place to be spiritually lifted and motivated so that we will not be taken in by the worldliness, the violence, and the lack of morals, ethics, and integrity that we see all around us. It is a time to strengthen and prepare ourselves for the future.<br><br>Having never attended Campus Education Week except as a speaker, I have often wondered what is the mystique that has you traveling so many miles to come each year. I have always attempted to get my brothers and sisters to get together during July, when I am free from travel assignments. Before my brother Bob passed away, he would never join us in July for family gatherings. His whole year's plans revolved around his August trip to Utah to attend Education Week. If we wanted him to attend a family gathering, it had to be in August, before or after Education Week.<br><br>There must be something of great therapeutic value or refuge from the trials of life that draws you to this conference each year. Is it here you come to find refuge from the storm?<br><br>I have asked two regular attendees to join me to see if I can discover the magnetic draw that brings so many to the Brigham Young University campus each August. First, Ada May Griffin from Garland, Utah, would you please join me?<br><br>How long have you been coming to Education Week?<br><br>"For 35 years."<br><br>Why do you come?<br><br>"I love to learn, and I don't retain it, so I have to keep coming back."<br><br>Do you bring anyone with you?<br><br>"Yes. I bring my husband and I brought my daughters. I bring my grandchildren now, and it's wonderful."<br><br>So it's not only a time of coming to learn, it is a time of gathering, to be together with wonderful people and experience the opportunity of being here and enjoy the warmth and love of friendly relationships. Thank you, Ada.<br><br>Now I would like to tell you about a great family experience we had just earlier this month that I think all of us can learn from.<br><br>The first part of August I reached a major milestone in my life. I was passing from middle age to old age with my 80th birthday. To celebrate it, I decided to take my children and grandchildren on a tour of Logan, my hometown, to share with them the impact this city has had on my life.<br><br>First we stopped at the Maddox Ranch House restaurant in Perry, Utah, for an early dinner. Perry is a significant city in our family history. After dinner we caravanned over to Logan, where I had designated nine stops that I wanted my family to see. With each stop I selected a scripture to teach a lesson on the importance that particular location had for me in my life.<br><h2><b>1. Logan High School<br>Lesson: Live Up to Your Potential</b></h2><br><i>For they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2]<br><br>I was very shy in high school and did not take advantage of the opportunities that were there to enlarge and build my talents. I was afraid to try. The lesson I wanted to teach my family is to live up to your potential. Don't be afraid to try. Have confidence in yourself. You won't succeed the first time on anything you do, but successive attempts will bring confidence and the development of new talents.<br><h2><b>2. The Logan Tabernacle<br>Lesson: The Joy of Gospel Service</b></h2><br><i>That ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>My father had served in the presidency of the Cache Stake in Logan for some 20 years. It seemed appropriate to stop at the tabernacle, where we held our stake conferences, to teach the lesson that Church service brings great joy and is a sure way of developing your skills in human relationships. You enter Church service with the pure intent to build our Father in Heaven's kingdom. The Lord more than compensates you for your time and effort with blessings that increase your talents and abilities to be used in further service. It is impossible to stay even with the Lord.<br><h2><b>3. My Father's Law Office<br>Lesson: Select Your Profession Early</b></h2><br><i>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</i><br><br><i>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</i><br><br><i>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</i>[1 Timothy 6:10–12]<br><br>I related to my family how I had prepared myself for the banking profession. Dad was the bank attorney. From my newspaper delivery earnings I saved enough to buy 10 shares of First National Bank stock. Dad insisted that I attend the stockholders' meetings and vote my 10 shares. He thought that was a way of introducing me to the banking profession. A job offer came after graduation that was much more lucrative than banking. I thought I would accept the position for a few years and then return to banking. I never did become a banker. I tried to teach my grandchildren that the selection of a major in college is not as important as integrity, ethics, developing good study habits, and building character as a person of faith, confidence, and industry.<br><h2><b>4. My Birthplace<br>Lesson: The Value of Our Heritage</b></h2><br><i>Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents . . . ; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</i>[Helaman 5:6]<br><br>I was given the name of my father. I honored my father and wanted to retain the same values he had established. Our heritage gives us those enduring values that will be with us now and through all the eternities.<br><h2><b>5. The Old Family Home<br>Lesson: The Blessing of Good Parents</b></h2><br><i>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father.</i>[1 Nephi 1:1]<br><br>I tried to teach my family that the credit for the success you achieve in life really belongs to the parents who have given you a wonderful start. My father was a hard worker, good provider, and a sterling example of service, honor, and integrity. He loved his family and made time for us in his busy life.<br><br>Mother was always there to teach and encourage us. She was a great homemaker, a careful housekeeper, an excellent manager of household finances, and a wonderful cook. How I honor and love my parents.<br><h2><b>6. The Comfort Inn<br>Lesson: Accept the Challenge of Change That Occurs in Your Life</b></h2><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:24]<br><br>We checked in at the motel. After checking in, I told my family, "Tonight you will sleep in the place that used to be our old cow pasture." This is where the motel had been built. My, how times have changed! I will always be grateful that I grew up in an age when we plowed, planted, tended, irrigated, and harvested. These activities were very important in our lives.<br><br>Future generations will have little opportunity to enjoy those same blessings we received. We live in a world of rapid change. Somehow we must find a way to hold onto the basic unchanging values and yet be ready for additional revealed light that will lead us to greater opportunities.<br><h2><b>7. Aggie Ice Cream Store<br>Lesson: The Value of Traditions</b></h2><br><i>And that same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:2]<br><br>Having an Aggie ice cream cone on every trip to Logan has become one of our many traditions. More important are traditions of Church activity, Church service, family loyalty, and so forth. Special traditions we establish here with members of our family will endure. We should build traditions that will be strong in our remembrance, that will last even into the eternities.<br><h2><b>8. Utah State University<br>Lesson: The Value of Taking Time to Have a Happy, Successful Courtship</b></h2><br><i>And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 49:15]<br><br>I explained that most of my courtship had occurred on the USU campus. Dances, ball games, meeting in the halls between classes, walking across the quad to the library, studying in the library, attending institute classes, taking special walks around the campus, etc., all gave time to becoming better acquainted and enjoying the richness of the relationship that was being developed. It became the most important thing in my life at that time. When this time comes to you, it affects all that you do. Make it precious and special.<br><h2><b>9. The Logan Temple<br>Lesson: The Importance of the Temple</b></h2><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–3]<br><br>The center of our lives must be the holy temple. We must always be worthy to enter therein. If we live worthy of the covenants we make with the Lord in His house, we literally bind the Lord to give the blessings He has promised us. The Lord will fulfill His promises if we will be faithful to the covenants we make with Him.<br><br>We ended the tour later in the evening at the old Logan Ninth Ward building. We had arranged for a room there in which the family could gather. My secretary had prepared a PowerPoint presentation of my life. There were pictures starting with my grandparents, parents, and on through my early life. Then there were pictures from my marriage and of the blessings of children, followed by a collage of pictures of the events we have enjoyed together as a family.<br><br>On Sunday morning we attended church services in the Ninth Ward chapel. This building was constructed under the supervision of my father while he served as bishop. He was the bishop for only 18 years. I had opportunity that morning to bear my witness and testimony of the blessings of the gospel in my life.<br><br>We then drove to our home in Salt Lake City. However, before letting them enjoy a delicious birthday dinner prepared by my wife, I quizzed the family on what they had learned. I again bore witness to the divinity of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I am absolutely convinced that the greatest refuge we will find in our life will be those wonderful, close associations we have with our immediate family members.<br><br>Now let's interview another attendee. Frank Margiotta from Long Island, New York, will you please join me?<br><br>Why do you come here?<br><br>"For spiritual rejuvenation and learning."<br><br>How long have you been coming to Education Week?<br><br>"Perhaps 19 or 20 years."<br><br>What do you retain out of these experiences?<br><br>"Well, I, too, like Sister Griffin, have to come back because I forget, but I retain quite a bit. I seek after particular classes I might be interested in."<br><br>Do you see the secret here? If you're going to learn the gospel of Jesus Christ in this eternal study, you have to repeat and repeat and repeat so that you can find the glories that come from the gospel of the Savior. Frank, study hard this time. Thank you.<br><br>So you come to Education Week to learn the beauties of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which will enrich your life and give you the greatest refuge you can possibly find. The gospel will give you the peace and assurance of the eternal blessings waiting for those who live righteously.<br><br>One year as we were preparing instructions for the newly called General Authorities, different members of the Twelve were assigned to prepare a statement on each of the important essential doctrines. One statement was given on the great plan of happiness. Years have passed and I cannot remember who had this assignment, but I have kept his statement in my binder. It explains what we're all seeking. It reads:<br><br><i>Our Heavenly Father has made available to all His children the same plan, system, and grand design by which He himself became God. It is called the great plan of happiness, the plan of salvation, the gospel of Jesus Christ. It consists of infinite, eternal, absolute, unchanging principles. The plan is complete in every particular, capable of reaching without compulsion to every phase of man's existence from premortal life through mortality and to the resurrection of the body and into eternity. There is no condition of intelligence existing to which the plan cannot be applied if individuals willingly obey. There is no extraneous proviso, nothing to be added or taken away. Although individuals can be blessed through the gospel, the fullness is realized only in the family. The plan is the Father's. Jesus made it His by total obedience to the Father's will. The Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement are essential to the implementation and fulfillment of the plan.</i><br><br>Those profound words can cause us to strive through our mortal life to understand the blessings the Lord has given to us. The Lord has prepared a way for us to stay abreast of His glorious gospel. We come to learn and need to leave with a desire to continue our studies. If we are able to seek a refuge from the storm, we must progress as far as we can in an understanding of the great wealth of information available to us. This should include both spiritual and secular knowledge. We must again remind ourselves to seek knowledge "out of the best books" and from television, satellites, the Internet, and radio. We must "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118) and share it with our children and grandchildren.<br><br>President David O. McKay warned us:<br><br><i>The peril of this century is spiritual apathy. As the body requires sunlight, good food, proper exercise and rest, so the spirit of man requires the sunlight of the Holy Spirit; proper exercise of the spiritual functions; the avoiding of evils that affect spiritual health, that are more ravaging in their effects than typhoid fever, pneumonia, or other diseases that attack the body.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>CR,</i>October 1907, 62]<br><br>Our refuge from the storm must be based on a foundation of the gospel of our Lord and Savior, which is to be understood, lived, and taught. Perhaps the comforting words of assurance from Helaman will give us comfort in the refuge we are seeking:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>I add my witness to you today. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true. It will not fail you in your life. It is the only hope for individual salvation and refuge from the storms that descend as we journey through mortality. May God continue to bless you with the desire to learn more of His ways and to be obedient to His law is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>lenges (and Opportunity) of the 21st Century - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, each year I approach this assignment with some apprehension because I believe the Annual University Conference is one of the most important events of the year. It is an opportunity for the faculty, staff, and administration of Brigham Young University to gather together and reset our course, to synchronize our compasses. Since the university's journey began well before we entered the scene and will continue long after we are gone, the directions set in these meetings are critical for us and for those who follow. I appreciate very much those in attendance today and hope that you will lead a discussion in the colleges and departments regarding the topics presented.<br><br>This is also a time for new associates to begin the orientation process at this unique institution. A perceptive person soon learns that orientation is not a one-week or one-year activity but that it takes years to appreciate fully the university's mission and to see how one may best contribute. The conference is also a time to recognize the achievements of various faculty and staff, as we have done this morning.<br><br>During last year's Annual University Conference, five challenges and opportunities were presented. They included the following:<br><br>-- building a university community;<br><br>-- continuous reinvention;<br><br>-- focusing resources;<br><br>-- mentored student learning; and<br><br>-- continual curriculum improvement.<br><br>My purpose today is not to issue new challenges but to provide a perspective on what lies ahead and encourage us to recommit to the opportunities just mentioned, especially in light of an ever-improving student body, continual faculty and staff turnover, new technology, and increasing donor support to our efforts.<br><br><strong>Building a University Community</strong><br><br>First, may I speak to the opportunity we have to build on the legacy of a strong community. I believe that the most important lesson learned from September 11, 2001, concerns the blessings that come in being part of a strong community. Sabotaged airliners crashing into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon did not fracture the American psyche or produce a crushing fear in the hearts of the people because the common beliefs shared by Americans were a unifying force that drew us close together and gave us the strength to carry on. Americans became even more determined to protect our freedoms and stand against terrorism. I am reminded of the Nephites, who banded together "to support their lands, and their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty" (Alma 43:9). America rallied from New York in the east to California and Hawaii in the west in support of those who suffered most from the terrible events. We came closer together as a nation, willing to root out those with their secret combinations who would try to destroy our way of life. The enemy--a small band living in the wilderness and performing their terrorist acts in the cities of the world--would no longer be allowed to roam freely across the earth (see Helaman 2:11 and 3:23 for a close parallel).<br><br>As the principles of freedom united America during the past year, a common faith unites our community of higher learning. Brigham Young University is more than the sum of its individual parts. Generally the quality of a university is determined by summing the reputations of the faculty and staff. Faculty and staff accomplishments play a key role at BYU as well. But there is a force far beyond individual strengths that defines this institution. That force, the institution's greatest asset, is the common faith that binds us together and that defines the university as part of the Lord's kingdom and an integral part of His Church.<br><br>What can we do to continue building a strong sense of community? Obviously each person must live a righteous life. Each person should perform their professional role to the best of their ability. But there is one common assignment--easy to fulfill--that will bind us together more than any other. It is attendance at the weekly devotional. Last year faculty, staff, students, and the administration rose to the challenge, and attendance at devotionals doubled during the last 12 months. The response was tremendous. Again I issue a challenge for all of us to be in attendance throughout the new year. Students will be encouraged to do the same, but your influence is key in helping them see the value of devotionals.<br><br>As you know, we conduct an annual survey of alumni three years after their graduation. Every year the alumni identify the weekly devotional as the activity that had the most influence on their spiritual development at BYU. As faculty and staff, we invite you to attend every devotional in the Marriott Center. We ask you to help build a sense of community by discussing the subject matter for a brief moment in your classes or in the workplace that day or the next. Help us build a sense of community with the students. Encourage students to become full partners in building this part of the kingdom.<br><br><strong>Increased Student Quality</strong><br><br>My next topic concerns the steady increase in student quality, which is both a challenge and an opportunity. The Church continues to be blessed with rising generations of youth who possess marvelous gifts and talents. The quality of those attending BYU continues to rise both academically and spiritually, even though the standards of the world drift farther and farther from our own. Each year about 85,000 LDS youth graduate from high schools in North America. Many thousands more graduate in other countries around the world. When one considers the large numbers who would like to attend and the impact this institution has on their lives and the world, two questions arise. First: Who should be admitted? Second: How should the university make those decisions? The administration is concerned with these questions, along with the commissioner and the board of education.<br><br>A chart on GPAs for entering freshmen indicates the challenge that lies ahead. The average GPA 20 years ago was in the 3.3 to 3.4 range. Today, entering students average about 3.75, and the forecast for 2021 indicates a range of 3.9 to 4.0, if current admission criteria remain the same.<br><br>The second chart illustrates similar data for ACT scores. During the past 20 years the average ACT score for entering freshmen jumped from 23 to more than 27. A 20-year forecast suggests that scores will reach 30 as the applicant pool continues to grow. In fact, it may go higher for some specific reasons that we are looking at.<br><br>Because BYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character, other factors, in addition to GPA and ACT scores, are also considered. These include spiritual preparation, service, leadership, talents, and a person's unique background and experiences. Spiritual preparation is essential to those who wish to study here. Faithful participation in the programs of the Church and a demonstration of lives in harmony with the principles of the restored gospel are important indicators of that preparation. Endorsements by local ecclesiastical leaders and recommendations by seminary teachers and others are the tools used to evaluate spiritual preparation. Applicants who are not endorsed are not admitted, regardless of other qualifications.<br><br>Other universities with large applicant pools of highly qualified students also take into consideration factors other than GPAs and national test scores. These factors include leadership and service experiences, plus the general and specialized abilities of the applicants. The reasoning of other universities is that many potential leaders of society will not receive straight A's in high school or score necessarily at the highest level on national tests. To achieve a balance of interests and abilities in the student body, many universities, including ourselves, believe it is important that we consider these other factors as well. Clearly every student must be faithful and have a foundation in mathematics, writing, and the verbal skills necessary to succeed. But the admissions criteria may require some adjustments over time as the number of students with high academic scores continues to rise. To learn more about BYU admissions policies, please see admissions.byu.edu.<br><br>Two other characteristics of the BYU student body are worth noting. The first is the increasing multicultural diversity that reflects Church growth in the U.S. and around the world. The next chart illustrates the rapidly increasing number of U.S. multicultural students enrolled at BYU. These are not international students but U.S. citizens. The steep trend for U.S. multicultural students rises from less than 1,000 in 1986 to more than 3,000 in 2001. U.S.multicultural students represented only 3 percent of the student body 15 years ago, but represent 11 percent today. Forecasts for 20 years from now indicate that this group will approximate 7,000--almost 25 percent of the total student body. This category includes African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and others. It appears that in the 1990s many second-generation multicultural LDS members reached college age and qualified to enter BYU. As noted earlier, this trend is consistent with Church growth in the U.S. during the last 30 years.<br><br>The next chart illustrates the growth in international students at BYU. Today, Church membership outside North America is more than 50 percent, but the economic challenges faced by international members severely limit their attendance. Also, local schooling in foreign countries may lead to more employment opportunities for international students than they might have if they receive their education in the U.S. That is not always true, but in some instances it is. Even so, the number of international students at Brigham Young University has shown a steady increase over time. The number has risen from 1,400 in the early 1980s to almost 2,100 today, and by 2021 the forecast is in the neighborhood of 2,800, or almost 10 percent of the student body.<br><br>Given today's extraordinary, diverse student body and the exciting prospects for the future, it will require our best, both academically and spiritually, to challenge and support them in the learning process. Although our faculty have been trained at the best schools and may be at the forefront of their disciplines, the intellectual capacity of some students will exceed ours. The opportunity is to help them live up to their potential.<br><br>Most of our students are spiritually mature beyond their years. They have had experiences with the Spirit unlike their counterparts in the rest of the world. Many will sense a hollowness if we lack testimony or do not have the courage to defend the doctrines of the restored gospel. We must live in a manner that allows us access to the Spirit so that we may discern and fulfill the trust placed in us with regard to this extraordinary student body.<br><br><strong>Faculty and Staff Renewal</strong><br><br>Another challenge and opportunity is faculty and staff renewal. This takes two forms. The first is the personal quest of each faculty and staff member to be a lifelong learner and to engage in creative activities. Most faculty are engaged in scholarly activities that renew the spirit and energy of this institution and make it an exciting place for students. The university has been short of faculty development funds for a number of years. One of the key objectives for university development is to raise funds during the next five years to support more faculty renewal.<br><br>The second form of renewal comes through new hires. The next chart indicates that 537 new faculty have been hired during the last seven years and that another 305 will be hired in the next five, bringing the total to 842. That means approximately one-half of the faculty will be replaced in a 12-year period. This opportunity stems from the rapid growth of the university during the 1960s and 1970s, when many faculty were hired. Now, 30 years later, these faculty are reaching retirement age.<br><br>With almost no exceptions, the new faculty hired have come with exceptional training, new skills and interests, and a deep commitment to the intellectual and spiritual wellbeing of the students. The last few years have been an exciting time to be at this university. It has been enlightening to see the great interest the board takes in each new hire. The merits of every prospective candidate are discussed openly by the board before a commitment is made. Hiring decisions are the most important decisions made at this or any other university.<br><br>As we look ahead, the candidate pool for new faculty appears deep in most disciplines. There are a few areas where departments must become more engaged in encouraging graduates to leave and to prepare themselves as future faculty and also to help identify others who have not gone through our university but who are out there and who will fit our mold. Generally, however, there are extraordinary prospects that we have nurtured at the undergraduate level who are now at other institutions preparing to return. Again, we are in the midst of a major opportunity and challenge as we renew the faculty of the university. It behooves us to be very careful in making these decisions and in recognizing that there are really two screens that we work with. One is the academic screen, the professional screen. The other is the spiritual screen in terms of the kind of role models they will be for our students in every dimension.<br><br><strong>Mentored Student Learning Environment</strong><br><br>Two years ago the university announced plans to create a mentored student learning environment. This is a major opportunity that will change the future of BYU. Some parts of campus, especially the sciences, have used this model for many years. Student projects under faculty direction are commonplace in chemistry, physics, engineering, the fine arts, and a number of other disciplines. The intent is to spread the model throughout the campus. The objective is for every student--either individually or as a team member--to work closely with a faculty member on a project and publish a paper or exhibit a creative work before he or she leaves the university. During the past year I have learned of many new student-faculty projects that indicate that the learning model is being adopted. Students have become engaged in major research and creative projects in languages, biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, history, English, anthropology, business, the fine arts, and almost every other discipline. The BYU learning environment is changing.<br><br>During the first two years of the mentored learning program, the major sources of funds were ORCA fellowships and mentored student grants originating in associate vice president Gary Hooper's office. ORCA funds totaling some $250,000 to $300,000 have supported about 250 to 300 students on an annual basis. Mentored student learning grants totaled $600,000 in 2000 and grew to $1.1 million last year. The number of students supported by this program increased from 350 to almost 500 in 2001. In addition to benefiting students, mentored student grants also assist faculty. The number of faculty helped by this one program during 2001 totaled 115, or almost twice as many as the year before.<br><br>Since announcing the mentoring program, student support from outside research grants and contracts jumped from $2.5 million in 1999 to $3.6 million in 2001 and will be higher in 2002. A number of faculty have decided to include funds for undergraduates as well as graduates in their research proposals as a result of the discussions we've had regarding mentored student learning. We congratulate faculty members from across the university for their efforts in this regard.<br><br>Mentored student learning is one of the highest priorities on BYU's fund-raising agenda. The board has endorsed it, and the President's Leadership Council (or PLC) has embraced the concept. In fact, when we explained the mentored-learning program to the President's Leadership Council--a group of major donors themselves--they became excited and offered to match every unrestricted alumni dollar given to the university. They had a twofold purpose. The first was to encourage alumni to give more. The second was to support the program, which they were excited about. The results have been extraordinary. The matching program began in the fall of 2000. In that year unrestricted gifts from alumni totaled $2.3 million.<br><br>The matching portion, which covered only the last three months, equaled $2 million from our major donors. In 2001 alumni gifts increased 70 percent to $3.9 million as alumni learned about the match. The PLC's contribution jumped to $5.2 million. The reason the PLC match exceeded the alumni gifts is because the match is 5:1 for student gifts, 2:1 for alumni out less than five years, and 1:1 for alumni who have been gone five years or more. The forecast for 2002 is that we will receive slightly more from the alumni, $4.2 million, and that the PLC matches will be $5.5 million.<br><br>In January 2002, $3.7 million from those funds was disbursed to the colleges to support mentored student learning. This compares with $300,000 the year before. In some colleges the funds will be expended this year on mentored student programs alone. In other colleges the funds have been divided between current projects and the creation of an endowment that will support future endeavors. In January 2003 we expect to return another $4 million to the colleges. The funds retained by the university over and above what we are returning to the colleges are being used to support mentored student grants, professorships, and an endowment to support student projects in the future.<br><br>If one totals the funds from all sources, support for mentored student learning increased from $4 million in 2000 (funds largely used in 2001) to more than $12 million supporting activities in 2002. I believe the creation of this program is a defining moment in the history of Brigham Young University. The new program will bless undergraduate education especially, but graduate programs will receive additional funding as well. If we continue, the university will become the premier institution of undergraduate learning in the nation. No one our size has ever tried such an experiment. Our goal is to build an $80 million endowment during the next few years to further our progress toward this objective.<br><br>I believe the program has shown results already. If you remember, we reported the findings of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) study one year ago. The results were for the year 2000. Out of five factors in the report, BYU's "campus environment" was rated the most supportive for student learning in thenation. Our score placed BYU in the 99th percentile, and we became a benchmark university for this category. Our level of "academic challenge" was also among the highest, with a score of 94. The university scored well above average with respect to "active and collaborative" learning with a score of 75. The two areas that needed improvement were "student interactions with faculty" and "enriching educational experiences." Considering the last two benchmarks, a mentored student learning environment is the perfect answer.<br><br>Recently the university received these NSSE scores for the year 2001. We continue to have the best "campus environment" supportive of student learning with a score of 99. The level of "academic challenge" continues at a very high level with a score above 90. With respect to "active and collaborative learning," we improved five percentage points and now rank in the 80th percentile. The amazing part of the report is the improvement in "faculty-student interaction" and "enriching educational experiences," which now score in the 71st percentile, compared with the 12th and 25th, respectively, the year before. Although the mentored student learning program initiated two years ago may not account for all of the change, I believe it has played a significant role as students and faculty work together on projects and activities that lead to increased learning and future opportunities. The learning process is deepened through a mentored learning program. Students learn to work in teams, as they will in the working world, and they will have rewarding experiences in close association with faculty.<br><br>Two recent announcements by departments of the U.S. government will provide additional funding for mentoring at BYU. We are particularly pleased with the U.S. Department of Education's selection of BYU as the headquarters for the country's newly created National Middle East Language Resource Center. The new center will provide mentoring opportunities and internships in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish. BYU competed with more than 20 universities for this designation and will lead a consortium including Brown, Georgetown, Harvard, New York University, Princeton, and UCLA to improve language teaching and learning of the designated languages in the United States.<br><br>Also, BYU was recently selected as a flagship institution for the study of Chinese. BYU's Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages, our Language Research Center, and other campus units will work closely with the national foreign language center in an effort to improve and expand the acquisition of Chinese. Again, funds coming to the university will provide mentoring opportunities and internships for students.<br><br>Gary Hooper and his associates also believe that the mentored environment can be expanded to include the workplace at the university. BYU employs more than 10,000 students on a parttime basis. When work opportunities are shaped appropriately, BYU staff also serve as mentors in an enriched learning atmosphere. This type of environment already exists in a number of locations on campus. We ask the staff and its leaders to think carefully about the workplace and ways in which employment can become a learning opportunity.<br><br><strong>Technology as a Contributor to Learning</strong><br><br>The next challenge we will consider is the use of technology as part of the learning infrastructure. Every university in the nationis in the midst of introducing technology into the classroom and using distributed learning concepts to free both student and faculty to engage in more interactive learning.<br><br>There is a major effort underway at the university to become more strategic in our planning and use of technology. Professor Stephen Jones has been asked to oversee this area as an assistant to the academic vice president. He is working closely with the Office of Information Technology to ensure the adequacy of the technology infrastructure, which, not unexpectedly, has had some growing pains. He also is responsible for the Center for Instructional Design and coordinates the digital efforts of the library and the online program emanating from Independent Study. His responsibility, along with others, is to plan a careful, deliberate, and strategic approach to shape and control our use of technology as a support to both faculty and students. I strongly encourage the faculty to attend Alan Wilkins' and Stephen Jones' sessions this week as they outline new directions for supporting technology in the classroom.<br><br>During the last three years BYU has made considerable progress in the use of technology for educational purposes. The annual UCLA survey of technology use in the classroom illustrates the progress being made nationally and at BYU. It found that 39 percent of the faculty at all four-year institutions in 1999 used the Internet for placing or collecting assignments. BYU was slightly below the national norm at 35 percent. The survey was repeated three years later during the early part of 2002. Nationally the percentage jumped to 52 percent. Our progress exceeded that of the nation. The survey indicates that 54 percent of BYU faculty used the Internet during last winter semester for assignments and studentfaculty communication. During the same semester 99 percent of the students at BYU reported that they had at least one course that used Blackboard on the Internet. In fact, 25 percent of the students reported that they had three courses or more requiring Blackboard. Almost 80 percent of the students wished that all course assignments were on the Internet. In the survey of BYU students and faculty, the UCLA report indicated that a very large percentage believe that Blackboard improves access to course materials, improves class communication, and provides more flexibility for students and for faculty.<br><br>The UCLA study also measured the frequency with which BYU students use online communication. It found that 61 percent of first-year students and 69 percent of the seniors use the Internet several times a week, if not daily, and 80 percent of the freshmen and 87 percent of the seniors use it at least weekly. This use has grown dramatically over the last three years. The frequent use of the Internet by seniors to discuss or complete an assignment increased from 35 percent in 2000 to 62 percent in 2002. These statistics are in line with the national average.<br><br>The next slide illustrates the number of "hybrid" courses taken by BYU students during the last school year. A "hybrid" or "mixed" course includes both online and face-to-face components. The data indicate that 81 percent of first-year students and 80 percent of the seniors took one or more classes of a hybrid nature during the last school year. This penetration of online work into the traditional classroom has just begun. One year ago Graham B. Spanier, president of Pennsylvania State University, called "the convergence of online and resident instruction 'the single-greatest unrecognized trend in higher education' " (in Jeffrey R. Young, " 'Hybrid' Teaching Seeks to End the Divide Between Traditional and Online Instruction: By Blending Approaches, Colleges Hope to Save Money and Meet Students' Needs," Chronicle of Higher Education, 22 March 2002, A33). Today the hybrid trend is no longer a mystery. The hybrid model, if used appropriately, increases facultystudent interaction and speeds up the learning process. In contrast, the totally virtual model is appropriate only in those circumstances where face-to-face opportunities do not exist. Even then the virtual model can provide opportunities for faculty-to-student and student-tostudent interaction. We are exploring more and more ways in which we can increase student/faculty involvement.<br><br>The final chart in this section illustrates the feelings of the faculty with respect to the use of technology in the classroom. Seventyseven percent agree that technology is useful. Seventy-seven percent believe that the university provides adequate technical support. Seventy-two percent feel that they receive adequate instructional support. On the other hand, 49 percent believe they are appropriately rewarded for using technology. Many faculty believe that it should count toward rank and toward continuing status. We need to work on these issues. These same issues exist at other universities. We believe that we can improve the support faculty members receive, but we also believe that the data for BYU are better than the national averages.<br><br>Again, may I remind you of the important sessions in which we will discuss technology strategies going forward and the changes that we wish to implement. Also, there will be sessions in which hybrid models will be demonstrated. The faculty need to be part of these discussions. I encourage you to attend and become part of the dialogue.<br><br><strong>Campus Infrastructure</strong><br><br>I now turn to another challenge that faces us. It has to do with new buildings under construction and the temporary inconvenience caused for parking and pedestrian traffic. By now everyone knows of the new hole where the former Smith Family Living Center once stood. Truckloads of dirt are again leaving the campus every few minutes. It will take two and one-half years to complete the new Joseph F. Smith Building, which will house the College of Humanities and the School of Family Life. The building will be a beautiful addition to campus. It will be constructed of stone, brick, and glass and have an inner courtyard. The building will be situated so that a new plaza will be created between it and the library. Our expectation is that the new plaza will contain considerable greenery. The front of the building will be glass and will include a special gallery. A creative team headed by Professor Terry Warner is developing ideas and designing exhibits for it that will link revelation to the mission of the university. The new gallery will be a showplace for visitors and students to learn about the distinctiveness of Brigham Young University and its role in the kingdom.<br><br>On the north side of the new building will be a three-story underground parking terrace with spaces for 265 cars. The aboveground parking with its 120 spaces has been removed, and the area will be landscaped once the underground garage is completed. Current plans also call for a tunnel that will run under West Campus Drive from the Tanner Building toward the Knight Building. Although drivers have been very careful along this route, the volume of pedestrian traffic is so high that a tunnel seems warranted.<br><br>A smaller project currently underway is the construction of a nanotechnology laboratory north of the Eyring Science Center. The new underground structure will house highly sensitive equipment used to study and measure atoms. It will be used by many of our physical science, engineering, and biology and agriculture faculty.<br><br>The last set of buildings that may be under construction soon are the Indoor Athletic Practice Facility and its associated Student Athlete Center. We received permission from the board of trustees last year to raise funds and develop plans. We are in the final stages of fund-raising, and the plans are complete. We hope to receive permission from the board to begin construction shortly. The site locations of the buildings have changed numerous times as we have tried to preserve parking space. A decision has been made to place the Indoor Athletic Practice Facility on the east end of Haws Field and the Student Athlete Center on the south end of the football practice fields. The Student Athlete Center will contain athletic offices, meeting rooms, a large weight-training facility, a nutrition center, and the Student Athlete Academic Advisement Center.<br><br>You might be aware of the fact that our current facilities, primarily the Smith Fieldhouse and the Richards Building, were built in the 1950s and 1960s, when Brigham Young University had seven to eight intercollegiate teams and about 200 to 250 athletes. We are now shoehorning into those two facilities 21 intercollegiate teams and 650 athletes and their coaches and staff. There is a need for these new facilities.<br><br>After all construction projects are completed on campus, there will be a net addition of 73 parking spaces. During construction, however, there will be a loss of student parking below the hill in order to stage the construction and to compensate for faculty and staff parking losses on top of the hill.<br><br><strong>Teaching by the Spirit</strong><br><br>Let me close my remarks today on a more spiritual note. For some time I have thought about Brigham Young's challenge to Karl Maeser that every subject should be taughtunder the influence of the Spirit (see Alma P. Burton, Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1953], 26). What did he mean by this? I have generally understood that the instructor should be worthy of the promptings that come from the Holy Ghost, and the student likewise. This is consistent with the Lord's instructions to Joseph Smith in D&amp;amp;C 50. With a little license, verses 21 and 22 read as follows:<br><br><em>Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that receiveth the word by the Spirit of Truth receiveth it as it is [</em>taught<em>] by the Spirit of truth?</em><br><br><em>Wherefore, he that [</em>teaches<em>] and he that [</em>receives<em>], understand one another, and both are edified and rejoice together.</em> [D&amp;amp;C 50:21–22]<br><br>Is that the sum total of what President Young was asking Brother Maeser to do? Was his directive fulfilled by having the Holy Ghost's influence as a teacher and guide? If so, learning at this institution would be accelerated and the discovery of truth would be enhanced. I suspect, however, that the prophet would not be satisfied if Brother Maeser and those who followed him were to use only one of the gifts available through the Holy Spirit. Yes, the Holy Ghost is a great teacher and will lead us to truth. But there are many gifts that He is willing to share with those who are prepared and seek after them (see D&amp;amp;C 46:8).<br><br>For example, do we as faculty and staff seek the gift of discernment to know what our students comprehend and what they do not? Have you suddenly become aware of a particular student and realized that he or she missed a key point? I will never forget sitting on the stand as a bishop in a fast and testimony meeting. As I looked out over the congregation, I suddenly knew what each individual was thinking as they listened to the testimonies. I could tell which members needed help and the nature of the problems they were facing. Is it appropriate for a faculty member at Brigham Young University to enjoy this same power? Why not? The teacher with this gift senses the impact of his or her teaching and is able to assess what should be done to enhance student understanding. The gift allows one to tailor the help for each individual and to create more effective ways of communicating. Elder Maxwell often speaks of the Lord's ability to tailor lessons to each person's needs. I am convinced that the Lord will share this power with us if we seek after it. He will do so because our intent is to bless others.<br><br>What about the gift of love? This power is a fruit of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22). Do we ask the Lord to bless us with a special care and concern for those whom we teach? I know from personal experience that one becomes a more effective teacher when he or she has strong, positive feelings toward those being taught. Can you imagine the impact of a missionary who is indifferent to or even dislikes the investigators? Worthy missionaries are blessed in due course with a special gift of love for those they are called to serve. As a stake president I interviewed a large number of young men and women returning from the field. I could tell in a very short time how effective they had been as teachers by the feelings they had for the people. Is our calling to teach 30,000 young Church members any less signifi- cant? I believe we are entitled to this fruit, and our effectiveness depends on it. Without it we may instruct, but we will never edify!<br><br>Finally, I pray that each of us will have the gift of wisdom--even above the gift of knowledge. I pray that we will be wise in our relationships with students, that we will be sensitive to the trust that has been placed in us to nurture their testimonies. I hope we will be wise in using the resources made available to us. They are the consecrations of the Saints and include the widow's mite. May we have wisdom as we meet members whose children are not able to study with us. May we be wise inseeking ways for BYU to bless all members of the Church. May we have the wisdom to appreciate the incredible future of this university and the great opportunity and blessing it is to be a part of it. I love and appreciate you, brothers and sisters. I plead with the Lord daily for the wisdom and faith necessary to lead His university. May all of us commit to the eternal destiny of this institution is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

<h1>lections and Temples of Learning - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Sister Bateman and I are particularly pleased to welcome you to the new 2002–2003 school year at Brigham Young University. Normally the two of us share the podium during the devotionals. Because of a health challenge, Sister Bateman has asked that I represent the two of us today. We have been sweethearts for more than 40 years. Her experience during the last month has reinforced in my mind and heart how much she means to me and our family. Our prayers have become prayers of thankfulness. We are grateful that she is on the mend.<br><br>We extend a special welcome this morning to more than 5,000 new freshmen admitted to the university. We also welcome 3,500 returning missionaries, 1,500 transfer students, and 20,000 students returning from last year. You come from all 50 states and more than 110 countries and represent the peoples, languages, and cultures of the world. In addition, you understand the most important language of all--that of the Spirit.<br><br>Recently BYU received the results of a national survey rating universities according to five important "learning" categories. The purpose of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) is to measure the quality of academics at the various colleges and universities in America. Brigham Young University ranks high in all five areas. We are rated at the 99th percentile as one of the most "supportive campus environments" in the United States. This is the second year in a row in which BYU is a benchmark school. We are at the 91st percentile with regard to the "level of academic challenge." This means that BYU's academic expectations are among the highest in the nation.<br><br>This is important information for two reasons. First, it reflects the quality of the extraordinary faculty and staff at the university. Second, it is a warning--especially to freshmen and transfers--that the standards are high and you must put forth your best effort. You have been admitted because we believe you can succeed in this special environment, but it will require daily effort on your part. In high school it might have been possible for some to wait until the day before the examination to study. For those who procrastinate here, 19 out of 20 will not perform satisfactorily. A great many of you were "A" students before coming. This is a very competitive but supportive environment. All can succeed, but you must study two to three hours outside of class for every hour in class. I promise each of you that if you will be diligent in your studies, ask questions, and meet with faculty when you do not understand, you will have an incredible learning experience here.<br><br>In a different survey that has a much longer history, the university once again was named the number-one "stone-cold sober" school (see<i>The Best 345 Colleges</i>[New York: Random House/Princeton Review, 2002]; also see "The Best 345 College Rankings" at http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingTeaser.asp?CategoryID=4&amp;amp;TopicID=27). A little thought suggests that this ranking is related to the high score received as the most "supportive campus environment." The truth of the matter is that we can work hard and have fun without alcohol as a crutch. Today "forty-four percent of college students--and a whopping 75 percent of students in fraternities and sororities--are binge-drinkers. In April, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism underscored the seriousness of this issue by reporting that campus drinking contributes to 1,400 deaths, 500,000 injuries, and 70,000 cases of sexual assault yearly" (Robert Franek, "Publishing List of 'Party Schools' Is a Public Service,"<i>Deseret News</i>, 6 September 2002, A12).<br><br>How grateful we are for the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ that guide our lifestyle and provide us with the best campus in America.<br><br>Today I wish to address two topics. The first is the impact and import of the events that occurred one year ago. The second concerns this campus and its students as temples of learning.<br><h2><b>9/11</b></h2><br>Tomorrow is the one-year anniversary of the terrible events that occurred in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, when terrorists hijacked four airplanes in an attempt to rob America of its safety and security. On September 11, 2001, Sister Bateman and I were scheduled to give the first devotional of the school year. We awoke early to prepare for the day. During the morning we turned on the television to listen to the news. It was not long before the cameras shifted to New York and the north tower of the World Trade Center, which had just been hit. The announcer noted that an airplane had crashed into the tower, puncturing the building just below the 100th floor. They were uncertain as to whether it was an accident or a deliberate act. A short time later, while the cameras were still focused on the twin towers, another plane came into view headed for the second tower. What followed was an unbelievable sight. United Flight 175 continued its course, crashing into the south tower. At that point it was apparent that the acts were deliberate, the planes had been hijacked, hundreds of lives had been taken, and thousands were now in danger. The floors that had been hit became drenched with airplane fuel, and soon the towers were raging infernos in the upper reaches of the buildings. All of us watching feared for the lives of those who were on the upper floors. Little did we understand what was about to happen. Within an hour the blazing heat generated by the fireball melted the steel infrastructure, bringing the south tower crashing to the ground. The north tower followed 29 minutes later.<br><br>As Sister Bateman and I watched, we became concerned about the students at BYU. It did not seem appropriate to move forward with the regular devotional, but we felt a strong need to gather the BYU community together to briefly discuss the events and then counsel together regarding the challenges that lay ahead. In the special devotional one year ago, we indicated that there was no reason to fear for our lives or the lives of loved ones unless they were in the planes or at the sites of impact.<br><br>We also noted the importance of being respectful of all people. We have students from most countries on campus. How important it was then and now to be kind and considerate of every individual. For thousands of years innocent people have been ill-treated because of ethnicity, nationality, or religious persuasion. Our own history reveals the ignorance and intolerance endured by our ancestors as they were driven from Missouri to Nauvoo to the Rocky Mountains. Intolerance on this campus is an anachronism--something out of place, something not suited to this location. This campus is and must continue to be a haven of peace and understanding where each individual is seen and treated as a child of God.<br><br>One year ago we stated that the only answer to these terrible acts is the good news--the gospel of Jesus Christ. This earth will find peace only when its citizens come to know the Prince of Peace. But we need not wait for others to find peace. By living the gospel each of us may receive an inner assurance that all is well. We have access to the Holy Ghost, who is the Comforter. Near the end of the Last Supper, Jesus turned to His disciples and said, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27). Even though He knew of the agony and trial of the next few hours, Jesus told His disciples that they would find peace. As Latter-day Saints, we are part of the greatest mission for peace the world has ever known.<br><br>Looking back one year, what are the lessons learned? The first is that we can make the world safer than it was, but it is not easy to root out evil when a small group of people separate themselves from civilized society, are well funded, live in a wilderness, and strike with an element of surprise against innocent people. The Book of Mormon tells about a similar terrorist group and the chaos that ensued when the general society also turned away from God. Fortunately, we know that in the last days the kingdom of God will not be destroyed but will spread across the earth--touching every nation, kindred, tongue, and people and preparing the earth for the return of its Creator. In the long run, al-Qaeda will not succeed.<br><br>A second lesson was taught by the New York firefighters and policemen who put duty before life. As the occupants of the towers were coming down the stairwells, they met the firemen going up. A new set of heroes was born. Recently an eight-year-old boy was leaving Shea Stadium in New York after a Mets baseball game. As he was crossing the street, he saw a police officer directing traffic. The boy approached him and asked the officer if he would sign his baseball glove.<br><br>The policeman looked at the young boy and said, "Don't you want a ballplayer's autograph? Why a cop's?"<br><br>The boy answered, "Because you saved the world."<br><br>There is a greater respect and awareness today for those civil servants who risk their lives in the course of duty.<br><br>Another lesson comes from the testimony of Church members who lost loved ones. Sister Mary Alice Wahlstrom and her daughter were on American Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles when it was diverted by hijackers and flown into the north tower of the World Trade Center. Almost a year later Margaret Wahlstrom, Sister Wahlstrom's daughter-in-law, stated the following: "I wish I could give everybody a testimony of the gospel. You're taught all these things throughout your life, and all of a sudden you have to live them. When something bad happens, you find out how strong your testimony is and if you believe in the Atonement--and you find out that you do."<br><br>There are some problems associated with the events of 9/11 yet to be resolved. The World Trade Center has been cleaned up, but some people still live in fear that another tragedy will occur. Al-Qaeda's forces have been reduced, but pockets of terrorists remain and continue to plan events. The world economy, although headed into recession prior to 9/11, was dealt a severe blow by those events and is still trying to recover.<br><br>On the other hand, the civilized world is more unified than before, more willing to stand together against those who would destroy our way of life. And from the ashes of last September has arisen a stronger America--one more committed to freedom, one more caring of those in need. Perhaps most important of all, a younger generation has been exposed to acts of war and tyrants who want to force their beliefs on others. The events of 9/11 will always be a warning in their memories that freedom is not guaranteed but must be protected. Finally, many people have been led to ask questions about the purpose of life and are searching for answers.<br><h2><b>Temples of Learning</b></h2><br>Now I turn to my second topic for the day: temples. I wish to share with you my view of BYU as a temple of learning. I also wish to point out that you, as individuals, are holy temples of God yourselves and therefore should protect your bodies and souls because they are sacred. The dictionary defines a temple as "a building or place dedicated to worship or the presence of deity." As you know, LDS temples are dedicated homes to deity. On every temple appear the words "House of the Lord." LDS temples are also places where sacred priesthood ordinances are performed. Temples in our religion have three major purposes.<br><br>The first is to provide men and women with a vision of their eternal potential.<br><br>The second is to provide instruction as to how we can achieve the goals God has set for us.<br><br>The third is to link us through ordinances and covenants to the grace and power of Christ's Atonement so that we may receive a fulness.<br><br>Now, consider how BYU might be a temple of learning. Is it a home for deity? Does it have a responsibility to help young people understand their potential in both mortality and eternity? Does it have a sacred as well as a secular responsibility to help you reach your ultimate destiny? Is there power in teaching you how to learn and providing you with knowledge concerning heaven and earth? The answer to each question is, "Yes!" Brigham Young told Karl G. Maeser that Brigham Young University was to be a home for the Holy Spirit (see Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1953], 26). This member of the Godhead should be present in every classroom and pervade the university. His presence softens and enhances relationships between faculty and students and affects student-to-student relationships as well. His presence also enhances the learning process. The seeking of knowledge--both temporal and spiritual--is a sacred responsibility given to every woman and man. On this subject the Lord has said:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God.</i><br><br>The scripture then shifts to secular matters:<br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms.</i><br><br>And then the Lord indicates why we are to learn both spiritual and secular subjects:<br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:77–80]<br><br>Everyone here today and everyone hearing this broadcast has been called by the Lord to a special mission. The more we know about things in heaven and in the earth, the more effective we will be in accomplishing the commission given us. The Aims of a BYU education are designed to this end. They are to increase your intellectual capacities and understandings, to enlarge you spiritually, to build your character, and to help you become lifelong learners and lifetime servants.<br><br>Two weeks ago I shared with the freshmen during their orientation one of the most sacred moments I have experienced on this campus. I wish to share it again because it illustrates the blessing and power of this university as a temple of learning. Almost two years ago the Palmyra Temple was dedicated. Prior to the dedication First Presidency instructions were for students to gather in local Provo chapels to view the services. After some investigation it was determined that few students would be able to attend because local Saints would fill the chapels. Consequently I asked President Hinckley if the services could be shown in the Marriott Center. Although there was some concern that it would be difficult to feel the spirit of the services in this large space, permission was granted.<br><br>Students with recommends were asked to be in their seats at least 30 minutes before the services began. The outside doors of the building were locked 20 minutes before. I arrived early and took a seat on the floor. As I entered this space through one of the tunnels, I immediately noticed the extreme quiet in the room. There were no sounds. There was no whispering. Almost every student had a set of scriptures, and each was quietly reading or pondering the events of the next two hours. A quiet, reverent attitude prevailed throughout the dedication. Following the dedicatory prayer, 20,000 students stood in this arena and with white handkerchiefs waving repeated the Hosanna Shout. It was electric! The sea of handkerchiefs was like fields of grain waving in the wind. I have attended a number of temple dedications, but not one like that.<br><br>Following the closing hymn and prayer, the Holy Spirit pervaded every corner of this room. We watched President Hinckley and others depart the celestial room of the Palmyra Temple. I then approached the microphone and excused those in attendance to return to their classes. The few of us on the floor stood and waited for the audience to leave. But no one moved. After another minute or two I returned to the microphone again and invited those in attendance to return to class. Slowly, quietly, people arose and left the building. It was one of the great, spiritual moments of my time at the university. This building literally became an extension of the Palmyra Temple during those two hours.<br><br>I now understand better the dream given to Karl G. Maeser in the 1880s during a very difficult financial period for the university. Brother Maeser became so discouraged with the lack of resources for the university that he decided to take a job at the University of Utah. He told his wife and daughter to pack the household goods and prepare to move. This they did, and then they waited two days. On the third day the daughter finally asked when they would leave. Brother Maeser replied: "I have changed my mind. I have had a dream--I have seen Temple Hill [upper campus] filled with buildings--great temples of learning, and I have decided to remain and do my part in contributing to the fulfillment of that dream" (from<i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years,</i>eds. Ernest L. Wilkinson and Leonard J. Arrington, vol. 3 [Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976], 3).<br><br>Brigham Young University is a great temple of learning. Each building has been dedicated to the Lord as a house of learning. The university will fulfill its destiny. How will you do your part?<br><br>I noted earlier that each of us is a temple of God. Our bodies have been so designated because they are designed to house the Holy Ghost as well as our own spirit. In scripture, Jesus was the first to speak of the body as a temple. After cleansing the Jerusalem temple of the money changers and merchants, the Jews asked Jesus for a sign of His authority. He said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2:19). The Jewish questioners thought He was referring to the building, but we know that He was referring to His body.<br><br>Writing to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul described sexual sin as a sin against one's own body and then used the temple metaphor to indicate the seriousness of such acts. He said:<br><br><i>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</i><br><br><i>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</i>[1 Corinthians 6:19–20]<br><br>To some the last sentence may seem strange. If we own anything on this earth, one would expect it to be our body and our spirit. In a sense that is true. We are our own person. But Paul is pointing out that Christ's Atonement determines what we become. We still have our agency, but He paid for our future possibilities. In that sense He owns us. We still must submit to Him. We still must give ourselves to Him.<br><br>In the garden and on the cross, the Savior's Atonement made possible our sanctification through the power of His blood and the help of the Holy Ghost. If we strive to live the gospel, our bodies become temples in which the Spirit of God resides. The price paid by the Savior insures that our bodies and spirits will overcome death and be raised to a higher state. By living close to the Holy Ghost, the day will come when we will be changed from mortals to immortals, and our souls will receive a celestial glory. In terms of everything that counts, Christ owns us.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, treat your bodies with the utmost care. The world does not understand what we have just discussed. It does not understand the Atonement. It does not appreciate the sacred nature of the body. Not only does the body house the Holy Spirit, but it also contains the sacred power of life. The power to give life is a godly power granted to us for a season. How we protect and use it is of utmost importance to our salvation.<br><br>When we understand that the body is a temple, we will not deface it. When we understand the sacredness of the body, we will understand the importance of modest dress. We will understand the incongruity of individuals stripping to the waist and painting their faces and bodies at football games. We will do all in our power to stay away from pornographic materials of all kinds. In this regard, one of the most serious challenges facing young people today, especially young men, is the availability of pornographic material. It is more addictive than cocaine. Do not take it into your temple. It has the power to destroy you. It destroys relationships between men and women. It distorts the mind. Stay away from it. If you know of anyone caught in this mire, do not pass them by. Insist that they get help. People caught in this web find it very difficult to break the chains that bind them, but there are professionals who can help.<br><br>May I thank you for the exceptional people you are. An integral part of the life of this university is the presence of the Holy Ghost abiding in you. Brigham Young University is a temple of learning. We are temples. The Lord told Joseph Smith that every person is entitled to a gift of the Spirit (see D&amp;amp;C 46:11). As we assemble in the weekly devotional, each person brings a gift that can be shared with others. That is how we become a Zion people. That's why we have wards and stakes, so we can share those gifts. No wonder the alumni tell us that the most important activity on campus for their spiritual development was the weekly devotional. I implore you to attend every week in the Marriott Center and turn this room into a temple. Bring your scriptures. Come in your Sunday dress. Robert Foster, our BYUSA president, invited the freshmen two weeks ago to do the same. I promise all who come a clearer vision of their destiny and more power to achieve it.<br><br>In closing, may we remember and honor those whose lives were lost in last year's tragedy. May we live in a manner that will add to the Spirit in this temple of learning. May each of us be worthy receptacles of the Holy Ghost. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Merrill J. Bateman was president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 10 September 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>e Fire Within - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a delight to be here. I have a very fond place in my heart for this wonderful institution and for all of the great work that is accomplished here. Thank you for joining me this morning. I would like to recognize my wife, Jennifer, with me here on the stand. She is my angel. I am also delighted to have my parents and children here.<br><br>On February 17, 2002, nervous anticipation filled the Salt Lake Ice Center for Apolo Ono's first Olympic short-track, speed-skating final, the 1,000 meters. Apolo was heralded as an Olympian who had a chance to win four gold medals. He typically waits until late in the race to make his move, and this race was no different. With two laps remaining, he finally moved to the front of the pack of five skaters. On the very last corner, Apolo and Li Jiajun from China bumped lightly, then Li bumped Ahn Hyun-soo from Korea, and in an instant they found themselves spilled across the ice, sliding into the padded walls. Only the Australian, Steven Bradbury, remained upright to cross the finish line, the first Australian ever to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics. As he would later say, his strategy worked perfectly--he hoped the others would crash.<br><br>As Steven was crossing the finish line, the crowd breathed a collective groan, their hopes of an American gold medal fallen with Apolo, who was also injured in the crash with a gash that would require six stitches. Largely unnoticed in the instantaneous aftermath of the fallen skaters, Apolo scrambled to get up and slide, skate first, across the finish line. He knew that winning the silver medal was still possible and that what would determine his order of finish would be when his skate crossed the line. He barely edged out the Canadian for the silver medal. During the medal ceremony Apolo exuded how thrilled he was. He didn't lose the gold. He won the silver. When Apolo fell, he not only got up, he got up quickly.<br><br>I would like to touch on a few lessons for life that we can learn--each illuminated from events in the Olympics. One of life's experiences is that we all get knocked down. As in Apolo's case, we are never sure what is around the next corner. In our case, we may not get knocked down on ice, but we can experience reversals in health, finances, or with family, friends, or other areas. Our challenge is what happens next. We need to get up and get up quickly. In our theme song for the Games, "Light the Fire Within," sung by LeAnn Rimes, we find the following:<br><br><i>And if we fall,</i><br><i>We won't stay down.</i><br><i>We will get back up</i><br><i>And use the strength we've found--</i><br><i>And we will rise</i><br><i>Like champions.</i><br><br><i>Every obstacle we'll overcome.</i><br><i>Once in every lifetime</i><br><i>There's a chance to stand apart.</i><br><i>We can show the world</i><br><i>Our very best,</i><br><i>Reveal what's in our hearts.</i><br><br><i>And so the story goes and glory</i><br><i>Never will end.</i><br><i>Inspiration lights</i><br><i>The fire within.</i><br>["Light the Fire Within," by David Foster and Linda Thompson]<br><br>Everyone faces challenges we never thought would come our way. The key question we face as a result of these reversals or trials is whether it will bring us closer to God. I believe we face this basic choice every time we encounter these difficulties: Will it push us farther away from God or bring us closer to Him? We should see more clearly our complete dependency upon God and humble ourselves in our relationship with Him.<br><br>The people of Alma provide an inspiring example and enlightenment on the trying times we encounter. In Mosiah 24:15 we read: "The Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord." I believe one of the great purposes of the burdens we face is to recognize our dependence upon the Lord and to submit our will to His. Indeed, the Savior is our schoolmaster in this principle. In 3 Nephi 27:13 the Savior said, "I came into the world to do the will of my Father." Is that not also true of us? Are we here to do the will of our Father? When we encounter such trials in our lives and at times feel helpless on our own to resolve them, we can turn to our Father for that source of divine assistance and in turn more closely mesh our will with His.<br><br>A second lesson was embodied in the experience of Jimmy Shea, Jr. Several years ago we asked the International Olympic Committee, or IOC, to add the skeleton back to the Winter Olympic program, particularly in light of the fact that, at the time, Jimmy Shea was one of the best in the world. We wanted the U.S. to do well in these Games. The skeleton is a sport in which competitors lie on a sled face first and fly down a bobsled track at 80 miles per hour.<br><br>Jimmy dreamed of becoming part of the first three-generation Olympic family in history, with both his father and grandfather having competed in the Olympics. We invited them to participate in the opening ceremonies, but then we were all struck by the tragic death of his 91-year-old grandfather last December when his car was hit by a drunk driver.<br><br>The day of the skeleton competition began with a light snow falling. Expectations were not high for Jimmy Shea, since for the past season his performance had not been up to what it had been previously. He had also been recovering from invasive surgery to his leg. However, after the end of the first of two runs, everyone was astonished to see him in first place. Because the athletes compete in reverse order of the standings, in the second run Jimmy would be last. The snow continued to fall, potentially making the track slower, even though we briefly cleaned it between each competitor. Jimmy began with a lead of five one-hundredths of a second, and as he moved through the turns, his lead became less and less. As he passed through the final time interval before the end, he was actually behind by one one-hundredth of a second. Experts in the sport tell you that it is impossible to make up time at the very end of the track. But when Jimmy Shea finished the last three turns, he ended up winning the gold by five one-hundredths of a second. We had witnessed a very magical, emotional moment, especially when he took a picture of his recently deceased grandfather out of his helmet. When asked how many Sheas were on the sled, Jimmy answered, "Two." His father suggested that Grandfather Shea gave him a little extra push. It was like Jimmy had a divine hand pushing him down that last part of the track.<br><br>During the Games I am certain we had a divine hand with us. There were many instances when we received assistance beyond our capabilities. There was one area in particular that would dramatically affect the outcome of the Games--the weather. Wind and snow are very problematic--though you wouldn't think so for the Winter Games. For example, we turned the downhill run into a sheet of ice. We used a water bar to inject water every eight inches into the entire slope and then let it freeze. The competitors' skis bite more effectively and consistently into an icy surface. Imagine flying down a sheet of ice at 80 miles per hour. When it snows, it ruins the prepared surface, and we start over with 27 Sno-Cats and 1,600 volunteers just for the downhill runs.<br><br>We enjoyed miraculously superb weather during the Games, beginning with a storm the morning of the opening ceremonies to blow out the inversion and to put a blanket of white on the mountains. During the 17 days of the event we showcased the majestic, white mountains and deep blue skies of Utah. We could not have scripted better weather. It made a fundamental difference to the outcome of our Games.<br><br>As the closing ceremonies approached, I kept an eye on an approaching storm that was forecast to hit that evening. Late in the afternoon of the closing ceremonies I was in the stadium monitoring the load-in when the storm hit with large black clouds and then rain. It cleared out before the start of the ceremonies, but the forecast called for a major windstorm to come through between 7:30 and 9 p.m., right in the heart of our program. Winds would be a problem. They would hinder the dinosaurs, prevent the large balloons from being used, and, worst of all, cancel the fireworks--more than 36,000 shells.<br><br>I stayed in touch by cell phone with our weather center, which was tied into ground-monitoring stations for hundreds of miles. Each successive report updated the storm approaching Salt Lake from the west. Then, at 7:30, I received a call that went something like this: "The strangest thing has happened. A wind has come in from the east, which almost never happens. It has stalled the wind front over the Great Salt Lake, so you are good to go for the entire show."<br><br>A feeling similar to electricity coursed through me. The closing ceremonies came off perfectly, and just 15 minutes after the stadium emptied, the storm hit with ferocity, tearing to shreds left-behind ponchos and programs. Mitt Romney and I watched this and commented that this was like a divine punctuation mark of who is really in charge. In our minds the weather was divinely provided.<br><br>We know we had a divine hand with us. We all have a divine hand in our lives. Our Father in Heaven and His Son care deeply for each of us. We need to recognize that They are ever present beside us to guide us along the way if we will but reach out to take the hand that is offered. It is real. It is a marvelous comfort. It is ever present, as we are worthy. It can keep us focused on our true mission in life as we take that divine hand and let it remind us and guide us in what we do. Remember that it is there.<br><br>One of the Olympic firsts for our Games was to choose a theme and amplify it through everything we did. Our theme was "Light the Fire Within," suggesting to us all to strive harder, to reach higher to accomplish things we never thought possible. It also tied to the idea of inspiring others with that light kindled within each of us. You probably recall seeing the children of light throughout our ceremonies and at the Medals Plaza. The athletes certainly exemplify the theme of "Light the Fire Within" and the inspiration of achievement. There are dozens of stories, but one in particular is very poignant.<br><br>Eighteen months before the Games, Chris Klug lay on an operating table wondering if he would live. In 1998 he competed in Nagano in the men's snowboard parallel giant slalom, finishing just out of the medals. His resolve was to compete in his home country, the United States. But in the summer of 2000 he was diagnosed with a life-threatening liver disease--the same disease that had taken the life of Walter Payton. Chris was wasting away, losing 30 pounds awaiting a liver transplant--a highly risky procedure, but his only hope to live. His operation was successful. He went into a special but very difficult training regimen, hoping to once again compete. At the Games he unexpectedly made it into the final round, and then--unbelievably--he won the bronze medal. He is the only organ transplant recipient ever to do so, and he won the medal on National Organ Transplant Awareness Day.<br><br>Chris was another example of "Light the Fire Within." He had been knocked down but got back up and reached heights as yet unconquered. Focus and determination resulted in what almost all thought impossible. Each of us can strive to reach heights that may not seem possible today. Life is full of many twists and turns, and it is so exciting to contemplate what lies ahead of you. As you reach to light the fire within you, you become an inspiration to those around you. What you reach for may be in studies, career, or service to others. But it may also be to light the divine fire within yourself. Each of us has the seeds of divinity within us, lying dormant until we consciously plant them and nourish them to grow. Many times the goal may seem infinitely distant and the journey uncertain and challenging, but making that journey is what allows us to accomplish what we never thought possible and imparts some of life's great lessons. So let each of us look inside ourselves to see how we may light that fire within and achieve more than we may think possible.<br><br>Certainly that was the case with the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. I recall looking from the outside at the organization as the bribery scandal unfolded. I thought, "What a tragedy for our community, especially since we try to be the most honest of people." Yet here were some of the headlines from around the world: "Biggest Scandal to Ever Hit the Olympics," "Oly Scandal Leads to Resignation," "Olympic Shame." When I traveled across the U.S. or abroad during those times and mentioned that I was from Utah, I was met with comments about bribery and dishonesty. The thought of having great Olympic Games seemed an improbable dream.<br><br>Yet the people of Utah did have a dream to host the world. As the new management of SLOC, our objective was to do it in such a way that the past would fade away and be replaced with memories of magical Games. We had been knocked down, but it was time to get up and do what many thought impossible: put on great Games.<br><br>The Games were indeed magical. The headlines read: "The Little City That Could Did," "2002 Olympics Light the Fire Within," "Basking in Olympic Spirit," and "Unbelievable Games." Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said, "The Salt Lake Games are far and away the most successful Olympics, summer or winter, in history." Jean Claude Killy said, "Salt Lake, we will always remember you. These were perfect Games."<br><br>Our collective success had many sources. We had a great team, led by my partner Mitt Romney. We had superb organization. We had a divine hand of assistance. But one key factor noted throughout the world were the wonderful volunteers. President Jacques Rogge said to the world in the closing ceremonies, "Volunteers, you are, with the athletes, the champions of these Games. Your generosity and profound kindness has won our hearts. You were marvelous." President Gordon B. Hinckley said in general conference last April, "I compliment and thank our people who participated in such numbers and so generously ... to make of this a wonderful and most significant event" ("The Church Goes Forward,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 6). So I am here to thank the wonderful volunteers from the community and BYU. Thank you, BYU, for lending us thousands of your superb students and for the wonderful job they did in hosting the world.<br><br>I would like to tell you a key statistic regarding these volunteers. In every Games previous to ours, the attrition rate of volunteers was 15 to 20 percent. In our Games we had attrition of less than 1 percent--an Olympic record.<br><br>As a thank-you for BYU's partnership in hosting these Games, allow me to present you with an Olympic torch. President Bateman, you will note that the inscription on the torch reads, "Light the Fire Within," something exemplified by your fine students.<br><br>Last summer, in commemorating the pioneers, President Hinckley quoted Brigham Young, who said, "Kings and emperors and the noble and wise of the earth will visit us here" (in<i>Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S. Brown</i>[Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1900; New York: AMS Press, 1971], 122; cited by Preston Nibley in<i>Brigham Young: The Man and His Work</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1936], 128). During the Games we had more than 140 dignitaries from around the world, in addition to our own president, vice president, and most of the cabinet. After the conclusion of the Games, President Hinckley said in April conference that "we have witnessed the fulfillment of that prophecy in these recent days" ("The Church Goes Forward," 6). He also said, "But out of all of this came something wonderful for this Church. Representatives of the media, so often a tough and calloused group, with very few exceptions spoke and wrote in language both complimentary and accurately descriptive of a unique culture they found here ... , of the spirit of hospitality which they felt" ("The Church Goes Forward," 5).<br><br>Now when I travel around the world and mention that I am from Salt Lake City, a smile comes to the eyes, followed by a warm handshake thanking us for marvelous Games. These Games were important for our community and for the Church. Many around the world did not even know of us, but now they do. And their reactions are almost universally positive and warm. Salt Lake City is now an Olympic city, and one with the magical Games.<br><br>As we continue our journey in life, let us follow some of these simple lessons. We will get knocked down--and many times unexpectedly--but when we do, let's get up, and let's get up quickly. Let's rely on the Lord and use the opportunity to draw closer to Him and align our will more with His. Let us take His divine hand every step of the way throughout our lives to navigate the many challenging turns that await us. And let's light the fire within to achieve more than we perhaps think possible. Let's light the divine fire within each of us to realize the divine potential we each have.<br><br><i>Fraser Bullock was president and CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Olympic Winter Games when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 1 October 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

This year the Brigham Young University College of Nursing celebrates its 50th anniversary. It all began in 1952. That year David O. McKay was our prophet, Dwight D. Eisenhower was our president, and Dick Clark began<i>American Bandstand.</i>The BYU College of Nursing held a fashion design contest for the nursing uniform. Students wore this winning entry. Thank goodness for men now being in the profession or we might still be wearing that little blue dress to school every day. A lot has changed in 50 years!<br><br>Though the College of Nursing began at BYU in 1952, Church leaders, through the Relief Society, had always supported nursing education. Belle Spafford was then general president of the Relief Society (and she served on the panel of judges for that winning nurses uniform contest) (see Maurine M. Harris, comp.,<i>History of the Brigham Young University College of Nursing, Volume 1</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1974], 9; also see private scrapbook collection, Brigham Young University College of Nursing). Sister Spafford received an honorary degree at BYU commencement the same year the Nightingale Pledge was taken by the first BYU nursing graduates. Today is her birthday. Born 107 years ago on October 8, Sister Spafford was general president of the Relief Society for nearly 30 years, from 1945 to 1974. Those were my growing-up years. Through my mother and grandmother, who spoke her name in reverence, Sister Spafford was my first exposure to the work of the Relief Society.<br><br>Over the last decade the College of Nursing has adopted a theme I would like to explore. The phrase is "I would learn the healer's art," a line from the third verse of the hymn written by Susan Evans McCloud and K. Newell Dayley ("Lord, I Would Follow Thee,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 220).<br><br>Our heritage of learning the healer's art began at the very dawn of the restored Church. Soon after the Relief Society was organized in 1842, the Prophet Joseph Smith set apart "noble and lofty women . . . to go about among the sick and minister to their wants" (in "Nursing in the Relief Society,"<i>Relief Society Magazine</i>2, no. 7 [July 1915]: 316–17). When the Saints arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young established a Council of Health. Women went east to medical school. In 1873 (the year Linda Richards graduated in New England as the first professional nurse in the United States) President Young called for three women from each ward in the Church to study nursing. Eliza R. Snow personally traveled the valley recruiting nursing students "for Zion's sake" (in "An Address by Miss Eliza R. Snow,"<i>Woman's Exponent</i>2, no. 8 [15 September 1873]: 63). The first classes were taught by the women doctors of the Church. Graduates "were blest and set apart for their professional work" (in "Home Affairs, Classes in Obstetrics,"<i>Woman's Exponent</i>10, no. 6 [15 August 1881]: 44). One of my favorite images is the picture of Dr. Ellis Shipp surrounded by her nursing students. (As a dean, I wish I could sit in my Sunday best bedecked with flowers and surrounded by adoring students with tidy coifs and starched white uniforms.)<br><br>By 1898 the Relief Society School of Nursing was begun. Sister Emma A. Empey served as superintendent of the school and supervisor of charity nursing during its entire tenure. She was the Florence Nightingale of the BYU College of Nursing. Tuition was $50 for the entire program. Graduates were set apart by priesthood leaders and "honor bound" to serve where needed and to charge no more than $6 per week ("Pioneer Midwives," in Kate B. Carter, comp.,<i>Our Pioneer Heritage</i>[Salt Lake City: Daughters of Utah Pioneers, 1963], 6:493–94).<br><br>Those early nurses were not only trained in the latest science but they faithfully learned and practiced the art of healing. They saw their work as a spiritual calling. They often stayed with families for whom they cared, they prayed with them and for them, and they called for the elders for priesthood blessings. The women of the Relief Society founded the Deseret Hospital in 1882 specifically to provide quality health care in an environment of faith and healing. By 1905 the Groves LDS Hospital was established. It became the mother school of the University of Utah and Brigham Young University Colleges of Nursing.<sup>1</sup><br><br>It is an honor to serve among faculty and students with such a heritage who temper their fascination for science with a devotion to the Lord and understand that it is the Savior, Jesus Christ, who is the source of all healing.<br><br>I have shared before my memory of the first day I set out to practice healing. It was not quite 50 years ago--but close. I could hardly sleep the night before my first day as a nurse. I remember it so vividly. The spring air was cool, and the sun seemed unusually bright. Two conflicting feelings left my heart pounding. First, I felt courage and couldn't wait to put that first tube into the first orifice. On the other hand, I was afraid that by sheer inexperience I would violate the promise to "do no harm." As a student nurse I did not have the blessing of the computer-simulated patient that our students now have.<br><br>Today BYU College of Nursing students can program a mannequin they call Sam to have any illness or injury. He responds to their treatments and drugs. Student nurses have actually killed him a few times! Consequently, they also learn how to resuscitate him as well as any doctor on TV can.<br><br>That first day I carefully pulled on my support hose, little white nylon dress, and ugly prescription shoes. My crowning glory was the starched white cap that held my long hair tucked tightly beneath. I couldn't wait to handle the instruments, titrate the fluids, and perform the treatment procedures. I wanted to cure. I wanted to care. I wanted to heal.<br><br>I have learned a lot about healing since that day. I have learned that healing is a process of restoring and becoming whole. This morning I would like to share six lessons I have learned about the healer's art.<br><h2><b>Healing Hurts</b></h2><br>First, healing hurts. When I was a young nurse in the hospital, hardly a day went by that a patient did not ask, "Will it hurt?" If I had been truthful, the whispered answer would nearly always have been, "Yes, it will hurt." I have learned that healing hurts. Life hurts. Healing really only begins when we face the hurt in its full force and then grow through it with all the strength of our soul. For every reward of learning and growing, some degree of pain is always the price. Author M. Scott Peck reminds us that if you do not want love or pain, you "must do without many things" (M. Scott Peck,<i>The Road Less Traveled</i>[New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978]: 133). I think you would do without dating, graduating, getting married, or having children.<br><br>Sometime in your life you will know a crashing crisis or heavy heartache that will threaten all sense of logic or hope or certainty--from which, no matter how you emerge, nothing will ever be the same. Hurts come as unique losses, unwelcome surprises, fading hope, or grief.<br><br>This semester you may not get the 4.0 grade point average you need to keep your scholarship, or you may not get your first choice in graduate school or career. Perhaps that special person did not have the same "revelation" you think you had. Maybe this is the best you will ever look. Maybe someone you counted on wasn't there for you. Perhaps someone in your past hurt you deeply. I know that pain. Also, I live a little of every day waiting for heaven to see my son and mother again. Last semester two of our nursing students lost their fathers. I imagine that no success in school or career or life will be quite the same for them.<br><br>Some of us suffer the wrenching consequences of sin or just poor judgment. Some of you may now be entangled in activities with others--or perhaps on the Internet--that you wish you had never started. Or you may have fallen into a trap of debt. We hurt when we see our own failures or helplessly watch the unwise decisions of others. Our lives are changed forever not only by the pain but by facing our need to heal.<br><br>Sometimes we simply have too many demands or feel like we just don't measure up. Daily life's hundreds of additive stresses can drain hope and energy, drop by drop, toward spiritual depletion--leaving a need to heal. Pain is part of living. Pain brings us to the source of healing.<br><br>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland warned:<br><br><i>The world around you is an increasingly hostile and sinful place. Occasionally that splashes onto us, and perhaps, in the case of a few of you, it may be nearly drowning you. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . You can change. You can be helped. You can be made whole--whatever the problem. All he asks is that you</i>walk away from the darkness and come into the light,<i>his light, with meekness and lowliness of heart. . . . Christ has "borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows," Isaiah declared, "and with his stripes we are healed"--if we want to be (Isaiah 53:4–5; Mosiah 14:4–5).</i>[Jeffrey R. Holland, "Come unto Me,"<i>Brigham Young University 1996–97 Speeches</i>(Provo: BYU, 1997), 189; emphasis in original]<br><br>We can partake of the healing medicine of the Atonement of our Savior, who promised, "I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee" (2 Kings 20:5).<br><h2><b>Healing Is Active--You Have to Be There</b></h2><br>My second lesson is that healing is active--you have to be there. Your friend or your husband or wife or your mother cannot do it for you. You have to face the problem and the pain. To begin healing, you must acknowledge and<i>feel</i>the hurt. Only those who don't feel, those without conscience, cannot heal.<br><br>My mother once told me of an experience she had one winter morning as she drove down to check the cattle in the lower pasture. She noticed a car off the side of the road. Inside she recognized a young mother and three children. When my mother asked if they needed help, the woman tearfully reminded her that this was the place of the accident two weeks earlier that had killed her husband. She answered, "We are just here to feel the hurt."<br><br>On that first day as a nurse, I assumed cure, care, and healing to be synonymous. I have learned they are not the same. Healing is not cure. Cure is clean, quick, and done--often under anesthesia. The antibiotic kills the pathogen; the scalpel cuts out the malignancy; the medication resolves the distorted chemistry. Healing, however, is often a lifelong process of recovery and growth in spite of, maybe because of, enduring physical, emotional, or spiritual assault. It requires time. We may pray for cure when we really need healing. Whether for cell reconstruction, for nerve and muscle rehabilitation, for emotional recovery, or for spiritual forgiveness, healing needs work and time and energy.<br><br>Healing cannot happen in a surgical suite where the pain is only a sleepy memory. Cure is passive, as you submit your body to the practitioner. Healing is active. It requires all the energy of your entire being. You have to<i>be</i>there, fully awake, aware, and participating when it happens.<br><h2><b>Healing Is Private</b></h2><br>My third lesson is that healing is private. The hymn "Lord, I Would Follow Thee" describes "hidden sorrow" in a "quiet heart" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 220). Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, "It is such a secret place, the land of tears" (<i>The Little Prince,</i>trans. Katherine Woods [New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1943], 28).<br><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:<br><br><i>There is, in the suffering of the highest order, a point that is reached--a point of aloneness--when the individual (as did the Savior on a much grander scale) must bear it . . . alone. Even the faithful may wonder if they can take any more or if they are in some way forsaken.</i><br><br><i>Those who . . . stand on the foot of the cross often can do so little to help absorb the pain and the anguish. It is something we must bear ourselves in order that our triumph can be complete.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979), 43]<br><br>Healing is not only private, it is sacred. Private healing is not healing by abandonment. There is something so sacred about partaking of the power of the Atonement to overcome suffering, disappointment, or sin that it happens in the privacy of that special relationship between the mortal and the divine. Healing involves a private personal communion with the Savior, the Master Healer. It inspires a very personal reverence and awe. While on the earth Jesus often healed in private and then departed. When He healed, He often charged, "See thou tell no man; but go thy way" (Matthew 8:4; see also Luke 8:56).<br><br>To say that healing is private is not to diminish the marvelous power that comes from the help and compassion of others. Indeed, private healing often may not happen without the help of others. But much of the work of healing is done alone, inside the heart, in the company of the Spirit of the Lord.<br><br>Such secret healing is not a single event. It happens as a process of living. You cannot simply take off a day or start tomorrow like a new diet and return healed. It happens quietly while you face the pain. It happens over time as you live, work, study, and give to others.<br><h2><b>Healing Teaches Us</b></h2><br>The fourth lesson of the healer's art is that healing teaches us. When we have a terrible loss or pain, we may seek to "get back to normal" or to the way things were before, but they will never be the same. Pain changes us, but not in the same way that healing teaches us. Healing can help us to become more sensitive and more awake to life. Healing inspires repentance and obedience. Healing invites gifts of humility and faith. It opens our hearts to the profound complexities of truth, beauty, divinity, and grace.<br><br>Orson F. Whitney wrote:<br><br><i>No pain that we suffer . . . is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of . . . patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer . . . , especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.</i>[Quoted in Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972), 98]<br><h2><b>We Must Help Others to Heal</b></h2><br>The fifth lesson of learning the healer's art is the obligation and great gift it is to help others to heal.<br><br>President Hinckley admonished:<br><br><i>As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, ours is a ministry of healing, with a duty to bind the wounds and ease the pain of those who suffer. Upon a world afflicted with greed and contention, upon families distressed by argument and selfishness, upon individuals burdened with sin and troubles and sorrows, I invoke the healing power of Christ.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "The Healing Power of Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1988, 59]<br><br>Every day someone in your path is hurting, someone is afraid, someone feels inadequate, someone needs a friend. Someone needs you to notice, to reach out, and to help him or her to heal. You may not know who that is at the time, but you can give encouragement and hope. You can help to heal wounds of misunderstanding and contention. You can serve "in the cause of the Master Healer" (Hinckley, "Healing Power," 52).<br><h2><b>Healing Is the Gift of the Savior, Who Calls, "Come unto Me"</b></h2><br>The last and greatest lesson of healing is that it is a divine gift that is always there from a loving Heavenly Father. If you have a pain or sorrow or disappointment or sin or just a grudge that needs healing, the Savior simply says, "Come unto me."<br><br>In the last few weeks as I have studied the scriptures, I have read only the accounts of Jesus healing. I have been humbled and amazed by how much of the Lord's mission on this earth was devoted to healing. When Jesus called and ordained the Twelve, He specifically gave them the power to heal (see Matthew 10:1, Mark 3:14–15) and instructed them to go about using their gifts "freely" (Matthew 10:8).<br><br>As Jesus healed, the scriptures say, "All the people were amazed" (Matthew 12:23). They brought their sick, their "blind, and dumb" (Matthew 12:22), those that were "possessed with a devil" (Matthew 12:22; also Mark 1:32), and their dead. They sought Him every day and into the evening. So great was His reputation and His healing power that they sought to "only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made perfectly whole" (Matthew 14:36). "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching . . . and preaching the gospel . . . , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people" (Matthew 9:35).<br><br>When Nephi was shown the vision of his father, Lehi, he saw the multitudes and the sick who were "healed by the power of the Lamb of God" (1 Nephi 11:31). When the Savior appeared in the Americas, He healed "every one as they were brought forth unto him" (3 Nephi 17:9).<br><br>President Hinckley promised:<br><br><i>Jesus of Nazareth healed the sick among whom He moved. His regenerating power is with us today. . . . His divine teachings, His incomparable example, His matchless life, His all-encompassing sacrifice will bring healing to broken hearts, reconciliation to those who argue and shout, even peace to warring nations if sought with humility and forgiveness and love.</i>[Hinckley, "Healing Power," 59]<br><br>Elder Holland reminded:<br><br><i>That is why we make solemn covenants based on Christ's atoning sacrifice, and that is why we take upon us his name. In as many ways as possible, both figuratively and literally, we try to take upon us his identity. We seek out his teachings and retell his miracles. We send latter-day witnesses . . . around the world to declare his message. We call ourselves his children, and we testify that he is the only source of eternal life. We plead for him to swing open the gates of heaven in our behalf and trust everlastingly that he will, based upon our faithfulness.</i>[Holland, "Come unto Me," 188]<br><br>Elder Holland further noted:<br><br><i>The Church . . . is more like a hospital provided for those who wish to get well. . . . For some of you that is simply to live with greater faith, to believe more. For some of you it does mean to repent: Right here. . . . For virtually all of us it means to live more by the promptings and promises of the Holy Ghost and to "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men." . . . (2 Nephi 31:20).</i>[Holland, "Come unto Me," 189]<br><br>One hundred eighty-two years ago, the heavens were opened. One hundred and sixty years ago, the Relief Society began the education of nurses to care for the healing needs of the Saints. Fifty years ago, a college of nursing was born at BYU to enable students to learn science, skill, and healing. Today each of us at this university with its special mission has a unique opportunity to come to know the Master Healer and to learn the healer's art. I leave you my testimony that He lives, the Savior, the Master Healer, the One "with healing in his wings" (Malachi 4:2). I say this in His name, amen.<br><br><i>Elaine S. Marshall was dean of the BYU College of Nursing when this devotional address was given on 8 October 2002.</i><br><br><b>Note</b><br><br>1.

<h1>ce of Your Fellow Beings and Your God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
People, countries, and institutions usually use a motto, a short expression of a guiding principle, to identify or to represent them.<br><br>The United States, for example, is represented by a Latin motto: "E Pluribus Unum," or "One Out of Many." On the other hand, Great Britain has a French motto: "Dieu et Mon Droit," or "God and My Right." My country, Belgium, has the following: "Strength Through Unity." Most of these mottoes express an ideal or a vision of expectation related to unity among people, and many refer to deity. Israel, for example, is using unofficially a very interesting one-word motto: "Resurrection."<br><br>What about this institution, Brigham Young University? Passing through the west entrance to this campus, you may have seen the following guiding principle: "Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve."<br><br>To learn is to gain knowledge; to enlarge your mental faculties; to acquire new skills by receiving instruction, by studying, and, as the scriptures would say, by experimenting upon the words of God (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27?lang=eng#p26">Alma 32:27</a>). Experimenting upon the words of the teachers and pursuing your education to finally graduate is the goal to be achieved so that, later, you can serve.<br><br>To serve is to give a spiritual dimension to what you have learned temporally. In fact, temporal knowledge always needs to be supported and experimented upon with spiritual knowledge to produce a true and honest contribution to the welfare of others. Spiritual knowledge has no value unless it is practiced in the service of God and our neighbor. In essence, seeking learning is not only done by study (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#p117">D&amp;amp;C 88:118</a>) but must be followed by works or service.<br><br>Why is this combination of temporal and spiritual knowledge followed by service so essential for mortal and eternal progression? Knowledge is one of the attributes of God; He is omniscient. In<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.20?lang=eng#p19"> 2 Nephi 9:20</a> we read, "O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it." The purpose of life being to return and live in His presence, knowledge of temporal as well as spiritual matters becomes essential to our salvation. The Prophet Joseph Smith in his instructions was very clear: "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.6?lang=eng#p5">D&amp;amp;C 131:6</a>). The Apostle John also mentioned the importance of divine knowledge: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/17.3?lang=eng#p2">John 17:3</a>).<br><br>Who is the source of that kind of knowledge? "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#p25">John 14:26</a>).<br><br>How is this spiritual knowledge acquired? We must also be reminded that divine knowledge or knowledge about the divine nature of God and His plan of redemption for His children is freely available simply by asking the Lord in faith, believing that it can be received by personal revelation and by being diligent in keeping the commandments (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.11?lang=eng#p10">1 Nephi 15:11</a>). The Book of Mormon confirms this process as we share the experimentation on the words of the prophets by Nephi. Having a great desire "to know of the mysteries of God," he "did cry unto the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.16?lang=eng#p15">1 Nephi 2:16</a>). The answer that he received was literally a cascade of revelation for him. The Lord did visit him and softened his heart, and thus Nephi believed the words of his father prophet and did not rebel against his teachings and prophecies like unto his brothers.<br><br>This spiritual knowledge not only helped him to remain faithful to the commandments, but through him his brother Sam and many others also enjoyed the same blessings. On the other hand, for lack of spiritual knowledge and desire to find out more and because they relied on their own natural knowledge and were turned to the world, Laman and Lemuel did murmur and rebel "because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2.12?lang=eng#p11">1 Nephi 2:12</a>).<br><br>What is the source of murmuring, which then leads to rebellion? It is the lack of or denial of knowledge received by revelation through prophets. This is Satan's favorite tool of destruction of souls and testimonies. This is the purpose of his work. "And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice," said the Lord (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.4?lang=eng#p3">Moses 4:4</a>). How come? Because he does not know the mind of God, and that is why he is seeking to destroy the world (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.6?lang=eng#p5">Moses 4:6</a>).<br><br>Once again, listen carefully how the words<i>know</i>and<i>knowledge</i>are emphasized all in one verse and related to our identity, our relationship with God and His Son Jesus Christ, and the doctrine of salvation:<br><br><i>And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.14?lang=eng#p13">1 Nephi 15:14</a>]<br><br>Now that this foundation is established about the importance of learning and seeking so that we can serve, do we start to discern that to know God is the beginning of loving God and enjoying His spirit, which entices us to serve in His kingdom? Do we realize that living by His commandments and loving and serving our neighbor prepares us to live in God's presence? Again, from the Book of Mormon: "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17?lang=eng#p16">Mosiah 2:17</a>). After all, is this not the perfect presentation of the two greatest commandments of the law? Jesus was unequivocal in His answer to the lawyer who was trying to tempt Him with his question:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</i><br><br><i>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/22.36-40?lang=eng#p35">Matthew 22:36–40</a>]<br><br>How do you--as students, as future husbands and wives and parents, as citizens, and as members and future leaders of the Church--perceive this responsibility? How do you then respond when you know the value of the word<i>responsible,</i>meaning "able to respond"?<br><br>Too many today, because of a wrong perception of this responsibility, become irresponsible--meaning that they do not respond anymore to the righteous perception of things as they are, as they were, and as they are to come. Instead, they are tempted to respond to their own feelings and inclinations and the philosophies or theories of the world to please their egos or pride.<br><br>Is this the problem? Indeed it is. Let us have a quick look at the present philosophy of the world that creates spiritual irresponsibility leading to self-love and self-service instead of to the love of God and the love of your neighbor.<br><br>The problem can be summarized by an old Latin saying: "Vox populi vox Dei," or "The voice of the people is the voice of God." This was written originally by Alcuin of York, a British cleric remembered as the most brilliant member of Charlemagne's (Carolus Magnus) entourage. He was an educator, scholar, administrator, statesman, priest, and poet. In this letter of advice to the emperor written in a.d. 800, we need to read the context to understand the real meaning of this saying: "We would not listen to those who were wont to say the voice of the people is the voice of God, for the voice of the mob is near akin to madness" (<i>Admonitio ad Carolum Magnum: Works,</i>Epis. 127, quoted in Burton Stevenson,<i>The Home Book of Quotations</i>[New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., 1956], 1480:15).<br><br>Through the centuries, however, this saying, now a proverb, has come to mean that the voice of the people can and ought to replace the voice of God. Translated in our day, this saying means that the so-called dictature of Christianity has to come to an end.<br><br>Let me quote some things that have been written recently about Christianity in the United States:<br><br><i>While the United States is recognized as one of the few industrialized countries where religion is still strong, its culture often seems at odds with traditional religious values. In a recent editorial, James Hitchcock discussed this apparent paradox and concluded</i>[that]<i>"Americans tend to value religion insofar as they regard it as supportive of their personal lives but not when it seems to "interfere" in their lives and make demands on them. They are deeply religious in a sense, but their commitment proves fragile when it fails to provide the emotional support they seek."</i><br><br><i>In support of his argument, Hitchcock cites evidence from a number of recent studies. In one survey of Christian teens, Jesus ranked fifth on their list of most admired persons (after Lincoln, Washington, John F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr.). A detailed survey of Christians in Minnesota found that 90 percent believed in life after death, but only 69 percent believed that Jesus actually rose from the dead. National surveys have found that 71 percent of adults believe in heaven, but only 53 percent believe in hell. Hitchcock comments, "The orthodox belief that human beings survive after death is warmly accepted by believers primarily insofar as it promises personal happiness, not insofar as it threatens punishment." Three-fourths of all Christians think that people should determine their own beliefs independent of any organized religion.</i><br><br><i>The area in which traditional teachings diverge most from the beliefs of many of the people in the pews is sexual morality. In contrast to Christianity's traditional teachings on the critical importance of chastity, the Minnesota study of practicing Christians found that 85 percent of them accepted divorce, 60 percent abortion, 36 percent premarital sexual relations, and 39 percent homosexuality.</i><br><br><i>In his concern over what he perceived as the growing gap between traditional Christian teachings and personal beliefs, Hitchcock averred:</i><br><br>"<i>The very religiosity of American culture is often turned against Christianity, in that the entire world has now been made to seem like a spiritual garden in which people can browse as they see fit, plucking the flowers that smell fragrant. Plucking them does not require accepting the church's discipline--literally becoming a disciple--but merely savoring the scent and leaving the rest. The ultimate test of religious authenticity is now thought to be personal feelings, which are among the few things the culture still regards as sacred. Religion has value insofar as it makes the individual feel good."</i><br><br>[See James Hitchcock, "Christianity American Style,"<i>Touchstone</i>14, no. 10 (December 2001): 3–5, as quoted in "American Christianity,"<i>Information Center News</i>12, no. 1 (14 January 2002): 1]<br><br>It seems that we are reliving what happened in the fourth century during the rule of the Roman Empire, when by decree of a Roman emperor the pagan gods of antiquity were suddenly replaced by a unique and personal God: Jesus Christ, the Son of God made man. Today that unique Jesus Christ and His gospel of self-imposed discipline is now being replaced by the voice of the people denying His role as Savior and Redeemer of the world, rejecting His resurrection, opening the gates of immorality by refusing the consequences of sin because there are no more rules--and thus no more sin. This creates a time of uncertainty and imbalance because people in their great majority still believe in God and even Jesus Christ because of their past, but they want to be released of the commitment pattern or from being bound by the covenants in the name of individualism and pragmatism. The new mottoes are "Be Yourself and Love Yourself"; "Live Your Life in a Better Way, a Selfish Way"; and "Your Way Is the New Thinking and So-Called New Morality."<br><br>John Howard, of the World Congress of Families, wrote:<br><br><i>For thirty-five years, the New Morality has been tearing down and replacing the accumulated wisdom of Western Civilization. The cherished ideals and standards of proper behavior were, it was said, outmoded nuisances that had to go. Previously, just as Americans would learn the language as an automatic part of growing up, they also learned how to behave responsibly, living by standards of right and wrong woven into the culture and taken for granted by the citizens. Now those standards have been so thoroughly trashed that many, many Americans live their lives deciding for themselves how to live and behave, oblivious to any sense of community responsibility.</i>[John Howard, "Into a New Wilderness,"<i>World Congress of Families Update</i>2, no. 37s (18 September 2001), The Howard Center for Family, Religion, and Society, online at http://www.worldcongress.org/WCF/Archive/wcf_update_237s.htm]<br><br>This new kind of behavior is also meant to replace the two great commandments to love the Lord and to love our neighbor with the motto "Love Oneself and Serve Oneself." There are no more duties to be considered; life is too short to be bothered by them. There are only individual rights, no more community or individual obligations. The first and more important commandment is to love oneself! We are transiting from a culture of discipline and obedience to a culture of total choice of action to decide for ourselves--to literally become our own kings. This may remind us of the last verse of the book of Judges: "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/judg/21.25?lang=eng#p24">Judges 21:25</a>).<br><br>Modern revelation found in section 1 of the Doctrine and Covenants confirms what is happening today:<br><br><i>And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;</i><br><br><i>For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</i><br><br><i>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.14-16?lang=eng#p13">D&amp;amp;C 1:14–16</a>]<br><br>The end result of this change of spiritual mentality and morality is a clear rejection of dogmatism and prescriptive or normative authority, where authority was giving precepts and rules to regulate life through judgments of value--the authority being represented by God delegating His authority to His prophets. It can be summarized by what a young Catholic said after attending the last meeting with the pope: "I am spiritual but I am not religious." Once again it seems that the personal experience is more important and prevails against what religion is teaching. Where does it come from? Very simply, it comes from a lack of religious education and a lack of personal testimony. That modern spirituality--a new trend of spirituality without dogma, without reflection, without responsibility--is not religion. And thus everything becomes possible--every spiritual skidding is possible because there is no other control at the wheel than the control of the individual. The institutional control is gone, and so anything can replace the church and God.<br><br>This is totally contrary to the teachings of the gospel of the incarnated Son of God, Jesus Christ. His gospel is a gospel of salvation requiring love of God and love of our neighbor. It is a gospel of sacrifice and obligations and service. It is a gospel of love and joy and peace and happiness by seeking to do what is right in the eyes of our Heavenly Father for ourselves and for others.<br><br>Let us conclude this examination of the problem of our day and age with the words of warning of the prophet Isaiah:<br><br><i>Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</i><br><br><i>That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!</i><br><br><i>Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/30.1-3?lang=eng#primary">Isaiah 30:1–3</a>]<br><br>It is now time to address the solution to the problem of modernity versus religion and the role that you will play as students receiving education so that you can serve in a spiritual way. You have entered this institution of learning to receive true knowledge about things as they are, as they were, and especially as they are to come so that you might go forth to serve your God and your fellowmen.<br><br>As declared before, our perception of what life is and how to live a better life leading to eternal life must be based on a true knowledge of divine and spiritual things--which is absolutely essential to our salvation. The scriptures and the living prophets have been given so that the people might have knowledge of the things of God. These things have been given, as the Lord has said, so that "you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.19?lang=eng#p18">D&amp;amp;C 93:19</a>). In modern language, the gospel is not a salad bar where you can pick and choose what you like!<br><br>Knowledge is one of the endowments of the Holy Ghost and one of the gifts of the Spirit. That is why spiritual perception becomes vital, associated with spiritual knowledge and followed by obedience. That is why temporal knowledge always needs to be associated and guided by spiritual knowledge so that we can serve God.<br><br>What is this essential spiritual knowledge that is needed? It is first to know the answer to the question that Jesus asked His disciples when they were together on the coast of Caesarea Philippi:<br><br><i>Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</i><br><br><i>And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</i><br><br><i>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</i><br><br><i>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.13-17?lang=eng#p12">Matthew 16:13–17</a>]<br><br>It is then--after knowing that He is the Only Begotten of the Father--knowing also that He atoned for the transgression of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and that He atoned for our sins in the Garden of Gethsemane. Further, it is knowing that He is the resurrected Christ. This is summarized in His own words as He was teaching about the emblems of the Atonement: "And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.40?lang=eng#p39">John 6:40</a>).<br><br>Once this personal revelation is received, it is to be safeguarded and applied--and it always must be followed by service. Again, another question, this time from the people:<br><br><i>What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</i><br><br><i>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.28-29?lang=eng#p27">John 6:28–29</a>]<br><br>And then come the well-known words of King Benjamin: "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17?lang=eng#p16">Mosiah 2:17</a>).<br><br>Certitude about the identity and the Atonement of Jesus Christ is the essence of our religion. Listen to the words of Isaiah, the messianic prophet, when he announced 2,700 years ago the birth of Jesus with such majestic unforgettable words: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/9.6?lang=eng#p5">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<br><br>Listen to the words of Alma, a prophet of the Book of Mormon: "For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.39?lang=eng#p38">Alma 30:39</a>).<br><br>Listen to the voice of a modern prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, when he declared in the April general conference:<br><br><i>We live in a world of uncertainty. For some, there will be great accomplishment. For others, disappointment. For some, much of rejoicing and gladness, good health, and gracious living. For others, perhaps sickness and a measure of sorrow. We do not know. But one thing we do know. Like the polar star in the heavens, regardless of what the future holds, there stands the Redeemer of the world, the Son of God, certain and sure as the anchor of our immortal lives. He is the rock of our salvation, our strength, our comfort, the very focus of our faith.</i><br><br><i>In sunshine and in shadow we look to Him, and He is there to assure and smile upon us....</i><br><br><i>... Man would walk the ways of the world and sin and stumble. But the Son of God would take upon Himself flesh and offer Himself a sacrifice to atone for the sins of all men. Through unspeakable suffering He would become the great Redeemer, the Savior of all mankind.</i><br><br><i>With some small understanding of that incomparable gift, that marvelous gift of redemption, we bow in reverent love before Him.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "We Look to Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 90]<br><br>Confronted by such professions of faith, of spiritual knowledge, contrasted to other temporal, rational, or so-called politically correct statements trying to usurp revelation, it seems that the words of Alma are as applicable today as they were in days past: "The great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.5?lang=eng#p4">Alma 34:5</a>).<br><br>It is so easy to change the reality of Christ into a myth and not a fact. It seems that the testimony of a factual, resurrected living Christ cannot be accepted as it is or as it was. It is still the eternal conflict: the antagonism between agnosticism and faith, between atheism and revelation. It marks the difference between temporal daily despair and spiritual eternal joy by either denying or accepting the spiritual reality of Christ, His mission, and His gospel.<br><br>Indeed, the spiritual knowledge of Jesus, the testimony of Christ, is not a matter to be left in the hands of doubters or unbelievers. The spiritual knowledge of the true nature and mission of Christ is given for a specific purpose: the salvation of mankind. There should not be a crisis of faith or a cry for faith in the world about the way, the truth, and the life that He represents, but there should be a cry of faith that, yes, He is "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.6?lang=eng#p5">John 14:6</a>).<br><br>Finally, the love of God, which is a commandment, is never disassociated from serving Him in the name of Jesus Christ and by association serving our neighbor. You former missionaries will easily recognize this mark of true discipleship:<br><br><i>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/4.2-3?lang=eng#p1">D&amp;amp;C 4:2–3</a>]<br><br>You sisters may remember the recent general Relief Society meeting where President Faust of the First Presidency said:<br><br><i>Our theme tonight is "Lord, here am I; send me." This profoundly simple statement is so appropriate as I address you sisters this evening because so very many of you demonstrate so well this willingness to step forward and serve. You are all heaven sent. You are the beautiful adornment of the human race. Your role as sisters is special and unique in the Lord's work. You are the nurturers and the caregivers who have, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, "feelings of charity and benevolence"</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>226]. [James E. Faust, "You Are All Heaven Sent,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2002, 110]<br><br>Sisterhood is as divine as priesthood. It has the same source, and both have the same purpose to serve others. The basic charter for both has, by the way, the same motto: "Charity Never Faileth" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.8?lang=eng#p7">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.46?lang=eng#p45">Moroni 7:46</a>).<br><br>Working and serving together is a result of our faith in Jesus Christ. Faith must always be followed by works.<br><br>The result of service is a crowning blessing, as the Lord promised:<br><br><i>I ... delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.</i><br><br><i>Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.5-6?lang=eng#p4">D&amp;amp;C 76:5–6</a>]<br><br>I testify of this truth today that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God appointed and called as our Savior and Redeemer. May the Lord bless you as you have entered this institution to never forget the purpose of what you are learning: to use your knowledge in service to God and our fellowmen to produce the fruit of eternal reward. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Charles A.

<h1> You - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege for me to speak with you this evening. My delight stems not just from who you are but, maybe even more important, from who you may become.<br><br>In 1955, after my first year of college, a friend and I spent the summer working at the newly constructed Jackson Lake Lodge in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. We arrived at the lodge in time to help prepare for its grand opening. As the date of the anticipated celebration approached, we learned two important things about the grand opening. First, many dignitaries, prominent businessmen, civic leaders, and western governors would be there. Most important, however, we learned that President David O. McKay would be present. The second thing we learned was that there was going to be a gigantic cocktail party between 2:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon, where a lot of alcohol would be served.<br><br>Having already completed one year of college and thus being reasonably bright, we concluded that President McKay was going to have some free time that afternoon, and we decided we would help relieve his boredom. Having wrangled President McKay's room number from one of the young men who worked at the front desk, we timidly made our way to his room and knocked on the door. In a few moments we were mesmerized as we stood in the presence of the tall, stately, white-haired prophet of the Lord. We were in his presence, and we felt the spirit that radiated from his very being. While we stood in awe, however, it was apparent that we had awakened him from a nap and that his dear wife was still sleeping.<br><br>In spite of our inappropriate intrusion into a very scarce moment of rest and solitude, he was ever so gracious and showed a sincere interest in us. After a few moments of conversation, he returned to his room and we began down the hallway, joyful and in awe, for we had just shaken the hand of God's living prophet. We had only taken a few steps when his door opened again. President McKay stepped out into the hallway and called out, "Boys, remember who you are."<br><br>Now that was not the first time I had heard the phrase "Remember who you are." I had heard it many times from my Young Men leaders and my bishop. I heard it from my parents almost every time I went out on a date. I even heard it from my football and basketball coaches. In fact, I had heard it so often that I was beginning to become irritated with the constant reminder. But this time it was different. It was coming from a prophet of God: "Boys, remember who you are."<br><br>And importantly implicit in President McKay's statement is the phrase "Remember what you can become." This brings me to what I consider to be perhaps the most fundamental doctrine of the gospel. It is a doctrine so fundamental that even the Atonement of our beloved Savior is based upon it. It is a doctrine that is the cornerstone of what Alma called the "plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8). It is a doctrine of hope. It is a doctrine of perspective. It is a doctrine of faith. It is a doctrine of vision. And it is a doctrine of strength and fortification.<br><br>When the Lord had a very important work for Moses, the Lord began to orient and prepare him for his responsibilities. We read in the first chapter of Moses that the Lord talked to Moses face to face. Thus began the important teaching about who God was and who Moses was. God declared to Moses, "Behold, thou art my son" (Moses 1:4). During this orientation God showed Moses the vastness and wonders of His creations. And then He referred to Moses as His son three different times and then explained that Moses was created "in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth" (Moses 1:6). Reinforcing this understanding, Moses' spiritual eyes had been opened, and he saw God, his Father, in whose image he was created. With this experience Moses had his eyes opened, and his vision of his worth and capabilities expanded. And with this new knowledge Moses was prepared for the work God had for him.<br><br>I don't believe this account in the Pearl of Great Price was recorded in such detail for the sole purpose of filling a couple of pages of scripture or to merely display the vastness of God's creations. There is significant purpose in these passages--the power of just knowing and remembering who you are and what your divine potential is.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin, an early American statesman and signer of the Declaration of Independence, gave meaning to this understanding and knowledge when he wrote the following:<br><br><i>We stand at the crossroads,</i><br><i>each minute,</i><br><i>each hour,</i><br><i>each day,</i><br><i>making choices.</i><br><br><i>We choose</i><br><i>the thoughts</i><br><i>we allow ourselves to think,</i><br><i>the passions</i><br><i>we allow ourselves to feel,</i><br><i>and the actions</i><br><i>we allow ourselves to perform.</i><br><br><i>Each choice</i><br><i>is made in the context</i><br><i>of whatever value system</i><br><i>we've selected</i><br><i>to govern our lives.</i><br><br><i>In selecting that value system,</i><br><i>we are,</i><br><i>in a very real way,</i><br><i>making the most important choice</i><br><i>we will ever make.</i><br><br><i>Those who believe there is one God</i><br><i>who made all things</i><br><i>and who governs the world by his Providence</i><br><i>will make many choices different</i><br><i>from those who do not.</i><br><br><i>Those who hold in reverence</i><br><i>that being who gave them life</i><br><i>and worship Him through</i><br><i>adoration,</i><br><i>prayer,</i><br><i>and thanksgiving</i><br><i>will make many choices different</i><br><i>from those who do not.</i><br><br><i>Those who believe</i><br><i>that mankind are all of a family</i><br><i>and that the most acceptable</i><br><i>service of God</i><br><i>is doing good to man</i><br><i>will make many choices different</i><br><i>from those who do not.</i><br><br><i>Those who believe</i><br><i>in a future state</i><br><i>in which</i><br><i>all that is wrong here</i><br><i>will be made right</i><br><i>will make many choices different</i><br><i>from those who do not.</i><br><br><i>Those who subscribe</i><br><i>to the morals of Jesus</i><br><i>will make many choices different</i><br><i>from those who do not.</i><br><br><i>Since the foundation of all happiness</i><br><i>is thinking rightly,</i><br><i>and since correct action</i><br><i>is dependent on correct opinion,</i><br><i>we cannot be too careful</i><br><i>in choosing the value system</i><br><i>we allow to govern</i><br><i>our thoughts and actions.</i><br><br><i>And to know that God governs</i><br><i>in the affairs of men,</i><br><i>that he hears and answers prayers,</i><br><i>and that he is a rewarder of them that</i><br><i>diligently seek Him,</i><br><i>is indeed,</i><br><i>a powerful regulator</i><br><i>of human conduct.</i><br><br>[<i>Benjamin Franklin's The Art of Virtue: His Formula for Successful Living,</i>ed. George L. Rogers, 3rd ed. (Eden Prairie, Minnesota: Acorn Publishing, 1996), 88–90]<br><br>I would add to Benjamin Franklin's statement by saying that those who believe they are sons and daughters of God, created in the image and likeness of the Only Begotten Son, "will make many choices different from those who do not." And why is this so important to us? Because ultimately we become the product of the myriad choices we are constantly making: choices that may seem quite inconsequential today but that may have an enormous impact on what measure of being we become; choices that sometimes isolate us from our peers on certain matters of principle; choices that are popular and choices that are unpopular; choices that are seen by others and choices that are known by only you and God.<br><br>And thus our value system becomes our anchor and mooring for life's greatest decisions, and our knowledge of who we are and what our relationship is with God becomes the basis for the value system upon which all these choices are based. Yes, those who know, who really know unequivocally that they are a son or daughter of God, created in the image and likeness of the Only Begotten, will make many choices different from those who do not. In the final analysis, our very salvation is simply a matter of our cumulative choices. Living righteously is based on an understanding of our relationship with the Almighty, an understanding of how we fit into the grand scheme of things. A constant reminder to ourselves that our value system is based upon being sons and daughters of God provides both the perspective and the strength to make correct choices. And with this knowledge, the choices flow.<br><br>In Ecclesiastes we read<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.</i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2]<br><br>As young adults you have arrived at a very special time in your life. You are in the planting season as you are in the process of making many of life's most important choices--choices of education, profession, whom and how you will marry, what kind of parent and eternal companion you will be. This planting season is compressed into a very few years, years of great consequence. Thus yours is a season of planting for a future that will bring an abundant harvest at the "time to pluck up that which is planted." Indeed, you stand at a crossroad of eternal consequences. With this in mind, let me suggest three choices I believe are appropriate and critical to your future--three choices of planting for a future harvest:<br><br>1. Choose to be a righteous example.<br><br>2. Choose to become self-reliant.<br><br>3. Choose a celestial marriage and eternal family.<br><h2><b>Choose to Be a Righteous Example</b></h2><br>Lehi taught:<br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh. ... They are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:27]<br><br>At the time of our baptism we made important choices. We chose to become a member of Christ's true church. We chose to take upon ourselves the name of Christ, and in so doing we chose to be an example to the entire world. This is a responsibility we cannot pass by lightly. The Savior reminded us of our responsibility to be an example. Speaking to us through the holy scriptures, He declared:<br><br><i>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</i><br><br><i>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</i><br><br><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</i>[Matthew 5:14–16]<br><br>On my first day in graduate school I was in an economics class where the professor asked each of us to introduce ourselves and tell what university we had graduated from. When I explained I had graduated from Brigham Young University, the professor interrupted the discussion and said, "It's nice to have another student from BYU." Then he inquired, "Do you know so and so?" I knew of him. Then he asked if I knew another BYU graduate, whom I did know. After naming several others, he concluded by saying, "They were great BYU students--men of character. It is nice to have you among us."<br><br>I was frankly somewhat embarrassed and uncomfortable with the attention. The professor was crediting the students' favorable traits to being graduates of BYU when in reality they were LDS students living gospel standards. And what he failed to understand is that we have LDS men and women of this caliber in universities all over the world. Nevertheless, candles had been lit, lights had been shown. Those BYU graduates had set a standard, and I was a little anxious about whether I would be able to maintain it. But I was determined to try to light another candle.<br><br>Alma refers to this light as "countenance" (see Alma 5:14). Each of us is responsible for the countenance that shines from within us. The personal light that radiates from our faces is either brightened or dimmed by the righteous or the unrighteous choices we make. When the Church was negotiating with the Jewish officials regarding the purchase of land and the construction of the Jerusalem Center, one of the conditions for approval was that we would not proselytize citizens in Israel. Reportedly, after we had pledged acceptance of that condition, someone in Israel said to a member about the agreement, "But how do you stop the shining in your eyes? Every one of you has it" (in Cheryl Brown, "Bright Minds and Broken Hearts,"<i>Brigham Young University 1996–97 Speeches</i>[Provo: BYU, 1997], 172). What a tremendous compliment to our students and members who are lighting candles--lights shining forth as righteous examples.<br><br>Every time we partake of the sacrament we remind ourselves of the important covenants made at baptism and we renew the covenant to take upon us the name of Christ. This is a responsibility, attached with all the blessings that a loving Father can give.<br><br>You as young adults have many pressures put upon you. Satan is using all his cunning devices and supporting forces to influence your choices toward iniquity. His objective is to blow out candles, to extinguish the light. We are not at all surprised by this. It was explained as part of the great plan, and we have subsequently had very specific warnings regarding Satan's power, influence, and determination. Nephi prophesied more than 2,500 ago of the trials and turbulence that you would face. You all know the scripture. It is found in the 28th chapter of 2 Nephi:<br><br><i>For behold, at that day shall he</i>[Satan]<i>rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</i><br><br><i>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</i>[2 Nephi 28:20–21]<br><br>I believe this scripture is true. I believe the time is now. And I believe the target is you. For the most part, Satan has made great strides in establishing and selling his value system, which is based upon the son of man, not the Son of God: "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" (2 Nephi 28:7) and "There is no hell" (2 Nephi 28:22). His is a value system based upon selfishness, self-indulgence, and immediate gratification. Thus we see devastating decisions constantly being made by those of your age. We see cultures infested with drugs, sex, alcohol, pornography, laziness, and many other spiritually devastating practices. But that does not have to be you.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley has warned us and pleaded with us:<br><br><i>I wish to say in the strongest language of which I am capable, stay away from moral iniquity. You know what is right and wrong. You cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unacceptable behavior....</i><br><br><i>I beg of you, my dear young friends, to avoid such behavior. It will not be easy. It will require self-discipline. The forces you confront are powerful and inviting. They are the forces of a clever adversary. You need the strength that comes of prayer.</i>[Gordon B. Hinckley, "To Men of the Priesthood,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2002, 58–59]<br><br>We don't have to fall into Satan's trap of immorality, sexual experimentation, inappropriate music, and you know the rest. Those of us who know we are sons and daughters of God, created in the image and likeness of His Only Begotten, will face temptation differently than those who do not. Those of us who know we are sons and daughters of God will stand for principle and on a higher moral plane than those who do not. Those of us who know we are sons and daughters of God will have light that shines differently than those who do not. We will have light that cannot be hid.<br><br>It was Joshua who said, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). It is our day and our choice as to whom we will serve.<br><br>Some years ago a Canadian convert family was driven from their home because of persecution. As they left their home for a more hospitable place to live, they rewrote the words to a hymn with these words:<br><br><i>Dare to be a Mormon;</i><br><i>Dare to stand alone;</i><br><i>Dare to have a purpose firm;</i><br><i>Dare to make it known!</i><br>[In Mark E. Petersen,<i>CR,</i>April 1952, 104]<br><br>Amanda Wallace, a young high school freshman in Gilmer, Texas, wrote in her journal after severe and steady persecution from her high school peers for standing up for her religion:<br><br><i>I know through the trials I've faced and have overcome that the blessings do follow eventually. ... I love my Savior and know firsthand that anything that doesn't kill me will make me stronger and help me love Him more, and I await the day that I am in His presence again that He might say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."</i><br><br>When the Prophet Joseph Smith was in the midst of translating the Book of Mormon, Martin Harris' wife was skeptical. She had an interest in the work since Martin was going to fund the printing of the first edition with a mortgage on their home. To satisfy her questioning faith, Martin asked Joseph if she could just see not the plates themselves but a portion of the manuscript translated from the plates.<br><br>You know the story. The Prophet inquired of the Lord about this request, and the Lord said no. Continued pressure by Martin's wife resulted in a second inquiry of the Lord; the same answer followed. But after continued nagging, a third inquiry was made, and Martin was given the manuscript containing the translation of a portion of the large plates. The manuscripts were somehow unexplainably lost while in the possession of the Harrises. With this, the Lord chastised the Prophet, and because of his continued persistence that resulted in the loss of the manuscript, our Father in Heaven temporarily withheld Joseph's power to translate the plates. The Lord told Joseph that Joseph "feared man more than God" (D&amp;amp;C 3:7). We have nothing to fear when we stand for righteousness and principle. We have nothing to fear when we pay our homage to God rather than to man.<br><br>Be willing to stand for principle. Be willing to be an example of righteousness. Light a candle. Let it glow. It won't hurt you, I promise.<br><h2><b>Choose to Become Self-Reliant</b></h2><br>The second choice I would encourage for you is self-reliance. Self-reliance should be the objective of every member of the Church. The proclamation of the family states: "Fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life." On the other hand, "Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102).<br><br>Self-reliance is a basic condition of self-esteem. It affects our confidence and our ability to achieve. It is difficult for us to feel good about ourselves and to feel our divine nature when we inappropriately rely on others to sustain and support us for our temporal or spiritual needs. Self-reliance is important for families to be stable and happy and to have the ability to serve the Lord, the family, and the community. Self-reliance is a blessing we should all strive to give to our children. It is a principle that our children should have ingrained within them from seeing our own example and hard work. Our best efforts should be to remove the uncertainty and fear about our temporal well-being and be prepared for the often turbulent and unknown future. It is difficult and often impossible for members who are constantly struggling financially to hold positions of service in the Church or in the community.<br><br>This is the time in your life for the planting of self-reliance seeds. It is a time to make the required sacrifices for the future harvest. The importance of this time of preparedness is highlighted in President Hinckley's establishment of the Perpetual Education Fund. This incentive is not only a means to help needy young people finance their education and desired schooling and training, it is a clear and persuasive signal to all to establish temporal preparedness as an important priority and to make the necessary sacrifices now.<br><br>I recognize that many of you have already completed your education or are now attending school, special training programs, vocational training, or apprenticeships to provide for your future. To you I say, "Stay the course." The harvest will be worth the sacrifice. To all I encourage you to do what it takes to become self-reliant. And now is the season of planting.<br><br>One of the most significant obstacles in achieving self-reliance is the accumulation of unnecessary debt. As young adults, many of you are out on your own for the first time in your lives. You are in the process of accumulating "stuff," most of which you consider essential but most of which is not really that important for now. Lending institutions make it easy and enticing to trade your future security and well-being for the gratification of now.<br><br>The most prevalent and most expensive debt is the easiest to acquire--credit card debt. Financial institutions often offer unsolicited lines of credit at seemingly low interest rates, but the interest rates are soon adjusted to the prevailing, onerous rates of 18 to 20 percent. It is not unusual to see young people with $15,000 to $20,000 of credit card debt at these terribly burdensome rates. The debt payment is often so high that the only way they can provide for themselves or their families is to take on more debt. Thus begins the vicious cycle of lifetime bondage to creditors.<br><br>It is true that some debt may be necessary and legitimate. Funds expended for education and professional improvement may be justified as investments in your future. Such expenditures may be the only avenue to a secure future--thus the purpose of the low-interest Perpetual Education Fund. Most people have to take a mortgage, at relatively low interest, to acquire a home. But in all instances prudence and conservatism should be used. Many of the things we feel we need now could be scaled down or delayed until we can pay for them. Eliminating the interest can greatly reduce the cost. In many instances the interest paid far exceeds the original cost of the purchase. Someone once said: "Those who understand interest collect it. Those who don't, pay it."<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., once cautioned, "Avoid debt as we would avoid a plague" (in<i>CR,</i>April 1937, 26). His counsel remains appropriate for us today.<br><br>The unnecessary debt being carried by so many has been such a concern to the First Presidency that President Gordon B. Hinckley has warned us several times in the last few years. In April 1998 he stated:<br><br><i>Be modest in your wants. You do not need a big home with a big mortgage as you begin your lives together. You can and should avoid overwhelming debt. There is nothing that will cause greater tensions in marriage than grinding debt, which will make of you a slave to your creditors. You may have to borrow money to begin ownership of a home. But do not let it be so costly that it will preoccupy your thoughts day and night.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>April 1998, 68; or "Living Worthy of the Girl You Will Someday Marry,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 50]<br><br>In October 1998 he stated:<br><br><i>I am troubled by the huge consumer installment debt which hangs over the people of the nation, including our own people....</i><br><br><i>We are carrying a message of self-reliance throughout the Church. Self-reliance cannot</i>[be]<i>obtain</i>[ed]<i>when there is serious debt hanging over a household. One has neither independence nor freedom from bondage when he is obligated to others.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>October 1998, 70–71; or "To the Boys and to the Men,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1998, 53]<br><br>In October 2001 he stated:<br><br><i>Life is fragile, peace is fragile, civilization itself is fragile. The economy is particularly vulnerable. We have been counseled again and again concerning self-reliance, concerning debt, concerning thrift. So many of our people are heavily in debt for things that are not entirely necessary. ... I urge you as members of this Church to get free of debt where possible and to have a little laid aside against a rainy day.</i>[In<i>CR,</i>October 2001, 89; or "The Times in Which We Live,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 73]<br><br>And as recently as four weeks ago in the general priesthood meeting he admonished:<br><br><i>Get out of debt and rid yourself of the terrible bondage that debt brings.</i><br><br><i>We hear much about second mortgages. Now I am told there are third mortgages.</i><br><br><i>Discipline yourselves in matters of spending, in matters of borrowing, in practices that lead to bankruptcy and the agony that comes therewith.</i>[Hinckley, "To Men of the Priesthood,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2002, 58]<br><br>A review of these statements leads one to believe this is a matter of great concern to the prophet. We ought to take heed.<br><br>Critical to achieving self-reliance are budgeting and good financial management. It is best to live not within your means but below your means.<br><br>Occasionally I hear of young men and women who are always looking for the easy solution to the comfortable life. Their ship is always just about to come in. Continued disappointments often result, however, in an unwarranted reliance on family members or an addiction to unemployment benefits. Now I am not disparaging those who legitimately and temporarily require assistance while they are investing in the future through education, training, and such or while recovering from unexpected hardship. But I do say that those who abuse the government system or inappropriately burden parents or others for support offend the very principles of the gospel.<br><br>It was God who said, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread" (Genesis 3:19). More recently the Lord declared, "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer" (D&amp;amp;C 42:42). Self-reliance is and always has been a sacred obligation and an important principle of the gospel.<br><br>Some of us may live in an environment or under circumstances that seem to provide little hope for our own temporal achievement. Often vision and opportunity are overwhelmed by generations of poverty, lack of self-esteem, feelings of despair, or lack of perceived opportunity.<br><br>Some time ago Sister Edgley and I were being chauffeured through a city in South America. Our driver was a stake president who was a convert to the Church. This stake president was a very successful international attorney. As we were passing the slums of the city--houses of cardboard and tin with no water, sewer, or plumbing of any kind--my wife asked the stake president where he grew up.<br><br>He pointed to the slums and said, "A place just like this."<br><br>My wife then asked, "How in the world did you ever climb out of this kind of poverty to become the successful person you now are?"<br><br>The stake president simply responded, "It was the gospel. The missionaries came and taught us who we really were and what we could become. My brother broke out, got an MBA from BYU, and now is the president of a large corporation in South America. My only other sibling is a sister, and she is a successful attorney."<br><br>This story is repeated over and over--hundreds, even thousands of times. In fact, the restored Church was born out of poverty and what some would see as absolute hopelessness. But the Saints came to believe in themselves, who they were, and what they could become. And may I point out, I believe in you, and your Father in Heaven believes in you. You need to believe in yourself. You see, those of us who know that we are sons and daughters of God, created in the image and likeness of the Only Begotten, know not only who we are, but we know who we may become. Those of us who know we are sons and daughters of God, created in the image and likeness of the Only Begotten, are driven by our potential to make choices to secure the future.<br><h2><b>Choose a Celestial Marriage and Eternal Family</b></h2><br>Choices of righteous living and choices of self-reliance prepare you for the most important and rewarding choice, the crowning ordinance of the temple--celestial marriage.<br><br>When God created the world, He did it in time periods that He called days. We don't know exactly how long each day was, but the account is quite specific as to the sequence of events. On the sixth day, after the earth was created, it was populated with every "living creature after his kind" (Genesis 1:24). God then said, "Let us make man in our image" (Genesis 1:26), for "it is not good that the man should be alone" (Genesis 2:18). Thus Eve was created out of a rib from Adam. And then God said, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24). It was not good for man or woman to be alone then, and it is not good for man or woman to be alone now.<br><br>We have a beautiful and clear explanation of this doctrine given in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World." Several important and clarifying principles are taught in this proclamation. Among them are the following:<br><br>First, "All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God." (This we have already discussed as being the basis of our value system that we use for making choices.) Second, "In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters ... accepted [God's] plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward ... his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life." And then, very importantly, "The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan." (From "The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102.)<br><br>Of all our priorities, finding an eternal companion and establishing an eternal family should be our top priority. All other objectives and priorities should be subservient and supportive of this, the most important.<br><br>Although we should make appropriate preparations, we should not unduly delay marriage. We need not have satisfied all our wants and desires before marriage. We need not have the perfect car, the perfect home, the perfect job, or the illusionary perfect companion to have a perfect marriage. Acquiring and achieving many of these things together, as companions, builds the perfect marriage. Yours is the time of preparation for an eternal, everlasting, celestial marriage that we have been talking about. This is the season of planting, the season of choices.<br><br>As the prophets of Ecclesiastes indicated, there is a natural sequence of important preparation and events in our lives: "A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted" (Ecclesiastes 3:2).<br><br>Yes, yours is the important time of planting, a time of preparation for that which is paramount in your lives, a time to let your light shine forth. Each of you came into this life as a glorious similitude of our beloved Savior. You also came into this world as a "candle." And there is only one person in heaven or on earth who can light that candle. Choose to light your candle.<br><br>Light a candle for righteousness. Light a candle for self-reliance. Light a candle for celestial and eternal marriage. These are the important choices that should flow from your value system. You see, those of us who know we are sons and daughters of God, created in the image and likeness of His Only Begotten, will make many choices that will lead to our eternal destiny of everlasting life with God and with our precious families. We will light candles.<br><br>May this be your dream--to choose righteousness, to choose self-reliance, to choose celestial and eternal marriage. May it be your righteous obsession in life is my prayer for you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard C.

<h1>edication and Commitment - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that kind introduction. There is no one more surprised than I am to be standing in this spot. I've heard many wonderful addresses from this podium, and I'm both thrilled and humbled to be here.<br><br>I'm also very humbled to be speaking on this special day for our country. Not only is it the day we at BYU set aside to honor the men and women who have sacrificed for our great nation but it is also the day we exercise our opportunity to choose our leaders. In this case the ballot won't have one name with only yes or no options. You will have the choice of selecting the candidate who best represents your beliefs and your point of view. We're here today with the freedoms and the challenges we enjoy in this wonderful country because our forefathers had the vision of making us citizens instead of subjects.<br><br>As I contemplated what to speak about today, I came to the conclusion that because most of you will probably never have the opportunity to be close to the military, this time together might be best spent in a discussion about what I learned during my years of service. I'd like to focus on some of the small events that shaped my life and made me the person I am. There are three underlying pillars--three bedrocks, if you will--that are present in everything I will discuss. They are unity, dedication, and commitment. I want you to think about these words as I speak.<br><br>I'd like to begin by reviewing some things that we as Latter-day Saints know about our country.<br><br>We know from the scriptures that this vision of freedom that is America was not an accident. In 3 Nephi we read:<br><br><i>For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled.</i>[3 Nephi 21:4]<br><br>That's definitely a higher destiny than to simply become a rich and powerful nation. We're not like any of the great empires that have preceded us--at least if you believe this ancient prophet. That is why in his dedicatory prayer at the Kirtland Temple Joseph Smith said, "May those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever" (D&amp;amp;C 109:54).<br><br>In the past year or so since 9/11 we've had to come to grips with new challenges to our great republic. Terrorism is now a reality understood by every grade-school student in this country. Traditional measures of strength just don't work as antidotes to this awful illness. Even less clear threats like the anthrax scare and the sniper in the Washington, D.C., area, for example, have further challenged our sense of internal security in this country. Most comforting to me in these times of trouble is how each of these events has produced heroes--individuals who rise to the occasion with remarkable acts of heroism and selflessness. In my mind's eye I can just see Todd Beamer on Flight 93 as he spoke with Lisa Jefferson, the GTE supervisor and the only one he could reach by mobile phone. He said the Lord's prayer with her and then offered something like, "Well, are you ready? Then let's roll." Todd Beamer and the other heroes of Flight 93 all gave their lives because they thought they could save other American lives or perhaps an American icon such as the White House or Capitol. As an American I appreciate those acts of heroism as well as the heroism displayed by dedicated Americans in every war we have fought.<br><br>Years ago, air force general Stu Barstad--the air force's chief of chaplains--recalled walking through the thousands of graves at Normandy, the last resting place of so many good and dedicated young Americans who were World War II casualties. All of them had entered that war with their own hopes and dreams and families. Now their bodies were buried in this hallowed spot. As he contemplated what would have become of the lives of these young men and women if they had survived, an aged French woman walked up to him and said, "Bravo, Americans. Bravo." She had lived through the invasion of Europe, and she understood what these young men and women had done for her country and her generation.<br><br>Such stories bring to my mind the words on a monument dedicated to our marines at Guadalcanal. Many of the young men who fought in this World War II battle were killed. "When you go home," the monument reads, "tell them, and say, 'For their tomorrows, we gave our today.'"<br><br>This sense of service and sacrifice--which our citizens have displayed so often in our history--is a key, I believe, to the greatness of this wonderful country. In Provo and in hometowns across America, there are men and women from our past wars and military experiences who were ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country and their comrades. Many of their fellow sailors, soldiers, and airmen did, indeed, make that sacrifice and now rest in graves--marked and unmarked--throughout the world.<br><br>I have to confess that I never directly faced a situation in my air force career in which I felt that I was in mortal danger. But, like most military men and women, I've been personally touched by the great heroism and selfless sacrifice of many others in uniform. I feel wonderfully blessed to be a part of this great university, but I will never regret the 29 years I spent in the uniform of my country.<br><br>You should know that one event that took place during my air force career dwarfs all others in terms of importance: my introduction to and baptism into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You see, my wonderful companion, Lana, and I are missionary success stories. We were, in the vernacular, "tracted out" by the missionaries in Charlotte, North Carolina, 29 years ago. In those days the Church was certainly present in North Carolina, but it was not yet a presence. (On one early visit of our very faithful missionaries, our toddler son--now a returned missionary himself--ran to us exclaiming, "Dad, the Norman Elmers are here!") Ours was the classic story: We listened because another young man, a student in the graduate program I was attending at the University of Oklahoma, had been a good example. We never spoke of his religion, but his belief in and dedication to his religion spoke more loudly in his actions than his words ever could have. By the time we had completed our short course, I had several good ideas about what this Mormon religion was. I remember thinking, as we graduated from this program, that it would be nice to have as much conviction to something as this young man had to his church.<br><br>Within a month or so after I left Oklahoma, the first missionaries I had ever seen in our area knocked at our door. Our response was classic, too: "We have our own church, but we've seen a little about your religion, and we're curious about some things. But you should know that we are certainly not interested in joining."<br><br>Six months later--thanks to at least three sets of wonderful missionaries who stuck with us and a ward that understood the value of friendshipping--we were baptized. That day has colored and framed all the other events in my life. I will be eternally grateful to that young man in Oklahoma and to the missionaries and members who worked so diligently to give us our chance to accept the marvelous message of the restored gospel.<br><br>When we joined the Church, I had been in the air force for about four years. It was a difficult time for our country. We were just coming out of the Vietnam War, one of the most unpopular wars in our history. Americans who had fought valiantly under America's flag came home to jeers instead of cheers and to scorn instead of honor. College students across the country, except perhaps at BYU, burned the flag and protested American involvement in this conflict. The country was deeply divided over a myriad issues, from civil rights to drugs to dropping out.<br><br>History always gives us a better perspective, and we now have a much better perspective of that period, too. As bad as it was, it was a very important period in our country, a period that had a profound effect on both society and our government. It was an era that changed how we view ourselves and how we run our military. It was an era when we, perhaps not always in a productive way, addressed some of the most pressing social problems in our history.<br><br>I cannot overestimate the impact of this period on the air force and the military in general. Fifteen years later, when I was a student at the National War College in Washington, D.C., we were still recounting the mistakes of this period--mistakes in how we fought the war and the effects that losing public support had on both us and on our war effort--and discussing how we could ensure that this would never happen again.<br><br>It was a healthy introspective, and it produced such great leaders as Colin Powell--quiet-spoken charismatic leaders with a love of their country and an understanding of the high costs of war for us and for the enemy. This period also produced individuals like our own retired four-star air force general, Robert C. Oaks, who is now a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. Elder Oaks, then General Oaks, led our U.S. Air Force in Europe during the sensitive years after the downfall of the Soviet Union and the breaking up of the Warsaw Pact. He was a leader in the Partners for Peace program, designed to help the countries of the former Warsaw Pact build closer ties with the United States and the West.<br><br>Most of us have an image of military leaders as cold, calculating men and women ready to fight at any provocation, aching to use their military skills and abilities. I found exactly the opposite in the military. First, as aide-de-camp and then as executive officer or personal assistant to two four-star generals--and later as a senior staff member in both the Tactical Air Command and the the Air Combat Command--I found individuals who, like Moroni, "did not delight in bloodshed" (Alma 48:11). Because they had experienced it firsthand, they felt that even one death was too many and strongly supported reasoned, negotiated solutions to international problems over military intervention. Most of these individuals were also people of faith who, in their own way, celebrated the blessings emanating from their Creator. When it came time to fight, they were--and will be--there. But I can tell you from firsthand experience that it is a mistake to see these leaders as lovers of war. They know the price that will be paid by their comrades and perhaps by themselves as well.<br><br>My first big break in the air force came as a fluke, but it taught me a very important lesson. As a young captain, I had just been assigned to the staff of a one-star general, and by default I became the project manager for a much-despised engineering study of his command of about 3,000 people. We were a diverse command spread throughout the United States in units of 25 to 150 people. My job was to develop a plan to reduce the command by about 20 percent in both people and budget. This general was almost as new as I was, and when I went to give him and his senior staff an oral version of my final report, he stared straight into my eyes and said, "This is not the information I'm getting from my staff. They tell me we're way understaffed. How do you know you're right?"<br><br>I thought for a minute as I looked into the faces of the key staff members in the room. "Well, sir," I said, stammering a little, "we've done the analysis and we've analyzed the data and we've done some pretty extensive modeling. I believe our conclusions are correct." This general dismissed me and didn't call again for some time, but I kept my job and we implemented the team's recommendations. As a result of that experience, I ended up working directly or indirectly for this individual for eight of the next ten years as he rose from a one-star to a four-star general and I rose from captain to colonel. He told me later that our relationship--and his faith in me--was built on my honesty in that meeting. I don't expect any special credit for being honest. In truth, I was scared to death as I faced all those colonels and generals and had to, in essence, contradict them. It is somewhat amusing how over time my honesty in that meeting became enmeshed with the fact that I was a Mormon. People are watching us, and they expect us to live by the standards of the gospel. They expect us to be honest, committed, and dedicated.<br><br>Perhaps the greatest personal leadership challenge I faced in the air force was my second assignment as a squadron commander. I got that job, too, because I was a Mormon. The general called me in and said he needed someone to go to a recruiting unit that had deep integrity and morale problems. The commander of the unit had been released, and the squadron was in great disarray. This was a large squadron of approximately 200 people with activities spread out over a geographical region that roughly coincided with one of our Church missions at the time. And that's how I got the idea to set this unit up like a mission. I appointed flight supervisors--or zone leaders--and I set up district meetings and reporting rules. We talked about supporting each other and having respect for each other instead of the traditional competition among ourselves. We wanted to be successful, but not as individuals. Instead we slowly turned into a team, and in two years that team became one of the top squadrons in the air force, winning an air force Outstanding Unit Award. It proved to me that the same principles we teach in our church work in our secular lives as well. Unity, commitment, and dedication are as necessary in the workplace as they are in the Church.<br><br>In my second year as commander of this unit, the nurse who led our medical professions recruiting team came in to see me. "I'd like to invite you to something," she said. "I'd like to invite you to my baptism." I was both thrilled and disappointed in myself. This woman had worked with me on a regular basis for at least a year and a half, and she had watched how I and other Mormons on the staff conducted our lives. She had the same feelings I had had when I joined the Church. She wanted to experience the great peace and joy the gospel brings. But in that year and a half I had never once asked her about her interest in the Church, and I was completely shocked to learn that she, on her own, had sought out the missionaries and had gone through the missionary discussions. I had often almost said something to her about the Church, but, because of my own insecurities, I had never spoken up. Brothers and sisters, I can testify to you that our friends and colleagues want what we have. They want the contentment and hope that the gospel of Jesus Christ brings into their lives. As our Heavenly Father's soldiers, we must be valiant in sharing this message.<br><br>The most difficult period of my career was probably the Persian Gulf War, also known as Desert Shield or Desert Storm. For many of you it is probably the only war you remember. At the time I was director of personnel programs for the Tactical Air Command. Twenty-five thousand of our people were sent to that war, and another 25,000 were sent from other air force commands. In all, approximately 500,000 Americans and our allies were deployed to southwest Asia during this conflict.<br><br>There is no doubt that this was a traumatic experience for those individuals directly involved, but it may have been even more traumatic for the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and spouses and children left behind. Support for that war sprang from every corner. Lee Greenwood of "Proud to Be an American" fame showed up at a speech I was giving to the spouses and families of our airmen in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He came just to say thank you for their sacrifice and the sacrifices of their loved ones who were actually serving in the Persian Gulf. The airmen of Myrtle Beach maintained the A-10 Warthogs, heavily armored subsonic jets called "the tank killers." These airmen were led in the war by then Colonel (and later Major General) Dave Sawyer, a dedicated member of the Church who conducted sacrament services on his post in Saudi Arabia every Sunday he was there. General Sawyer is now deceased, but he was a marvelous example of a great warrior and a wonderful human being and priesthood holder.<br><br>You may remember the yellow ribbons that sprouted from nearly every mailbox and tree during this war. From Florida to Maine and from Virginia to California--and I'm sure in Alaska and Hawaii, too--there were ribbons. Many of them had personal, handwritten messages next to them. Others just hung as symbols of love and support from automobile antennas and even around water tanks.<br><br>As there are from any war, there are as many stories from the Gulf War as there are men and women who fought there. An army helicopter mechanic, for example, wrote to his family back home: "As I was washing the dust from my hands, I looked at my wedding ring and thought of what it meant to me. It's as if our love buffs a shine into it that nothing can dull or tarnish. Not even when my hands are dirty with grease."<br><br>And a major on the Kuwaiti front said these words to his family back in the Midwest: "When I get back to the States, I will never take anything for granted--from a glass of milk to walking the dog. Being here doing the job in this country makes me proud to be an American soldier and grateful for what kind of society we have."<br><br>The events of that war, despite the fact that they occurred more than a decade ago, are still vivid in my mind. On the first night after Iraq invaded Kuwait, members of our stake and ward leadership visited families whose fathers would deploy within 24 hours to Saudi Arabia. The First Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, was the first U.S. military unit to deploy. Langley was also the headquarters of the Tactical Air Command, in which I was serving as director of personnel programs. The first home we visited was the home of a lieutenant colonel, a fine member of our ward and an F-15 pilot who flew numerous combat missions during the war. He was a man respected by both peers and subordinates. There was anticipation and concern in that family that night, and I'm sure a few tears were shed. But there was also a deep faith in our Savior and in our Heavenly Father's eternal plan. I had to visit other homes, too, where spouses--just as loved by their families--were leaving without that comforting knowledge of God's plan that we enjoy as Latter-day Saints. Even though in most cases those men and women returned after a prolonged absence, there was a finality and a despair about those meetings in nonmember homes that saddened my heart. How wonderful it would be if all of God's children had the blessing of knowing His plan for them. How comforting these truths can be in our times of greatest need and challenge.<br><br>During that war I heard many military officers say they would rather have Mormons under their command than anyone else. "With their strong belief in their religion," they'd say, "they're not afraid to do what is necessary. They know their God will protect them." I often thought of the words of Alma as he described Moroni in the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;</i><br><br><i>Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.</i>[Alma 48:11–13]<br><br>Moroni was a man who took joy in liberty. His heart swelled with great thanksgiving to his God. Such a man firm in the faith of Christ is the model for every Latter-day Saint soldier, sailor, and airman. In fact, the world would be a much better place if he were a model for every nation's soldiers, sailors, and airmen. He was a man who was committed to his people, who was dedicated to his God, and who unified good and noble causes.<br><br>I'd like to speak just a few minutes to those of you who may not be United States citizens. Although you may appreciate America, you also have great feeling for your own country and your special heritage. Do not take my words today as glorying in the fact and reality of war but instead as glorying in the heroism and sacrifices of the wonderful men and women who have been willing to give all they have--including their lives, if necessary--for their country. The beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that we are all brothers and sisters. The emphasis in every one of our lives ought to be celebrating our similarities and not going to war over our differences. I despise and renounce evil in any form, including evil perpetrated among nations. I love my brothers and sisters of every race, color, and creed. I appreciate all for their uniqueness, no matter what their ethnicity or skin color. As a Latter-day Saint I can never justify racial or ethnic discrimination in any form. Every man should be treated like my brother, and if he is my enemy, I need to work even harder to find ways to reach him and soften his heart.<br><br>We learn from the scriptures that it is not wrong to defend our families or homeland, or even our religion, but it is wrong to let hatred destroy the light of Christ in our lives. I believe this is the point Elder Russell M. Nelson addressed in his October conference talk:<br><br><i>As a church, we must "renounce war and proclaim peace"</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:16].<i>As individuals, we should "follow after the things which make for peace"</i>[Romans 14:19]. ["Blessed Are the Peacemakers,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2002, 41]<br><br>We should be personal peacemakers. We should live by the Golden Rule."<br><br>This love of our fellowman should not be limited to our international friends but should be extended to all in our country as well. Our church is growing in every quarter. One of the most spiritual sacrament meetings I have ever attended took place several months ago in a predominantly African-American branch in Detroit, Michigan. There a young missionary from Florida--the first member of his family to join the Church, an African American himself--bore a testimony that shook the very foundations of that marvelous little chapel that had been created as an oasis in the middle of an old warehouse. This young man overcame great personal adversity to find the Church and to prepare for a mission. Even though he had been a member for only about four years, his testimony carried enormous power of personal knowledge and conviction.<br><br>He would not have been an obvious candidate for membership in the Church. By age 18 he was in prison with, as he said in his remarks, "his life going nowhere." He knew this was not what he wanted for his future, and, for the first time in his life, he knelt down "with serious intent" to pray. He said he remembered having the distinct impression of inspiration, if you will, that he would be led to the true church. He began reading the Bible and other religious works while he was in prison. Once he was released, he set out to find this true church. Whom should he meet soon after he was released but two marvelous young missionaries who taught him the gospel. Now he is a returned missionary, having had a profound effect on many other lives. Isn't it wonderful how the Lord works?<br><br>During our university conference, President Bateman told us that greater numbers of students like this wonderful missionary will be coming to BYU in the future. They come with burning testimonies but with limited knowledge of our culture and our own unique ways. Every one of us should make that extra effort to give all brothers and sisters a truly genuine, loving welcome to our wonderful university. We should be sensitive to ethnic and cultural backgrounds and help others in any way we can to adjust to life here at BYU. Our hearts are in the right place. I believe that. But we need to reach out and be more inclusive if we are to become truly united.<br><br>I've covered a lot of ground this morning. I've talked a bit about the debt we owe our veterans and even our accidental heroes, like the brave souls on Flight 93. And I've tried to give you some insight into my career in the air force. My point is, ultimately, that we can never separate what we do in life and what we accomplish from the people we are. I have spoken about unity, dedication, and commitment. These principles are like the threads of a fine tapestry interwoven in all aspects of our lives--in our professions, in our religion, and in our homes. These are pervasive qualities, adding light and power to all of our endeavors.<br><br>I would like to make one last point. There is a tendency today to think about the negative and to believe that our best days as a nation and as a world have passed. I believe, as Latter-day Saints, we must look at the future with optimism and hope. There will be dark days in all our lives, and we will have challenges--some of which may, at the time, seem to be insurmountable. But through our faith and obedience the light will come. And there will be joy in the morning.<br><br>Carl Sandburg has said:<br><br><i>I see America, not in the setting sun of a black night of despair ahead of us, I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun fresh from the burning, creative hand of God. I see great days ahead, great days possible to men and women of will and vision.</i>[Carl Sandburg, interview with Frederick Van Ryn in "Carl Sandburg Speaking: 'I See Great Days Ahead,'"<i>This Week Magazine,</i>4 January 1953, 16]<br><br>That is a great statement by Mr. Sandburg, and I hesitate to make any changes to it. But I would like to take the liberty of adding<i>faith</i>to his words: Great days truly are possible to men and women of will and vision and faith.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I pray for each and every one of you that the Lord will bless you and your families as you enter "the crimson light of [your] rising sun." May you have success in all aspects of your life and may you find happiness and joy in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I say these things in His name, amen.<br><br><i>Maurice L.

<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is an honor and great privilege to be on campus today and to speak with you. I am glad that my father and Sister Neuenschwander's parents are also here. It is of great worth to know people who have been faithful to their commitments and covenants well into their eighties and nineties.<br><br>During my first year of graduate school, I had an evening class on Slavic culture. On one occasion, after a day of intense study, I was hurrying to class to take an exam. Information, dates, and events were swimming around in my head. The closer I got to the exam, the more confused I became. On the way I happened to see one of my professors and asked him to clarify what for him must have been a very obscure matter. He looked at me and asked in a tone I still remember, "Is it important?"<br><br>Over the years I have pondered his question. It has helped me to distinguish the important from the trivial, to remember the important things and to forget the things that have little consequence or that would, by forgetting them, bring a blessing.<br><br>Remembering important things is fundamental to both our temporal and spiritual well-being. Confusing what we should remember with what we can or ought to forget creates difficulties for us. Much trouble in life originates from forgetting what we should remember and remembering what we should forget. One of Nephi's experiences with Laman and Lemuel is an interesting example of this. Nephi told his brothers that they were "slow to remember the Lord" (1 Nephi 17:45). They had seen an angel, and he had spoken to them. Though no response is recorded, I suppose that Laman and Lemuel could have looked at each other and said, "Oh, yeah, we forgot."<br><br>Remembering the kindness of others while forgetting their offenses is spiritually much healthier than forgetting their kindness and remembering their offenses. We should keep in mind that even the Lord, who is capable of remembering everything, has promised that He will forget our sins if we repent.<br><br>It seems to me that living the gospel has as much to do with remembering important things as it does with knowing them in the first place. The word<i>remember</i>and its derivatives appear hundreds of times in the scriptures--certainly a lot to remember! This repetitious scriptural reminder to remember takes on added significance when we understand that in Hebrew the word<i>remember</i>has a much broader meaning than does the English connotation of "keeping something in mind." In the Hebrew context, "doing" is an essential part of the remembering process. Thus, "to remember" is "to do," whereas "forgetting" is "failing to do."<br><br>The prophets of various dispensations, cultures, and languages have all been remarkably consistent in teaching what is most important for us to remember--and to do. Among them we are to remember:<br><br>1. The Lord and His holy name.<br>2. His word, as well as His words.<br>3. His commandments.<br>4. His marvelous works.<br>5. The poor.<br><br>Just a word about each of these:<br><br><b>First, we are to remember the Lord and His holy name.</b>The Lord established His preeminent position through the commandments He gave Moses. "I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:2–3).<br><br>The Lord also commanded, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them" (Exodus 20:4–5).<br><br>The children of Israel had a hard time remembering these commandments and, because of their forgetfulness, suffered painful consequences. Are we under any less obligation to remember them? As the Lord extended His hand to rescue the children of Israel from Egyptian bondage, so also did He offer His life to rescue us from the bondage of sin and death. This we can never forget.<br><br>Declared the Savior, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).<br><br>King Benjamin added his testimony of this essential doctrine: "I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent" (Mosiah 3:17).<br><br>In our dispensation the Lord confirmed this doctrine through the Prophet Joseph Smith: "No man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word" (D&amp;amp;C 132:12).<br><br>As the means of salvation for all, Jesus commanded all to revere His holy name: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain" (Exodus 20:7).<br><br>Certainly this has reference to speaking the holy name of the Lord in inappropriate and irreverent circumstances or invoking His name as a means of expressing anger, displeasure, surprise, or simply showing a lack of self-control. In this regard there is likely no other commandment that is so universally broken than this one. It seems that in our time we have forgotten the clear instruction of the Lord: "Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips" (D&amp;amp;C 63:61). Speaking His name without authority is taking His name in vain.<br><br>Remembering the Lord's name also has much to do with the manner in which we take His name upon ourselves. King Benjamin taught, "I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives" (Mosiah 5:8). King Benjamin counseled his people to remember not to transgress, "that the name [of Christ] be not blotted out of your hearts" (vs. 11). King Benjamin told them that they "should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, . . . that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you" (vs. 12).<br><br>If the people were to forget this simple instruction, the name of Christ would be blotted out of their hearts and they would be found on the left hand of God.<br><br>In 1983 I met Sister Marianna G½ównia during an assignment to visit the Polish Saints with Brother Matthew Ciembronowicz. Sister G½ównia had joined the Church in Poland in 1958 when she was 50 years old. For 25 years she had been virtually isolated from other members of the Church. She was in obvious pain as a result of severe injuries received during the Polish occupation. She moved with great difficulty around her small apartment. She told us that representatives of another church had come to offer support and relief if she would simply renounce her faith. With tears in her eyes, Sister G½ównia said, "Brethren, I have never renounced my faith." A year later she passed away a faithful Latter-day Saint. Sister G½ównia remembered the Lord and to the end of her life revered His holy name, which she had taken upon herself.<br><br>Our lives are blessed when we remember the Lord and His holy name.<br><br><b>Second, we are to remember His word.</b><i>Word</i>and<i>covenant</i>often stand together in the scriptures. The Lord is a man of His word. That which the Lord speaks, He will do. That which the Lord promises by His word, He will fulfill. Only on a basis of absolute trust and confidence can we enter into covenants with Him and know that He can do as He promises. Where would trust be if God extended a covenant to us and then promptly forgot it or did not have sufficient power to honor it? Wrote the Psalmist, "He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations" (Psalm 105:8).<br><br>To Nephi, the Lord said, "I will show unto . . . my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever" (2 Nephi 29:14).<br><br>Our individual identity as well as our identity as a people is established by how well we remember our covenants. If we are careless and in the process forget the covenants and promises of God, we will surely lose our identity as the children of God. The history of the Nephites and the Lamanites is one of forgetting the covenant extended to them as part of the house of Israel. The Book of Mormon is an excellent book of remembrance. Its prophets were continually exhorting the people to remember important things. I suppose they did so because of the people's tendency to forget that which should have been important for them to remember. In Mormon's lament over the destruction of the Nephites, he wrote, "O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open arms to receive you! Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen" (Mormon 6:17–18).<br><br>The Nephites forgot their covenant and the promises given to them by virtue of that covenant. They simply forgot what they should have remembered! And in their forgetting they lost their identity in a most tragic manner. The Lamanites, though not destroyed, had also not taken advantage of the covenant and promises given to their fathers. As Mormon lamented the fall of the Nephites, he reminded the Lamanites of important things that had passed from their memory: "Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel. . . . And ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first covenant" (Mormon 7:2, 10).<br><br>The recovery of the people's identity as members of a covenant family was uppermost in Mormon's mind. Where is that identity to be found? It is in the knowledge of the promises made to their fathers. The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>And for this very purpose are these plates preserved, . . . that the promises of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made to his people;</i><br><br><i>And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the promises of the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 3:19–20]<br><br>We are no different. If we remember and participate fully in the covenant the Lord has extended to us, we will remember who we are and what we are about. If, on the other hand, we forget the word of the Lord and His covenant, we will lose both our identity and the fulfillment of the promises that otherwise would come to us and to our children--a tragic consequence of forgetting.<br><br>Not only should we remember the word of the Lord, but we should remember His words as well. His words are without end (see Moses 1:38). They are sure and shall not fail. They are pure, they are true, they are faithful, they are eternal (see 2 Nephi 31:15). As we remember and ponder His words, we remember and ponder matters of eternal significance and meaning. On one occasion the Lord asked the Twelve if they, like the multitude, would also go away from Him. Their answer is the one that we should all wish to give: "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life" (John 6:68).<br><br>We should also remember that the Lord's words are very practical and are meant to guide us through life's trials and uncertainties. Jacob wrote, "Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God" (2 Nephi 9:52). Nephi continued this thought in words that are very familiar to us: "Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3).<br><br>The Savior counseled us to live "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). His words point us in "a straight course" (Alma 37:44). They nourish us and give us understanding (see Alma 32:28). The Savior taught:<br><br><i>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings</i>[or my words],<i>and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</i><br><br><i>He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.</i><br><br><i>But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</i>[Luke 6:47–49]<br><br>Would that we all remember and not forget the word of the Lord, His covenant and promises, and His words of life.<br><br><b>Third, we are to remember His commandments.</b>In our world, too many look upon the commandments of God as restrictive or punitive. We do not share this opinion. Divine commandments are given to us by a loving Father who desires to bless His children. Obedience to His commandments brings safety and blessings. We often sing:<br><br><i>Keep the commandments; keep the commandments!</i><br><i>In this there is safety; in this there is peace.</i><br><i>He will send blessings; He will send blessings.</i><br><i>Words of a prophet: Keep the commandments.</i><br><i>In this there is safety and peace.</i><br>["Keep the Commandments,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 303]<br><br>The commandments of God are a view into His personality and reveal His integrity. Is it possible, for example, to imagine that the Lord would expect us to keep His commandments while He himself disregards them? Certainly not. Wilford Woodruff wrote, "Jesus Christ abode in the covenant; he kept all the commandments while he was upon the earth. . . . There was no part of the gospel that Christ did not fulfil" (<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i>sel. G. Homer Durham [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946], 80).<br><br>Even in baptism the Savior showed us the way by His own obedience. In answer to John's reluctance to baptize Him, Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15).<br><br>Nephi provided this explanation:<br><br><i>And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water?</i><br><br><i>. . . He showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</i>[2 Nephi 31:6–7]<br><br>Many blessings flow from willing obedience to the commandments of God. The fourth commandment teaches us to "remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work" (Exodus 20:8–10).<br><br>To those who remember the Sabbath, the Lord has promised "the fulness of the earth" (D&amp;amp;C 59:16). Many can testify to the literal fulfillment of this promise. In the initial years of the spread of the gospel in eastern Europe, the Saints were counseled to attend to their Church responsibilities and leave their garden plots alone on the Sabbath. This was indeed a great matter of faith! They relied upon the harvest of their small gardens to carry them through the winter. They were accustomed to spending weekends in their gardens, which were often located a long distance from where they lived. Obedience to this commandment brought them blessings. Those who were faithful in keeping the Sabbath day holy had fruit when others around them did not. They had moisture when others received none. Their fruit was protected when that of others was lost. These faithful Saints saw the fulfillment of the Lord's promise to Malachi: "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field" (Malachi 3:11).<br><br>Commandments given in love are to be kept in love. The Savior taught, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>One of the great blessings in keeping the commandments is that our obedience to them not only brings us closer to the Giver of the commandment but permits us to know Him. John taught, "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments" (1 John 2:3). Indeed, it is our willing obedience that confirms our faith. For example, how can we know for sure that God has power to forgive sin? We can know for ourselves when we repent and are baptized for the remission of sins or when we partake of the sacrament worthily and regularly.<br><br>Remembering the commandments of God and doing them bring blessings, safety, and great spiritual knowledge. Let us always remember to keep the commandments.<br><br><b>Fourth, we are to remember His marvelous works.</b>One of the most beautiful messages of the Psalmist was his plea to remember the great works of the Lord: "His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered" (Psalm 111:3–4).<br><br>As we remember the mighty works of the Lord, we are humbled in the recognition of our relative nothingness and placed in a position to learn great things. Moses found this to be true when he was permitted to view the greatness of God's creations. As he regained his physical strength, he remarked, "Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed" (Moses 1:10).<br><br>Keeping the mighty works of God in our memory builds in us knowledge, confidence, and a profound reverence for His magnificent power. On one occasion we stayed overnight in the Austrian Alps. Our lodging was a small guesthouse on the edge of a deep precipice. Across the divide rose a sheer wall of rock thousands of feet high. Early in the evening a fierce storm arose. As thunder and lightning reverberated against the rock wall, the whole valley seemed to shake. With profound respect for the awesome power of God, we could not help but compare our puny experience with the account found in 3 Nephi:<br><br><i>There arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.</i><br><br><i>And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder.</i><br><br><i>And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had been known in all the land.</i>[3 Nephi 8:5–7]<br><br>The mightiest of all His work is, of course, His magnificent Atonement, which brought to pass the immortality and eternal life of you and me. May we always remember His mighty works.<br><br><b>Fifth, we are to remember the poor.</b>The Lord counseled us, "Remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple" (D&amp;amp;C 52:40). One of the distinguishing characteristics of Enoch's Zion was that "there was no poor among them" (Moses 7:18). Each member of the Church has both a temporal and spiritual responsibility toward the poor. President Marion G. Romney said, "The prime duty of help to the poor by the Church is not to bring temporal relief to their needs, but salvation to their souls. . . . All must be measured by the ultimate spiritual uplift" (<i>CR,</i>October 1977, 118).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, let us be neither forgetful nor stingy in our care for the poor and those who stand in need of our sustenance.<br><br>As I began writing down the patterns of the "remember" scriptures, I also discovered some "remember, remember" scriptures--six of them, to be exact. Five are in the Book of Mormon and one is in the Doctrine and Covenants. If the "remember" scriptures are important, then the "remember, remember" ones must be doubly important.<br><br>These six scriptures in themselves provide an effective review of an already familiar pattern. Helaman told his sons Nephi and Lehi, "O remember, remember, my sons, . . . that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ" (Helaman 5:9).<br><br>Furthermore, he said to them, "And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation" (Helaman 5:12).<br><br>To Helaman from his father, Alma: "O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God" (Alma 37:13).<br><br>King Benjamin taught, "I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. . . . O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it" (Mosiah 2:41).<br><br>Samuel the Lamanite reminded the people, "And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself" (Helaman 14:30).<br><br>Finally, in this dispensation the Lord taught the Prophet, "Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men" (D&amp;amp;C 3:3).<br><br>In the apostolic charge delivered to Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery said, "The same thing rehearsed frequently profits us" (<i>HC</i>2:192). As we all have a tendency to forget, the Lord has provided some gentle reminders to help us remember important things in the gospel. For those who are endowed, frequent visits to the temple remind us of holy covenants and promises. Frequent reading of the scriptures keeps important things in our remembrance. Perhaps the most pervasive reminder of all is the sacrament. All members of the Church can participate weekly in this important ordinance. By so doing we are regularly reminded of our willingness to take His name upon us, to keep His commandments, and to always remember Him. If we remember and do these things, the Lord promises that His Spirit will be with us, which Spirit brings "all things to [our] remembrance" (John 14:26). The Lord can also jog our memory in some not so gentle ways. Mormon observed, "Except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him" (Helaman 12:3).<br><br>May we be wise enough to remember the gentle reminders.<br><br>Brethren and sisters, in all of our remembering and forgetting through life, let us remember, and do, at least these five important things:<br><br>1. Remember the Lord and His holy name.<br>2. Remember His word, as well as His words.<br>3. Remember His commandments.<br>4. Remember His marvelous works.<br>5. Remember the poor.<br><br>Now, remember who you are. You are a covenant child of God, who loves you and has prepared a way for you to return to Him. Remember that happiness and peace in this life and in the world to come depend upon remembering the principles I have discussed today. Remember to keep your covenants with the Lord in order to claim His promised blessings. Remember that you are precious and of great worth to Him.<br><br>I testify of the Lord Jesus Christ and of the saving power of His holy name. I am a witness of His word, His commandments, and His marvelous works. I testify of our need to care for the poor among us. May we so also remember, and do, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Dennis B.

<h1>and Near - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Two parts of my university education introduce my subject today. The first I remember from my BYU freshman English class, where I had an excellent teacher. We wrote essays that were due every Friday, and, at that point, I hoped someday to be a writer. I had enjoyed some success with my writing during my 18 years. I had won a prize here and there, and my parents certainly thought I wrote well. So I welcomed writing that essay every week--at first.<br><br>Somehow my teacher was more critical than my parents were. No matter how I tried, I couldn't seem to please him. Finally, one week I poured everything I had into three pages and handed it in, only to receive it back simply dripping with red ink and caustic comments about choosing something to write about that could be tackled in three pages. "Limit your subject," he wrote, and "Write about something you understand!" There were exclamation points to help me see the fervor of his comments, and I was stunned to receive what I considered a failing grade. I had hoped to touch his heart with my stirring three-page treatise encompassing all anyone would need to know about democracy.<br><br>With a crisp remembrance of that experience in my mind, I broach my subject today with real trepidation. I will talk about eternal perspective--which brings me to the second part of my university education that I want to share with you.<br><br>As an undergraduate English major at BYU I read a lot. In an early class on learning how to analyze literature, we read a short story by Thomas Wolfe called "The Far and the Near." Wolfe wrote about a train engineer who drove the same line for 20 years. At a certain crossing he had to blow the whistle, and then, just ahead, every day a woman stepped out of her cottage and waved to him with a high, happy hand. He looked forward to that distant encounter every day. Soon the woman came to wave with a child by her side, then, over the years, the little girl grew bigger until now she was a grown woman, too.<br><br>The cottage where the woman lived was neat and tidy with flowers growing around it. The woman waved summer or winter, sunny days or gray, and the man promised himself that someday he would go meet the woman who had been such a bright spot in his life.<br><br>Finally the day came. Retired from responsibility, he got off the train at the little town one day and walked the country road to where the woman lived. He was shocked to find that it was all unfamiliar, not at all as he had imagined it. In fact, when he got up enough courage to knock at the door, he found the woman who greeted him at the door was not beautiful, not free. Life's hardships had made her pinched and sullen and ugly. After struggling to explain why he was there, he left disappointed, beaten, and sad.<br><br>I have thought about that story many times over the years, looking at it this way and that, considering what it means to look at something from far away and then close-up. I discover that I am uncomfortable with Thomas Wolfe's conclusions and with the "unfinished" look, which communicates that something is wonderful from far away but ugly when seen close-up. I am concerned with our often jaundiced view of one another and our assumptions that one close-up look brings enough information to make clear judgments. I now realize that both the far view and the near view by Mr. Wolfe's engineer were false because he did not look with eyes of truth. Suppose he had used eyes of truth that would allow him to see from an eternal perspective--the Lord's perspective--with an understanding heart. It is just as the Savior explained to His disciples when asked why He taught in layered parables. Instead of "he that hath ears" (see Mark 4:9–13), let us say, "He that hath eyes to see, let him see." Looking with eyes of truth, I would say two seemingly contradictory things to Mr. Wolfe's engineer: "You didn't go near enough" and "You didn't go far enough away."<br><h2><b>Looking Nearer Through Eyes of Truth</b></h2><br>First, about looking nearer: Last summer I took my first baby steps into family history--oh, nothing as noble as searching out lines of our family to take names to the temple to have them sealed to us forever. No, my aims were more modest. I set out to write a simple story about my father, Andrew Jensen Terry--an ordinary man, now 94 years old, who lives in Beaver, Utah, the town where I was born and grew up. I hoped to capture his charm and his humor and some of the tales from his life that I have loved since I was a child. Interviews with him of several hours over a delightful weekend were to be the heart of my story, told in his own words and preserved for my grandchildren. I hoped Zachie, Olle, Sadie, Leif, and McKay might see that the elderly man who calls them--and all his other grandchildren--"Butch" was once a child like they are.<br><br>Soon I realized that the book wouldn't be complete without at least two other stories inseparably intertwined with my father's. First is that of my wonderful mother, Lyla Wixom Terry, who was accidentally killed more than 35 years ago while I was a missionary in the South German Mission. Second is that of my sweet stepmother, Edla Johnson Terry, who has been by my father's side since he was little more than middle-aged. They were two ordinary women--one a schoolteacher, the other a nurse--each having chosen one of the traditional roles available to women born about a century ago.<br><br>My father's tales about living in a tent in the Nevada desert with his parents and three siblings intrigued me. So I searched for histories of his parents, then of my mother's parents, then of their grandparents, until I had cobbled together small stories of each grandparent up to four generations before me. I found ordinary people: farmers, a few teachers, a lumberjack, a telegraph operator, two railroad graders, and people who were children in one story and young marrieds in the next--who then became the mothers and fathers who brought their skills and gave them freely to tame the wilderness of the American West. As I come nearer, Mr. Wolfe, I find no bitter, sullen people here. On the contrary, I discover something else entirely.<br><br>These are not ordinary people at all, though they didn't know it. These are heroes. They were men and women who fought the elements, the economy, the challenges of the frontier. They were men and women who forged relationships through monogamy and polygamy and monogamy again to carve out lives of honor and, yes, glory.<br><br>I regret that I can't get close enough. I revel in bits of information that I find and discover that the family history center in my own stake has information to enrich my work. I have found the names of the ships on which my ancestors sailed to America. I have found census records with their names and occupations. I have found that some were involved in the Church history I already knew.<br><br>For example, Solomon Wixom, my mother's great-grandfather, was a member of the Schuyler, Illinois, militia and a member of the Church. As a militia member he was called with his unit to go to Carthage to keep the peace as Joseph Smith and Hyrum were arrested and put in jail there. He tried to explain that his allegiance to Joseph was too great, but those around him insisted that the Mormons do their duty and go to Carthage with them. He went. On June 26, 1844, he watched as Joseph and Hyrum were taken to the Carthage courthouse; then he helped keep order as they were returned to jail. On June 27, because of the seeming quiet, Solomon's group was relieved of duty and sent back home to Schuyler, Illinois. They had traveled 10 miles on their way and set up camp when a horse and rider galloped through shouting that "Joseph and Hyrum have been killed!" But Solomon hadn't had to be there. He hadn't had to choose where his allegiance lay.<br><br>My father's grandmother, Bengtha Swenson, left beautiful Sweden disowned and knowing that she may never hear from her father or mother again in this life. Did they quarrel? Did she try to explain about the gospel? After whatever words had been said and she had left for Denmark to work for a year before boarding a ship set for the golden shores of America, did her mother waken in the night to weep for her daughter and for the words that had passed between them? They never had contact again.<br><br>The far and the near? Oh that we could draw nearer to heal the rifts we make with those we love!<br><br>This I know to be true. Family matters. The learning that comes in the laboratory of the home is one reason we have accepted this earthly existence--yes, more than accepted: rejoiced over. Yet when I look at how far we have to go, how much we have to learn to ever be like the Savior, I despair over the length of the journey. How can it ever be? How can we learn enough?<br><br>Resolving family problems lies at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East. "We are two brothers," a priest in Jerusalem said to me, "born in the same cradle." In the Jerusalem Center we employed both Israeli and Palestinian workers. They worked side by side--respectfully, for the most part; hopefully; and with responsibility. That microcosm of Holy Land society leads me to believe--to hope--that there is a solution to the anger between the two peoples. As I discussed such things with my friends on both sides of the issues, I was amazed to discover that everyone--really everyone whom I knew--wanted peace. They wanted the leaders to work out solutions. They didn't hate each other. They knew there was some way to live together to the mutual benefit of both sides without encroaching on each other's beliefs.<br><br>I watched Abdullah, a Palestinian worker, stand respectfully at attention on the balcony of the Jerusalem Center as the siren sounded for Prime Minister Rabin's funeral after he was assassinated. I saw our Israeli security chief hire Palestinian workers to help guard the center, and on one occasion when fire broke out because children were playing with matches under some nearby brush, my Israeli friend watched one of our fine Palestinian workers wade into that fire with our fire hose, remarking to me, "When I'm in trouble, I want Ali to be right there. Ali is a brave man."<br><br>Have you seen that, Mr. Wolfe? Do you know that when we get right up close to someone, we may see their warts but we may also see their souls? And they are brave and beautiful.<br><br>Let's now look from farther away. What does a broader view tell us about the truth of this earthly existence?<br><h2><b>Looking with Eyes of Truth from Farther Away</b></h2><br>In my mind's eye I imagine our learning about coming to earth, rejoicing, knowing we could do whatever was required and understanding that this earthly existence was the next necessary step in our eternal progression. But in that pure spiritual environment, I wonder, did we realize what it would mean to have the veil drawn, to be here without "recollection of [our] former friends and birth" ("O My Father,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292)?<br><br>I like places here that remind me of there. The temple is one of those places. The temple lets me look at the big picture of eternity with the Savior Himself at the center. And sometimes, when I'm there, I get a glimpse of the whole thing--from the beginning to wherever "never-ending" is. And sometimes I almost understand.<br><br>One thing I understand for sure (this means our view necessarily focuses in again) is that the Savior is the key to our whole earthly existence. I think of the baby in Bethlehem, the toddler in Egypt and then in Nazareth, the stripling boy who learned to build things by Joseph's side. I think of earthly parents teaching Him. I think of Galilee and the sea where the tempest raged; of Capernaum, where He taught and found friends like Peter and John, who followed Him. I think of Bethany, just around the shoulder of the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem, where He liked to stay with Mary and Martha and Lazarus. He ate and slept and grew and laughed and was discouraged and enjoyed friends--just as we do. He underwent this mortal experience to learn and progress--just as we do. Because of that experience, He understands us. If we work it right, this earthly experience will lead us to understand Him, too. No, it is stronger than that: He loves us, and, if we work it right, this earthly experience will lead us to love Him. "We love him," says John, "because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19). How else could He have endured Gethsemane? He paid for your life and mine, paid for your sins and mine, with His whole self. It was all that God Himself could offer. "I stand all amazed" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 193).<br><br>Our view must come closer again to examine what it means to love God, to love the Savior, because, after all, we are caught in this finite existence and must work out our salvation from here. How? What must I do today to demonstrate that I love the Lord? John reported that the Lord said, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" (John 13:35). Ah, me. It is hard to even like some people, let alone love them.<br><br>But here are some ways I have found that work. The most important way is praying for the gift of the Spirit that allows love.<br><br>Here's another. Certainly I see my students at the first of the semester differently than I do at the end. As we forge through this learning process together, I get glimpses of who they are, of what they hope, and, sometimes, of what moves them. In short, getting to know them--connecting with them, finding what truths we share and what passions we carry--is one way that helps me love them.<br><br>Here's another way. At the Jerusalem Center we had wonderful mature couples, service couples, who came to help us run things more smoothly. They oversaw housekeeping, for example, or played the organ, led tours, helped with secretarial work in the office, and served as marvelous grandparent figures for hundreds of students. They offered themselves as role models of happy marriages, as experienced adults with listening ears and stable backgrounds. They loved the students. I learned a lesson from a brother from one of those couples. He was a professional man--learned and wise. He was a former stake president who had clearly blessed the lives of thousands of people in his lifetime.<br><br>He told me how he and his wife had approached their time to serve a mission. He said his wife was willing to serve wherever the Lord called them. But he--in his "wisdom," he said--had counseled the Lord about what he would be willing to do. He told the Lord and those who issue mission calls for the Lord that he couldn't learn a language, wasn't willing to proselyte, and would like to continue practicing his profession. So they were called as a service couple to Jerusalem. There--mingling with young people full of faith, walking where the Savior walked along the dusty roads of Palestine, and growing to love and understand the Savior's teachings with a depth he hadn't known before--he confided to me near the end of his stay, "Now I will go wherever the Lord wants me to go. This time I put my whole self upon the altar." That's another way to love our fellow travelers on this earth, by putting our whole selves upon the altar and "yielding [our] hearts unto God" (Helaman 3:35). President Ezra Taft Benson said, "Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can" (<i>TETB,</i>361).<br><br>I have one more way to learn to love. My story begins in first grade. I loved first grade. The windows that were decorated with our drawings for anyone to see who drove down Main Street were changed with the seasons. I loved the smell of chalk dust and pencil shavings. I loved jump rope and tag at recess, and I loved the books the teacher read to us after lunch. In our school, two first-grade classrooms on the first floor were matched by two second-grade classrooms directly above on the second floor. We first graders were not allowed to go up those stairs except on an occasional afternoon visit to the school library, carefully chaperoned by our teacher. But each day I stood on the first floor and watched the second graders clamber up the stairs talking and laughing, the boys punching each other in the arm and the girls giggling and whispering. I longed to go up those stairs, too. Going upstairs to second grade appeared to me to be the ultimate step in maturity. Second graders knew more than we did, and somehow I understood that knowing more would be advantageous to me, so I longed for the day I could go upstairs to second grade.<br><br>That day came. I climbed the stairs on the first day of second grade and sat down in my classroom expecting maturity and understanding to unfold before me. I looked around the room and found seated there the same children I had been with in first grade. To my surprise and dismay, nothing, simply nothing, seemed different. It appeared that second grade would not unlock the mysteries of the world. Surrounding me were ordinary children. All of us apparently were no different than we were last year. What a disappointment when I had expected something much more grand.<br><br>I have lived long enough now to watch my classmates grow up, marry, raise families, wrestle with the economy, put food on the table, and set one foot in front of the other in doing the best they could. What I couldn't see in second grade--and often miss even now--was that I was growing, too. Just because the same people were around me didn't mean we were the same.<br><br>Understanding who those ordinary people around us are can help us love them more. C. S. Lewis understood, I feel, better than Thomas Wolfe. Lewis said:<br><br><i>It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. ... It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no</i>ordinary<i>people. You have never talked to a mere mortal.</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1949), 14–15; emphasis in original]<br><br>And there it is. No matter how it looks, we are no mere mortals. We must treat ourselves, and those sitting next to us in class, with more respect because of who they are--and because of who we are. We are not ordinary people. None of us is--not one. We are gods and goddesses in training. For us to move forward, we must be better than we are in our simple dealings with one another. We must love one another--not merely like them or tolerate them, but love them.<br><br>These things I know to be true. We are given time and opportunity to be molded like Jesus Christ. We are in a process. So are all those around us. By looking at this earth and its purpose from some broad perspective, we can sense the purpose of the exercise, the school--the university, if you will--that moves this earth life forward in our becoming like the Savior.<br><br>So I plan to gather my grandchildren around me and tell them stories about where they came from. I want to tell them about Anna, the little girl who grew up to live in a tent. I want to tell them about Don, the baby boy whose mother died when he was nine months old but who now tells us that never was a mother kinder to him than his father's third wife. That little boy grew up to be the kindest man many people have ever known. And, of course, I want to tell them about Andrew, the little boy who wanted to get rid of his warts so much that he stole his grandmother's only dishrag, rubbed his warts with it, and buried it in the garden because he heard that would make warts disappear. That little boy grew up to call all of his grandchildren "Butch." I want them to understand the nobility they spring from, the richness of their heritage, the nature of their caring.<br><br>I want to tell them about Bethlehem and Nazareth and Galilee and about a little Boy who lived there and grew up to offer them life eternal. I want to help their parents teach them not to "fight and quarrel one with another" but "to love one another, and to serve one another" (Mosiah 4:14–15).<br><br>Someday this mortality will put on immortality. Someday we will see not "through a glass, darkly; but ... face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Someday the unfolding lessons of our life will become clear to us: exactly why we failed chemistry or why that relationship didn't work out or why we lived in days of war or why we were taught the gospel in Argentina or Germany or what purpose the daily efforts of life had and why the crying babies and the pain of divorce and loneliness and heartache were allowed, making us sit in dismay with our heads in our hands. Something about all of this "shall give [us] experience" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7) and turn us to Him to seek solace and peace and understanding, teaching us to love Him. We love Him because He first loved us. Because He loves us, we may, we can, we must love each other.<br><br>Because we are not ordinary people as Thomas Wolfe would have us believe, we will see as John does: "Beloved, now are we the sons [and daughters] of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:2). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Kaye Terry Hanson was an assistant professor in the BYU Marriott School of Management when this devotional address was given on 3 December 2002.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>he Savior is Born - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
With Christmas only a fortnight away, thoughts turn to our homes and families. Sister Nelson and I enjoy many Christmas traditions. On our mantle over the fireplace we display a small framed photograph of each member of the family. With 10 children, their spouses, and 54 grandchildren, that's quite a flock of photos. We have been doing this for so long that most of the pictures are no longer current. The children scramble to find their own pictures among the many.<br><br>They also admire Sister Nelson's large assortment of dolls collected from various countries throughout the world. Those dolls are nestled among the branches of our Christmas tree. Her cookies, cakes, and candies are always in great demand. And we love to read scriptures of the Christmas story with our family.<br><br>Through all of our various Christmas traditions, I hope that we are focused first upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Wise men still adore Him. At this special devotional, many of you have come with a prayer in your hearts that you may learn from one of the Twelve Apostles more about our Lord and Master.<br><br>We commemorate His humble birth at this time of year, even though we know it did not occur in December but more likely in April. Scriptures declare that His mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph. They had participated in the first of two components of a Jewish marriage ceremony. Their espousal might be likened to an engagement in our culture, which is followed later by the second component of a marriage ceremony.<br><br>Luke's account records the appearance of the Angel Gabriel to Mary when she first learned of her favored future. I read from chapter 1:<br><br>"Hail, thou that art highly favoured . . . : blessed art thou among women. . . .<br><br>"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.<br><br>"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.<br><br>"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest."<sup>1</sup>(Note the capital S; capital H.)<br><br>God is the Highest. Jesus was to be the Son of the Highest.<br><br>"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"<sup>2</sup><br><br>She knew of her virginal status.<br><br>"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."<sup>3</sup><br><br>Before Joseph and Mary came together, she was expecting that holy child. Joseph desired to protect her privacy,<sup>4</sup>hoping to spare Mary the punishment given to a woman pregnant without a completed marriage. While he pondered these things, the Angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph, saying,<br><br>"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Mary and Joseph did not need to be taught the deep significance of the name<i>Jesus.</i>The Hebrew root from which it was derived,<i>Jehoshua,</i>means "Jehovah is salvation." So the mission of Jehovah, soon to be named Jesus, was salvation, and His supreme destiny was to become the Savior of the world.<br><br>Let's turn to the Book of Mormon for the dialogue that Nephi had with an angel as recorded in 1 Nephi 11:<br><br>The angel asked: "Knowest thou the condescension of God?"<sup>6</sup><br><br>Nephi replied: "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.<br><br>"And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.<br><br>". . . I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!<br><br>"And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.<br><br>"And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!"<sup>7</sup><br><br>Now let's turn to the second chapter of Luke--the fond and familiar story that we read at Christmastime:<br><br>"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."<sup>8</sup><br><br>This was really a capitation tax, a census, an enrollment--a registration of the citizenry of the empire of Rome. Herod made a decision that people should be counted in the land of their ancestors. Mary and Joseph, then living in Nazareth, had to travel southward to the city of David, a distance approximately as far as from Salt Lake City to Nephi. Perhaps they traveled even farther if they went around the hostile intermediate province of Samaria. Almost certainly they traveled with relatives who likewise were summoned to the land of their ancestry. This difficult travel was no doubt made with their animals, such as dogs and donkeys. They likely camped out several nights, as three to four days would have been required for that journey.<br><br>Verse 7: "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."<sup>9</sup><br><br>Let's pause to ponder this verse. We need to be aware of the culture of that time and region, and we need to learn one word from the original Greek text. In the Greek New Testament, the root from which<i>inn</i>was translated is<i>kataluma.</i>We don't have an equivalent word in the English language. The Greek prefix<i>kata-</i>(or<i>cata-</i>) means "a bringing down." We see it in English words such as<i>cata</i>bolism,<i>cata</i>strophe, and<i>cata</i>clysm. When the prefix<i>kata-</i>was joined with the suffix<i>-luma,</i>it meant literally "a breaking down of a journey." A kataluma was a guest chamber in a lodging place.<br><br>In those days an inn was not like a Holiday Inn or a Bethlehem Marriott. A lodging place in that part of Asia had to provide accommodations for traveling caravans, including the people and their animals. Caravans stayed at what was then known (and is still known) as a<i>caravansary,</i>or a<i>khan.</i>You may look in your own dictionary and find<i>caravansary</i>and<i>khan,</i>each defined as a rest house in some Asian countries.<br><br>Such a facility is typically rectangular in shape. It has a central courtyard for the animals that is surrounded by walled cubicles where the people rest. These quarters allowed guests to be elevated slightly above their animals with open doorways so that owners could watch over their animals.<br><br>The Joseph Smith Translation of Luke 2:7 indicates that there was no room for them in the "inns," suggesting that all of the katalumas or cubicles of the caravansary were occupied. In the Greek New Testament the word<i>kataluma</i>appears in only two other passages,<sup>10</sup>translated in each instance not as "inn" but as a "guestchamber," which fits the concept that we have discussed.<br><br>As a youngster, whenever I heard those words "no room in the inn," I assumed that No Vacancy signs were posted at local motels or that the innkeepers were inhospitable or even hostile. Such an assumption is probably way off the mark. People of that part of the world were no doubt then as they are now--most hospitable. Particularly would this have been true at a season when the normal population of Jerusalem and neighboring Bethlehem would be swollen with large numbers of relatives.<br><br>At a caravansary, animals were secured for the night in the center courtyard. In that courtyard there would have been donkeys and dogs, sheep, and possibly camels and oxen, along with all of the animals' discharges and odors. Because the guest chambers surrounding the courtyard were filled, Joseph possibly made the decision to care for Mary's delivery in the center courtyard of a caravansary--among the animals. There, in that lowly circumstance, the Lamb of God was born.<br><br>Why was reference made twice in Luke 2 to His being wrapped in swaddling clothes?<sup>11</sup>What is the meaning of those five words "wrapped him in swaddling clothes"? I sense a significance beyond the use of an ordinary diaper and receiving blanket. Instead of those five words in the English text, only one word is needed in the Greek New Testament. That word is<i>sparganoo,</i>which means to envelop a newborn child with special cloth, strips of which were passed from side to side.<sup>12</sup>The cloth would probably bear unique family identification. That procedure was especially applicable to the birth of a firstborn son.<br><br>You remember the announcement of an angel at the birth of Jesus:<br><br>"This shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."<sup>13</sup>His wrappings surely would have been distinctive.<br><br>I think that such a concept of a cloth with family markings might also have been relevant when Joseph, son of Israel, became the birthright son and received the unique cloth coat of many colors--a fabric symbolic of the birthright.<br><br>What about the manger? Those of you who speak French will recognize the word to be the same as the French word<i>manger,</i>meaning "to eat." A manger is a trough or an open box in a stable designed to hold feed, provender, or fodder for animals to eat. Elevated from the floor of the contaminated courtyard, a manger was probably the cleanest site available. Such a feeding trough became the cradle for our Lord!<br><br>Now, two millennia later, though we don't know all the details pertaining to His birth, we certainly understand the unique parentage of this Babe of Bethlehem. Several scriptures ask the question "Who shall declare His generation?"<sup>14</sup>We declare solemnly and with conviction: Jesus was born of an immortal Father and a mortal mother. From His immortal Father, Jesus inherited the power to live forever. From His mortal mother He inherited the fate of physical death.<br><br>He declared this reality regarding His own life: "No man taketh it from me," He said, "but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Those unique attributes were essential for His mission to atone for the sins of all mankind. Thus Jesus the Christ was born to die.<sup>16</sup>He died that we might live. He was born that all humankind could live beyond the grave.<sup>17</sup>His Atonement was wrought in Gethsemane--where He sweat great drops of blood--and on Golgotha (or Calvary)--where His body was lifted up upon a cross above the place of the skull, which signified death. This infinite Atonement would release man from the infinitude of death.<sup>18</sup>His Atonement made the Resurrection a reality and the gift of eternal life a possibility for all who would obey His teachings. His Atonement became the central act of all human history.<br><br>Our recollections of Christmas are enriched by these realities. Each one of us with a testimony of the Lord has the privilege in faith to know of His divine parentage and to testify that Jesus is the Son of the living God.<br><br>True testimony includes the fact that the Father and the Son appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith, whose birth we commemorate on December 23. That testimony includes the fact that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, led by the living Lord via prophecy and revelation through authorized administrators who receive and respond to direction from Him.<br><br>With this background in mind, I share comforting counsel with you today. It comes from section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where we read this commandment from our Master: "Be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come."<sup>19</sup><br><br>Lovingly we cling to that promise. Difficult days are ahead for all mankind. Sin is on the increase. We live in a time of wars and rumors of wars. The Church and its members will come under attack and endure persecution.<sup>20</sup><br><br>Jesus descended below all things in order to rise above all things. He expects us to follow His example. Yoked with Him, we can rise above all challenges, no matter how difficult they may be.<sup>21</sup>Peter offered this counsel:"If any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."<sup>22</sup><br><br>The time is coming when those who do<i>not</i>obey the Lord will be separated from those who<i>do.</i>Our safest insurance is to continue to be worthy of admission to His holy house. How blessed we are to have temples available. The greatest gift you could give to the Lord at this or any other time of year is to keep yourself unspotted from the world, worthy to attend His holy house. His gift to you will be the peace and security of knowing that you are worthy to meet Him, whenever that time shall come.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I plead with you to rise above the tasks of the day and the hurdles ahead. You can do more than the deeds scheduled in your daily planners. You can take the name of the Lord upon you and become more like Him. You can rise to your great potential. You can prepare for the future with greater spiritual capacity.<br><br>Remember that the fulness of Christ's ministry lies in the future. The prophecies of His Second Coming have yet to be fulfilled. At Christmas, of course, we focus upon His birth. But, He will come again. At His First Coming Jesus came almost in secret. Only a few mortals knew of His birth. At His Second Coming the whole of humankind will know of His return. Then He will come, not as "a man traveling on the earth,"<sup>23</sup>but His glory "shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together."<sup>24</sup><br><br>As a special witness of His holy name, I testify that Jesus is the divine Son of the living God. He will love you, lift you, and manifest Himself unto you if you will love Him and keep His commandments.<sup>25</sup><br><br>I express my love and blessing for each of you, along with my best wishes for a very merry Christmas, and do so prayerfully in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell M.
