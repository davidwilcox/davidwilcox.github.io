<h1>World‚Äù - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We are privileged tonight to have a very honored guest. I&#39;m sure none of you will notice him unless I point him out to you. L. Tom Perry IV, my grandson, is on the floor over here. You notice his position--right underneath the basket, if the basket were there. I have great confidence in this young man. Judging by his present rate of growth, I think between 6&#39;10" and 7&#39; is about where we could expect him to be. If anyone from the P.E. Department is here, if you&#39;d like to see me, we&#39;ll sign a letter of intent immediately following the meeting.<br><br>I&#39;m delighted to be back with you again to begin a new year. I think I&#39;ve had the privilege three out of the last four years of being here as a new calendar year starts. It doesn&#39;t seem possible that another one has passed. Where did it go? They seem to go by rapidly as we have opportunity to grow and experience life in this exciting time in which we live.<br><h2><b>"In the World"</b></h2><br>Tonight I&#39;d like to talk to you about a subject that I think we need in the Church. I think we need to be reminded of it, to prepare ourselves more all the time for our responsibilities in the world in which we live. The Savior once said:<br><br><i>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, . . . I have chosen you out of the world.</i>[John 15:19]<br><br>From the teachings of the Savior, we have adopted the common saying in the Church: "To be in the world, but not of the world." The phrase has two distinct parts, the first being "in," and the second being "not of." Too often, I think, we use them together and think of them as justification to remain somewhat detached, somewhat removed, from the world. I would like to separate this phrase tonight and give emphasis only to the part of being "in the world." It is far better to view the two parts as separate, equally important admonitions. Of course, we must stay free from the sins and materialism of the world around us. But is it equally important to live "in the world"?<br><br>It is "in the world" we have had the privilege of coming to have a mortal experience. It is "in the world" where we are tested and tried. It is "in the world" that we have the opportunity of partaking of sacred saving ordinances which will measurably determine our postmortal life. It is the world that must be saved; it is to the world that the Christ must come again. It is the world that will be our eternal home.<br><h2><b>Encouragement from Prophets</b></h2><br>We will play no part in saving our world, in preparing it for its destiny or in making it a better place in which to live, if we refuse to be a part of it and make our contribution to it while we live. Our prophets in this day have encouraged us to be mindful of our obligations while we are here in the world. I would like to quote from just two of them. First, President Heber J. Grant, who said:<br><br><i>What a wonderful power we shall have with the Lord in furtherance of His mighty purpose in the earth, if we keep His commandments. Our influence will be not only with the world, but with our own young people. Their strength and power will be multiplied if we shall succeed in having them feel the necessity of observing the commandments of God and particularly . . . the Word of Wisdom and the principles of clean and righteous living.</i><br><br><i>It is not out of place to predict that the people of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will continue to thrive and prosper, spiritually and temporally, as long as they (1) keep the commandments of God and (2) walk in the way which He shall point out through His inspired servants holding the Holy Priesthood. They are a people whose faith, teachings, thrift, and temporal and spiritual progress will be a blessing and an advantage to the whole [world].</i>[<i>Gospel Standards</i>(Salt Lake City:<i>Improvement Era</i>, 1942). p. 101]<br><br>And then President McKay said this:<br><br><i>The responsibility of showing to the world that the gospel of Jesus Christ will solve its problems rests upon the men who make the claim, who believe that [every world problem may be solved by obedience to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.] . . .</i><br><br><i>The solution of the great world problems is here in the Church of Jesus Christ. Ample provision is made not only for the needs of individuals, but also for the nations and groups of nations. I grant that we may be arrogating to ourselves superior wisdom, but we are not. It is simply the application of God&#39;s plan to the world problems. You who hold the priesthood have greater responsibility today, now that you live in this creative moment in the world&#39;s history, than ever the Church has had before. I repeat it. If we make the claim to hold the truth, it is obligatory upon every Latter-day Saint so to live that, when the people of the world come, in answer to the call, to test the fruit of the tree, they will find it wholesome and good.</i><br><br><i>The Lord will help us to be able to prove to the world that we possess just what the world today is longing for, and when they see it, they will know, as you know, as I know, that the everlasting gospel is a light to the world.</i>[<i>Gospel Ideals</i>(Salt Lake City:<i>Improvement Era</i>, 1953), p. 5]<br><h2><b>Scriptural Example: Daniel</b></h2><br>Now, in looking for a way to illustrate this topic that I&#39;ve selected for tonight, I searched the scriptures to try and find an example of one who was required to live "in the world" and yet was able to make his contribution for the good of the people among whom he lived. I found a classic example in the Old Testament. The birth of this young man came at a time when his kingdom, Judah, was having great difficulty. It seems improbable that anyone from this nation could make much of a contribution to the world as it existed at that time.<br><br>After the death of King Solomon in 975 B.C., Israel, the northern kingdom, separated itself from Judah. The two kingdoms were not able to hold their own against the other powers of the region, and Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 721 B.C. Egypt and Assyria would take turns overrunning the land of Judah. In the year 607 B.C., the Medes entered into an alliance with the Babylonians to besiege the Assyrians, whose capital city, Nineveh, fell, and the two conquering nations divided up the spoils of Assyria. Assyria proper in the northern provinces fell into the hands of the Medes, and Syria lay open to be seized by the Babylonians.<br><br>While the struggle was going on, it seemed an appropriate time for Egypt to move through Judah. When the king of the Babylonians heard of Egypt&#39;s move, he sent his son, Nebuchadnezzar, to drive the Egyptians back to their border. While the battle raged with the Egyptians, the king passed away, and Nebuchadnezzar became the ruler of Babylonia. He was successful against the Egyptians and became the ruler over all of Syria to the Egyptian border.<br><br>These nations were powerful in destruction, but they were never able to build up much of a stable political structure. They ruled by terror. They crushed their enemies by fire and sword. Then they would weaken a conquered foe by deporting some of the choice people of that land to other parts of their empire so that the leadership would be stripped from the land.<br><br>It was in this bloody climate that Daniel was born. As a youth he was selected to be deported from his home in Judah to Babylon, the center in which Nebuchadnezzar was building his empire. The king was determined to make it the center of the universe, the most beautiful city in the world, with beautiful parks and buildings and, in the city center, a temple to the worship of the gods of Babylon. Thus Daniel was brought into a strange land as a youth--a land with strange customs, a strange tongue, strange environment, and a strange religious foundation, for the Babylonians believed in nature worship.<br><h2><b>First Test: Law of Health</b></h2><br>His first test in being "in the world" came when the king ordered that the ones who had been captured drink of his wine and eat of his rich food. Daniel understood from the commandments that he had been taught by his parents, the commandments of the Lord, that these things were not good for his body. In their homes Daniel and his friends were taught to keep the commandments of God, and they knew it would be wrong to eat and drink of unhealthful things. But how could he explain this knowledge to the leaders of Babylon who did not believe as they did, who even had different gods?<br><br>"The king has commanded that thou shalt eat and drink the same as the others," argued the servant who was responsible for training these young men.<br><br>"If thou doest not eat this, and the king sees that thou art growing weak and thin, he will surely have me killed," was the servant&#39;s reply to Daniel when he came to have his diet changed.<br><br>But Daniel begged that he and his friends be allowed to follow the health rules that had been given to them. His response was, "Prove us for ten days. Feed us upon the grains, and let us drink of water; then see if we are not as healthy as the rest."<br><br>The response of this young man was most interesting. He did not try to discount or to argue against the beliefs of the Babylonians. He volunteered to a test to try the two ways to see which would be the better.<br><br>The servant agreed to the test. For the next ten days Daniel and those with him ate and drank only the things that they should. At the end of ten days Daniel and his friends were found healthier and stronger than all the rest (See Daniel 1).<br><br>Now, the Lord has declared to us that some of his commandments deal with the effects they will have on the body and temporal things, which are, after all, in essence, really spiritual. The largest measure of good which is derived from following the code of health prescribed by the Lord is the increase of faith, the development of more spiritual power and wisdom. The two cannot be separated. A healthy spirit will draw much strength from a healthy body. Spiritual laws are rules of conduct from God, the violation of which brings penalties, while obedience thereto brings a communion with God and eventually life eternal. When one governs his life by divine law, he becomes more perfect. To break that law and to become a law unto himself are sins.<br><br>Listen to just a few of the admonitions of the Lord to his children, beginning with the early recorded history in the scriptures down even to the present, concerning our responsibility to live the Lord&#39;s law of health:<br><br><i>Do not drink wine nor strong drink.</i>[Leviticus 10:9]<br><br><i>Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.</i>[Deuteronomy 14:3]<br><br><i>Drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing.</i>[Judges 13:4]<br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i>[1 Corinthians 3:17]<br><br><i>And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</i><br><br><i>And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</i><br><br><i>And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 89:18-20]<br><br>Yes, Daniel met the challenge of being "in the world" and still living the Lord&#39;s law of health, thus becoming stronger than all the rest. The responsibility for that example has not diminished with time. We continue under the same obligation. When the Lord has revealed to us a better way, it must be shared. The opportunity for a better life must be given to all his children who are willing to receive it. Is this not part of our responsibility? We have been given the law. Experience has demonstrated its fruits. "In the world" we should be the strongest, the healthiest, the most vigorous of all the people on the earth. Our example in the code of health should be a light unto the world.<br><h2><b>Second Test: Mental Growth</b></h2><br>The second challenge that came to Daniel was the challenge to grow in knowledge, skill, learning, and wisdom. He was placed in competition with all of the other young men who were coming in from the various parts of the world that the Babylonians and Nebuchadnezzar had captured. They were being weeded out to see who would be worthy to stand as an adviser to the king. The scriptures record:<br><br><i>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</i><br><br><i>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel . . . in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found [Daniel] ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</i>[Daniel 1:18-20]<br><br>Imagine that. This young man taken as a captive had the determination and desire to qualify himself so he became ten times better than all the advisers of the king. So Daniel met the second challenge of being "in the world." Not only did he perfect his physical body so that it was fairer and stronger than all the rest, but he took advantage of every learning opportunity to develop his mind so that it became ten times better than the minds of those who had equal opportunity.<br><br>Again, the scriptures are replete with admonitions to stretch our minds, to increase our knowledge and understanding. Again let&#39;s quote just a few passages. In the Old Testament we find:<br><br><i>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.</i>[Proverbs 1:5]<br><br>From the New Testament:<br><br><i>Ask and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</i>[Matthew 7:7-8]<br><br>And again, from the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</i><br><br><i>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</i>[Alma 37: 34-35]<br><br>Then the Lord, in speaking to his prophets today, has declared:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18-19]<br><br><i>It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:6]<br><br>I stand before a group tonight that is having one of the greatest opportunities ever given to the children of men. You have been allowed to come to earth when there is more truth in existence than any other generation in the history of time. Think of the sacrifice of the widow, the parent, the worker, the Church, in making a great investment in you, providing you with facilities and instructors to give you a good education. What kind of a return are they receiving on this investment? Is it an investment in time for fun and games, or do you show a real appreciation for the sacrifice that is being made for you by taking advantage of every opportunity to grow in knowledge? You will probably never have a better opportunity to expose your mind to more variety of truth than you will during the next few years while you pursue your education. What will you do with this parade of information? Will it really become a part of you, or is it just a process of cramming in a session before an examination to get a passing grade? Are you building a reservoir of knowledge needed for your total life experience? Have you developed a storage system to retain in orderly fashion the information that will be of value to you in your exciting life ahead? Have you started a library, a file, a catalog system to retain this vast amount of knowledge that will be available to you during this educational phase of your life in a form that will be accessible to you in time of need? If not, your education will benefit you only in small measure in relationship to the great potential available to you at this very special time in your life.<br><br>There is a real need in the world for individuals who are willing and have the determination to stretch their minds, to be of service in bringing solutions to the many problems that face the world. I hope you follow the example of Daniel and learn to take advantage of the opportunities that are given to you to grow in knowledge and understanding, to be prepared mentally to serve the world.<br><h2><b>Go Forth to Serve</b></h2><br>Daniel&#39;s training and spiritual strength enabled him to be of service to the king in time of need. One of the most interesting stories in scripture, I think, occurred when Nebuchadnezzar had the dream. The dream startled him so much he awakened, and it troubled him greatly. He called in his counselors and said, "I&#39;ve had a dream, but I can&#39;t remember what it was. You tell me the dream and give me the interpretation thereof."<br><br>How would you like to get an assignment like that? When they could not, the king was so angered that he commanded that his wise men would not only lose their positions, they would also lose their heads. Hearing these things, Daniel rushed to the king and asked permission to have time to provide an interpretation. The king agreed. Daniel knew that the only way he could learn about the dream and its interpretation was to turn to the Lord. He asked those who believed as he did to entreat the Lord, and they prayed together. The Lord answered their prayers by telling Daniel the dream and its meaning. Everyone was astonished when Daniel told the king not only what the dream was but also what it meant. Daniel&#39;s ability on this occasion not only served the king, but it saved all those great wise men in that country for continued service in that government. You see, Daniel was able to make application of the training he had received in service to his government and in service to his fellowmen.<br><br>Again we find admonitions from the Lord that after preparation comes service. In Old Testament times, Joshua told his people:<br><br><i>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</i>[Joshua 24:15]<br><br>And the Savior said:<br><br><i>And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.</i>[Matthew 20:27]<br><br>And again in the Book of Mormon we find King Benjamin teaching his people to serve:<br><br><i>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>And Joseph Smith in this day received these instructions:<br><br><i>He that is ordained of God is set forth, the same is appointed to be the greatest, notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:26]<br><br>Further, the Lord counseled:<br><br><i>Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 81:5]<br><h2><b>Wide Field for Service</b></h2><br>I&#39;m afraid, all too often, when we think of service, it is only in the Church context--to teach a Sunday School class, go home teaching, conduct a Church meeting, or sing in sacrament service. Of course these are important. The other day I had the privilege of having breakfast with Senator Hatch and Richard Eyre. We were discussing service--service in the nation in which we live. I asked Brother Eyre to make a few notes of that conversation because I was so impressed with what these two men had to say to me. This is what he sent to my office.<br><br><i>What we must remember is that the Church exists within the world and has the purpose of saving and preparing the world. If we who are within the Church associate only with each other, give our time and our means only to internal Church causes, we remove ourselves from the world. Then two particularly negative results occur: First, we become more parochial, more narrow, less compassionate. We lose our perspective and have fewer chances to use and to spread the real gospel. Second, the people around us and the causes around us lose the potential benefit of our association and our help. The world becomes for them, and for us, a less happy place to live. The fact is that our tendency is to dwell on the things that make us different from the world. Our basic belief is in Christ. The traditional values we embrace, our hopes, our dreams, our freedom of liberty all are shared by right-minded, principled Christian people throughout the world. If we build bridges rather than walls, we begin to see that the gospel principles always unite and never separate.</i><br><br>As we discussed these items of service, I was thinking of my missionary experiences. I thought back to the times when I was most successful, when I would give true Christian service. Often on our days off--what they call preparation days today--we&#39;d don our work clothes and go out into the widow&#39;s cornfield and help her weed her corn or go help a family move. When we&#39;d put the real Christian principle of service into action, it was easy to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. For when we set the example of the process of service, it was easy to go the next step of teaching why we gave that Christian service.<br><br>As we prepare for life, of course, we should be preparing for service in the Church. But we should also be preparing for service "in the world." Throughout the world we hear the cries for sound leadership, for Christian service. We must be ready to answer these pleas for help. Our public school systems need our input and our involvement. Our local, state, and national governments need the service of principled people, grounded in the faith of the gospel of Jesus Christ. How long has it been since you really became interested in a civic cause or attended a city council meeting or supported with your time and also your means a campaign in which you believed?<br><h2><b>Opposition to Be Overcome</b></h2><br>Yes, Daniel met the challenge of being "in the world." He lived to become a trusted counselor to the king whom he served. His service, however, was not without opposition, and we will find it too as we go forward in life. He made his way to a position of prominence under three kings. Finally, in serving one of the kings, he was appointed the head of all the princes. The other princes were jealous of Daniel, and they plotted against him. They tried to find something he did that was wrong, that they could take and present before the king. When they found nothing, they had to devise another plot. The wicked princes presented a new law to the king which stated that for thirty days no one in the kingdom would be allowed to pray. It said they should praise only the king. The king seemed to think that was a good idea. What greater honor could come than to have all these people praising him for thirty days? So he put a penalty on the law: anyone found praying to any god or any man except the king would be cast into the lion&#39;s den.<br><br>When Daniel heard the new law, he was greatly troubled. Prayer was more important to Daniel, the communication with his God, than the fact that he might be cast into the den of lions. Still he continued to pray three times every day. Those who wanted to have Daniel out of the way spied on him in his house, and, when they saw him praying, the message was taken to the king.<br><br>The king loved Daniel, and he realized what a terrible trick had been played on him by the wicked princes. He tried to change the law to save Daniel from the lions, but the princes reminded him that no law that the king had made could be changed. When evening came, Daniel was thrown into the den of the hungry lions. The sorrowful king, in bidding Daniel farewell, said:<br><br><i>Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</i>[Daniel 6:17]<br><br>Imagine that. Daniel had set such a great example before the king that he trusted the Lord God of Daniel that he would deliver Daniel from the den of the lions. The king spent all night fasting for Daniel.<br><br>In the morning he rushed to the den of lions and cried out:<br><br><i>Daniel, O, Daniel, . . . is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</i>[Daniel 6:20]<br><br>And how pleased he must have been to hear Daniel&#39;s voice answer:<br><br><i>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions&#39; mouths, that they have not hurt me.</i>[Daniel 6:22]<br><br>The king was joyous and commanded that Daniel be brought up out of the lion&#39;s den. Because of Daniel&#39;s faith in God, he had not even been scratched by the hungry lions.<br><br>Even with the challenge that was continually before Daniel to live his religion, he was able to rise above the conflicts which came before him. And the Lord blessed him in his service and spared him and protected him in all that he was able to do. So much was he able to live "in the world" and be of service to the world that the king, in his reorganization, selected three princes to be over all his empire, and chief among those princes was Daniel. He had gone from being a humble servant taken out of a strange land into a strange environment to becoming the second most powerful man in that great nation. Not only did his service benefit the king, but because of his faith in the Lord, he literally affected the whole land, for the king sent forth a proclamation that all the people of his kingdom should worship the true and living God, the God whom Daniel worshiped. You see the power of service of one righteous man as he was able to serve "in the world" in which he lived.<br><h2><b>Challenge Today</b></h2><br>So tonight we begin another new year. The pages of history of 1981 are white and unrecorded before us. What will history record this new year concerning our contribution to mankind? Will the pages of history almost completely omit our names, the fact that we were "in the world," because we fail to make a contribution to our fellowmen this year? Or will there arise from this body another Daniel who is prepared physically, who understands the Lord&#39;s law of health, who has prepared himself so well that he will be an example to all with whom he comes in contact by the way he lives, the way he takes care of his physical body. Or mentally--will we be noticed for our mental contributions, the way we study, the knowledge we acquire, the wisdom that is ours to have as we sojourn in life? Or emotionally--will we be prepared to serve, to give of ourselves to others, to help lift a soul, to touch a life, to increase the happiness of another one of our Heavenly Father&#39;s children? Or spiritually--will we be so strong in the faith that what we do will be noticed because of that strength? Will we demonstrate by the life that we live that, yes, God our Eternal Father will still hear and answer prayers and abundantly bless those who will serve?<br><br>Will we be prepared to be of service in the Church and "in the world" and prepare better than those around us to set the example because of our will and our determination?<br><br>Just think of the problems that face our great nation today to which we could give time and attention in helping to find solutions: the deterioration of family life, individuals living in fear because of crime and violence. I was back visiting in the East a short time ago and watching the news. They had made a survey on the east coast, and it had been discovered that in our large cities, 60 percent of the people live in constant fear. I think that&#39;s appalling for a nation as enlightened as ours. Or think about the lack of a value system among people in morals, in honesty, in industry. Or the energy shortage, or the growing lack of confidence in our economic system, the lowering of educational standards in many of our schools, of wars and rumors of wars, and we could go on and on and on. Surely one cannot present the alibi for poor performance that there is a lack of opportunity. So at the beginning of this new year, let the trumpets sound from the tops of the mountains; let again the cry be heard, "Charge," into another new year of making our contribution, of being "in the world" in which we live. Let us do it humbly, grateful for that which the Lord has given to us, that we can serve, that we have been given the light and truth and understanding necessary to make our contribution to our fellowmen.<br><br>I declare again to you that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. His voice can still be heard giving direction to mankind in the only way that will bring peace to a troubled heart and eternal happiness to those who will follow his path. May we determine this year to live "in the world," to be a part of it, to set the standard and example that we have learned at the feet of those who have been trained in the ways of the Lord in order that that influence can permeate the lives of others.<br><br>I bear witness to this glorious principle. It is the answer to world problems. The fruits are sweet for the taking; they will bless mankind. Let&#39;s share those great blessings with them, as we continue and sojourn here. God lives; Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. His gospel is on the earth today. We have the glorious opportunity of sharing that way of life with others. May we be valiant in our responsibility of living "in the world," I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<br>
<br>
This is an overwhelming sight. And I would like you to know, my dear brothers and sisters, President Holland, President Vernon, President Gardner, and all of you, how much I have enjoyed the music and how pleased and honored I am to participate in this 14-stake fireside tonight, because I want to tell you what an exciting and challenging time it is in the history of Relief Society. It is a time of great growth, great expectations, and great needs. The sisterhood of Relief Society must be strengthened and unified now just as much as during the administration of any of the wise Relief Society presidents of the past.<br><br>Relief Society has reached its present position of status and influence under the inspiration and guidance of the prophets and apostles, and it is a great blessing to the women of the Church worldwide. Relief Society must stand as a bulwark and a fortress against the penetration of the extreme viewpoints regarding women that have become political and social issues. It must develop in each woman an understanding of not only her magnificent potential, her irreplaceable contributions, and her eternal destiny, but those of each man as well.<br><h2><b>Zina D. H. Young and Silkworms</b></h2><br>Problems are not unique to our times. Look at the life of President Zina D. H. Young, the third general president of the Relief Society. She was bright, observant, and deeply religious. Even so she suffered sickness, trials, tribulations, and sorrows. She witnessed the burning of the homes of the Saints in Nauvoo before the exodus. Her father and mother both died as the result of persecutions against the Mormons. She had two children by her first marriage. Then, later, she married Brigham Young and raised four of his children along with her two and one daughter born to them.<br><br>President Brigham Young gave Zina the mission of establishing the silk culture in the territory of Deseret. The silkworms were extremely repugnant to her, but in spite of that she successfully completed that assignment. Her love of the Lord and her determination to follow the direction given by the prophet made it possible for her to do what she was asked to do, and I am sure that she had to develop some special strengths in order to be able to do it. I can&#39;t tell you how grateful I am that I don&#39;t have to handle silkworms--just Phil Donahue.<br><h2><b>Parable of Caterpillars</b></h2><br>Last week a beautiful young woman sent me a book entitled<i>Hope for the Flowers</i>(Trina Paulus [Paramus, N. J.: Paulist Press, 1972]). As I read it, I thought, "It&#39;s too bad that Sister Zina didn&#39;t have this book. It might have given her some new insights about worms." Let me share its message with you.<br><br>It tells of a tiny striped caterpillar and how he joined a pile of other squirming, pushing caterpillars who were trying to get to the top of the pile. It was only when he talked to a certain yellow caterpillar that the two of them decided that getting on the top wasn&#39;t really what they wanted most. So, they climbed down and away from the others. They enjoyed being together, and they ate and grew fat until one day they became bored, and they wanted to find out if there was more to life. The striped caterpillar decided to find out by climbing again to the top of the caterpillar pile. The yellow caterpillar felt ashamed that she didn&#39;t agree but decided it was better to wait until she could take action she could believe in. So he climbed, and she wandered aimlessly until she saw a caterpillar hanging upside down on a branch and caught in some hairy substance. She said, "You seem to be in trouble. Can I help you?" "No," said the hanging caterpillar, "I have to do this to become a butterfly."<br><br>"Butterfly? What is a butterfly?"<br><br>"It&#39;s what you are meant to be. It flies with beautiful wings and joins the earth to heaven. It drinks only nectar from the flowers and carries seeds of love from one flower to another. Without butterflies the world would soon have few flowers."<br><br>The yellow caterpillar exclaimed, "It can&#39;t be true! How can I believe there&#39;s a butterfly inside you or me when all I see is a fuzzy worm? How does one become a butterfly?"<br><br>The hanging caterpillar said, "You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar."<br><br>The yellow caterpillar began fearfully but continued the process until at length she became a butterfly. Then she helped the striped caterpillar learn who he was and leave the pile to become what he was really meant to be.<br><h2><b>Development of Potential Powers</b></h2><br>Like the caterpillars who will one day become butterflies, you have the magnificent potential to develop the powers within you and become greater than most of you dare dream. "God has . . . made us the custodians of some great powers," said Sterling W. Sill (<i>The Power of Believing</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1968], p. 6). You have the power and the capacity to perform so well that you can inherit all that our Father has if you begin the process and continue until you become what you are really meant to be.<br><br>Each individual is entitled to choose which path to walk and thereby determine the ultimate destiny of his or her life. Some of you might question so bold a statement: "That can&#39;t be true. I want to be a great quarterback like Jim McMahon or a miraculous receiver like Clay Brown, and I can&#39;t do it, no matter how determined or diligent I am."<br><br>It is not of such choices I speak. I speak of the destiny of your life and of the eternal truth that you<i>can</i>choose to use the powers within you to have a happy life of continual growth and development that leads to eternal progression or choose to follow the crowd of other people struggling to get to a top that is nowhere.<br><br>Tonight let&#39;s consider just three of the great powers of which you are custodians. Perhaps then you can begin to understand the process necessary to become what you are really meant to be.<br><h2><b>Physical Powers</b></h2><br>First, you have great physical powers. Look at you; notice your hands, your arms, your legs, your feet, your face, your eyes, your ears, your mouth, and your nose. You must admit that you are a magnificent creation when you realize how intricate these components are and what you can do because of them. If by any chance there is more of you than you would like to see, you can do something about it. And, if you do, it will make a great difference in how you feel about yourself.<br><br>Recently I was in Washington, D.C., where I met a woman in her thirties who has not yet married. She is stunning, tall, and full of enthusiasm. She is running an oil recycling business. This young woman told me about her recent campaign to lose weight. I think that she had taken off more than 40 pounds. "I can&#39;t begin to tell you what it has done for me," she said. "Having decided to reduce my weight and then having successfully done it have made it easier for me to relate to other people because I feel so good about myself. It is exciting."<br><br>Her example serves to illustrate that physically you have the power to choose the options available to you. You who have five or ten or more pounds that you would like to lose can do so in different ways. You can take in fewer calories, or you may desire to put yourself on a consistent program of exercise, or both. The point is that you have the power to lose weight and thereby increase your capacity to do what you want to do.<br><br>I like the statement made by Bryant S. Hinckley, father of Elder Gordon B. Hinckley. He said:<br><br><i>When a man makes war on his own weaknesses he engages in the holiest war that mortals ever wage. The reward that comes from victory in this struggle is the most enduring, most satisfying, and the most exquisite that man ever experiences. . . . The power to do what we ought to do is the greatest freedom.</i>[That Ye Might Have Joy (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1958), p. 83]<br><br>I hope at some time you all will feel the reward of such a victory and that you will recognize the miracle of your mortal bodies in helping you to gain this newfound freedom.<br><br>"Think for a moment," said B. H. Roberts,<br><br><i>what progress a man makes within the narrow limits of this life. Regard him as he lies in the lap of his mother . . . a new-born babe! There are eyes, indeed, that may see, but cannot distinguish objects; ears that may hear, but cannot distinguish sounds; hands as perfectly fashioned as yours and mine, but helpless withal; feet and limbs, but they are unable to bear the weight of his body, much less walk . . . and yet, within the short span of three score years and ten, by the marvelous working of the wondrous power within . . . what a change may be wrought! From that helpless babe may arise one like unto Demosthenes or Cicero, or Pitt, or Burke, or Fox, or Webster, . . . or from such a babe may come a Nebuchadnezzar, or an Alexander, or a Napoleon, who shall found empires or give direction to the course of history.</i>[<i>Mormon Doctrine of Diety</i>(Salt Lake City:<i>Deseret News</i>, 1903), pp. 33‚Äì34]<br><br>The miracle of the mortal body became apparent to me one afternoon when I was holding my first baby. It was a girl, and suddenly she seemed to stop breathing. I tried to force air into her lungs. I cried to the Lord in desperation, and after only a few seconds that seemed like an endless hour, she began to breathe normally again. The problem was diagnosed as an enlarged thymus gland that needed treatment. I shall never forget how grateful I was for the miracle of life and for the power of the body that I knew that day. I determined to do my very best to help her use her life as the Lord intended when he gave her to me to care for and love.<br><br>I know now the powers within these bodies, and I know they are powers not only to create life but to live it in such a way that mortality will be a happy and meaningful experience. When these miraculous systems malfunction--and maybe only then--we fully appreciate the complexity of the systems that give the body life. Only as we struggle to understand the body in order to treat the ailments it falls heir to in this life do we fully appreciate its remarkable nature and the intricate interrelationships which exist. The human body is most remarkable. It can walk, run, jump, climb, swim, ski, play, jog, and on and on, but not the least of these remarkable capabilities are its compensatory powers. We find these powers as we observe some of our friends and acquaintances--or even ourselves--who have birth defects, accidents, or illnesses that cause the functions we counted on to be lost so that other parts of the body have to substitute.<br><br>You&#39;ll hear from Curt Brinkman during this week. You honored Curt at Homecoming last year because he had broken some records in the famous Boston Marathon. Curt was a good basketball player before his accident, but afterward he did not dwell on what his body could not do. When he had no legs, he trained his arms and built strength in them to compensate for his missing legs. He found another way to use the powers within him, and he became a champion.<br><br>I want you to know the full joy of your mortal body. The power is within you to do an infinite variety of things. It is like a never-ending kaleidoscope of experiences that are available to you regardless of your challenges or your problems. When one avenue of activity is denied by a physical impairment, there is still a rich variety of alternate choices available to you.<br><br>It is the masterful creation of our bodies that gives us these wonderful abilities because we are the literal offspring of our Heavenly Father. He, whose spirit children we are, organized these mortal bodies and provided us with a powerful instrument capable of vitalized mortal living. However, Elder LeGrand Richards cautions:<br><br><i>There are those who think their bodies are their own and that they can do with them what they will, but Paul makes it plain that they are not their own, for they are bought with a price, and that "if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."</i>[<i>A Marvelous Work and A Wonder</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1950), p. 380.]<br><br>You do have great physical powers within you to create life, to control your abilities and capacities, and to compensate for disabilities; and these physical powers require you to take good care of your bodies. At the very least you should obey the Word of Wisdom, eat properly, sleep and exercise regularly, and abstain from taking anything into your bodies that will destroy your powers, for you will be held accountable for them as you strive to become what you are really meant to be.<br><h2><b>Mental Powers</b></h2><br>Now consider your mental powers. Think of your infinite capacity to learn, your ability to control your attitude toward learning, and your ability to adapt to and draw from the happenings each day. No mother can watch the progress of her child without being filled with wonder at his endless desire to learn. It is one of the joys of being a parent.<br><br>There are a hunger and a frustration that accompany the young child&#39;s eagerness to grow and learn. You have all watched a child struggle to walk. Again and again he tries: up on his feet, down on the floor, bumps and hurts, cries of pain and frustration until at last he walks. At first he holds on to the offered hand for support, and then he pushes it away. A child must go through the process if he would grow and gain a sense of achievement.<br><br>This fundamental principle applies to you if real learning is to occur. Each of you must reach out for strength from others, then struggle and stretch to the limits of your own capacities to feel the ultimate sense of achievement.<br><br>With that realization look back over the centuries of our experience in mortality and see the great learning that has come to us from others. I mentioned my recent trip to Washington, D.C. While there I had the opportunity to visit the National Air and Space Museum. It is a huge structure, housing all the tangible machines of flight which are part of our national legacy. Within those walls are housed many dreams. The history of our conquest of the moon is documented there in countless projects and written records. It is just one of the tiny fragments of human inquiry which have yielded enormous amounts of knowledge.<br><br>In the earliest records of human desire to go to the moon are stories of drinking a magic potion and being wafted to the moon or harnessing giant birds that could pull a raft carrying a man to the moon. Some even thought about covering men with suction cups so that, as the dew would evaporate from the cups, the traveler could be lifted to the moon. Then came a reflection of our technological progress, the thought of gliding, and finally the realization that a person might be shot from a rocket to the moon.<br><br>More than 300 years ago the necessary principles of physics were beginning to be known, and Kepler declared that when we had developed the technology to build machines to go to the moon, men would come forward to ride those machines. They did, and the moon once whimsically described as being made of green cheese suddenly became a real place--barren, foreboding, made of rocks and boulders with no living thing on it.<br><br>In the process of conquering the distance to the moon, many things were discovered. As the hardware was developed to lift the rocket from the earth and hurl it through space, the first major discoveries with computers were made. From the roomful of equipment it took to do the first computer calculations developed our present pocket calculators.<br><br>Walk the corridors of this great university and look into the libraries and the laboratories, and you will find more projects designed to overcome the ignorance and the unknown than could have ever been dreamed about a few short years ago. Remember that knowledge builds upon knowledge. There is no end to the capacity of men and women to learn. The great vision of the gospel is that we grow in wisdom and in knowledge and in favor with God and man. You must put yourself to that task because you have the power.<br><br>When the Lord sent Adam and Eve out into the world from the Garden of Eden, he said to them, "Multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it" (Genesis 1:28). So here we are in the midst of the work of subduing the earth. There is only one way to subdue the earth. It is to learn enough to dispel ignorance and to gain enough wisdom that we might apply what we know for the benefit of all people.<br><br>There is most often an urgent desire for knowledge in us when we are young. I smiled at my young grandson, who, long before he went to school, used to take science books to his mother and say, "Read these to me."<br><br>She would ask, "Don&#39;t you want a storybook?"<br><br>He would reply, "No, mother, I don&#39;t know anything about science, and I want to learn."<br><br>At this great university you have unnumbered opportunities to learn. You can select courses, you can study in the library, you can attend concerts and plays and lectures. You can engage your friends and your professors and teachers in conversation. If you fill your time well, you will learn many great and important things at a pace you may never be able to sustain again in your lifetime.<br><br>There are no handicaps that cannot be overcome.<br><br>I was told that when J. Willard Marriott, the man for whom this great structure was named, returned home from his mission, he found that the cold of a very severe winter had killed most of his father&#39;s flock of sheep. He asked his father to buy more sheep, but his father was very hesitant to make such a large investment again. He reminded Willard that he and his brothers would be in school and that there would be no one to stay home full time with the sheep. And so young Willard volunteered to stay home instead of going away to college. For two years he watched the sheep, but his desire for an education was so compelling that he registered for home study classes and while out in the field studied hard enough to complete his first two years of college.<br><br>Joseph Larsen, a fine stake president in Illinois, was injured while serving his country. The accident left him without the use of his legs, confined to a wheelchair. But he, with the help of his lovely wife, went on to finish his education, and he is now a dean at the University of Illinois. He is a spiritual giant among the brothers and sisters of his stake. The capacity to learn did no end when his ability to walk ended. He kept going.<br><br>A delightful sister, Ruth Knudson, took me on a tour through the National Gallery of Art. When her husband passed away, she decided that she would make good use of her time alone. She studied art history. It was so fascinating to her that she wanted to tell others about it, so she began conducting tours through the various galleries. Then she took a group abroad to study art. People began coming to her home and requesting private lessons or group instruction, whichever she would give. Now her life is rich and full as she continues to seek more learning about art in order to be filled enough to constantly teach others.<br><br>Continuing education is one of the gospel concepts for an enriched life. We can learn in so many ways. For example, one of my daughters was visiting with Sarah Boyer recently and observed that Sarah&#39;s little girl had a new and attractive braid in her hair. My daughter remarked how lovely the little girl&#39;s hair looked, and Sarah said that she would teach her how to do it. Sarah commented: "When I realize how many years of combing and setting hair I would have with five little girls, I thought I might as well learn all I could about caring for their hair, including a lot of different and charming hairstyles." Isn&#39;t that delightful? I wonder why I didn&#39;t think of that. I had four daughters.<br><br>Another family from this area keeps their learning alive by acquiring things like telescopes, looms, greenhouses, and potter&#39;s wheels, and they accompany each new piece of equipment with an intensive study so that they can master a new skill. Imagine how many happy, productive hours they spend together.<br><br>Classes are available; books are available; constant, never-ending media stimulation is available. All these things can work to our good if we desire to continue learning. Once I made the statement to President Kimball, after I returned home from Mexico, that I wish I could speak Spanish. His quick reply was, "Well, you can learn, can&#39;t you?"<br><br>At first I thought, "Oh, no, not at my age, I can&#39;t," and then I realized that of course I could learn.<br><br>I haven&#39;t learned it yet, but I know that I can. We all can come from the unknown to the known. We can develop skills, but we must remember that one of the significant tools for learning is our ability to control our own attitudes. Fortunately we have the power within us to control and establish our own attitudes. All the knowledge in the world will not help us if we resist learning. But there is no end to our capacity to learn if we apply ourselves diligently and eagerly to the task.<br><br>A slight change of attitude to a new point of view can open up a whole new world to you. I can remember descending into the Los Angeles airport one day. I was seated next to a landscape architect. I was thinking about the myriad of houses and buildings below us, and he looked across me and said, "Can you imagine how many sprinkler heads there are down there?" The landscape problems of a big city had never entered my mind before that, but occasionally I think about them now.<br><br>Perhaps the most important point I would like to discuss with you regarding your intellectual powers is the fact that you have the power to grow from your day-to-day experiences. At one time or another, you will all have the occasion to choose between a life of bitterness or a life of beauty. You have the power within you to make such a choice, and the Lord has promised that you can count on him for sufficient help to have an abundant life if you choose to live by the principles which lead to your personal growth and development.<br><br>Brother Marriott turned the circumstances which kept him from school into great personal discipline and a learning experience. President Larsen changed his life in a wheelchair to a life with sufficient optimism that he could stand tall in spirit and intellect even though his legs would no longer hold him. Sister Knudson accepted her situation and receives abundant satisfaction as she is sought out for her deep insights that bring happiness to herself and to others.<br><br>This great adaptive quality is part of the power within us that can shape our lives into contributions and excellence if we so choose. When we use our mental powers wisely, we can more easily become what we are really meant to be.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Powers</b></h2><br>There is a third great power within you, the power for enormous spiritual growth--the infinite possibility for perfecting yourself. One way you can develop your spiritual power is by sharing the gospel because the gospel has the principles upon which all growth is predicated. Once we understand those concepts, we need opportunities both to teach them and to live them.<br><br>Another way to develop your spiritual power is to render acts of loving kindness and compassionate service. They are only of real value to you when they are given out of personal choice, not pressure. Albert Schweitzer wisely said, "The only ones who will ever be truly happy are those who have<i>sought</i>to serve."<br><br>For example, my former bishop and his wife entered the Missionary Training Center this week to prepare for their mission to Nigeria. Their daughter also entered the MTC this week to prepare for her mission to Peru. This family is well aware of the conveniences and luxuries they will give up, but they are eager to serve the Lord by loving and serving his children. The Lord wants us to be mindful of each other and to be dependent upon each other, and so to one he has given a particular spiritual gift and to another a different gift so that we might bless each other.<br><br>Recently a visiting teacher helped prepare a blind sister to go for the first time to the Seattle Temple soon after its dedication. She did not assume the responsibility of the bishop but tried to explain each part of entering the temple for one&#39;s endowment in such detail that the sightless woman could feel calm, peaceful, and spiritually in tune. Again, I mention Relief Society because it serves two fundamental purposes. It gives us a chance to be schooled in the art of sharing our talents and in giving loving service.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, we read:<br><br><i>I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them will I give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on my name.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 11:30]<br><br>You may think, "That can&#39;t be true! How can there be that great potential in you or me when all I see is a struggling, imperfect human being?" And I can only say, as did Lorenzo Snow, "Godliness cannot be conferred but must be acquired" (Truman Madsen,<i>The Highest in Us</i>[Bookcraft: 1978], p. 9)<br><br>You must want that blessing so much that you have faith in his word, resist worldly enticements, seek him in prayer, listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, and proclaim his gospel within the reach of your influence, and in the process you will help develop the spiritual powers within you.<br><br>The power<i>is</i>in you. From the Doctrine and Covenants again, we read:<br><br><i>Unto as many as received me gave I power to do many miracles, . . . power to obtain eternal life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:8]<br><br>Nurture your spiritual powers. It is the only way you can become what you are really meant to be.<br><h2><b>Begin Where You Live</b></h2><br>Where do you begin to develop your physical, mental, and spiritual powers? Begin in your home. Whether you are single or married, whether your home is an apartment, a house, or a dormitory, begin in your home. Your home is the place where you go each night, but it is more than that. Your home is the place where you grow in physical stature, in mental abilities, and in spiritual strengths. The scriptures clearly teach the importance of the home and the training that takes place there. Let&#39;s consider for a moment Doctrine and Covenants, section 88, verse 119:<br><br><i>Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.</i><br><br>I like to apply those words to establishing a house where gods-to-be can be taught and trained, where they can develop the habits and attitudes that will prepare them to live in a celestial home in the hereafter because they have learned how to pray and develop a sweet dependence upon the Lord, to fast and draw near unto him, to learn of him and his ways so that his purposes can be the direction of their lives. I feel that the phrase "prepare every needful thing" is very important. What is a needful thing? How would you describe every needful thing? Is it a needful thing to have a regular place designated to study in your home--a specific desk, a table, a favorite chair? Is a budget a needful thing? Is it a needful thing for you to learn how to pay your tuition and your rent and still have enough money for books, transportation, and entertainment? Is it a needful thing to have good food if you would increase your physical abilities and strengths? Is it a needful thing to have food prepared that is pleasing to look at--or just satisfying to the appetite?<br><br>Sometimes in our hurry to get everything done, fast foods have become the order of the day. We think of dinner at McDonald&#39;s--at least I&#39;m told that they feed more people in America than any other food service except the army. I think dinner at McDonald&#39;s should be the exception rather than the rule unless, of course, your name happens to be McDonald. I hope that you will use the many resources available to you to help you supply your kitchen with good things to eat--nutritious snacks, super soups, and money-saving meals. Use the ideas that have proven successful to enrich your living.<br><h2><b>Three Homes</b></h2><br>Come with me vicariously into three homes. Let&#39;s look in unobserved to see how these homes are organized to foster the powers within those who reside there. We&#39;ll go first into the home of a young mother who is a concert pianist. She is preparing right now to play with the philharmonic orchestra of her state. She has a baby-sitter caring for her three little sons while she spends these last few days in uninterrupted practice. Ordinarily she would limit her practice time at the piano to the hours when the children are in bed, but she is well aware that a flawless performance demands hours and hours of highly concentrated preparation.<br><br>She loves music. She wants her children to love it too. Each mealtime is accompanied by classical recordings, opera, symphony, world-renowned vocalists, or choirs. She is following the pattern set by her own mother. As soon as the children are old enough, they will accompany their parents to special musical events in order to firmly establish great music as an important part of their lives. Perhaps we should take our leave now, but it is to be hoped that her example will give you a thought about how you might cultivate learning by planning a time, a place, and a way to make the learning you desire possible.<br><br>We&#39;ll enter quietly into the next house because the fourth-grader who lives there is sobbing out the aching of the hurt he experienced today in school: "My teacher told me that I am the worst penman in the whole class!" If there is dismay at the teacher and her lack of consideration for that young son, the mother doesn&#39;t show it--only compassion and understanding. She carefully weighs her words, and then she says, "I&#39;m sorry. I know it hurts to have someone point out your errors and your weaknesses, but I have a thought. Why don&#39;t you practice your penmanship each day until you are the very best in the class?"<br><br>Her son&#39;s tear-filled eyes begin to shine with a ray of hope. He asks, "But, how can I do it, Mother? When would I write? What will I write?"<br><br>"Every night after school you can work at the kitchen table until dinner time. Why don&#39;t you begin copying your favorite scriptures? Or you might write words from the dictionary or even newsworthy events from the newspaper. You will learn a lot, and if you write very carefully and try to form each letter perfectly, you will soon be a beautiful penman. It can only happen with practice. You&#39;ll have to try really hard."<br><br>That determined little boy begins. He works hard every night. By the end of the year he comes home elated. "You were right, Mother! My teacher said today, &#39;Theron, you are the very best penman in the class!&#39;"<br><br>He invested the time. The place was established. He was given the encouragement. All of them are important elements of organization--needful things--if learning is to take place.<br><br>It&#39;s Christmas Eve as we join this next family. They are at home in a strange city. It&#39;s new to them. The father has to complete his professional training, and so the whole family had to be uprooted. At Christmastime, it is very difficult for them to be away from their extended families. They have just finished dinner as we enter the house, and so we&#39;ll follow them into the family room.<br><br>The father says: "Children, Christmas is a time of great love. Our Heavenly Father loved us, his children, enough to send his Only Begotten Son into the world on that Christmas Day so long ago. He was to be the example of righteous living. He was to teach us how to grow close to our Heavenly Father. We must live worthy of that precious gift. This Christmas Eve I would like to give you a gift that is available to you only because Jesus was born. Because of him I hold the priesthood of God. With that power I would like to give each of you children a father&#39;s blessing tonight. We will start with the oldest."<br><br>One by one the children go to their father. They receive blessings suited to their special needs. Then we see each child, even the three-year-old, stand and tell how he or she has been blessed by the life of Jesus. The parents then testify to their children of the abundant blessings they have received from Jesus Christ.<br><br>I believe that those children will always remember this Christmas Eve. I believe that the example set by the parents of faith and prayer will be a directional force in the lives of their children. It is a needful thing to organize and to plan such experiences to be a part of one&#39;s life. They don&#39;t just happen.<br><h2><b>Power in the Home</b></h2><br>Someone once said, "All human power is a compound of time and patience," and Benjamin Disraeli said, "All power is a trust" (<i>Vivian Grey</i>, book VI, chapter 7).<br><br>You should realize that time and patience are necessary for organizing your life and calling forth your powers. It may begin with something as simple as bringing order to your desk, to your drawers, or to the room where you are. You can leave each room better than it was when you entered it simply by picking up and by straightening it. Some people leave a trail of books, papers, clothes, boots, purses, and so forth, from the front door to the bedroom if that is their destination. They expect someone else to pick up after them, or they decide that they will retrace their steps at another time and begin picking up their belongings. Neither of these actions is worthy of the kind of living of which I speak. It&#39;s good to believe in a future time, but it&#39;s better to surround yourself with beauties and memories born of order.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., suggested that our homes are holy places and that we should approach them as if coming to an altar. Ask yourself what you have done to make your home an altar--a place that sanctifies or prepares those who are there for celestial living. Do your actions focus on developing loving relationships? Are there kindly acts of concern each day? Does your routine bring about maintenance of that home and practices of provident living? Do your pursuits bring about learning and refinement? Are the relationships within that home those that can be forever?<br><br>What is a home? To one of my friends it is a place where children are cherished and memories are born. Home is where she and her husband put priceless antiques they seek out. Home is where friends and family gather to share love. Home is a framed newspaper account of her grandmother&#39;s funeral service or an oil painting of a scene she knows an loves. Home is an attic turned into an upstairs playroom that is just filled with things meant to bring happiness to children. Home is a collection of books that have lofty thoughts they make theirs. Home is a kitchen where good food is prepared and gratefully enjoyed. Her home is a place where you feel love and faith and dreams that have become a reality.<br><br>When President Ronald Reagan delivered his Inaugural Address, it was essentially based on faith in the American people. He said, "Act worthy of yourselves," and he told us that we are "too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams."<br><h2><b>Power to Be Christlike</b></h2><br>So it is for us as Latter-day Saints. We too must act worthy of ourselves and the glorious vision of truth and eternity which has been restored to us. That vision of eternal growth and gentle, loving persuasion is too great a dream to let go of when we hunger in our hearts to be one with our Savior.<br><br>The power is in you to reach out and claim those blessings.<br><br>Tonight, remember that beyond anything you have ever accomplished is the challenge of living the principles of heaven in such a way that you connect the powers in you with the powers of heaven. Melvin J. Ballard said:<br><br><i>Men came to the Savior to see what God was like; we stand to show men what Christ was like"</i>(Melvin J. Ballard,<i>Crusader for Righteousness</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966], p. 112).<br><br>You have the powers within you to be Christlike. It is what you are meant to be, I humbly testify, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Barbara B. Smith was president of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 1 February 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
<br>
I&#39;m happy to be able to greet you here this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is a devotional at the Lord&#39;s university. I am persuaded that this is his university. I am sure he has many of his children scattered about the world in different universities, but this is his.<br><br>How glorious it is to be here this morning, to listen to Sister Harris and her lovely sisters and their beautiful music, to be in the presence of these special witnesses of the Lord (and there must be two thousand of them over here), and to be in your presence.<br><h2><b>Families in Earth and Heaven</b></h2><br>We all have something in common--each of us. We are part of a family. We have a mother and a father, each one of us does. I know that&#39;s true because we can&#39;t get here any other way. And families are very important to the Lord. The greatest blessings that the Lord has designed for his children will be received in a family relationship. It is part of the plan of salvation that we would come to this earth, we would have earthly parents, and each of us would have a body of flesh and bones. They would provide it for us, obviously with the help of our Heavenly Father, who, I believe, has a hand in when we come and the fact that we do come. I believe that because prophets have made it very plain.<br><br>The great prophet by the name of King Benjamin, with whom you are all familiar, says,<br><br><i>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</i>[Sounds as if he had a hand in your coming, doesn&#39;t it?]<br><br><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--.</i>[Mosiah 2:23, 21]<br><br>The Lord supports us.<br><br>Paul added to that when he said, as recorded in Acts, to those on Mars Hill who were worshiping the unknown God:<br><br><i>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</i><br><br><i>Neither is worshipped with men&#39;s hands as though he needed any thing--</i><br><br>[There is very little we can give to the Lord except a broken heart and a contrite spirit. He would love to have that.]<br><br><i>--seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</i><br><br><i>And hath made of one blood all the nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.</i>[Acts 17:24‚Äì26]<br><br>We have a Heavenly Father, each of us, who is very concerned about us. We are begotten sons and daughters unto him, and so we have earthly parents and we have heavenly parents. Our Heavenly Father is concerned about us.<br><br>It is great to know that, isn&#39;t it? He is concerned, and he does much for us. As a matter of fact, President Brigham Young said one time that, when you walk back into the presence of your Heavenly Father, you will find that he has done everything godly possibly for your exaltation. He leaves no stone unturned. So, as the family of God, we have to promote his purposes and to bear witness of this basic, fundamental truth wherever we go.<br><h2><b>Families under Attack</b></h2><br>Families are under very serious attack throughout the world at this time--make no mistake about that. I had an opportunity to visit with five students from the People&#39;s Democratic Republic of China recently.<br><br>We like to host people from other countries who are in Utah going to school or extending their education, and we do so up at the Church Office Building periodically. We like to do that because we want them to understand that we appreciate the hospitality that is extended to our missionaries throughout the world. For the most part, they extend warm hospitality to us. Of course, there are places we would like to go where we have not been permitted to go as yet. So we invite them up, and we host them and have an opportunity to tell them something about why Salt Lake is here (we may have a slightly ulterior motive) and the restoration of the gospel. After they have been fed and have been spoken to, we have a chance to visit with them. On this occasion I was invited to attend. There were people there from, as I recall, sixteen different nations. I visited at some length with these five from the People&#39;s Democratic Republic of China, and they volunteered information to me that in China today only one child per family is permitted. Family size is limited by birth control, sterilization, and abortion. If a second child is born, the government takes it to rear. In my opinion this practice will destroy China as a nation. The Chinese people have traditionally almost worshiped their ancestors. Chinese children are very obedient to parents, for the most part. It makes a major difference in what happens in a family when children obey parents. Probably the Chinese as an ethnic group have the lowest juvenile delinquency rate of any group in the United States, and it&#39;s primarily because of how they feel about their parents. But something serious is going to happen if you can&#39;t bring forth the Lord&#39;s children.<br><br>I saw on TV a documentary recently on Sweden, where they have been in this social experiment for some years: a socialistic form of government where the government assumes the responsibility for taking care of people from cradle to grave. There are some who think that is the way to do it. But they are having a difficult time in Sweden today because no one seems to care about old people. No one will visit old people. You see, the children no longer have the responsibility to take care of their parents, and because they don&#39;t, they pay no attention to them. And old people who don&#39;t feel expressions of love die, just as babies die if they don&#39;t get loved. I&#39;m persuaded that without expressions of love not only the old and the young die, but also those that are in between die too.<br><br>We are to live together in love, and if we love each other, we seem to get along very, very well. Without love it is impossible to please God, for God loves us. Jesus loved us so much that he gave his life for us. The scripture makes it plain that "God so loved the world, that he gave his Only Begotten Son" (John 3:16), and Jesus said, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). Love is vitally important in the gospel of Jesus Christ, in the economy of God. So they have a government program in Sweden today where they hire full-time governmental personnel just to visit old people.<br><br>Of course, we are not doing much better in our own country. We had a White House Conference on families last year, which was the Year of the Family (I guess you knew that). When they chose delegates here in Utah--and I am assuming they did it in most other states of the Union, for they chose delegates in every state--they attempted to pass a resolution here defining a family as "any group of people living together." Not the traditional mother, father, children with the father presiding over the family, with the mother supporting the father, bearing the children and caring for them through childhood, but any group of people living together.<br><br>Who do you suppose would have been in favor of that kind of a definition? You know. The same ones that are making noises about the Equal Rights Amendment. It&#39;s the homosexuals, the lesbians, those who say they are in favor of the "alternative lifestyle." Alternate. Well, obviously, it isn&#39;t the Lord&#39;s program. President Kimball made a plain statement on this when he said, "Every form of homosexuality is sin" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1974, p. 8). And so we know what that is. In San Francisco today, 15 percent of the population are gay. Now isn&#39;t that a sad commentary?<br><h2><b>To Avoid Being Wasted</b></h2><br>The Lord indicates that we should seek diligently to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers. In fact, he says if that doesn&#39;t happen, the whole earth will be smitten with a curse. That is the record of Malachi (see Malachi 4:6). In the second section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we have the statement from the angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he made it a little bit more clear when he said:<br><br><i>Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i><br><br><i>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 2:1‚Äì3]<br><br>I have thought much on that, wondering how the earth will be wasted if the children&#39;s hearts are not turned to the fathers. There may be a lot of ways the earth could be wasted. But as I think about is some more, some facts are obvious. What was the earth created for, anyway? It is recorded in the book of Abraham, third chapter, and twenty-fourth verse, that the Master said:<br><br><i>We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these</i>[meaning all of us]<i>may dwell;</i><br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God will command them.</i><br><br>The earth was created so that we would have a place to come and be born, with a body of flesh and bones, with earthly parents who love us. The first purpose of marriage, of course, is to bring children into the world, according to President Harold B. Lee, and the children ought to be welcome. There should be love surrounding them.<br><br>I find that it is vitally important that we live together in love. Children deserve to have parents who love each other with all their hearts. There should be a show of affection between parents, no doubt about that. I&#39;ve never been able to embrace my wife with my children around without their trying to get into the act. We feel little arms wrapped around our legs, or they try to push between us. Children love to see their parents love each other. There is a great sense of security that comes to children who have parents who do love each other and show it, so it&#39;s vitally important that we live together in love. That is what the earth was created for.<br><br>What do you suppose will happen if, when the Lord comes, he doesn&#39;t find anything but homosexuality and lesbianism and birth control and abortion and sterilization, all of which are rampant upon the earth, as you well know. In other words what will he feel if he finds that we will no longer allow his Father to send his children to this earth? Do you suppose the earth would be wasted as far as he is concerned?<br><br>We think the term<i>wasted</i>is a modern term. The kids think they made up<i>wasted</i>just as they think they made up<i>gross</i>, but the Lord said, "This people&#39;s heart is waxed gross" (Matthew 13:15) two thousand years ago when he lived on earth. The Lord is way out ahead of us in all these terms.<br><br>He says that the earth could be wasted. The only other time he used similar language was back at the time of the flood. He said that the whole earth was corrupted in his sight, that it was wasted. You know what happened then? He destroyed it. I presume he would do the same thing today. And so you and I, who are children of God, and who have been sent to this earth to carry out the plan of salvation, know that we should marry, for it is ordained of God. Marriage is ordained of God. It is right for people to marry, raise families, and teach them to love the Lord and keep his commandments and walk uprightly before him. If we do so, we will be happy. If we don&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure we ever will be.<br><br>You almost have to have grandchildren to really be happy here upon this earth; I have found that out. I have seventeen. I have often wondered what it is about grandchildren that makes them so wonderful. I&#39;ve thought a lot about it, and I think I&#39;ve figured it out. You can spoil them, and you don&#39;t have to live with them. I said that some time ago in a meeting, and a sister came up afterwards and said, "Elder Rector, you are right; grandchildren are wonderful. I have two of them in my home this afternoon, and I said to them, &#39;If you&#39;re not good, you have to go home.&#39; I couldn&#39;t say that to my own children."<br><br>I&#39;m convinced, too, that great-grandchildren are important to us if we&#39;re going to be happy ultimately. We are here upon the earth to raise a family to the Lord. If we don&#39;t do it, the earth<i>will</i>be wasted.<br><h2><b>Children&#39;s Hearts to Their Fathers</b></h2><br>We may wonder how you turn the children&#39;s hearts to the fathers. We have plain directions on how to do it through the admonition of a prophet. You will never turn your own children&#39;s hearts more to you than you will if you write a personal history of your life. They will find out a lot of things about you, and they&#39;ll find out why they&#39;re kind of strange, probably because we&#39;re all strange, you know. "Everyone except me and thee--and even thee is a little peculiar." Isn&#39;t that how it goes?<br><br>I&#39;m convinced that personal histories are vitally important if you are really going to raise up children to love the family relationship--where children have a good time, where you live together in love, where the father presides as he is supposed to do, and where the mother supports the father and nurtures the children. It&#39;s a happy relationship, and children will want it for themselves and their children. They will not want to be homosexuals. I am convinced that homosexuality is an addiction just as surely as pornography and drink and drugs are addictions. There are those who will try to tell you that it&#39;s an accident of birth, that there is a female spirit trapped in a male body, or vice versa. I do not believe that that is true. He that made them male and female, and the prophet says that every form of homosexuality is sin. If children want families, they will have families, and that is vitally important. Writing this personal history will tell them a lot about who they are.<br><br>I know, for instance, that I stand before you here today primarily because I have a wonderfully fine father. He is as honest and honorable as any man I have ever met. He&#39;d walk ten miles to pay you ten cents he owes you. If he says he&#39;ll do it, he&#39;ll do it. You don&#39;t have to write it down. His word has been his bond all his life. He loves to talk about religion. He is open minded; he will talk to anybody about religion. He never joined a church--hasn&#39;t yet, anyway. I&#39;m still working on him. I found out some time ago why he hasn&#39;t joined a church: he never met a Protestant minister he thought was better than he was. He may have lacked a little bit in humility, but I never met a Protestant minister I thought was better than my dad either. He is an open-minded man, willing to talk about religion or anything else. I grew up that way.<br><br>Also I had a wonderfully fine grandmother. Her name was Lucy Ellen Mason Garvin. We call her Mama Lucy. Mama Lucy believed in the Bible with all her heart. She knew it was true. She lived in a small town of Rennick, Missouri, population 167. I&#39;ve always suspected that number included the horses and the cows. But in that small town of 167 back there in central Missouri there were four churches. That was a religious place, and every summer when I had the opportunity to spend a week with her just before school started, there was always a religious revival going on in one of those churches. We went every night. I loved to hear those old revival preachers; they called them evangelists. Of course, they don&#39;t know what an evangelist is. That meant a traveling preacher to them. They could preach hellfire and damnation with the best of them. In fact, they would preach so convincingly that you would look under your chair sometimes to see if there weren&#39;t a fire under there. Then they would invite all to "come to Christ" to be saved, to confess Christ. I wanted to do that. I thought that would be important to me or would make a difference to me if I did it. My grandmother would never let me do it because my father had never joined a church, and she thought maybe he wouldn&#39;t want me to do that. She didn&#39;t want to get in Dutch with him, and so I never was able to go confess Christ. I never did. Some of my friends did, but it didn&#39;t seem to make a whole lot of difference to them. They still put potatoes in the exhaust pipes of cars. I don&#39;t know whether you ever did that or not. And we&#39;d make mud pies and put them on the headlights. Someone would come out and turn on the headlights--nothing. Of course, there wasn&#39;t very much light even if there wasn&#39;t a mud pie on the headlight because the headlights on the cars back in that day and time were so people could see you; you couldn&#39;t see a thing with them. And you had to be a mechanic to make a car run, back in those days. (One farmer said to his friend, "How much do you get out of your car?" And his friend said, "About four times a mile.")<br><br>Every night after the revival meeting, I wound up by sitting on Mama Lucy&#39;s lap, and she read to me out of a great big old picture Bible. There were some of the wildest pictures in there that you have ever seen. Hell was a horrible place. There were fire and brimstone. People there were naked, and these characters with pitchforks were sticking them, and they had horns on their heads and forked tails. I knew I didn&#39;t want to get in that place. I knew that. That was impressed upon me. And heaven was always a beautiful place. There were angels there. They were always female, and my grandmother was sure that no man would ever be worthy of this exalted station. When the elders told me about Moroni&#39;s visit, and they said he was a man, I said, "Are you sure?"<br><h2><b>Writing It Down</b></h2><br>When the elders knocked on my door, they found someone who was open minded, was willing to talk about religion, read all kinds of books on religion because I was looking for the truth and believed the Bible with all my heart (my grandmother had seen to that). I was a pushover for the missionaries, and I&#39;m sure it was, to a great extent, the way I was raised. I had to write all that down. It is vitally important that you write it down because if you don&#39;t write it down, you cannot be sure that it happened.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith seems to indicate that, in section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where he tells us how important it is that we write things down. In this section, he emphasizes not only that we write it down, but that we put down witnesses, names. He says, beginning with verse 5:<br><br><i>You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world, for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.</i><br><br><i>And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared as you will find recorded in Revelation 20:12--</i><br><br>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<br><br><i>You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened: and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books</i>[with an s],<i>according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. . . .</i><br><br>Sometimes we get the idea, "Well, it won&#39;t make any difference whether it&#39;s recorded here because it&#39;s recorded in heaven." Don&#39;t be too sure. The Prophet continues:<br><br><i>Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:8]<br><br>Does that sound as if maybe you&#39;d better write it? I think so. If you really want to get credit for it, you&#39;d better write it down.<br><br>I am convinced that it is not what we do here upon this earth that will condemn us at the last day, anyway. No, because if we do something wrong, we can repent of it, can&#39;t we? You see, the Lord Jesus Christ granted repentance to us all. That is not going to hurt us, for those sins will be blotted out. If we did something good, and we record that, we will get credit for it. So you see, it&#39;s not what we do, it&#39;s what we don&#39;t do that we&#39;re going to have a rough time repenting of at the last day. So we ought to write it. Let&#39;s write it down. It is vitally important that we do. And then the record is in heaven.<br><br>Now you say, "Well, they keep a record in the temple anyway."<br><br>The International Genealogical Index is a record, no doubt about that. It is an index to the temple record which is a record of ordinances performed, but do you know what&#39;s on that record? Well, if we have your birthdate, that will be there. If you&#39;re baptized, that will be there. If you&#39;re confirmed, that will be there. If you&#39;ve been endowed in the temple, that will be there. If you&#39;ve been sealed, that will be there too, along with the witnesses&#39; names and the name of the sealer, but that&#39;s all that&#39;s there. Is that how you want to be judged?<br><br>Matthew records the Lords&#39; words:<br><br><i>When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</i><br><br><i>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them from another, as a shepherd that divideth his sheep from the goats:</i><br><br><i>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br>Are you sure it was me? Have you ever been given credit for something you didn&#39;t do, I mean something good? Isn&#39;t that a horrible feeling? I can imagine that a righteous person wouldn&#39;t want to be given credit for something he didn&#39;t do. He might say, "Lord, people do look a lot alike, you know. Are you sure you don&#39;t have me mixed up with someone else?"<br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:31‚Äì40]<br><br>I&#39;m convinced that you&#39;d better write it down. Yes, you&#39;ll find out a lot about yourself as you write your personal history. You think, "Well, I don&#39;t have time to do it. Besides, my history is not anything too exciting anyway. Nobody would ever be excited about it. I don&#39;t have anything to write." Just in case you feel that way, I&#39;d like to read you a couple of excerpts. These are very simple records. The first one is entitled "Dear Abby" (you&#39;ve heard of her).<br><br><i>A great man died today. He wasn&#39;t a world leader or a famous doctor or a war hero or a sports figure or a business tycoon. But he was a great man. He was my father.</i><br><br><i>He didn&#39;t get his picture in the paper for heading up committees; I guess you might say he was a person who never cared for credit or honor. He did corny things--like pay his bills on time, go to church on Sunday, and hold an office in the PTA.</i><br><br><i>He helped his kids with their homework and drove his wife to the shopping center to do the grocery buying on Thursday night. He enjoyed hauling his kids and their friends to and from football games. He enjoyed simple things--a picnic in the park, country music, mowing the grass, and running with the dog.</i><br><br><i>Tonight is the first night of my life without him. I don&#39;t know what to do with myself so I am writing to you. I am sorry for the times I didn&#39;t show him the proper respect. But I&#39;m thankful for many things.</i><br><br><i>I&#39;m thankful because God let me have him for 15 years. And I&#39;m thankful that I was able to let him know how much I loved him. He died with a smile on his face; he knew he was a success as a husband, a father, a son, a brother, and a friend. I wonder how many millionaires can say that. Thank you for listening. You&#39;ve been a great help! Signed, His Daughter.</i><br><br>Now that&#39;s not earth shaking. I know that, but it&#39;s great literature, isn&#39;t it? You know why? Because it comes from the heart, and anything that comes from the heart is great literature. I want to read you one more if I might. This is by Ed Bartley who is an English professor back east. He has written several articles in syndicated magazines.<br><br>He was working frantically trying to prepare a test on Melville for his English students the next day when his 22-month-old child, Meghan, came up with a pile of storybooks and a pleading look.<br><br>The Poky Little Puppy, The Magic Bus, The Cat in the Hat,<i>even that ancient copy of</i>National Geographic<i>with the penguin on the cover . . . she had them all.</i><br><br><i>With her free hand, she tugs at my sleeve.</i><br><br><i>"No Meghan," I snap irritably, "not now. Go away and leave me alone. And take your library with you."</i><br><br><i>That does it; she leaves. She makes no further attempt to bother me. I can finish the test easily now without interference. No one trying to climb onto my lap, no extra fingers helping me type.</i><br><br>[Have you ever been typing along and a mystery key flied right in the middle of what you&#39;re doing? You look down and there&#39;s a very small finger on a typewriter key.]<br><br><i>I see her standing quietly with her back against the sofa, tears running down her cheeks. She has two fingers of her right hand in her mouth. She holds the tragic [doll] Dumpty in her left. She watches me type and slowly brushes the tip of Dumpty&#39;s anemic arm across her nose to comfort her.</i><br><br><i>At this moment, only for a moment, I see things as God must--in perspective, with all the pieces fitting. I see a little girl cry because I haven&#39;t time for her. Imagine ever being that important to another human being! I see the day when it won&#39;t mean so much to a tiny soul to have me sit next to her and read a story, one that means little to either of us, realizing somehow that it is the sitting next to each other that means everything.</i>[Have you ever had anybody badger you for half an hour to read a book, and, when you start to read, you make mistakes and they can correct you? They know it by heart, but they have got to have a book read.]<br><br><i>And I see the day when the frail, loyal, and lovable doll Dumpty will vanish from the life of a little girl who has outgrown him.</i><br><br><i>I resent Dumpty for an instant. He is consoling</i>my girl<i>, and that is my concern, not his. She and I have few enough days like this to share. So the paper slips gently into the top drawer, the hood slides over the typewriter. The test will get done somehow. Tests always get done.</i><br><br><i>"Meghan, I feel like taking a walk down to the park. I was wondering if you . . . would care to join me. I thought maybe you&#39;d like to go on the swings for a while. Bring Dumpty--and your red sweater too. It might be windy down there."</i><br><br><i>At the word "park" the fingers leave the mouth. She laughs excitedly and begins a frantic search for her shoes and socks.</i>[Have you ever had anybody badger you for half an hour to go with you, and then, you say yes, you have to spend fifteen minutes looking for shoes? When that happens, you know everything is right on schedule. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.]<br><br><i>Melville will have to wait, but he won&#39;t mind. He waited most of his life for someone to discover the miracle of</i>Moby Dick<i>--and died 30 years before anyone did. No, he won&#39;t mind.</i><br><br><i>Besides, he&#39;d understand why I must go right now, while [birds] still spark wonder and before dandelions become weeds, and while a little girl thinks that a leaf from her father is a gift beyond measure.</i>["Now, While There&#39;s Time,"<i>Reader&#39;s Digest,</i>December 1969, p. 103‚Äì4]<br><br>I&#39;m convinced that you could all write something like that. It&#39;s vitally important that you do so.<br><h2><b>Record Keeping</b></h2><br>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll never turn your own hearts more to your own fathers than by writing a family history, because you have to find out about them before you can write about them. There may be someone who is noble and great, and I&#39;m sure that your whole line is, because you see, you&#39;re here--and not by happenstance. You&#39;re not an accident of birth; someone has paid the price to get you here. These are noble people. Maybe they&#39;ve never had an opportunity to write it themselves, but you can write it. And if you write it, they&#39;ll be judged by what you write. President Kimball said, before the World Conference on Records:<br><br><i>There are 78 large volumes that I have written of my life. Sometimes I come home at night, and I am so tired I feel I can&#39;t do it. But then I rest a while and then I do it.</i><br><br>If the prophet can do that, you can too. He also said, "If you write your personal history, the angels may quote from it one day."<br><br>I believe that because there are angels up there waiting for you, praying for you. Sometimes they rejoice over you, and sometimes they don&#39;t. But if you write it, you&#39;ll get the credit for it. Do you suppose you could become a savior on Mount Zion by doing something like that? The Prophet Joseph Smith said, "The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 356). He also said, "Those Saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the peril of their own salvation" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 193).<br><br>Personal history. Family history. You write it. Then you ought to do your four generations--yes, four generations, a pedigree chart and the family group sheets to go with it--and submit them to the ancestral file. We&#39;re going to computerize that file one day. It will be available for all. There will be those who join the Church and can put their name in that computer, and we&#39;ll find out everything that has been done on their line so that they don&#39;t have to duplicate the work.<br><br>There are many people for whom we need to do this work. The smart people say that about 68 billion people have lived upon this earth. Can you imagine that? I can&#39;t even understand how much a billion is. They tell me a stack of brand new one-thousand-dollar bills 4 1/2 inches high is a million dollars. If you want to make that into a billion dollars, the stack would be 333 1/3 feet high--longer than a football field plus a third. That&#39;s the difference between a million and a billion.<br><br>Sixty-eight billion people? If you were standing on a football field and let the 68 years from the goal line represent that 68 billion people, that&#39;s about how far McMahon threw that last touchdown pass, right? (Wasn&#39;t that exciting? I loved it. I have to watch it over now and again just to make sure he did it.) You&#39;re looking at the goal line. If those 68 years represent 68 billion people, everything we have done so far since the restoration of the gospel would have moved that football about an inch and a quarter toward the goal line.<br><br>You see what we have to do? We have got a lot to do. We don&#39;t need to duplicate things, so we&#39;re going to fix it up so we won&#39;t have to, but you are going to have to prepare you four-generation sheets and then go as far beyond as you can. Get them out there because there are people who are waiting for you to do it. They will rejoice over you if you do; and if you don&#39;t, you neglect it at the peril of your own salvation; that&#39;s how the Prophet Joseph said it. I believe that that is true.<br><br>Then you ought to go to the temple and do as many endowments as you can as often as you can--as many as is practical for you to do. That&#39;s part of your responsibility.<br><br>Nephi wrote a personal history; we have it here. Angels have been quoting it for centuries. Who says that they won&#39;t quote yours too? But you have to write it. That&#39;s vitally important--that you do it. The way you do that is to get started. I like to carry pages with me all the time out of a looseleaf journal, and when I have a few minutes, I can write down something. Then when I finish that, I just stick it back in my journal and take out a few more blank pages, and I&#39;m always ready to do it. You can use this system too--or one of your own. It is important because it has to do with the eternal salvation of your family, which is the most important unit in time or all eternity.<br><br>I&#39;ll close with verses 22‚Äì24 from section 128 of the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Prophet Joseph Smith says,<br><br><i>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren, and on, on to the victory. Let our hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoner shall go free.</i><br><br><i>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, powers!</i><br><br><i>Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? . . .</i><br><br>Do you know who can stand? He tells us right here:<br><br><i>Let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.</i><br><br>Those can stand, and I doubt seriously if anyone else can. Therefore, it is for us to do. And you have to get about it. The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, and you can start today. Will you do it? I pray that you will, and there are those on the other side praying that you will. When you get started, you will have help from them. I know you will.<br><h2><b>Something Nice</b></h2><br>As I traveled about the Church promoting the World Conference on Records, Elder Packer said one day to me, "Hartman, because of what you&#39;re doing, the Lord will do something nice for you." It&#39;s always exciting when the Lord starts doing nice things for you. (He meant in genealogy.)<br><br>It was shortly thereafter that I got a letter from a new convert. His parents were not members of the Church, but they were living in Friday Harbor, Washington, and they had some friends up there by the name of Rector, Ed and Eleanor Rector, to be factual. This young man said he had been in Eleanor Rector&#39;s home, and there were at least 5,000 Rector family group sheets that she had filled out, and he wondered if I&#39;d be interested in them. He said, "She&#39;s very ill. She has terminal cancer and she may not live."<br><br>I asked, "Do you suppose she would live until November?" I was going up for the dedication of the Seattle Temple.<br><br>He said, "Oh, I think so."<br><br>We went to the temple dedication, and then we went on up to Friday Harbor. We had to ride the ferry for two hours to get there, after we got up to Anacortes. There she gave me five volumes of family group sheets. There must be more than 30,000 Rectors in there. They are all my line. You see, the Lord will do something nice for you if you&#39;ll start doing something for those who can&#39;t do it for themselves--of which I bear witness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 February 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Pillars of Eternity: Creation, Fall, Atonement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I know, as do we all, that the things of God can be understood only by the power of the Holy Spirit. And I pray that we may receive a mighty outpouring of that Spirit as we consider the three pillars of eternity--the three great eternal verities upon which salvation rests.<br><br>My purpose is to take the three greatest events that have ever occurred in all eternity and show how they are interwoven to form one grand plan of salvation.<br><br>If we can gain an understanding of them, then the whole eternal scheme of things will fall into place, and we will be in a position to work out our salvation. If we do not build our house of salvation on a true foundation, we will never make the spiritual progress that will prepare us to enter the Eternal Presence.<br><h2><b>Three Great Events</b></h2><br>The three pillars of eternity, the three events, preeminent and transcendent above all others, are the creation, the fall, and the atonement. These three are the foundations upon which all things rest. Without any one of them all things would lose their purpose and meaning, and the plans and designs of Deity would come to naught.<br><br>If there had been no creation, we would not be, neither the earth, nor any form of life upon its face. All things, all the primal elements, would be without form and void. God would have no spirit children; there would be no mortal probation; and none of us would be on the way to immortality and eternal life.<br><br>If there had been no fall of man, there would not be a mortal probation. Mortal man would not be, nor would there be animals or fowls or fishes or life of any sort upon the earth. And, we repeat, none of us would be on the way to immortality and eternal life.<br><br>If there had been no atonement of Christ, all things would be lost. The purposes of creation would vanish away. Lucifer would triumph over men and become the captain of their souls. And, we say it again, none of us would be on the way to immortality and eternal life.<br><br>And so I now say: Come and let us reason together; let us reason as did righteous men of old that we may come to understanding.<br><br>Come and hear us declare sound doctrine; let us declare it plainly and in power as do the angels of God in heaven.<br><br>Come and let us testify of those things which God has made known to us; let us testify as do those whose souls are afire with the Spirit and who know by revelation of the truth and verity of their spoken word.<br><h2><b>The Atonement</b></h2><br>Let us gaze first at a scene of sorrow and suffering in a garden called Gethsemane, the garden of the oil press. There, outside Jerusalem&#39;s walls, on the now sacred side of Olivet, we see eight of the Twelve huddled at the garden gate. Inside the garden are Peter, James, and John. It is night, and the eyes of all are heavy with sleep.<br><br>About a stone&#39;s cast removed from the three we see the Son of God in sorrow and agony beyond compare. He has fallen on his face. We hear his pleading words: "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt" (Matthew 26:39).<br><br>We see great gouts of blood drop from every pore. An angel--surely it is mighty Michael himself--comes down from heaven and strengthens him. He trembles because of pain and suffers in both body and spirit. He comes off triumphant; and in a way incomprehensible to us, he bears the sins of all men on conditions of repentance.<br><br>Now let our gaze turn to Golgotha. There, at the place of a skull, we see him again, crucified between two thieves. It is noon, and his mangled and scourged body has already hung on that accursed tree for some three hours.<br><br>Again it is the hour of atonement. The sun is darkened; for three long hours there is "darkness over all the earth" (Luke 23:44), as all the agonies and sufferings of Gethsemane return. Then the victory is won; the ransom is paid; the atonement is accomplished.<br><br>Some thirty-eight or forty hours later--after three days as the Jews counted time--we see him by a garden tomb. He has risen in glorious immortality. Clothed with immortality and eternal life, he gently restrains one of the beloved Marys from embracing him with the same intimacy that had once prevailed.<br><br>Soon angelic choirs will fill the heavens as the redeemed sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing" (Revelation 5:12).<br><br>And thus it is that salvation is in Christ, that his atoning sacrifice is the heart and core and center of revealed religion, and that he--in Gethsemane of sorrowful memory and on the cross of Calvary--put into full operation all the terms and conditions of his Father&#39;s plan.<br><br>He is the resurrection and the life. He is the Redeemer of the world and the Savior of men. He "hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel" (2 Timothy 1:10). It was his work and his glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. And his is the only name given under heaven whereby man may be saved.<br><br>If there had been no atonement of Christ, there would be no resurrection, no breaking of the bands of death, no coming forth from the grave.<br><br>If there had been no atonement, there would be no remission of sins; no return to the presence of God; no salvation of any sort, kind, or nature; no eternal life; no exaltation; no continuation of the family unit in eternity.<br><br>If there were no atonement of Christ, all men would be subject to "that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment" (2 Nephi 9:19).<br><br>If there were no atonement of Christ, "our spirits" would have become "like unto" Lucifer&#39;s, "and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself" (2 Nephi 9:9).<br><br>If there were no atonement of Christ, all men would be damned everlastingly, all would be sons of perdition, and the whole purpose of God and his eternal plan of salvation would utterly fail.<br><br>All things center in, revolve around, are anchored to, and are built upon the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is no language given to men or angels to proclaim these truths with the power and verity and dignity that should attend them. Let it be blazoned in burning fire through all the sidereal heavens that salvation is in Christ and comes because of his atoning sacrifice.<br><br>Now this atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ--grand and infinite, glorious and eternal as it is--does not stand alone. It is not simply a sudden blaze of light in a universe of darkness and despair. It is not by itself alone a great sun rising in celestial splendor to dispel the gloom of endless night. It is not merely a manifestation of the grace of an infinite God toward his fallen children.<br><br>However much the atonement may be and is all these things--and more!--yet it does not stand alone. It is not a child born without parents. It has roots; it has a reason for being; it came because other events called it forth.<br><h2><b>The Fall</b></h2><br>The atonement is part of the eternal plan of the Father. It came at the appointed time, according to the will of the Father, to do for man that which could not have been done in any other way. The atonement is the child of the fall, and the fall is the father of the atonement. Neither of them, without the other, could have brought to pass the eternal purposes of the Father.<br><br>The fall of Adam and the atonement of Christ are linked together--inseparably, everlastingly, never to be parted. They are as much a part of the same body as are the head and the heart, and each plays its part in the eternal scheme of things.<br><br>The fall of Adam brought temporal and spiritual death into the world, and the atonement of Christ ransomed men from these two deaths by bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. This makes the fall as essential a part of the plan of salvation as the very atonement itself.<br><br>There are, in fact, five things that came into being and continue to exist because of the fall. None of these things would have existed if there had been no fall, and all of them are essential parts of the divine plan of salvation. They are:<br><br>1.<i>Temporal death.</i>This is the natural death; it occurs when body and spirit separate; it results in corruption and decay. Because of the atonement of Christ all men will be raised from corruption to incorruption, from mortality to immortality, thence to live everlastingly in a resurrected state.<br><br>2.<i>Spiritual death.</i>This is death as pertaining to the things of the Spirit. It is death<br><br>as pertaining to things of righteousness. It is to be cast out of the presence of the Lord. It is a way of life which is in opposition to that of the Father of us all. Because of the atonement, because the Lord Jesus bore our sins on conditions of repentance, we have power to gain eternal life, which is spiritual life, which is a life of righteousness, which is life in the presence of our God.<br><br>3.<i>Mortality.</i>Mortal life comes because of the fall. If there had been no fall, there would be no mortal life of any sort on earth. Mortal life is life where there is death. Death must enter the world to bring mortality into being.<br><br>4.<i>Procreation.</i>Before the fall there was no procreation. I repeat, for thus saith the Holy Word, before the fall there was no procreation. Adam and Eve, in their Edenic state, could not have children, nor, as we shall see, could any form of life when first placed on the newly created paradisiacal earth.<br><br>5.<i>A probationary estate.</i>We are here to be tried and tested, to see if we will believe the truths of salvation and keep the commandments while we walk by faith. After the fall men became carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature, and the plan of salvation calls upon them to put off these worldly snares and to put on Christ.<br><br>Now, lest there be any sliver of misunderstanding about any of this, let us reason together on all these things as did they of old. Indeed, let us use the very words they used as they are found in the holy scriptures.<br><br>"Now is Christ risen from the dead," Paul said as he testified of the atonement. "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead." Adam brought death, and if he had not fallen there would be no death; and Christ brought the resurrection, and, if there had been no atonement, there would be no resurrection. "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:20‚Äì22).<br><br>Moroni linked the fall and the atonement together in this way. God, he said, "created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And because of the fall of man came Jesus Christ." It is just that simple; the fall is the source and cause and reason for the atonement. "And because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man" (Mormon 9:12). Salvation is in Christ!<br><br>"And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ," men "are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep" (Mormon 9:13).<br><br>What did the angel say to King Benjamin? He said, Christ&#39;s "blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam" (Mosiah 3:11). We are descendants of Adam; we all have a common father.<br><br>He said, "As in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins" (Mosiah 3:16). The blessings of the fall have passed upon all men; all can be redeemed because Adam fell and Christ came.<br><br>He said, "Salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent" (Mosiah 3:18). There is no other source of salvation from the fall than that which comes through Christ.<br><br>He said, "The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord" (Mosiah 3:19).<br><br>Thus the natural man, which is Adam, is conquered by the perfect man, which is Christ; and thus "all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel" (Third Article of Faith). And now, what saith our great and good friend Lehi about all these things?<br><br>He saith that the Redeemer "cometh to bring salvation unto men. . . . And the way is prepared [for him] from the fall of man, and salvation is free" (2 Nephi 2:3‚Äì4). The fall is the foundation upon which the atonement rests.<br><br>He saith that "after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth" (2 Nephi 2:19). Their mortal probation and the trials and tests of mortality began after the fall.<br><br>He saith:<br><br><i>And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all the earth.</i>[2 Nephi 2:20]<br><br>Every living soul on earth is a descendant of Adam and Eve. God hath made of one blood all the nations of men.<br><br>He saith:<br><br><i>If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden.</i>[2 Nephi 2:22]<br><br>If Adam had not fallen, he would be there today, six thousand years later, in all the glory and beauty of his immortal nature. Such is the word of holy writ.<br><br>And next--marvel of marvels and wonder of wonders--Lehi saith, "And all things which were created"--<i>all things</i>means all things; it includes animals and fishes and fowls and creeping things and plants; it includes dinosaurs and whales and ants; it means all things--<br><br><i>All things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</i>[2 Nephi 2:22]<br><br>There was, we repeat, no death in the world until after Adam fell. And there was, we repeat, no procreation until after the fall. And there was, we repeat, no mortality until after the fall.<br><br>And so Lehi continues, "And they"--Adam and Eve--"would have had no children" (2 Nephi 2:23).<br><br>And then, on the foundation so laid, while filled with light and guided by the Spirit, Lehi acclaimed:<br><br><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are that they might have joy.</i><br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall.</i>[2 Nephi 2:25‚Äì26]<br><br>Truly, as Enoch said:<br><br><i>Because that Adam fell, we are; and by his fall came death; and we are made partakers of misery and woe. . . .</i><br><br><i>And men have become carnal, sensual, and devilish, and are shut out from the presence of God.</i>[Moses 6:48, 49]<br><br>Truly, as Mother Eve said:<br><br><i>Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth to all the obedient.</i>[Moses 5:11]<br><br>Truly, salvation comes because of the fall, and it is just as important to believe in the fall as it is to believe in the atonement, and, indeed, it is not possible to believe in the atonement without believing in the fall.<br><h2><b>The Creation</b></h2><br>Now, even as the atonement grows out of the fall, so the fall grows out of the creation. If all things had not been created in the very way in which they were created, there could have been no fall. If created things were to fall, they must be created in a higher state than the state they would be in after the fall. To fall is to go downward or forward, not upward.<br><br>And so it is that the revealed accounts of the creation of this earth and all things on the face thereof are accounts of the paradisiacal creation. They speak of the immortal state in which all things were first made; they are telling of created things in the day before death entered the world.<br><br>Our Tenth Article of Faith says: "We believe . . . that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." When the Lord comes and the millennial era commences, there will be new heavens and a new earth; the earth will be renewed; it will become new again; and it will return to its paradisiacal state; it will become as it was in the Edenic day. And once again death as we know it will cease.<br><br>The accounts of the creation in Genesis 1 and Moses 2 are accounts of the paradisiacal or Edenic creation. They are descriptive of a creation that antedated death and mortality and the fall. They speak of a creation in which--again these are Lehi&#39;s words--<br><br><i>All things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</i>[2 Nephi 2:22]<br><br>That is, they would have so remained if there had been no fall.<br><h2><b>Recapitulation</b></h2><br>Now, we are speaking of the three pillars of heaven, of the three greatest events ever to occur in all eternity, of the three doctrines that are woven inseparably together to form the plan of salvation. We are speaking of the creation, the fall, and the atonement. And these things are one. And, be it noted, all things were created; all things fell; and all things are subject to the redeeming power of the Son of God.<br><br>I am not conscious of expressing a single thought or concept that has not already been said by the Brethren who have gone before. Almost every sentence I have uttered is a quotation or a paraphrase of something said by Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Joseph F. Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith, Orson Pratt, or some other of the great theologians of our dispensation.<br><br>Many among us have no difficulty envisioning that the atonement is infinite and eternal and applies to all forms of life. They know that the revelations say in so many words that all forms of life both lived as spirit entities and will be resurrected--animals, fowls, fishes--all things are eternal in nature.<br><br>But some among us have not yet had it dawn upon them that all things fell and became mortal so they could be resurrected.<br><br>The early Brethren of our dispensation wrote these words:<br><br><i>The word</i>atonement<i>signifies deliverance, through the offering of a ransom, from the penalty of a broken law. . . . As effected by Jesus Christ, it signifies the deliverance, through his death and resurrection, of the earth and everything pertaining to it, from the power which death has obtained over them through the transgression of Adam. . . . Redemption from death, through the sufferings of Christ, is for all men, both the righteous and the wicked; for this earth, and for all things created upon it.</i>[<i>Compendium</i>, pp. 8‚Äì9, cited in<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, B. R. McConkie (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), pp. 64‚Äì65.]<br><h2><b>Three Glorious Beings</b></h2><br>When we speak of the creation, the fall, and the atonement, we are speaking of the works of Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael. We are talking of the doctrines which are stated or are implicit in our first three Articles of Faith. We need to come to a unity of faith as to the labors of each of these glorious beings.<br><br><i>Who is Elohim?</i>He is God the Eternal Father. He is a glorified and exalted personage. He has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man&#39;s. In the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name. He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He knows all things and has all power--not simply as pertaining to us or in some prescribed sphere or realm--but in the absolute, eternal, and unlimited sense. In the ultimate sense, he is the Creator. And anything you may have heard to the contrary, whether in the creeds of Christendom or the mouthings of intellectuals who, in their own eyes, know more than the Lord, is false.<br><br><i>Who is Michael?</i>He is a spirit son of the great Elohim. Under Christ he led the armies of righteousness when there was war in heaven. Our revelations say that he "was the son of God" (Moses 6:22), that he was "the first flesh [the first mortal flesh] upon earth, the first man also" (Moses 3:7), and that he was "the first man of all men" (Moses 1:34). He is Adam our father; he is the presiding high priest over all the earth. Under Christ, who is "the Holy One," he holds "the keys of salvation" (D&amp;amp;C 78:16). He is the only one by whom the fall came. And anything you may have heard to the contrary, from whatever source, is false.<br><br><i>Who is Jehovah?</i>He is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Firstborn of the Father, the Savior and Redeemer. He is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. He is the Only Begotten in the flesh, the only person ever born with a mortal mother and an immortal Father. He worked out the infinite and eternal atonement, ransomed men and all forms of life from the fall, and made the purposes of creation operative. Salvation is in him and comes to those who believe and obey. And anything you may have heard to the contrary is false.<br><br>The truths relative to Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael are the greatest of all eternal verities. They wrap the creation, the fall, and the atonement into one grand plan of salvation. They are the gospel of God who is the Father. And of their truth the Holy Ghost bears witness.<br><br>God grant that we may all believe and know and understand the great eternal verities by which salvation comes and that, believing and knowing and understanding, we may so live as to gain eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce R.

<h1> Light So Shine - Dean L. Larsen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great privilege to be on the campus of this university--and more especially to be here tonight in the spirit of this fireside. I have prayed earnestly that, in organizing the things I would like to say to you tonight, I&#39;d be guided by the Spirit to say what would be appropriate and helpful. I have earnestly sought, in organizing the things I would like to say to you tonight, I&#39;d be guided by the Spirit to say what would be appropriate and helpful. I have earnestly sought for the power and influence of the Lord&#39;s Spirit to help me to convey to you the message I have brought. I trust that that Spirit will work with us, and that perhaps something in these words will prove encouraging and useful to you.<br><h2><b>A Great Responsibility</b></h2><br>The Lord has made it clear that each of us has a responsibility to exert an influence for good in the lives of those who share this mortal experience with us. We cannot live in isolation from others and still fulfill the purpose of our existence here. Our actions, our words, our thoughts, and our values will inevitably affect the souls of those whose lives brush against ours. In fact, the Lord himself has said that this influence may continue to reverberate long after we have departed, even to the ensuing generations (see Mosiah 13:13). This is an awesome prospect. When we contemplate the power we have for perpetrating both good and evil in the lives of others, we have good reason to reach for careful understating of this power.<br><br>It is clear that we will be held responsible for making our influence felt. There is no safety or sanctuary in living passively or in avoiding contact with others. This is true for individuals as well as groups. Nowhere in scripture is this made more emphatic than in the Lord&#39;s injunction to Ezekiel. He said:<br><br><i>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</i><br><br><i>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</i><br><br><i>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</i>[Ezekiel 3:17‚Äì19]<br><br>To his disciples the Savior said,<br><br><i>I give unto you to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.</i>[3 Nephi 12:13]<br><br>On another occasion he spoke of the need of our placing our light on a candlestick, not under a bushel, so that it could give light to the whole house (see Matthew 5:15).<br><br>How do we exert this kind of influence upon others so that their lives and ours are enriched and blessed? Joseph Smith warned that it is the<i>nature</i>and<i>disposition</i>of almost all of us to exercise this influence in an unrighteous way. He said:<br><br><i>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.</i><br><br><i>Hence many are called, but few are chosen.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:39‚Äì40]<br><h2><b>Agency and Accountability</b></h2><br>Is it possible for us to have the best of motives and intentions and still produce undesirable results? In what ways can we unrighteously dominate the lives of others? Obviously this is a matter of overriding importance, for, not only do we bring others into jeopardy by our misuse of this power, but it appears that our own prospects for eternal advancement are closely related to our leaning to use it righteously.<br><br>In order for us to interact with each other in a correct way, it is necessary to comprehend the immense importance of the gift of agency--the freedom to exercise one&#39;s own will. Of course, one&#39;s agency is of little productive value unless it is accompanied by knowledge and understanding. When knowledge and understanding are combined with agency, a condition is achieved that we call<i>accountability.</i><br><br>Achieving accountability and helping others to achieve it are among the most important concerns of mortal life. Parents have this great responsibility with regard to their children. The Lord has said that those parents who fail in this are guilty of a serious transgression (see D&amp;amp;C 68:25). Progress and development toward a celestial standard of life cannot be achieved in the absence of individual accountability. It is a process that continues after baptism. The Lord has said that children only<i>begin</i>to become accountable before him at the baptismal age (see D&amp;amp;C 29:47).<br><h2><b>Jehovah vs. Satan</b></h2><br>It is helpful to review the account given to us by Moses in the Pearl of Great Price of the propositions that were advanced and the decisions made in the great council of spirits prior to the creation and habitation of this earth. In that council the purposes and opportunities of mortal life and the essential nature of agency were explained. The preeminently important role of a redeemer and atoner in this great plan was also outlined. One whom we know as Jehovah, the Firstborn of the Father in the spirit, was chosen to fill this role. He was fully qualified for such an assignment. It would require attributes of unexcelled devotion, love, and perfection. Jehovah accepted the conditions of the plan and willingly agreed to comply with them. Additionally, he insisted that the honor and glory resulting from the success of this plan would remain with the Father (see Moses 4:1‚Äì4).<br><br>Paramount among the conditions that Jehovah espoused was that of agency--the freedom of each individual spirit to make choices and to abide by the consequences of those choices. All of us who participated in that council were informed as to the risks that would attach to a mortal existence. We understood well that, while our decision to come into mortal life would enable us to be "added upon" (Abraham 3:26), the prospect of having "glory added upon [our] heads for ever and ever" would be conditioned upon our willing obedience to those principles and practices that would make this possible. We understood that because we would be free to make choices--to exercise our agency--some would fall short of their highest potential in consequence of their disobedience. It must have been a most sobering and compelling moment in our lives. The magnitude of the step to be taken into mortal life must have seemed overwhelming to us--and indeed it was!<br><br>At this momentous time of decision-making, another prominent figure stepped forward. We know him as Lucifer, a son of the morning. He contested the plan of the Father, and he opposed the choice of Jehovah as the Redeemer. Taking advantage of the anxiety and doubt that must have been felt by many of the spirits in that council, he used his influence to incite a rebellion. He proposed that he should replace Jehovah as the central figure in the plan of salvation. His plan would deny the freedom of choice to those who followed him. They would be compelled to obedience. He promised them that not one soul of them would be lost. Furthermore, all the honor and glory were to rest upon him. The words of the Father describe these events and their consequences for Lucifer and those who rebelled with him.<br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i><br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i>[Moses 4:3‚Äì4]<br><br>Lucifer knew that the promise of salvation extended on his conditions was a lie. He could not have delivered the results he promised. He had two despicable motives in taking the course he did. One was to make himself an absolute dictator with all power and glory. The other was to enslave his followers by taking from them forever their right to make choices. Obviously under such conditions all opportunity for individual progress and development would have been lost. Lucifer sought to aggrandize himself at the eternal expense of all who would submit to his proposition.<br><br>From the account of these dramatic events we gain considerable insight into the importance of Joseph Smith&#39;s inspired observation. No person can be compelled to progress. When compulsion is used, the benefits are lost. It is an irrevocable law. Manipulation, regimentation, coercion--for whatever motive or reason--will ultimately fail to produce good results. Joseph Smith specifically warned against such things as pride, vain ambition, control, unrighteous dominion, compulsion, hypocrisy, and guile. He declared that methods of exerting influence based upon these things would cause the Spirit of the Lord to grieve, the heavens to withdraw their sanction, and, finally, the power for accomplishing good to be terminated (see D&amp;amp;C 121:36‚Äì37).<br><br>The Prophet went on to say that no power or influence can be maintained, nor should it be attempted, even within the purview of a priesthood calling or assignment, except<br><br><i>by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:41‚Äì42]<br><br>In order for progress and development to occur, then, one must have the freedom to exercise his own will. He must have a knowledge of truth sufficient to make him accountable--enough to "greatly enlarge the soul." Moreover, he must come to value the truths he has learned for himself, by his own volition, not through compulsion or intimidation from another. Under these conditions he is capable of exercising moral judgment. And he is capable of progress.<br><br>I like the statement made by Albert Payne on this point:<br><br><i>A distinguishing feature of church organization lies in its balance of authority and individual rights. Priesthood is a brotherhood, and in its operation the highest capacities of man--his capacity to act as a free agent, and his capacity to be spiritual--must be protected, respected, and enlarged. Leaders invite, persuade, encourage, and recommend in a spirit of gentleness and meekness. Members respond freely as the Spirit guides. Only this kind of response has moral value. Fear and force have no place in the kingdom because they do not produce moral actions, and they are contrary to God&#39;s gift of free agency.</i>[Unpublished]<br><br>It should be pointed out that the Lord&#39;s plan does not ignore the need for occasional correction and discipline. He does not withhold the consequences of bad choices. When we err, we feel the pain. Those in positions of influence and leadership, including parents, are required to see that purity of conduct and belief is maintained among the membership of the Church. Persistent or recurring violation of the Lord&#39;s standard requires disciplinary action. His commitment to agency does not include a tolerance for sin. It is important for us to remember the fact taught by Alma to his son Corianton: Mercy cannot rob justice (see Alma 42:25).<br><br>While his love for us does not diminish, he does not rescue us from hard lessons that we must sometimes learn. Freedom always has jeopardy as its companion. Only inspired wisdom and an unrelenting commitment to truth and righteous conduct guarantee a forward course on the path of progress.<br><br>The<i>freedom to</i>choose our own course of action does not provide<i>freedom from</i>the consequences of our choices.<br><br>With these facts before us, how doe we govern ourselves in wielding the influence the Lord expects us to have upon others? How can these principles apply in our relationships with family, friends, associates, and with all whom we encounter on life&#39;s journey?<br><br>Just as the ends do not always justify the means, neither do the motives always justify the methods. Lucifer sought to aggrandize himself by enslaving others. His motive for compelling others was to exalt himself above them. One may have the purest of motives for regimenting, compelling, or controlling the lives of others, but his motives will not prevent negative results from occurring in the lives of those whom his incorrect methods touch.<br><h2><b>The Savior&#39;s Example</b></h2><br>We have a perfect model to follow in the Savior himself. He had great power that he could have used to compel people to follow him and to be obedient to his word. Occasionally he demonstrated this power in miraculous ways but never with the intent to command a following. It was not uncommon for him to ask of those who had been the recipients of his marvelous power to keep the matter to themselves and tell no one. Such was the case with the leper whom Jesus healed. "See thou tell no man" (Matthew 8:4) was the Savior&#39;s charge in this case. It was almost as though he feared that men would follow him because of his power rather than as a result of having learned his truths and having valued them because they were true.<br><br>In no incident in the mortal ministry of the Lord is this concern made more manifest than in the case of the feeding of the multitude with the loaves and fishes (see John 6). This great gathering of people had followed Jesus into a mountain where he had taught them. They had brought no provender with them. Out of compassion for their physical hunger, he miraculously provided food for 5,000. Their reaction to this demonstration of power was to attempt to force him to become their king. The benefits of yielding subservience to one who could care for their needs so easily were obvious. Their intentions alarmed the Savior. He left the crowd immediately and during the night crossed over to the other side of the sea of Galilee near Capernaum. Word soon came to them of the Lord&#39;s whereabouts, and the throng pursued him. When they found him, they said, "Rabbi, when camest thou hither?" (John 6:25).<br><br><i>Perceiving the real purpose of their interest in him, the Lord accused them:</i><br><br><i>Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</i><br><br><i>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.</i>[John 6:26‚Äì27]<br><br>The crowd then demanded another miracle, protesting that they were not so different from the children of Israel for whom Moses had provided manna in the desert.<br><br>Obviously the truths that Jesus had taught these people had not penetrated their hearts and their understanding. They were untouched by the influence he hoped to have. "I am the bread of life," he said. "He that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst" (John 6:35).<br><br><i>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</i><br><br><i>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</i>[John 6:50‚Äì51]<br><br>Completely untouched by understanding, the multitude was revulsed by this allegorical attempt of the Savior, and, as the scriptures tell us, "from that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him" (John 6:66).<br><br>It would not have been difficult for Jesus to continue to command the following of these people. Their welfare and their salvation meant more to him than his own life. A few more public miracles could have held them and augmented their numbers. It would have been an easy thing for him to do. But the essential parts of the equation were not coming together. He did not wish a following on that basis. It must have been a terribly disappointing, frustrating experience for the Master. If they would not follow him because they believed and valued the truths he taught, he would not have them follow him at all.<br><br>From a careful review for the Lord&#39;s own methods in teaching and influencing others, it appears that he has always been greatly concerned about helping people to become accountable. His teaching is designed to give both knowledge and understanding. He has set a perfect example. And he has always honored the agency of men. When it has been necessary for him to reprove and correct, he has done so openly and directly, but always with the intent to help and to lift--never to bring honor or attention to himself, nor to bring lock-step, blind obedience to his will. The Lord does not exercise unrighteous dominion.<br><h2><b>Implementing the Perfect Plan</b></h2><br>Following this pattern, it would seem that we must use every opportunity that comes to us to share the truths we have about life and its purpose. The Lord&#39;s charge to Ezekiel that we referred to earlier is evidence of this. Additionally we must continue to encourage and guide and assist with patience and meekness, not to serve our own needs nor our own objectives, but with an eye single to the glory of the Lord and the blessing of his children.<br><br>These are matters that are at the very center of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Father&#39;s plan of life for us. There is no other plan capable of producing the character and strength and independent goodness that must qualify one for eternal life. Gospel principles and the institutions of the Church provide the essential road map for us to follow, but the detail of the daily itinerary is left up to us.<br><br>The Savior trusts us to succeed because he knows of the divine spark within us, and he trusts the plan because he knows of its perfection. Even as he had to be trusted by the Father to drink of the bitter cup in those last hours of Gethsemane, when he wondered and hoped momentarily that there might be an easier way, so he must trust us. Even as he had to trust Peter and the other apostles to pass the tests of the refiner&#39;s fire after he had been taken from their midst, so he must trust us. There is no other way.<br><br>When we contrast the vacillating Peter on the night of the Savior&#39;s betrayal (see Luke 22:60‚Äì62) and his humiliation before Pilate to Peter, the calmly unshakable apostle who later stood before the Jewish council and at the peril of his life witnessed for the divine messiahship of the Master, we too can know that the plan works (see Acts 4:10‚Äì12). It is valid, it is true, it is perfect.<br><br>In order for it to work its miracle for us, we must go beyond that which is prescribed for us. We must do many good things of our own free will because the power is in us wherein we are agents unto ourselves (see D&amp;amp;C 58:26‚Äì28).<br><br>The challenges through which we must pass in making the necessary preparations for the Lord&#39;s return will require that we develop the tempered integrity of Peter and Paul and Joseph. It is an integrity that cannot be imposed upon us. It is a strength that must be born and nurtured within each soul. It is the power of God unto salvation through Jesus Christ. We may teach and encourage and love and correct one another to achieve it, but we cannot compel.<br><br>The elders quorum president who takes it upon himself to do all of the unfinished home teaching in his quorum during the last week of the month must ask himself what his real motives are. Is it for the sake of a good record? And, if so, for what reasons does he wish to make the record look good? Is he concerned about helping his home teachers to be accountable? Is he willing to let them be accountable whether or not the teaching is done? These are challenging questions, and they require soul-searching, honest answers. When we delegate a responsibility to others, we establish a sacred trust. We have an obligation to do everything appropriate that we can do to help them succeed, but we must be careful not to preempt them in the responsibility we have delegated lest we rob them of their rightful opportunity and in so doing exercise unrighteous dominion.<br><br>The ward mission leader who prescribes the exact procedure to be followed by all members of his ward in fulfilling their member-missionary responsibility must carefully assess both his motive and his method. Certainly he must do all he can to teach the purpose and the need for the missionary effort. He must share ideas and encourage at every opportunity. But he must guard against the temptation to regiment in order to get the results he has specified. At what point is agency infringed upon and unrighteous dominion exercised?<br><br>As a high school basketball coach, I learned the value of what we used to call our "freelance" offense. There were times when all the practiced patterns and set plays didn&#39;t produce the desired results. At these times the freelance offense was often effective. It simply consisted of having each player take advantage of every opportunity that arose, with a minimum of form and system. It required a considerable command of the fundamentals and a keen sensitivity to the situation. Sometimes a good freelance offense will win for you when the system fails, especially if the fundamentals are understood and applied.<br><br>In order for people to keep the Sabbath Day holy, must they have a full day of required activities prescribed for them at our chapels, or can they enjoy the necessary group worship exercises, including partaking of the sacrament, and then be trusted to govern their own conduct and find their own means of spiritual uplift on this sacred day? Can we live with the risk that some will misuse their time and opportunity? Can agency be honored in such an important matter as this?<br><br>Can parents be entrusted to teach the gospel to their own children? Or must we require all to follow intensive group programs for instructing our young people to protect against the possibility that some parents will be negligent and their children cheated of their rightful opportunity? Are there reasonable answers to these important questions in the pattern the Lord has set for us? Where can the most appropriate balance be found in order to bring the greatest ultimate blessings for all of us?<br><br>In our consideration of these vital and very real issues, we must never tune out the warning sounded for us by the Prophet Joseph Smith: "It is the nature and disposition of almost all men . . . to exercise unrighteous dominion." We must remember the terrible price that has been paid in order that our agency and accountability might be preserved and enhanced. Finally, we cannot lose from our minds the picture of the Savior&#39;s heartache and disappointment as the multitude at Capernaum turned away "and walked no more with him." Another miracle could probably have held them on--another meal of the loaves and fishes. They were so precious to him. One can sense the heart-wrenching disappointment of the Savior as he turned to his apostles and asked, "Will ye also go away?" (John 6:67).<br><br>Peter&#39;s response has meaning for us all: "Lord," he said, "to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life" (John 6:68).<br><br>The words of eternal life, while full of transcendent hope and promise, are not easy. The pathway of progress marked by the Lord is filled with challenges and risks, but it is the only way to celestial life. As we move along that path, we have the reassurance of knowing that we follow in the footsteps of one who knows the way, who understands, who trusts us to press on by our own effort and will. He has removed from this path every obstacle that we could not remove ourselves. He now beckons, "Come to me."<br><br>On our onward journey, may we draw proper strength and help from each other, and may we be so wise as to avoid any act or desire that would unnecessarily hedge up the way for another. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dean L.

<h1>l Courtesy and Consideration - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, President Holland. I know I speak on behalf of this wonderful student body when I express appreciation to Debbie for that marvelous musical number. I thought as she was rendering it, "I wonder what I was doing in the preexistence when all that talent was handed out." I asked my wife that once about music and me. She said, "I know. You skipped church that week." I'm glad Debbie didn't.<br><br>Seeing all these chairs placed in front of the podium reminds me of a little story concerning the lady who came to church who had a little trouble hearing, and she wore a hearing aid and sat as close to the pulpit as she could. The minister, being very considerate, would raise his voice so that she could hear better. He was quoting a text from the New Testament in his sermon concerning the second coming. Wanting to be sure he was heard, he raised his voice and said, "And I come quickly." The lady leaned forward to hear. He thought she couldn't make sense out of it, so he tried again. He repeated, "And I come quickly." Once more she cupped her hand and leaned to hear. So a third time he said with a raised voice, "I come quickly." About that time the pulpit gave way, and he fell in front of her, just at her feet. He looked up at her and said, "Oh, I'm so sorry, madam."<br><br>She said, "That's all right, sonny. You warned me three times."<br><br>These devotionals, along with your courses of study, are wonderful. As you learn new material, you are often reminded of your roles. I feel a little bit like the entrepreneur who, having made his fortune early in his young career, decided to try a life of adventure. He purchased a balloon with the intent of making a cross-country journey. Shortly after he departed with a companion, a large storm arose, and it caused them to drift. For many hours they were buffeted back and forth until they were hopelessly lost. When the storm passed, they found themselves passing over a mountain. On the road below they noticed a car. Two men were standing beside it. They thought they'd descend enough to get some help on where they were located. They let a little air out of the balloon and came down over the car, hovering for a second. The young adventurer hollered to the men on the road, "Can you tell us where we are?"<br><br>One of the men looked up and said, "You're in a balloon."<br><br>The young scout said to his companion, "You know, that man is a CPA."<br><br>His friend asked, "How would you know that?"<br><br>He replied, "The information he gave was accurate and precise but totally useless."<br><br>I suspect that most of what you get here is not useless, but of great value and worth.<br><br>As I came through the hall into the Marriott Center a little while ago, one enterprising freshman stopped me (you know how freshman are) and said, "Are you going to tell any sports stories?"<br><br>I said to her, "That's always a risk. I worry because many don't understand the nomenclature of sports talk." Her companion said, "Well, we do down here."<br><br>I said, "Let me test you." I turned to the young lady and asked, "Do you know what a<i>foul ball</i>is?"<br><br>She replied, "Well certainly. It's a dance for chickens!"<br><h2><b>Watchful Eyes</b></h2><br>I do have one sports story, in line with what President Holland was suggesting concerning our attitudes and our sportsmanship. I couldn't agree more with his counsel to us this morning [to be good sports and gracious hosts] than I already do. It is sound advice. We are always on display just because of who we are and what we represent. We are missionaries at every turn. I guess the question is, What do we teach as we project our image across the land?<br><br>I have an opportunity, as one of the general officers of the Church, to participate quite frequently with non‚ÄìLatter-day-Saint groups of influence. Quite often I address PTA conventions, Boy Scout conventions, businessmen's conventions, sports conventions, and the like. I would say a good deal of my General Authority time is spent literally as an ambassador of the Church before non-LDS groups, and it is interesting to me to see how careful they are to watch and to observe us for what we are and what we do. There are silent eyes, watching very, very carefully.<br><br>About a year and a half ago, my friend Billy Casper invited me to participate with him in his induction to the Golf Hall of Fame. Now that's a singular honor for an athlete, to be sure. They had quite a few notables there, and, along with the activity of the induction itself, I was invited to play in the pro-am tournament.<br><br>Do you ladies understand that kind of terminology? It is a one-day event where the amateurs are teamed up with the professionals in a golf tournament, and it is a spectacular thing for those who take part. I was paired off with two very fine amateurs and with Larry Nelson, the young golf professional who is making quite a name for himself. He's a devout Christian. We had tremendous opportunity for eighteen holes to talk about you and me and the restoration of the gospel. What I didn't know is how many Latter-day Saints (this was in North Carolina) would come out to watch a General Authority in a tournament. I think half the Saints from North Carolina to Florida came out, and they carried placards around encouraging and giving support. And many on the golf course were wondering who Elder Dunn was.<br><br>We reached the fifteenth hole, where the gallery begins (if you've followed golf tournaments, you appreciate that from about the fifteenth to the eighteenth hole the gallery increases in goodly number. The television cameras are often very active at that point). When I reached the fifteenth tee, the hole was a 205-yard, par-3, elevated green, and it was well trapped. In tournaments they go to special effort to make it a little more difficult. The two amateurs hit beautiful shots, with both balls hitting somewhere between 6 and 12 yards from the hole. Larry Nelson put his 6 feet from the hole. Now it was Elder Dunn's turn, and many in the gallery were LDS. I could hear them saying, "Come on, Brother Dunn; come on, Brother Dunn."<br><br>Larry Nelson, the golf pro, walked over and said, "I never knew anybody with so many brothers and sisters." So again we had a chance to talk a little about the Church.<br><br>Well, a 205-yard, elevated green for me is somewhere between a 3-iron and a 5-wood. I debated. I have a little more accuracy and direction with a 5-wood. I removed it from the golf bag, teed up my ball, and hit a beautiful drive, but the lip of the sand trap just in front of the green caught the ball. The ball lodged itself right up under the lip. And I heard an "O-h-h-h" go out across the audience.<br><br>As I approached my next shot (there were the three balls on the green), the gallery tuned up again, "Come on, Brother Dunn; come on, Brother Dunn." I walked into the sand trap. In professional play, I guess you know, the rules are very strict. If the blade of that iron touches the sand, it is a two-stroke penalty. My ball was up under a lip. You could barely see the white. I took out a sand wedge and walked into the trap--it looked like the side of the Matterhorn. I planted my left foot so that it was almost eye level. I didn't bow my head, but I did say a little prayer. I said something to the effect, "Lord, I am doing this for you." I hit a shot out of there that I believe registered 8 on the Richter scale. It took out a large piece of turf and a shovel full of sand, and the ball went straight in the air about 40 feet. It came down two inches from the hole. Larry Nelson, the pro, walked over and said, "Paul, I gotta know more about your church."<br><br>We finished the round and had a little fun with it, and that gave me a great chance to discuss you and me and what we represent. I find wherever I go people are seeking and looking; they don't always know where to find; and you and I have wonderful opportunities to teach. I think you can be as much of a missionary at a ball game, if the climate is right, as you can sometimes in a living room or knocking on a door.<br><h2><b>Two Sides of a Coin</b></h2><br>Let me in the spirit of what President Holland has suggested tell you of a little experience. I've decided to change my talk in the direction of his counsel. He mentioned in that thoughtful obituary of me that I attended Chapman College some years ago. It was a religiously oriented school, and I won't plague you with all the details as to why I selected that particular institution. I had just finished a baseball career that was brief. I was married, had two children, and was uneducated, so I had to start all over again as young people frequently do. I wanted to be a teacher. Seminaries had just been introduced into Southern California, and I thought I would like to teach young people.<br><br>When I was growing up, religion wasn't all that exciting to me--or fun. I had long believed religion didn't have to be stuffy. I think the Lord has a sense of humor, don't you? If he doesn't, some of us are in trouble. The gospel to me is positive. It lifts burdens; it doesn't add burdens. I worry about a few of our Saints who go around burden ridden. It suggests that either they don't understand the gospel or they are not applying the principles that lift the guilt, the uncertainty, the frustration, and the anxiety that lots of them have. You ought to be the happiest audience in the world, and I think you are; but I'd like to see you even happier. The gospel does that for me, and it's an exciting thing. It ought to radiate; our every action ought to suggest something good and positive and important.<br><br>Several years ago I went to Chapman College, and at the time I was the first Mormon to enroll in the school's history. It is a religiously oriented school. I majored in the New Testament because of my lack of background in the Bible. I was so rare they used to put me on display there every Friday--you know, a real, live Mormon. Go look at him. I took time while at school to study our faith all the more diligently so it was kind of a two-pronged approach. I fell into the good graces of a marvelous professor of New Testament who later became a close friend of mine. In fact, I had the privilege 23 years later of performing his baptism--think of it--23 years of teaching and fellowshipping.<br><br>That fellowshipping started the first day I walked into a New Testament class. We met frequently during their so-called coffee breaks, and we would talk. We corresponded after I graduated. We had several personal meetings. I had him in my home. He later became critically ill. I left Salt Lake City on one assignment to the South, stopped off in Los Angeles, and went out to the Veterans Hospital to give him a priesthood blessing in a ward of about 200 men, none of whom belonged to the Church. It was interesting on that occasion to find that, when I called them to order the way the priesthood would do it, many others witnessing the scene were very interested. It's in that kind of environment I find the real power of what we are and what we have, if we are not embarrassed, or if we will take the lead and go with it.<br><br>He later joined the Church. I had the privilege of confirming him. A few years later it was my honor to perform the sealing for him and his wife right here in the Provo Temple. He later became a member of this faculty. He died two years ago. I had the privilege of speaking at his funeral. I met him, I taught him, I baptized him, I fellowshipped him, I performed his marriage, and I buried him. Can you think of anything I left out? It's that kind of wholeness that I think the gospel basically requires.<br><br>Well, we used to have a lot of fun in class. Many students were majoring in religion and preparing for the ministry. It became quite obvious in our class discussions that there were differences of opinion and interpretation of scripture. Dr. Davis kept things on a very high, friendly plane. Quite often during the discussion if I hadn't spoken, Dr. Davis, would stop the class and say, "Hold it, we haven't heard from the Mormons yet." So that would give me a chance to respond on how we would interpret that particular scripture. And as you can appreciate, it would often be quite a contrast.<br><br>One day we were reading in chapter 21 of the fourth gospel, the book of John, verses 22 and 23. This is where John makes a request of the Savior to tarry on the earth till he comes again (do you remember?), and that wish was later granted also to the Three Nephites of Book of Mormon history. You should have heard the discussion and the interpretation given to that chapter by these ministers-to-be. They went back and forth for the better part of an hour: "Well, it means this--" "No, I think it means this--" Finally, when they looked almost exhausted, I raised my hand.<br><br>Dr. Davis said, "Mr. Dunn wants to speak."<br><br>I replied, "Would you gentlemen<i>really like to know</i>what that chapter means? The Mormons do have the answer."<br><br>"Speak."<br><br>So I opened my Doctrine and Covenants to section 7, which deals with the proper interpretation of John 21:22 and 23. You remember the Prophet Joseph Smith had a similar question some years ago, and he inquired of the Lord, and he received an answer which became the seventh section of the Doctrine and Covenants. When I finished reading the section, there was total silence in the room. Dr. Davis raised his hands again and said, "Good heavens, the Mormons even have John!"<br><br>It was about that time when the Los Angeles Temple was being readied for dedication, and I thought it would be a tremendous spiritual experience for the religion faculty and ministerial students to have a field trip to the Los Angeles Temple open house. It was my privilege to be assigned as their guide.<br><br>Now, if you know a lot about the Old Testament, you can appreciate that much of what we do in the temple has a relationship, and most religions have no explanation for it. Well, these were men who were destined to be in the ministry, and they were fascinated with what they saw. They would stop as we would go from room to room and say, "What is that for? What do you do over there?" Where we could, we would give a little explanation. "Well, that's marvelous," they'd say. "We didn't know you Mormons did such things. Tremendous." We finally reached the celestial room, and you know how beautiful they all are in their appointment. Many would quietly approach me and say, "I hope we're not out of line, but what is that, and what do you do over there?" My friend, Guy, happened to see a couple of sealing rooms and a staircase that led up to a third one. He said, "Paul, I hope I'm not out of order, but where does that staircase go?" I couldn't resist the temptation.<br><br>"Oh," I said, "you shouldn't have asked."<br><br>"Oh, my goodness," he said, "I'm sorry, I hope I haven't been out of line."<br><br>I said, "No, but for you, I'll tell you if you won't tell anybody else."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "I promise."<br><br>I said, "You see that stairwell?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>I said, "There's a special room up there, and that's where John lives."<br><br>Well, it was that kind of a relationship that we shared with each other, and about a semester later he came to me and asked, "Could I ask you a favor?"<br><br>I said, "Please do."<br><br>He said, "You know, in addition to being a teacher here on the faculty, I am a part-time minister of the First Methodist Church in Glendale, California." (I grew up in Hollywood, California, and that's where I was living at the time.) He said, "You know, Paul, in our young married group, of which I am a sponsor, we are studying other religions, and we have never had a Mormon come and talk to our group. Would you come and be a guest speaker?"<br><br>Well, I could see a chance to raise my grade, so I said, "Why, I'd be honored to."<br><br>So on the appointed day I drove over to the First Methodist Church in Glendale. And you know how many Protestant churches align themselves on existing corners, often competing at the same hour, and the traffic was horrendous this particular morning, so I made a pass around the building and came by once more trying to find a place to park. There was a gentleman standing just off the curb, and he was waving me down. So I pulled over and he said, "Are you Mr. Dunn?"<br><br>I said, "Yes."<br><br>He said, "Dr. Davis described your car. If you'll get out, this gentleman will park it for you."<br><br>(Now just a little editorial note: Have you ever noticed how many firesides we have invited special speakers where they had to park a long way off? Think of a LeGrand Richards when somebody wasn't thoughtful enough to be out there. I just testify from my General Authority's vantage point: It happens, even in the true Church. Spiritual courtesy and consideration are so vital to receiving the Lord's spirit.)<br><br>Well, I was escorted in, and we went down some stairs through a long corridor. And I stopped in my tracks. The refrain from the song "Come, Come, Ye Saints" was being played on an organ. I thought I was having a revelation. I said, "What's that?"<br><br>They said, "We're trying to set the stage for a Mormon talk."<br><br>I said, "Thank you." I walked through the door, and seated before me were two hundred young adults--in kind of an oversized Relief Society room, beautiful in appointment, with a large fireplace. On the mantle over the hearth were two large candelabras with many candles casting a soft light on a picture. Do you know what the picture was? The Salt Lake Temple and the Tabernacle, framed. And I said, "Oh, thank you." There wasn't a peep in the audience, reverently listening to a strange hymn. I was escorted to the front of the room. I took my place; they had an appropriate devotional. Then Dr. Davis said some very nice things about me, as guest speaker, and turned the time to me. I tried as hard as I could to represent you properly, to teach some Methodists about the difference between Mormons and Protestants, Catholics, and Jews. When I had finished, there were about twenty minutes of inquiry, questions from the group that were thoughtful and courteous. I was then escorted to the back of the room, a benediction was offered, and one by one the couples filed out, saying such things as "Thank you, thank you. We haven't understood you people. You have helped us today. Thank you, thank you." Three days later I got one of the nicest notes I have ever received. It's still in my Book of Remembrance. Every time I hear the word<i>Methodist</i>, I feel<i>warm</i>and<i>good</i>. Could I, in the spirit of teaching a point here, turn the coin over for just a minute?<br><br>Another semester passed, and a wonderful friend of mine who was serving in our bishopric came to me and said, "Paul, we know you are over there at Chapman. Our Special Interest group is studying about the Holy Land. You know some of those Bible scholars at Chapman. Do you have any contacts that could come over and give us a lecture on the Holy Land?"<br><br>I said, "I think so." I approached my friend, Guy Davis. This was a man who received a very impressive honorarium when he'd go to other churches to lecture. Dr. Davis was one of the first who instituted student tours to the Holy Land 27 years ago, and he had developed a tremendous process of explaining and expressing the spirit of that wonderful place. I went to him and I said, "The Special Interest group in our church is having a lecture on the Holy Land, and we wondered if you could come and talk to them."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "I'd be honored."<br><br>He checked his calendar and had to cancel out another Protestant appointment. I said, "Hold it; don't do that. We don't pay honorariums. You remember one of the unique differences of our church and all other churches is that we are a lay church. At best, I may be able to get you two cookies and a glass of punch."<br><br>"Don't worry," he said, "I'd be honored to come."<br><br>He came. On the night of the special event, since he did not know where our church was located, I decided to pick him up. It was a chance for another visit. The meeting was scheduled for 7:30. We arrived at the church at 7:15. There was a familiar sight. The ward was dark. No one around. I sat out in front of the chapel, giving him another little two-and-a-half-minute talk on the lay nature of the Mormon Church and how different we are from other faiths. 7:20, and from out of no-where came the first Latter-day Saint with a set of keys. She opened a door, and lights went on, and then that interesting Mormon phenomenon occurred. Mormons came from everywhere. I thought some of them had parachuted in. One by one they scurried in. 7:25, I got out of the car and escorted my friend into the chapel. We stood in the foyer for several minutes. Nobody approached us. Finally a member of the bishopric went by, and I reached out and grabbed him. I said, "Your guest is here."<br><br>"Oh, yeah, thank you!"<br><br>We were escorted into the Relief Society room. The members were taking their seats. Have you ever watched a Mormon congregation as they gather? You know how interesting and a little different we are. I hope we never lose our informality--I like it. But there has to be some good taste and proper understanding as we exercise it. Finally, in came a lady with an armful of songbooks, and she distributed them. One by one people filled the Relief Society room. The person who was conducting got up and thumbed through the songbook: "Anybody got a song they want to sing?" The prayer was quickly offered, and the meeting was turned to me. I tried to set the stage so the spirit would be right. You young leaders know the challenge of creating the spirit and the atmosphere for teaching, don't you? Sometimes we work against it. I wish you could have heard the lecture that night. Tremendously powerful. He was so delicate and sensitive not to offend Mormons, understanding our differences. There wasn't anything we couldn't have accepted, particularly as he interpreted some New Testament thinking. His part of the meeting was then concluded, and we opened it for questions. The first hand went up, and I'll never forget the comment. A well-meaning Latter-day Saint said, "Sir, by what authority do you teach all of this?" And one by one, similar questions followed. I finally had to stand up and say, "Folks, we have a guest here tonight. Thank you for understanding."<br><br>We ended on a high note. You Mormons have genius for recovery. You really do. As I drove my friend home that night, I gave him another little talk on the lay nature of the Mormon Church. But I have often thought as I have reflected back on those experiences: If you were a Baptist or a Catholic or a Jew coming from the east coast to California, and you went to the First Methodist Church in Glendale, and then you came to a wonderful only-true-Church ward in Hollywood, which church would you want to join? Now think about it. I appreciate that knowledge and understanding and rationale are vital tools in learning truth. I submit again a very important principle of the gospel--that the Spirit is the revealing force. When the Spirit speaks to the spirit, a person comes to know, and this whole field of courtesy and delight, I think, is the vehicle through which the Spirit tends to move. You know, we all react on a feeling level. Have you ever noticed that?<br><h2><b>Challenge</b></h2><br>So I would challenge you, as you go forth to serve in your wonderful capacities: Remember who you are and what you are. People are watching, and they have a right to watch. My wife, who is a convert to this great Church, has that vast family out there who haven't yet seen the light. They watch us very carefully. They have a right to see that my children are different from other children. They have a right to see that Jeanne and I are doing things that we claim to be true in a way that's different from the other members of their family. And if we don't, then really, by comparison, what do we have?<br><br>God bless you wonderful students. I just testify the gospel is true. I'm glad you are my friends. I love you, I sustain you, I respect you, I honor you, I cherish your association, and I bear witness that you and I really do belong to Christ's church. And he is counting on us to share it in a wonderful way, whether it is in a golf tournament or in a fireside or in a walk across campus. And as the nation looks at this great ball game [with the University of Utah on television], they'll watch very carefully what you do and how you do it. May we have the sense and spirit to be good examples, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<h1>Balance - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
There are many in society who are concerned only with single interests, who judge the merits of candidates and causes on the basis of those single issues. In the Church some have been concerned with one principle or one phase of the gospel over all others. With this background, I have chosen to speak today of the need for a good balance in our lives.<br><br>The wise Job said: "Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity" (Job 31:6).<br><br>As we employ the even balance, so also we shall be judged, for the measure we judge by comes back to judge us.<br><br><i>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</i><br><br><i>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</i>[Matthew 7: 1, 21]<br><h2><b>Protest Off-balance</b></h2><br>There seem to have been many in the last generation whose lives were spent protesting. Perhaps they wanted to do so because they felt repressed or wished to bring about change or perhaps had selfish reasons, thinking that if they tore the house down they might end up with a shingle. Some protesters have said that they did what they did in order to be free--free of traditions, free of morals, free of all of the confining standards of society, unrestrained by government or law. Some have been wildly self-indulgent. Having traveled far down this road, they have found that it is not the road to freedom, but to slavery--as Harry Emerson Fosdick noted, with "habits that bind them, diseases that curse them, and blasted reputations that ruin them" (<span style="color: #00ccff;"><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/james-e-faust_christianity-repression-liberation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Christianity: Repression or Liberation?</i></a></span>).<br><br>Fortunately, most of your generation have escaped this disaster, but there are few who have not been exposed to this philosophy. As a result, the balance in their lives has been somewhat tilted and uneven. Many in society, and even some in this university, expend far too much precious energy in protesting the rules. Since they did not make the rules, some feel that they should not be restricted by them. Others make a game of testing the fences to see what they can get away with. Some think that by breaking the rules somehow they become stronger or more independent. Those who fight the rules spend much time and energy trying to express independence in their attempted quest to find some identity.<br><br>Talents, gifts of expression, and precious time are exhausted in swimming against too many tides. I have no hesitancy to suggest that young men at this university can learn to express themselves better through excellence in the classroom or on the playing field than in the length of their hair. Young ladies can obtain a better identity and receive a better notice by their academic excellence and artistic expression rather than through immodesty of dress.<br><h2><b>Importance of Self-Regulation</b></h2><br>Recently some of us heard that when President Nathan Eldon Tanner was teaching school in Canada, a student reported that at the beginning of the year President Tanner announced to the class, "I am going to teach you only one thing this year," and then he wrote on the blackboard in large letters, "TO THINK."<br><br>Some students who are struggling financially and otherwise understandably chafe under the general education requirements necessary for their degrees and are anxious to get on with the technical education they think they really came for, such as in computer science, engineering, law, or other disciplines which will make their knowledge and skills more marketable. But computers as we know them now will become obsolete. In my life the periodic tables are no longer the same. New things will alter engineering, and the law will change somewhat.<br><br>In part, at least, general education is supposed to teach you how to think and broaden your horizons. In the Doctrine and Covenants we are reminded that we will get into the celestial kingdom through much tribulation. If you think general education has no other advantage, you may put it down to simple tribulation.<br><br>Elliott Richardson, a few weeks ago on this campus, suggested that with reference to too much government regulation, the flip side is to learn and practice more self-regulation. An important part of your education is to learn that you cannot altogether escape the law of the Medes and the Persians in the myriad regulations of the complex society in which we live. Having learned this will be good training to become submissive to the laws of God which are immutable.<br><br>The people asked the Savior, "Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?" (Matthew 22:17). The Savior's response was:<br><br><i>Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</i><br><br><i>And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</i><br><br><i>They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.</i>[Matthew 22:19‚Äì21]<br><h2><b>Help from Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>There are times, however, when each of us has to have the gumption to make a stand as to what we wish to preserve or change in order to maintain our self-respect and not "be a reed shaken with the wind" (Matthew 11:7). I would advise you to make your great stands in life on moral issues, not kicking against the rules of dress or behavior in society, appearing to be eccentric or unbalanced or immature. We lose much credibility and strength and risk being weighed in an uneven balance when, Don Quixote-like, we go around "tilting windmills." There is for all in this audience a transcending blessing available in making the right moral choices, for you can receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost. It is much easier for those who have a righteous balance to yield "to the enticings of the Holy Spirit" (Mosiah 3: 19).<br><br>This way we can leave behind the attributes of the natural man or woman and become someone much more enlightened. Alma counseled his brethren to "contend no more against the Holy Ghost" (Alma 34:38). The gifts of the Holy Ghost have special strengths for those who study and learn: "He shall ... bring all things to your remembrance." Through this marvelous power, "the Comforter ... shall teach you all things" (John 14:26). Another wonderful attribute is that "the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and ... shall flow unto thee forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 121:46).<br><br>How do these marvelous gifts function? Parley P. Pratt stated:<br><br><i>It quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections, and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. ... It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. ... It ... invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens ... and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being.</i>[<i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i>5th ed. (Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1891), pp. 101‚Äì2]<br><br>With persons blessed by these gifts, one enjoys "the light of their countenances," and their presence is "a warm glow of pure gladness and sympathy ... of spirit."<br><h2><b>Help of Humor</b></h2><br>An important part of the gospel message is that we not be too rigid, that we open up our minds, that we develop some tolerance and be not too quick to render judgment. I learned when I was making my living in the arena that we do not always have all of the facts. There always seem to be at least two sides of a question. Everything is not always just black or white. The counsel of the Savior as he instructed his Twelve was, "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16).<br><br>It is not always easy to achieve an appropriate balance. In addition to what we read in the newspapers, we can have brought right into our homes in color most of the problems of an entire world. We also have our own personal ups and downs and challenges. The stresses of life are real and rather constant. There is, however, a defense against much of this. A thoughtful man said, "There is no defense against adverse fortune which is, on the whole, so effectual as an habitual sense of humor" (Thomas Wentworth Higginson, quoted in<i>Dictionary of Thoughts</i>, [Chicago: J. G. Ferguson, 1969], p. 372). Humor is a defense against adversity.<br><br>For many years, as I have blessed newborn children, including my own, I have blessed them with a sense of humor. I did it with the hope that it will help guard them against being too rigid, in the hope that they will have a balance in their lives, in the hope that situations and problems and difficulties will not be overdrawn.<br><br>Many years ago in one of the courtrooms of Utah a divorce case was called for a hearing. One of the participating attorneys, indignant and incensed, took the witness stand to bring forward to the court the fact that the husband and the wife the night before had reconciled and composed their differences. He urged that because of the reconciliation his adversary was unprincipled, unfair, and unethical now to come into court. The judge turned to the other attorney who had been maligned and asked him if he were going to take the witness stand to refute the allegations against his character. The defamed attorney, a wise and experienced counselor, said: "Oh, no, your honor. I'm not going to take that witness stand. He might be able to prove all those allegations against me." The courtroom broke into laughter, the tension was broken, and all things got put into their proper place.<br><br>A sense of humor helps to understand the counsel given by the Savior.<br><br>Good humor is a refining of the heart. Thomas Carlyle stated: "True humor springs not more from the head than from the heart. It is not contempt. Its essence is love. Its issue is not in laughter, but in still smiles which lie far deeper" (Quoted ibid.).<br><br>Abraham Lincoln said: "With the fearful strain that is on me night and day, if I did not laugh I should die" (Quoted ibid.).<br><br>Cultivating good humor may be helpful in finding your identity. Each of you young people is trying to find out who you really are. You can feel your surging powers and strengths, and yet with the many challenges that confront you now and lie ahead of you, you may have some inner concerns with respect to your ability to meet and cope with them. I wish to assure you that you will ride over the bumps and come quicker to your own identity if you cultivate the good humor which comes naturally. A thoughtful man said: "Humor is an affirmation of dignity, a declaration of man's superiority to all that befalls him" (Romain Gary, quoted ibid.).<br><br>It is important to learn to laugh at yourself and poke fun at yourself. One definition of humor is: "Humor is falling downstairs if you do it while in the act of warning your wife not to" (Kenneth Bird, quoted ibid.).<br><br>There is another important dimension of learning to laugh at yourself. It lies in not being afraid to make a mistake. When I was a young bishop, we sought to have a ward choir. We had a good choir because our leader, Brother Alex Anderson, was a good leader. He, however, encouraged the bishop to sing in the choir, at some risk. I felt that as a measure of support for Brother Anderson and the others that I would try to sing with them. Things went from bad to worse. Brother Anderson liked to invite the choir members to improve their talents by singing solos. One Sunday during choir practice he asked that the bishop sing a small solo. I found it very difficult to turn Brother Anderson down in front of the whole choir, when the others who were not very good singers had made a 100 percent effort, so during sacrament meeting the choir sang and I tried. I was literally so frightened and upset that the paper trembled in my hands. I could hardly hold it. I felt embarrassed and I felt humiliated. All of my mask of dignity was gone. After the meeting, as I walked down the aisle, I was met with warm smiles and expressions of understanding and support. Someone said, "Bishop, it surely makes us feel good to see you scared." That day the bishop became more human.<br><br>May we consider for a moment the role of humor and faith. George Barrell Cheever said: "For health and the constant enjoyment of life, give me a keen and ever-present sense of humor. It is the next best thing to an abiding faith in providence" (Quoted ibid.).<br><br>Our leaders have demonstrated that one can enjoy both faith and humor. It is said of Heber C. Kimball that he prayed and conversed with the Lord "as one man talketh to another."<br><br><i>However, on one occasion while offering an earnest appeal on behalf of certain of his fellow creatures he startled the kneeling circle by bursting into a loud laugh in the very midst of his prayer. Quickly regaining his composure and solemn address, he remarked apologetically, "Lord, it makes me laugh to pray about some people."</i>[O. F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball,</i>3rd ed. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), p. 427]<br><br>This sense of humor is retained by his grandson, President Spencer W. Kimball. When Jeffrey Holland was invited into the great room in the north end of the first floor of the Church Office Building, he met there with the First Presidency and was asked to become the president of Brigham Young University. President Holland, in one of the few times I have known it to happen, was somewhat without appropriate words and simply said, "You've got to be kidding." President Kimball responded, "Brother Holland, we don't kid very often in this room."<br><br>A good sense of humor will help us hone our talents. One of the talents which needs to be greatly magnified is a sensitivity to others, and this sensitivity involves reaching out and touching another heart. By learning not to be afraid to laugh at oneself, one is able to stir up the kindred feelings of others. Under the cultivation of the Holy Ghost the talents will be greatly magnified.<br><h2><b>Importance of Enthusiasm</b></h2><br>Elder LeGrand Richards, the great advocate of enthusiasm, would want me to mention the importance of embracing life rather than shrinking from it. A few weeks ago a stake president came in to see me. On the way out he stopped in to see Brother Richards, who was coming to his stake conference in a week or two. He asked, "Brother Richards, how are you?"<br><br>That great apostle said, "Well, president, I will tell you. My body, the house I live in, is getting old and creaky," and then he added, with all ninety-five years of his life testifying, "but the real LeGrand Richards is on fire."<br><br>It is now time to conclude lest I fall into the error of the speaker referred to by President Bryant S. Hinckley, the father of Elder Gordon B. Hinckley. President Hinckley related:<br><br><i>A garrulous speaker at a banquet had talked on and on until the guests could not suppress their yawns. The irritated toastmaster raised his gavel, intending to rap for order. He brought it down and in place of hitting the table he struck a man next to him, who had stooped to pick up his napkin, right on top of his bald pate and knocked him unconscious. They administered restoratives and when he began to revive they asked him how he felt. He said, "I hear him still talking, hit me again."</i>(<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1929, p. 16.)<br><br>Many, I expect all, within the sound of my voice have many talents, and are great, but you don't know yet how great you will be. This greatness will come in the achieving of balance and wisdom and understanding. Balance in a large measure is knowing of the things that can be changed and prioritized, and recognizing and accepting the things that will not change. Much of the rest in obtaining sound balance lies in attitude.<br><br>I leave with you my blessings. I want you to know that I know that God lives, that the Lord Jesus guides President Kimball and the leaders of this Church, which is the restoration of all things through Joseph Smith and his successors, and I leave you this witness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E.

<h1>Love of God and of All Men:&quot; Help for Refugees - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
A week ago this evening I was in Osaka in rather pleasant weather, which was a relief because the weekend before we were in Sapporo with snow above our haircuts, and falling all the time. In between I was in Hong Kong, where we now live, where the moisture content of the air that day was 95. This is March; summer is coming.<br><br>Someone asked me, "How is it in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia?"<br><br>I said, "Well, in the summertime it is a bit monotonous until the typhoons come, but it is pleasant to be back here because, while it is very, very hot in the summer, it is not so hot the rest of the year."<br><br>You really do look good to me, and it's a very great pleasure to be here at BYU in the great state of Utah as conference approaches and to feel the exciting spirit of this part of the world at this time of year. I would like you to know, too, how deeply we are committed to and how very greatly we love the people of Southeast Asia with whom we are honored to work--and the nations of that part of the world, which certainly comprise one of the most vital and significant groups of nations on earth and where much of great importance to the kingdom of God is occurring.<br><br>When I was invited to fill this appointment this morning, I began to reflect on the diversity of possible topics and on my limitations in treating them, and I thought of the famous medallion of Montaigne which was struck in 1576. On one side of the medallion he had inscribed, "Que sais-je?"--"What do I know?" and on the other side, "Je m'abstiens"--"I exercise restraint." With those reflections came to mind certain matters which engender many questions and which seem timely and appropriate. Since I do have deep convictions on these issues, I will mention in mini-sermon two of them and will speak also of a third.<br><h2><b>Revelation</b></h2><br>Revelation is a continuing fundamental principle of the kingdom. With all its meaning and ramifications, that great principle forms the foundation of the structure of the restored church, the restored gospel, the restored priesthood, and the ongoing and future rolling forth of the kingdom. What I know about revelation comes from the scriptures, and those scriptures are, I believe, very plain.<br><br>I am grateful for section 28 of the Doctrine and Covenants, for instance, which teaches vital truths about revelation: One, there is one man--the prophet, seer and revelator who holds the active keys--who alone speaks for the Lord to the whole Church in making any new doctrinal statement. Any revelation or commandment for the Church will come through the President of the Church. As I understand it, no other person has any authority to make such a statement unless directed by the prophet to do so. This would include conclusive doctrinal declarations in matters where varying opinions have been held by leaders of the Church and where no such declaration has been made by the President of the Church, and certainly where announcement has been made by him that the Church has taken no official position on such an issue.<br><br>In the great revelation recorded in section 28, Oliver Cowdery, who enjoyed a close relationship with and position alongside the Prophet Joseph in many of the marvelous moments of our beginnings in modern times, was taught by the Lord what all of us are to understand--that we are to teach for doctrine that which has been revealed by God through those who have been commissioned to reveal it, and that there is one man on the earth at a time so commissioned.<br><br>Point two: Oliver was told to "declare faithfully" the revealed word. If he wrote his own views, he was to write by wisdom and not by commandment so that his personal writings were to represent his personal wisdom. What he had heard from the prophet he was to teach as revelation through the prophet, but his own writings were to be by his own wisdom.<br><br>Thus, there is a prophet who is the revelator for the Lord to the Church, and there are those called to declare that which has been revealed. Oliver Cowdery was also taught that in his mission to the Lamanites, he had the promise of the blessing of the revelation of God's will to him in that specific calling. That is that third great principle: that each of us, in our own calling and in our individual life, is entitled to and may receive the revelation of the will of God.<br><br>Now, there is much more in the first seven verses of section 43, which reiterate the first of those principles. In section 50 there is magnificent instruction about how we know when one who is teaching is teaching by the Spirit of the Lord. We must have that same Spirit to really know, and then there will be mutual edification and enlightenment. And in section 68 is the declaration to a number of missionaries relating to what they said under the influence of the Spirit.<br><br>I simply wish to declare that I believe that God has revealed that which is basic in the establishment of the kingdom; that he now reveals, as his prophets have declared, much of importance; and that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of God. When he does, it will be through his prophet, seer, and revelator. That is my understanding of the doctrine.<br><h2><b>Forgiveness</b></h2><br>Briefly, to another subject. A letter came just the other day from a wonderful young man who had made a mistake for which he had sincerely and sorely and lengthily repented. But he was awaiting some kind of special sign that he was forgiven. Though his life was in order--is in order--and he has everything to be grateful for and to work with and so much to contribute, he is languishing, his energies mitigated, because he doesn't know that the Lord has forgiven him. To him I declare again what I learn in the scriptures: that God forgives the penitent sinner, and that he will not only<i>forgive</i>but<i>forget</i>and never mention those sins of which we have sincerely repented (see D&amp;amp;C 58:42‚Äì43). And that's what I know about repentance. We are not to pine away our lives in endless, enervating regret. We are to consecrate our lives in gratitude to a God who loved us so much that, in contemplation of our need, he sent his Only Begotten Son to live and die for us, and in gratitude to that Son who loves us so much that he paid the price of Gethsemane, the price of Calvary. There is no wisdom or strength in a condition that keeps us from making our contribution because we have made a mistake sometime, if we have truly and honestly repented. Nothing is more clear to me in the records than that.<br><h2><b>"Exclusionary Clauses" and More</b></h2><br>Then there is a third theme I wish to mention. Someone has written commenting on the so-called "exclusionary clauses." Is it really necessary that we believe these "exclusionary clauses," which must have reference to the ordinances of the gospel: "Except ye be baptized, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven," and the other ordinances which relate to the unfolding of our eternal opportunities? Now, again it seems to me very clear what the revelations teach us concerning the meaning and importance of these "exclusionary clauses." Are they really necessary? Isn't it enough if we are wholesome, genial, Christian in the broad sense of being selfless and generous? I read from section 52, a revelation given to the elders of the Church in Kirtland, the language of which is instructive and clear:<br><br><i>Wherefore, he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</i><br><br><i>He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 52:15‚Äì16]<br><br>In many ways and in many instances in the holy records, the emphasis and clarification are given. The last chapter of the book of 2 Nephi has the testimony of that great prophet as he finished his work. He had learned compassion and consideration and kindness and all the other qualities generally thought of as Christian. But note the summation of his conviction:<br><br><i>I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.</i><br><br><i>I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean them from whence I came.</i><br><br><i>I also have charity for the Gentiles.</i><br><br>[Now charity is interpreted in the record as the "pure love of Christ." Here is the declaration of Nephi that he has that feeling for his own people, for the Jew, and for the gentile.]<br><br><i>But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the straight path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.</i>[2 Nephi 33:7‚Äì9]<br><br>As we read the scriptures, we discover what is meant by the "gate" and the "straight path."<br><br><i>For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</i>[2 Nephi 31:17]<br><br>In 2 Nephi 9 and 10, that is further explained. What does it mean to be reconciled to Christ? The answer is, To obey the ordinances; then there is more. Now it is the<i>more</i>to which I would like to refer. I believe in and declare my knowledge and conviction of the importance of the so-called "exclusionary clauses." These ordinances are announced as essential, indispensable. We believe that and we practice that and we announce that to the world. That's the missionary theme. But is that all? Again the answers are very clear in scripture. I would suspect that all or most of you would be interested in turning to 2 Nephi 31 and reading what must accompany entrance at the gate. This great chapter has taught the reasons for, the explanation for, the baptism of the Lord himself (2 Nephi 31:5 to 10 or 11, and so forth)--the meaning of Christ's statement that this he did to "fulfill all righteousness." Then the "gate" and the "straight and narrow path" are identified, and these words follow:<br><br><i>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this straight and narrow path, I would ask if all is done. Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, you must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 31:19‚Äì20]<br><br>How do we express this steadfastness, the brightness of hope, the love of God and all men? Again, the Lord has answered clearly and repeatedly in the record. One well-known answer is in chapter 34 of the book of Alma, where, after prayer and faith are discussed in detail, the prophet declares:<br><br><i>And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is in vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</i>[Alma 34:28]<br><br>We might turn again and again to passages in all the standard works that teach us that one requisite of forgiveness, one essential in salvation, is this continuing sacrificial service to God's other children, in the name of Christ. To me, it is his most moving personal message beyond the declaration of his own sonship and his own purpose in life declared through the record:<br><br><i>Behold, ... I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.</i><br><br><i>And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; ... that as I have been lifted up ... even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</i>[3 Nephi 27:13‚Äì14]<br><br>In application of that purpose in our lives he gave us the magnificent parable and story of the King, and those on the right hand, and those on the left. We have heard it often. In these verses he speaks of the hungry, of the thirsty, of the naked, of the homeless, of they who are ill and in prison. And everyone in the room, I suspect, knows the conclusion of that marvelous story:<br><br><i>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:40]<br><br>That isn't the end, however, of the story in Matthew 25. It goes on to talk about those on the left hand who shall be banished from his presence, and the same categories of need and the needy are listed: the hungry, the naked, the thirsty, the stranger, those who are ill, those who are in prison. And the conclusion is:<br><br><i>Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it not unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:45]<br><br>That seems so plain and so personal. Protestations of commitment and testimony which do not comprehend compassionate, considerate, selfless service to our fellowmen, real service beyond eye-pleasing and lip-serving, are not testimonies that are broad enough or real enough.<br><h2><b>Help for Southeast Asia's Refugees</b></h2><br>Now, that's a rather long introduction to something I want to tell you about that you may not know about. You may not know that, in addition to having some wonderfully good ball teams about which we have heard, you have some other teams representing you. In Phanat Nikhom in the province of Chon Buri, not too many miles from the Gulf of Thailand and about 100 miles from Bangkok, twelve remarkable young ladies, most of them graduates of this university, are presently charged with the responsibility of cultural orientation in a camp for refugees in transit to new countries. These twelve--and a mature couple who are their liaison with governments living in Bangkok--have done and are doing a remarkable work. You may have read a little about it in the<i>Church News</i>a week ago. If you did not, please do.<br><br>They won't be honored by any great public notoriety, but they are doing something which in the aggregate and in the historical perspective may be far more important than anything even the good ball teams of this university are doing or will do. These twelve are meeting refugees at that critical moment when they are in transit, some of them for months, many for years, waiting to get home again--a home, not their former home; that's gone.<br><br>There are a few things about refugees one ought to know. Not the numbers--I have them, and they are staggering (about half a million to this country in recent times; hundreds of thousands along the borders still--many hopeless). The refugees are not undesirable or weak people. Sometimes we get the notion they are different from us. They are different, all right, in that they have lost substantially everything we hold dear. But they are not different in their aspirations and their intelligence and their ties with families and their emotions and their desires. They can never go home again. Their home isn't there; the street isn't there; the people aren't there; their loved ones aren't there, and very frequently they are not with them either. They are casualties of war.<br><br>The refugee story ordinarily is a story of strength, of courage, of character, very frequently of a willingness to stand up for what one believes and to lay one's life on the line for it.<br><br>Well, our great young ladies are in that refugee camp teaching many hours every day--cultural orientation, some crash English, but fundamentally they are teaching people how to live, how to cope with a certain amount of grace in the new country of which they know so little. They are frightened. One of the tender moments of my life--and I will not forget it while God grants me memory of anything--was to watch a young lady whose home is in this valley and who attended this school take a little brown baby from his mother's arms, hold him tenderly, kiss the baby, and then gently, lovingly, lay the child down on a little carpet on which a diaper had been placed. She finished the operation, the first time the baby had ever worn a diaper in his life. The mother and the others watched with great eagerness, adoringly, as if in the presence of the Lord himself, and I felt that way. A little later we went from the large teaching shed to the compounds where they live, and there again the process was repeated, this time for a smaller group. You see, many of these great folks haven't had the kind of experiences that would equip them for the simplest kind of understanding of life in this country. They don't know how to get on an airplane. I went in one of the big teaching sheds there where our young ladies were teaching them about the journey they were soon to make. The refugees came to class carrying bundles under their arms, representing their baggage. They passed by three tables where attendants stood. All had been instructed carefully in what to do. One table represented the airlines counter, and they had to present a piece of paper as a ticket. They were excited, giggling; they were pale and frightened. Tentatively they put forward their tickets. The attendant took the ticket, tore a piece off, and gave them a part back. They went then to "Immigration" and to the folks who inspected their baggage. Then they sat in rows on the concrete floor while they were shown signs that said "No Smoking" and "Fasten Your Seat Belt," etc. They had never seen any of that before. They didn't know about food on a tray or stewardesses or going to the bathroom. They were taught gently, lovingly, genially.<br><br>They sometimes have to be taught through two interpreters because there are many languages and they are difficult. One interpreter may speak English and Khmer, another Khmer and Laotian but no English. To reach the Laotians, our folks must speak to the first Khmer, who translates to the second Khmer, who teaches the Laotians. But it works! All day long these heroines of ours are patiently teaching, preparing, helping, blessing, and they are doing it in accordance with strict rules against proselyting in refugee camps. That is difficult for them, but things are happening that indicate what kind of a fallout there will be one day when these good people who are leaving in large numbers every week fan out across the earth. We faithfully keep the commitment that we shall not proselyte in terms of our specific church convictions, and yet what happens is a thrill. Let me share one or two simple instances.<br><br>Here's a letter from one of these young ladies that gives an idea of what it's all about:<br><br><i>Good things are happening at Phanat Nikhom. Some of us had a very special experience yesterday that Sister Edmonds asked me to write and share with you. We were walking down a road in the Holding Center. In the distance we saw a small group of people walking toward us. A little girl bolted out from the group, running toward us with outstretched arms. She stopped. She was so very cute. I bent down to take her in my arms and give her a big hug. I held her, and we tried to talk to her while the rest of the group joined us. We talked with the mother in Cantonese and learned that these were Vietnamese who just arrived three days ago from another camp. The little girl was five years old and had never seen Westerners before, yet, as her mother said, she so joyously welcomed us. Later we were talking with a Catholic father who is a wonderful man working in these camps. I said, "It's easy for us to feel so strongly about these wonderful people, these refugees." I told him about the experience we had just had with the little Vietnamese girl. He stopped me. He said, "That proves my point about you girls. She wouldn't have done that to volunteers from any of these other fine agencies. She could see that you are different."</i><br><br>And with this our lovely representative finishes:<br><br><i>I am so happy that I can be here sharing with these precious people. I'm glad the light of the gospel helps us to be different. Thank you for your prayers and support.</i><br><br>I want to give you perhaps two other examples of hundreds that reflect not so much the tremendously hard work, the tremendous sacrifices being made there by our folks, but the consequences of them. Here is a short paragraph from another letter:<br><br><i>Today in the Hmong orientation class</i>[and you'll recognize that the Hmong and the Yaos are hill tribes from Cambodia or Kampuchea]<i>I saw wealth and poverty--a wealth of creativity in a child making up games to play with two sets of rubber thongs and poverty of education in a grandmother who struggled to copy the words to the children's song, "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes" by starting at the last line at the bottom of the page and working her way up. Her eyes went up to the board and down to her page many times for each letter she formed with her pen. We have discovered that some of these wonderful women cannot count even to ten in their own or any other language. So much to do. We are thankful for this opportunity to be useful.</i><br><br>Yet, some of these folks are professionals. They have sophisticated education and experience. And our young ladies must meet time variances. Some are there for two weeks, some for many months. Some go through the teaching process a number of times, some are there only a few hours. And from early in the morning until late at night, our folks are teaching others to teach and are themselves teaching great numbers of these people in need.<br><br>I suppose out of all these letters the one that may touch you as much as any, or at least did me, is the one about Christmas. They were teaching about holidays.<br><br><i>We had a good time discussing Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day, but when we talked about the Savior, the spirit in the room changed at the mention of his name. I talked about what death really is, just a separation of the body and the spirit and how after resurrection they can't ever be separated again. As I talked about a perfect body, the concepts of pain, hunger, suffering all seemed to be mitigated. They have suffered so much. How much more joyous the resurrection will be to them than to us! We talked of sorrow and rejection and persecution--all real things to them. It was wonderful to teach the truth and offer hope. And then we came to Christmas. We had spoken of Santa Claus and snow and Christmas trees, and then one of them wanted to know why the star was a symbol of Christmas, so I shared the Christmas story with them, and they loved it. They don't understand words like</i>manger<i>or</i>And it came to pass,<i>so I had to use vocabulary words they could relate to. A stable is a place where the animals live; a manger is what the animals eat out of. "Wasn't it dirty?" they wanted to know. "Yes, but they cleaned it out and put some straw in it." A shepherd is a man who takes care of sheep. There was no room in the inns; even though the woman was going to have a baby very soon, no one would give her a place to sleep. The story came alive to me. And at the end they said, "Why, that sounds like a refugee story. Do you have some pictures of it? And no one knew who that baby was, did they? Because if they did, they would have gladly given up their own beds." These words have haunted me: "And no one knew who they were." That's my own feeling about the refugees. If we only knew who they are, we would do anything for them. But not many know, and so many seem not to care. So they suffer and remain here, obscure, despised, ignored, rejected, homeless, hungry, mocked.</i><br><br>I have to add this one. They were teaching a class of young people. A young boy told them about a high school French teacher in one of the countries from which they came.<br><br><i>During one of the late political regimes, she had been unfairly punished. She had watched vicious things and suffered vicious things and had sworn that she would never again utter another word to anyone as long as she lived. She had kept her vow since 1975, even during the time she and her mother walked clear across Cambodia to Thailand. She and her mother had been unable to obtain entrance to a third country since she would not talk. No amount of coaxing or threatening would bring her out.</i><br><br>One of our returned Thai missionaries who is helping in the camp found the young teacher, knelt by her, took her hand in hers, and said hello. The teacher answered! Her first words in six years, to one she had never before seen. A spirit of love reached her heart.<br><br><i>Benja returns to work with her each day. Now she has cut her hair and has enrolled in a basic English class. She talks every day. She is going to get to go to a new country with her mother.</i><br><br>I have scores of these incidents recorded. Let me add one more. They were singing with some of the youngsters. This group happened to be Vietnamese. There were Khmers and Laotians and Hmongs and Yaos also and occasionally some others--an amalgam of Indochina.<br><br><i>We noticed that one of these Vietnamese boys was singing along with us on the chorus of "I Am a Child of God." We thought, "He surely does learn fast." But as we went to leave, he said, "I know that song. Do you know this one too?" Then he hummed "Love at Home." He told us that he learned these songs from a Protestant group in Saigon in 1975. We then sang "Love at Home" with him. Then we asked if he knew it in Vietnamese so that the other children would be able to understand the words. He sang it with such emotion and his lip quivered. We wondered if he had been part of a family when he had learned it. It was beautiful. We asked him what the words meant, and he replied in broken English, "All the world is good when there is love at my house." After talking with him a little more, he told us that the young men who taught him the songs wore funny clothes--white shirts and ties.</i><br><br>He was obviously one of the youngsters then ten or eleven taught by the missionaries in Vietnam before they were pulled out.<br><br>I wanted you to know what I suspect few of you have known--that, through the work of a magnificent team of about 1,500 missionaries in Southeast Asia, miracles are happening amidst some of the most colorful political and economic complexities the world knows. With all the deprivation and all the problems and all the masses of humanity, the kingdom of God grows. Sister Hanks and I just came back from two weeks in India with President Talmage Jones and his wife, who live in Singapore and who have had added to their extensive vicinage the land of India to go with Singapore and Indonesia and Malaysia. We had such sobering and sweet experiences.<br><br>Let me attempt to tie together everything I have said by telling you about one man. He knocked on the door of our hotel in Hyderabad, having heard we were coming. The room was getting crowded. Two other men had arrived a few minutes before. They had come 600 km in an ancient bus from their home in Andhra Predesh in South India, riding all night, because they had heard that some Church leaders were going to be in Hyderabad. I was talking with the two brothers when the third man arrived. He brought with him his son. He is a professor, his son a lawyer. They had found a tract through someone who had known about the Church and had obtained a copy of the Book of Mormon. Now this man and his sons, all professionals, are ready and anxious to join the Church, pleading for that privilege. We have no one there to teach them; we are not permitted in that great land to have any missionaries presently, and so we were unable to baptize them. I am confident that we will find ways to help them. We are pleading with the Lord, and we are seeking answers, and there will be ways; but for now these people are coming singly or in groups with the same message, pleading for baptism. We must find a way. This is what this man desired. He had written a document in which he acknowledged that he had need of repentance and declared that he had sorely repented.<br><br>He declared his convictions about the Lord Jesus Christ and the Prophet Joseph Smith and the priesthood and the kingdom and the gospel plan. His Book of Mormon was marked on every page, annotated on every page with cross-references to the Bible and to the Doctrine and Covenants. I read one of his annotations and tried to explain, in tenderness of heart, why we needed to have a chance to help teach them, because he had misread a scripture and had written an incorrect doctrine in his margin. His answer to that was to hand me this document in which he was pleading for baptism. He had two references to the scriptures, both of which happened to be loved passages, favorites of mine. But consider what he was saying (he's been waiting many months): "I know I must not ask for the priesthood, but what must I do to become acceptable to the Lord and to be received by baptism?" These are the two verses. I read from Isaiah 30:<br><br><i>And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him ....</i><br><br><i>... Thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</i><br><br><i>And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:</i><br><br><i>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</i>[Isaiah 30:18‚Äì21]<br><br>The other reference he handed me was to section 108 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which the Lord comforts his servant, Lyman Sherman, with these words:<br><br><i>Your sins are forgiven you, because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed.</i><br><br>Brother Samuels had come 100 miles.<br><br><i>Therefore, let your soul be at rest concerning your spiritual standing, and resist no more my voice.</i><br><br><i>And arise up and be more careful henceforth in observing your vows, which you have made and do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great blessings.</i><br><br><i>Wait patiently until the solemn assembly shall be called of my servants, then you shall be remembered with the first of mine elders, and receive right by ordination with the rest of mine elders whom I have chosen.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is the promise of the Father unto you if you continue faithful.</i><br><br><i>And it shall be fulfilled unto you in that day that you shall have right to preach my gospel wheresoever I shall send you, from henceforth from that time.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 108:1‚Äì6]<br><br>Then a beautiful verse about strengthening the brethren.<br><br>We went to a meeting in a little schoolhouse, and all testified, each in turn. One of the brothers stood, dressed in his Indian white, and bore as sweet a testimony as I expect to hear on this earth. He is a young teacher with two college degrees. He concluded: "We don't demand; we ask. What must we do to be worthy to receive baptism?" Then his brother stood. I was a little worried about his brother because he is a preacher, and he might be thought to be a little less well grounded in some ways. I will quote verbatim what he said, quietly, humbly, tearfully:<br><br><i>The child is father to the man. If we are not worthy to be members of God's kingdom, are our little children not acceptable to him? It is for them we plead.</i><br><br>I wish to say to you who have served afar and you who have committed in your hearts--not all go afar and perhaps not all are committed--that among you there ought to be a special sense of delight to know that the Church in the far reaches of this world--in camps in Thailand, others in Hong Kong and the Philippines--is represented, the Church as an institution, by people who carry our name, the banner of the Lord, and who, with graciousness and high skill, with the Spirit of the Lord, and with a sense of sacrificial commitment that is still a bit rare in the world, are doing what the Lord wants done for those who are hungry, thirsty, naked, homeless, ill, in prison. Think of them, pray for them. They are just like you, but they are imbued with a special sense of commitment because they have a special historical mission. It is the Church, it is Christ they are representing. You will be pleased to know that the funds on which they operate are all volunteer funds, donated funds. Your senior class last year gave $20,000, the largest single contribution. That's why I thought you ought to hear what is going on.<br><br>God bless you to have a sense of personal responsiveness to what the Lord has for us, wants from us, permits us to give. I would like you to know that I know with every capacity of my being that what is happening is good and sweet and pure and Christlike, and I am very proud and grateful to God--in the right sense proud--that I have lived long enough to see us moving in a way that will not be misunderstood--it will be understood--and of which we can be appropriately proud. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marion D.

<h1>me, Listen to a Prophet&#039;s Voice&quot; - Yoshihiko Kikuchi - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I pray that the Spirit of the Lord will guide me so that I can say the things that I have in my mind and heart. It is indeed a great privilege for me to stand before you today in this great institution built upon the foundation of the true restored gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and dedicated to the propagation of knowledge. I consider it an honor to speak to you especially, the Lord's elite, the leaders of the future and the future leaders of the world.<br><br>Today I would like to relate the stories of two great leaders who showed faith and courage in obeying the voice of the Lord. And then, I would like to issue an invitation to each of you to listen to the voice of the prophet, President Spencer W. Kimball, the mouthpiece for the Lord, and to obey his voice as he has directed us and continues to direct us to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others.<br><h2><b>Nephi's Leadership</b></h2><br>The first story comes from the Book of Mormon. Lehi's and Ishmael's families had left Jerusalem and had been sojourning in the wilderness and they "did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness" (1 Nephi 17:1). The scriptures tell us that "notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all" (1 Nephi 17:6).<br><br>Each of you sisters here today, suppose that you are Nephi's wife and you brethren that you are Nephi. You have left Jerusalem and have been sojourning in the wilderness for the space of many days, months, and years, even eight years. "Our women did bear children in the wilderness" (1 Nephi 17:1). Without sufficient sanitary supplies, water, medications, and other necessary aids, many children were born.<br><br>Not only that, but while they were in the wilderness they "did live upon raw meat" (1 Nephi 17:2). Can you imagine saying to your daughter, "Sarah, here is your dinner of raw meat"; or to your son, "Matthew, here is some raw meat for your dinner tonight"?<br><br>Can you imagine the sufferings and afflictions that you are facing in the wilderness?<br><br>But the scripture tells us that "so great were the blessings of the Lord upon" them that they "began to bear their journeyings without murmurings" (1 Nephi 17:2).<br><br>And because of their great faith in following the commandments given by the Lord, he said unto them:<br><br><i>I will make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;</i><br><br><i>And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land.</i>[1 Nephi 17:12‚Äì13]<br><br>The prophet Nephi said that--<br><br><i>if . . .the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.</i>[1 Nephi 17:3]<br><br>When they finally reached the seashore, of course, they "were exceedingly rejoiced," and they called the sea Irreantum, and they called the place "Bountiful, because of its much fruit and honey" (1 Nephi 17:5).<br><br>They finally thought that they were settled there, but--<br><br><i>it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters.</i>[1 Nephi 17:7‚Äì8]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I feel very strongly that we do have similar challenges--or invitations--given by the Lord to us today as a Church, as individuals, through President Kimball to share the gospel with all the world as well as with our neighbors.<br><br>Nephi could have said to the Lord, "Send me back to Jerusalem where I can find many hands to help me, tools to use, and much wood with which to construct a big ship." Without saws, hammers, nails, lumber--all he had was a broken bow--instead of responding negatively, he sought to obey the Lord's will, saying:<br><br><i>Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?</i>[1 Nephi 17:9]<br><br>Of course the Lord revealed his will:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.</i>[1 Nephi 17:10]<br><br>And Nephi made a bellows with which to blow the fire, and he made tools from the ore which he melted out of the rock. But the prophet Nephi had his greatest opposition from his older brothers, as you know.<br><br><i>And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.</i>[1 Nephi 17:17]<br><br>They continued murmuring against him:<br><br><i>And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered these afflictions.</i>[1 Nephi 17:20]<br><br><i>And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord.</i>[1 Nephi 17:18]<br><br>But Nephi, as you know, replied to them:<br><br><i>Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel, would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?</i><br><br><i>Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage?. . .</i><br><br><i>The waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither and they passed through on dry ground. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, who were the armies of Pharaoh.</i>[1 Nephi 17:23‚Äì24, 26‚Äì27]<br><br>And so Nephi obeyed the Lord, built the ship, and carried his people to the promised land--in spite of the opposition of his brothers and the difficulties he encountered.<br><h2><b>Enoch's Leadership</b></h2><br>I want to relate another story. In the book of Moses, chapter 7, we read:<br><br><i>And the Lord said unto me: Go to this people, and say unto them--Repent, lest I come out and smite them with a curse, and they die.</i><br><br><i>And he gave unto me a commandment that I should baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, which is full of grace and truth, and of the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that Enoch continued to call upon all the people, save it were the people of Canaan, to repent;</i><br><br><i>And so great was the faith of Enoch, that he led the people of God, . . .and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him. . . .</i><br><br><i>The fear of the Lord was upon all nations, so great was the glory of the Lord, which was upon his people. And the Lord blessed the land, and they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them [spiritually or physically].</i><br><br><i>And Enoch continued his preaching in righteousness unto the people of God. And it came to pass in his days, that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion.</i>[Moses 7:10‚Äì13, 17‚Äì19]<br><br>Oh, what great faith Enoch had! Not only was Enoch's faith great, but the people of Enoch were also very humble themselves. "They were of one heart and one mind and dwelt in righteousness." Therefore, there were no spiritually and physically poor among them.<br><h2><b>Our Prophet's Leadership</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, the Lord has commanded us in this day, through our living prophet, to teach the gospel to all the people, to go into all the world, and to "baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>In one of our Church hymns we sing:<br><br><i>Come, listen to a prophet's voice,</i><br><i>And hear the word of God,</i><br><i>And in the way of truth rejoice,</i><br><i>And sing for joy aloud;</i><br><br><i>We've found the way the prophets went,</i><br><i>Who lived in days of yore;</i><br><i>Another prophet now is sent</i><br><i>This knowledge to restore.</i><br>[<i>Hymns</i>, no. 46]<br><br>What strength we add to our testimonies as we see the Lord's guiding hand in his great church and in the preparation of his prophet, even Spencer W. Kimball.<br><br>I say to all of you today,<br><br><i>Come, listen to a prophet's voice, . . .</i><br><i>For God has shown his face [again]. . . .</i><br><i>The Savior to his people saith,</i><br><i>"Let all my words obey."</i><br>[<i>Hymns</i>, no. 46]<br><br>"Let all my words obey." They--<br><br><i>who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who spake as they were inspired by the gift of the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of him in all things, should have eternal life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 20:26]<br><br>President Kimball, the living prophet, teaches us many things, such as:<br><br>The sacred mission of Jesus Christ<br>The purpose of life<br>Eternal marriage and how to have a truly happy married life<br>Family influences<br>How to have a full and abundant life<br>Family preparedness, and<br>How to fortify our homes against the evils of the world.<br><br>He teaches us:<br><br>Faith<br>Forgiveness<br>Repentance<br>Obedience<br>Cleanliness<br>Reverence<br>Righteous living<br>To follow the commandments of the Lord<br>To honor the Sabbath<br>The meaning of the sacrament<br>Truth<br>Salvation<br>The importance of:<br>Children<br>Scripture study<br>Genealogy<br>Temple work<br>Keeping a journal<br>Honoring the priesthood<br>Priesthood responsibilities<br>The Relief Society organization<br>Welfare services<br>Loving one another<br>Service<br>Labor<br>Gardening<br>Filling Church assignments, and so on.<br><br>He teaches us about our most important personal Liahona. And the list goes on and on.<br><br>Oh, how I believe the words of Elder Thomas S. Monson, who said:<br><br><i>I believe the Church has never had a person more oriented toward spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ than President Spencer W. Kimball. This has been true throughout his entire life. . . .He truly has the missionary spirit. The impact of his dynamics as a missionary-oriented person, his long experience, and the call through him as the Lord's Prophet, Seer, and Revelator have set in motion factors which have resulted in one of the greatest upsurges in missionary work that we have ever seen.</i>["Status Report on Missionary Work,"<i>Ensign</i>, October 1977, p. 8]<br><br>In order for all of us to be prepared in righteousness to come and dwell with the Lord in a city of holiness, we must follow the prophet's voice. Let us heed President Kimball's example and do our part in the missionary cause.<br><br>Regarding member missionary work, President Kimball recently said that it is--<br><br><i>not simply left to our discretion and pleasure. Every man and woman should return home from this conference with a determination that they will take the gospel to their relatives and their families. If they do not, they must consider that they are not in the total favor of their Heavenly Father, because he commanded us to do so!</i><br><br><i>To some extent we have been bypassing our neighbors. There are millions of great, wonderful Protestants, Catholics, and others, and they want it just the same. They may not know what they want, but they want it just the same. And you and I only can give it to them. The gospel is without price.</i>[Auckland, New Zealand, Area Conference, 1980]<br><br>President Kimball further stated:<br><br><i>One of the highest forms of Christian service is to share the gospel because with its acceptance come so many other blessings. There is a special accountability to receive the oracles of God, the authoritative counsel from God's oracles.</i><br><br><i>And all they who receive the oracles of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation, thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains descend upon their house</i>(D&amp;amp;C 90:5).<br><br>And he continued:<br><br><i>I am concerned with all that has been written and all that has been said. Many of our people are still hard of hearing and seemingly unwilling to make the effort to proselyte their neighbors. . . .</i><br><br><i>We are busy people, but we must remember a heavy responsibility has been placed upon us. We must not expect the way to be easy. We must not expect to grow without some obstacles.</i><br><br><i>We must remember what a development comes to us as we teach (share) the gospel. Perhaps almost more comes to us than to them. We know, of course, there are disappointments and many people will not accept.</i>[Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976, p. 4]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, it is our great need, great desire, great dream, and great obsession to bring this everlasting light, which is the gospel of the Lord, to the people of the world, this<br><br><i>candle of understanding to light the way out of obscurity and darkness. Our message is to bring light into the world, and our charge to convert the people of the world to accept the truth.</i>[Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976, p. 1]<br><br>On 3 April 1975, President Kimball charged the members of the Church with the following:<br><br><i>Members must be finders. . . . Members should shoulder this responsibility. Every member knows nonmembers he or she can refer to the missionaries. Every father, mother, and youth in this Church should share the gospel by giving a Book of Mormon by telling the account of the Prophet Joseph Smith, or by inviting our acquaintances to a special meeting.</i>[Regional Representative Seminar, 30 September 1976]<br><h2><b>A Missionary Story</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, may I just share with you a wonderful and beautiful story. Brother Isogai is 17 years old, and right before I left for this conference trip to Salt Lake, he passed on to me his conversion story, which I want to share with you today.<br><br><i>My family consists of three members. We are now living in our grandparents' home because two years ago my parents got divorced. Since then our grandfather and my mother started working to support us. Some time in October 1979, I met the missionaries on the street near Shibuya station. I studied and I was baptized, and I became inactive following my baptism.</i><br><br><i>Since my family was not stable, I was not happy, and I wondered about my future, though I was baptized--about my life, about my family. I wondered, I wondered, I wondered every day. And one day I wandered through Shibuya again. I was feeling depressed. With the feeling of depression and emptiness in my heart, I was walking toward a church without conscious direction. While there, I attended a beautiful baptism service. I was very impressed and inspired by it. I decided to come back to the Church, which I did.</i><br><br><i>I learned of the importance of the missionary work, and I helped the missionaries, and I did this particularly almost every day. I went to the street with the missionaries. And I contacted many people. One day I had been praying, and I received a strong feeling that I should teach my own family. I had baptized seven of my friends within two months. So I started to introduce the gospel to my family. First, I thought I should introduce it to my mother. My mother has many friends, and she was attending another Christian church. Because of that, she refused to be baptized. But because of the beautiful fellowshipping and the cooperation of the missionaries, I finally did baptize her. Then, we went into the temple during the open house for the Tokyo Temple. When we saw the sealing room, we all cried because we knew that we could be together for all eternity, and we have decided to go to that sacred spot again. My sister got baptized September 11, and I felt so strongly I should introduce to my grandparents the gospel, which I did. Now, they have studied and believe, and they are ready to be baptized next Saturday, this Saturday. And I will baptize them. Oh, what a great blessing I receive.</i><br><h2><b>Our Missionary Challenge</b></h2><br>Brothers and sisters, this is one just simple example, but just at the close of my talk I want to share the essence of why the members of the Church should be involved in the missionary work so aggressively and why the Brethren of the Church ask us to involve ourselves in the missionary work. Brother Monson put it so beautifully:<br><br><i>The eternal truth is: that which we willingly share, we keep; and that which we selfishly keep to ourselves, we lose. We care because we want all of our members elsewhere to be happy. Is there any better reason?</i>["Status Report on Missionary Work,"<i>Ensign</i>, October 1977, p. 8]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, direction is so clear. Now you are studying in the most beautiful and most profound and the most inspired institution that you can find anywhere in the world. You are the leaders of the Church, and you are the leaders of the nation, and you are the leaders of the world. And you are the saviors of the world.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, let's heed the words of the prophet and all become humble people like the City of Enoch, so that we can involve ourselves in the missionary work, in a humble way so that we can dwell in righteousness, in the city of holiness, even Zion.<br><br>I bear you my testimony, my brothers and sisters, the gospel is true. There is nowhere any name under heaven except the name of Jesus of Nazareth whereby we might be saved. We are his brothers and sisters. I bear you my testimony that this is the work of the Lord and this is the Church of God, and we have a responsibility to do the work of the Lord, to share the gospel with our neighbors, our friends and relatives, our parents. I know, I know that President Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of the Lord. I love our Heavenly Father with all my heart and all my soul. I love you missionaries. People are waiting for you to come. And you, brothers and sisters, people are waiting for you to stand before them to share the truth and the knowledge--the everlasting knowledge--you have. Yours is the greatest heritage, to bless the people of the nations and the nations of the world; your forefathers preserved that heritage, and you can bless the people of the nations, even unto eternal life, which witness I bear in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Yoshihiko Kikuchi was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 31 March 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Yourselves for the Great Day of the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am especially happy to see so many attending this devotional this morning when the competition "out of this world" is being televised. While we are concerned that the astronauts will arrive home safely, as we have prayed this morning, it is good that so many of you are here to learn more about how you may return safely home to your Father in Heaven. My beloved brothers and sisters, this is a thrilling sight. I've been uplifted by the lovely music and the spirit of this occasion. I am proud of the great work being done on this campus. I commend you for the counsel given by your president this morning. May I say you cannot do wrong and feel right. It is impossible.<br><br>I want you to know that it is a great honor to be with you and feel of your spirit. You young men and women are choice spirits; you were reserved for this special time; you have a unique task to accomplish in this world, and our prayers are constantly with you that you will live up to the expectations the Lord has for you. We love you. We have confidence in you. We pray for you.<br><br>The people of every generation, I suppose, see the time in which they live as being exceptional. The truth of the matter is that you do live in a most exceptional time in the history of the world. You young people will see events transpire which were promised from the beginning of the world. Prophets of old have seen your days and rejoiced in them. And yet, you will face challenges and circumstances the severity of which has been unparalleled in generations past. For this you must be prepared.<br><br>Today, I speak to you about the times in which you live and about the quality of faith you will need to survive some of the difficulties yet to be experienced. I speak as one who loves you and has been given a responsibility, with my Brethren, "to testify and warn" about the impending crises facing mankind. I speak to you to the topic "Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord."<br><br>I speak to you on this subject, for I feel it is needed because of rumors, writings, and tape recordings that have recently circulated among the Saints and that have created among some of our Church members a feeling of uncertainty. It calls to mind the counsel given by President Harold B. Lee:<br><br><i>There are among us many loose writings predicting the calamities which are about to overtake us. Some of these have been publicized as though they were necessary to wake up the world to the horrors about to overtake us. Many of these are from sources upon which there cannot be unquestioned reliance.</i><br><br><i>Are you . . . aware of the fact that we need no such publications to be forewarned, if we were only conversant with what the scriptures have already spoken to us in plainness?</i>["Admonitions for the Priesthood of God,"<i>Ensign</i>, January 1973, p. 106]<br><br>That is precisely the way the Brethren feel today. So, today, I shall quote liberally from the words of the Lord to our dispensation in order that you will have, from the Lord himself, guidance on future prophecy.<br><h2><b>Fulfillment of Prophecy</b></h2><br>During the last week of our Lord's mortal life, he was privately approached on the Mount of Olives by his disciples. They asked him two questions, the first of which was:<br><br><i>Tell us, when shall these things be which thou has said concerning the destruction of the temple, and the Jews?</i>[JST Matthew 24:4]<br><br>The basis for their earnest inquiry was a prophecy of Jesus that had left even the disciples stunned. While standing in the temple precincts, Jesus had declared:<br><br><i>There shall not be left here upon this temple, one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</i>[JST Matthew 24:2]<br><br>The temple in Jerusalem was a magnificent structure. It rested on the same site as the temple of Solomon, which had been largely destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in the siege of Jerusalem. With the help of King Cyrus the Great, whom the Lord inspired, the Jews returned from the Babylonian captivity and erected a second temple, though much inferior to Solomon's. Later, Herod the Great became the leader and undertook to reconstruct the temple. He spared no expense on labor or materials to restore that building to the beauty and magnificence of the days of Solomon. The project took about 46 years to complete, six years longer than the Salt Lake Temple in pioneer days. According to Josephus, a Jewish historian, some of the stones used in the foundation were prodigious in size, measuring approximately 60 feet in length. Can you imagine how improbable it must have seemed to Jesus' disciples that one stone would not be left on another? Yet, 37 years later, when the Romans invaded Jerusalem, that prophecy was literally fulfilled. It is said that after Roman soldiers burned the temple, they dug up the foundation stones in the hopes of finding a treasure buried there.<br><br>The Savior also prophesied concerning the fate of the Jewish nation:<br><br><i>This people shall be destroyed and scattered among all nations . . . .</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass that this generation of Jews shall not pass away until every desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come to pass.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:19, 21]<br><br>That desolation came as predicted. In 66 A.D., the Jews rebelled against the Romans. The Roman army invaded Judea, and, in one of the most bloody and horrible sieges in history, Jerusalem was eventually overcome. The siege lasted for about four years. During that time, it was estimated that over one million Jews were killed, and 97,000 were taken captive and sold as slaves.<br><br>Thus you see, in just four decades following the Crucifixion, the nation, the city, and the temple were all destroyed! As one modern historian recorded,<br><br><i>The destruction of the Temple marked the end . . . of the Jewish state. . . . Judea was almost shorn of Jews, and those that remained lived on the edge of starvation.</i>[Will Durant,<i>Caesar and Christ</i>, The Story of Civilization (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1944), 3:545]<br><br>Later in the first century A.D., the Jews, under the leadership of a false messiah, again attempted to recover their homeland. The Romans also crushed that rebellion; Judea was laid waste, and the remaining Jews were scattered throughout the Empire. Again the historian chronicled the literal fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy in these words:<br><br><i>No other people has ever known so long an exile, or so hard a fate . . . . Scattered into every province and beyond, condemned to poverty and humiliation, unbefriended even by philosophers and saints, they retired from public affairs into private study and worship.</i>[<i>Caesar and Christ,</i>3:549]<br><br>The prophecy of Jesus was sure and certain: "This people shall be destroyed and scattered among all nations." A lesson drawn from the Jewish catastrophe, and applicable to our times, was given by the Lord himself in modern revelation:<br><br><i>My word shall not pass away; but</i>all<i>shall be fulfilled.</i>[JST Matthew 24:36; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>Prophecies Being Fulfilled</b></h2><br>The second question asked by the disciples on the Mount of Olives, and the one pertinent to our time, was;<br><br><i>What is the sign of thy coming; and of the end of the world? (or the destruction of the wicked, which is the end of the world.)</i>[JST Matthew 24:4]<br><br>The Lord has designated these days in which we live as the "times of the Gentiles" (Luke 21:24). The Gentile nations are the so-called Christian nations--North and South America and the European nations from which many of us came. The phrase<i>times of the Gentiles</i>refers to that period of time extending from when the gospel was restored to the world (1830) to when the gospel will again be preached to the Jews--after the Gentiles have rejected it. This is how the Lord explained it:<br><br><i>And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fullness of my gospel;</i><br><br>But they receive it not<i>; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men.</i><br><br><i>And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:28‚Äì30]<br><br>We will know when the times of the Gentiles are approaching fulfillment by these signs:<br><br><i>And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and they shall say that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth.</i><br><br><i>And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:26‚Äì27]<br><br><i>And again, this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come, or the destruction of the wicked.</i>[JST Matthew 24:32]<br><br>Are we not witnessing the fulfillment of these signs today? The gospel is being extended to all nations which permit our missionaries to penetrate their countries. The Church is prospering and growing. Yet in undiminished fury, and with an anxiety that his time is short--and it is--Satan, that great adversary of all of us, is attempting to destroy all we hold dear. We constantly hear or read of wars and rumors of wars. Atheism, agnosticism, immorality, and dishonesty are flaunted in our society. Desertions, cruelty, divorce, and infidelity have become commonplace, leading to a disintegration of the family. Truly we live in the times of which the Savior spoke, when "the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound."<br><h2><b>Prophecies to Be Fulfilled</b></h2><br>The rejection of the testimony of the servants of God by the nations of the world will bring the consequence of greater calamities, for the Lord himself declared:<br><br><i>For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not be able to stand.</i><br><br><i>And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds.</i><br><br><i>And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:89‚Äì91]<br><br><i>And there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.</i><br><br><i>But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.</i><br><br><i>And there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the sword, one against another, and they will kill one another.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:31‚Äì33]<br><br>The world will present a scene of conflict such as has never been experienced before. Still, men's hearts will be hardened to the revelations from heaven. Even greater signs shall then be given to manifest the approaching great day of the Lord.<br><br><i>And they shall see signs and wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath.</i><br><br><i>And they shall behold blood, and fire, and vapors of smoke.</i><br><br><i>And before the day of the Lord shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood, and the stars shall fall from heaven.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:40‚Äì42]<br><br>I realize this is an unpleasant topic on which to dwell. I take no delight in its portrayal, nor do I look forward to the day when calamities shall come with increasing number upon humanity. But these words are not my own; the Lord has spoken them. Knowing what we know as his servants, can we hesitate to raise a warning voice to all who will listen that they may be prepared for the days ahead? Silence in the face of such calamity is sin!<br><br>But to an otherwise gloomy picture there is a bright side--the coming of our Lord in all his glory. His coming will be both glorious and terrible, depending on the spiritual condition of those who remain.<br><br>One appearance will be to the righteous Saints who have gathered to the New Jerusalem here in America. In this place of refuge they will be safe from the wrath of the Lord which will be poured out without measure on all nations. Modern revelation provides this description:<br><br><i>And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety.</i><br><br><i>And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45: 67‚Äì69]<br><br>Another appearance of the Lord will be to the Jews. To these beleaguered sons of Judah, surrounded by hostile Gentile armies, who again threaten to overrun Jerusalem, the Savior--their Messiah--will set his feet on the Mount of Olives,<br><br><i>and it shall cleave in twain, and the earth shall tremble, and reel to and fro, and the heavens also shall shake.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:47]<br><br>The Lord himself will then rout the Gentile armies, decimating their forces (see Ezekiel 38, 39). Judah will be spared, no longer to be persecuted and scattered. The Jews will then approach their Deliverer and ask, "What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet?"<br><br><i>I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.</i><br><br><i>And then shall they weep because of their iniquities; then shall they lament because they persecuted their king.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45: 52‚Äì53]<br><br>What a touching drama this will be! Jesus--Prophet, Messiah, King--will be welcomed in his own country!<br><br>Jerusalem will become an eternal city of peace!<br><br>The sons of Judah will see this promise fulfilled:<br><br><i>After their pain</i>[the tribe of Judah]<i>shall be sanctified in holiness before the Lord, to dwell in his presence day and night, forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 133:25]<br><br>Yet another appearance of Christ will be to the rest of the world. Here is his description of his coming:<br><br><i>The Lord shall be red in his apparel, and his garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat.</i><br><br><i>And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars shall be hurled from their places.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 133:48‚Äì49]<br><br>All nations will see him<br><br><i>In the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all the holy angels. . . .</i><br><br><i>And the Lord shall utter his voice, and all the ends of the earth shall hear it; and the nations of the earth shall mourn, and they that have laughed shall see their folly.</i><br><br><i>And calamity shall cover the mocker, and the scorner shall be consumed; and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:44, 49, 50]<br><br>When the Savior spoke of these signs and prophecies to his disciples in Jerusalem, they were apprehensive. He said to them,<br><br>Be not troubled,<i>for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:35; emphasis added]<br><h2><b>The Preparation</b></h2><br>Saints of Zion, do you realize we are living in the days of the fulfillment of these signs and wonders? You are among those who will see many of these prophecies fulfilled. Just as certain as was the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem and the scattering of the Jews, so shall these words of the Savior be certain to your generation.<br><br>We know not the day nor the hour of his coming, but of this you may feel assured: You stand close to the great day of the Lord! In his words of modern revelation, we say to you,<br><br><i>Seek the face of the Lord, always.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 101:38]<br><br>You will live in the midst of economic, political, and spiritual instability. When you see these signs--unmistakable evidences that his coming is nigh--<i>be not troubled</i>, but, "stand . . . in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come" (D&amp;amp;C 87:8). Holy men and holy women stand in holy places, and these holy places include our temples, our chapels, our homes, and the stakes of Zion, which are, as the Lord declares, "for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 115:6).<br><br>Heed the Lord's counsel to the Saints of this dispensation:<br><br><i>Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 133:10]<br><br>This preparation must consist of more than just casual membership in the Church. You must learn to be guided by personal revelation and the counsel of the living prophet so you will not be deceived. Our Lord has indicated who, among Church members, will stand when he appears:<br><br><i>And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.</i><br><br><i>For they that are wise and have received the truth, and</i>have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide,<i>and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.</i><br><br><i>And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.</i><br><br><i>For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 45:56‚Äì59; emphasis added]<br><br>President Wilford Woodruff further prophesied in 1894:<br><br><i>Can you tell me where the people are who will be shielded and protected from these great calamities and judgments which are even now at our door? I'll tell you. The priesthood of God who honor their priesthood and who are worthy of their blessings are the only ones who shall have this safety and protection. They are the only mortal beings. No other people have a right to be shielded from these judgments. They are at our very doors; not even this people will escape them entirely</i>. [Susa Young Gates, "The Temple Workers' Excursion,"<i>Young Women's Journal</i>June 1894, p. 512]<br><br>If you are to preserve your blessings, it is not enough for you just to be free and independent, to capitalize on your advantages so that they accrue to your well-being and prosperity. You must protect and safeguard the freedom you have. You must be<i>wise</i>and<i>virtuous</i>. You must govern your natures by the doctrines of his kingdom. You must be valiant in your testimony of Christ by keeping all his commandments.<br><br>Will you be among those who are faithful to the end? Will you endure? Are you prepared? Can you live in the world and not partake of the sins of the world? Will you "arise and shine forth" as the Lord has commanded? Will you be a light and "standard for the nations"? We know you can. We pray you will. We have every confidence that you, "the rising generation," will not falter. I repeat: You are valiant spirits reserved for this exceptional time. Make the choice: Rise to the task of this momentous hour!<br><br>As a special witness of our Lord, I humbly declare to you that he lives, that he is close to his servants. His word "shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by [his] own voice or by the voice of [his] servants, it is the same" (D&amp;amp;C 1:38). I testify that you can rely on his promises.<br><br>God lives; Jesus is the Christ. These two heavenly Beings did in very deed appear to Joseph Smith in the greatest event that has occurred in this world since the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is my testimony to you, my beloved brethren and sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h1> to Successful Dating and Marriage Relationships - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I come to you concerned and somewhat troubled. My comments this evening are directed to those of you who will dedicate an important part of your earthly lives to making your eventual eternal marriages succeed. The emotions I feel are the deepest love and respect for you and the excitement for your futures as someday you will sit where we now sit and speak where we now speak and lead in areas where we have led, but in many areas where we have not yet led. There is a tendency in life, brothers and sisters, to simplify problems and complicate solutions. Many challenges, however, are very complex. But I have learned that, when we utilize the teachings of the Master, the solutions to even the most difficult of life&#39;s challenges are usually basic and easy to implement.<br><h2><b>Dedication to Successful Marriage</b></h2><br>Several years ago, while visiting in Florida, I talked with Frank Shorter, a world-class marathon athlete. He won the marathon in the 1972 Olympics, placed second in 1976, and has won literally hundreds of long-distance races. As we talked about his training schedule, I learned that he had dedicated a great part of his life to succeeding in that impressive area of athletics. He knows exactly what foods to eat, how many miles to run each day (which incidentally is about 20), the frame of mind he needs to have if he expects to be victorious, and a number of other characteristics relating to success in his chosen field.<br><br>Well, while thinking of Frank Shorter and his goals and others who have succeeded in their chosen lines of work or hobbies or professions, I have asked myself, Why couldn&#39;t more of our husbands and wives have the same type of dedication to a successful marriage as do renowned athletes, physicians, educators, and governmental leaders as they excel in their professions?<br><br>Tonight I shall not address the mate-selection process except to say three things: First, obedience, brothers and sisters, is the sure cornerstone of happiness. A boyfriend or girlfriend who does not have a wholesome respect for regulations during the dating process will often continue to break the rules after the word<i>yes</i>at the altar is spoken. Seek out those who are willing to live the rules because if you do not, we will spend time with you in offices in whichever ward or stake you live, attempting to work out the difficulties that will surely come.<br><br>Second, there are not to be sexual experiences before marriage. Temporary pleasure in the backseat of an automobile is not worth the incredibly high price of heartache, self-doubt, and guilt, with always the question gnawing at one&#39;s spirit, "Is it true love that I feel or some sort of hormonal substitute?" One penalty that comes to those who participate when they should not is that the counterfeiting procedure begins that sometimes cannot be refined out of one&#39;s heart and mind. Don&#39;t let it be part of yours.<br><br>Third, you must realize that you had better marry the person who has the built-in characteristics you desire because marriage is not a place where you will be able to change another or to fit him/her into the mold of what you want. It must have happened before, and then two people can grow and progress together.<br><br>Brethren and sisters, I know of nothing worthwhile in life that comes easy. However, nothing in life is as valuable as a strong marriage and a secure family. I am speaking to all who want their future marriages to succeed. My comments are not for anyone looking for simple ideas or anyone who would be satisfied merely to tolerate an uncomfortable arrangement. Every strong marriage is severely tested. Husbands and wives who encounter and surmount suffering, pain, misunderstanding, and temptation can enjoy marriages that are beautiful and eternal. There is a principle that needs to be understood, and let me take just a moment to explain it to you. Many marriage experts who write articles are failures in their own marriages or have never married. Unfortunately, many of the books on how to have a successful marriage are less than helpful to Latter-day Saints. Our marriages and families are built upon heavenly concepts and principles, not upon worldly ideas or solutions. I pray that I may be in the Spirit this evening as I communicate with you about marriage.<br><h2><b>Belief in Eternal Marriage</b></h2><br>First of all, consider the concepts that we have that the world does not understand. One is the principle of eternal marriage itself, where we are able to look beyond the problems of today and this evening and tomorrow into a life beyond death, where as a family we will dwell forever together. Relationships are to be never ending, but the world does not comprehend this great truth.<br><h2><b>Spirituality</b></h2><br>Second, the world does not understand spirituality or the fact that we can receive personal revelations that will assist us in any of the challenges that will come our way. We must bring, brothers and sisters, the Savior and his teachings into our homes and hearts, and when we do, he will guide us. To really succeed, your eternal marriage must be Christ centered. Let me tell you an experience I had several years ago. I was sitting in my office. I heard a commotion out in the reception area. My secretary picked up the telephone and buzzed me. She said, "There&#39;s a couple here, Elder Pinnock, that you have been assigned to talk with."<br><br>I could tell she was very nervous, and I said, "Have them in." A man and a woman came into my office. Her face was tearstained.<br><br>He began pounding on my desk, "Tell her I have the priesthood, and she&#39;s to do what I tell her to do."<br><br>The first thing I said was, "Stop pounding on my desk." The second thing I said was, "Brother, you do not have the priesthood."<br><br>"Oh, yes, I do. I was given the priesthood last June."<br><br>I said, "You don&#39;t have the priesthood," and I turned behind me to where my scriptures lay. I took the triple combination and turned quickly to section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants. We could have begun in a number of places, but let&#39;s begin with verse 36:<br><br><i>That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.</i><br><br><i>That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.</i><br><br>At that time, that good sister smiled briefly. I said, "Do you understand that you don&#39;t have the priesthood?"<br><br>He said, "I didn&#39;t understand that before now."<br><br>Then I said, "Let&#39;s begin reading the 41st verse":<br><br><i>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood</i>[or any other position or title, I might add],<i>only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</i><br><br><i>By kindness and pure knowledge. . . .</i><br><br>About this time, their hands joined as I read the next several verses:<br><br><i>Which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.</i><br><br>Jumping to the 45th verse:<br><br><i>Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.</i><br><br>Well, he was listening now. And we talked for the next few minutes about the importance of meekness and patience and love unfeigned. As they left, they walked out arm in arm, apparently after having learned a great lesson in life. The gospel of Jesus Christ and the priesthood that so many of us in this room bear can only be maintained and handled upon the principles of righteousness.<br><br>Just as a building must have a strong foundation, a family needs the sure foundation of the Savior and his teachings. We are a spiritual people, believing in spiritual principles: that first and foremost we are to use the Spirit in solving problems and receiving revelations that will guide our feet. Obviously this means to live righteous lives, to pray often, and to be kind one to another.<br><h2><b>Communication</b></h2><br>Third, do not feel that an intense disagreement in your dating procedure or eventually in your marriage indicates that it cannot succeed. If we are to really communicate, we must be honest when we disagree. We must express hurts and let our feelings show. We can do this without becoming angry or inconsiderate. People who keep things bottled up inside are candidates for a variety of illnesses, but even more serious, that approach does not solve problems. A serious disagreement between partners does not mean the two are becoming allergic to one another or that the situation is hopeless. It merely means that they are human and not yet perfect individuals. If we can just acknowledge our differences in mature ways, then we will realize that our dating procedure is okay or our marriages eventually will be all right. Often what happens is that we have simply failed to communicate. And differences can be worked out without jeopardizing a relationship. As we communicate, brothers and sisters--may I say this quickly--let us first communicate about feelings, those throbbings from within, and then we can be concerned with the historical aspects of communication, where we have been and what we have seen. But let us communicate our feelings first. And if something just doesn&#39;t feel quite right--leaves you with kind of an uncomfortable feeling--that needs to be said to your date or to your husband or wife.<br><h2><b>Kindness</b></h2><br>Fourth, never make your date or mate the object of jokes, either in private or in public. Partners who poke fun at one another may think of it as good-natured humor. It is not. It is degrading and dangerous. To make a joke about private things a husband or wife or a boyfriend or girlfriend does is a form of ridicule and a way of putting him or her down. Too often the laughter conceals a spirit of malice or anger that causes hurt feelings and fractures in that delicate substance we define as spirit. Couples who respect each other do not resort to such procedures.<br><h2><b>Trust</b></h2><br>Fifth, both during the dating period and after marriage, do not smother one another with excessive restrictions. Remember a kind and loving Father--and I guess it was a hundred years ago today that we were sitting around talking about that council in heaven and all those things that had happened thousands of years before, and we were getting ready to come here. As we looked to Father, we could see the trust in his eyes. And we knew that we would be operational here upon the earth in a great environment of freedom. Then why do we sometimes try to take that freedom away from those we love so much? A loving wife of many years shared with me one of the secrets of her beautiful marriage. She told me, "It is my duty to maintain an atmosphere in our home in which my husband can reach his full potential. As you know, he is a busy businessman, a bishop, and a father. In turn, he helps me reach my potential." With her encouragement he was an outstanding bishop. She later served as a counselor in two auxiliary presidencies. She had a little place in their home where she could sew and where she painted lovely paintings and wrote beautiful poetry. He felt comfortable in going fishing, lowering his golf score, doing some painting himself, and growing in ways that interested him. Neither of these marriage partners was being smothered by a selfish mate. Each respected the other&#39;s needs and goals. And as you think about that eventual responsibility that you will have of raising children, keep that concept in mind. If you will give them gobs of freedom, almost beyond logic sometimes, they will grow in precious ways that will give them the confidence to do what needs to be done.<br><br>The most fulfilling of all marriages that I have observed seem to be those in which the husband and wife together commit their love to the Savior&#39;s keeping and to each other. They are interested in one another, and yet they set each other free to grow and mature--never free to flirt, but free to take on new challenges and to pursue new interests. Jealousy is a subtle form of bondage and is the most smothering of human passions. Dating couples or husbands and wives who fear the loss of a partner&#39;s love weaken their relationship by holding on too tightly. A husband who thinks to himself, "I won&#39;t let her out of my sight," is actually expressing a fear that might push her away. We must allow each other plenty of room for personal growth and expression. When both partners are able to develop their talents and interests, the marriage is less likely to suffer from boredom and narrowness.<br><h2><b>Paying compliments</b></h2><br>Sixth, compliment each other sincerely and often, just as you do or will do during the dating period. A middle-aged wife once told me, "Someone has to keep my husband humble. He gets so much attention from others that he needs to be brought down a peg or two. He gets too big for his britches." How sad. Every husband needs a wife who will build him up, and every wife needs a husband to honor and to respect her. Building each other with sincere compliments is never a sign of weakness. It is the right thing to do. Anyone who can contemplate kneeling at an altar, participating in an eternal ordinance--or those who have--can certainly find lovely things to say about a partner.<br><br>So often in those stressful circumstances where divorce has occurred, I will hear comments such as this from a divorced man or woman: "John (or Mary) has been gone now for three years. How I wish he (or she) would come back. The loneliness is unbearable. I neglected to tell him (or her) so many things. Oh, if only I had let her (or him) know how good she (or he) was in so many ways. What a fool I was! I could never learn to compliment and to build. I was always pointing out her (or his) mistakes."<br><br>"I see how some husbands and wives treat each other," a young divorced lady said to me, "so coldly and with such indifference I want to scream at them, to wake them up before it is too late. I want to tell them to quit their sarcasm and instead to encourage each other." And remember, dear friends, that that is part of the responsibility of dating, to handle that precious relationship as if it were fragile because it is. We all tend to become the persons described in the compliments that our spouses and friends pay us. We will do almost anything to live up to the compliments and encouragements of a boyfriend or a girlfriend or a proud wife or husband.<br><br>Let me tell you a story about a man who received his PhD from this institution. We had known this person for a number of years. He married later than many, and as we watched him relate with a young woman, we wondered if she could keep up; we wondered if she had the capacity to understand life as he had learned it because he was more than several years older. Then, as we observed that couple at social functions and elsewhere, we saw that he would take time to carefully instruct her. As he returned from classwork, he would bring home books for her to read and to study. As they took long walks, they were constantly teaching each other. What a beautiful marriage and what a lovely family they now have because they have taken the time to compliment and to build each other! They are serving now in the mission field together, there because of his sensitivity and because of her sensitivity, there because they desire to build one another.<br><h2><b>Talking Openly</b></h2><br>As a seventh recommendation, in dating or in marriage, never resort to the silent treatment. Always be open and straightforward with each other. Too often we may respond to tensions by clamming up or by taking a walk. A young wife in the southwest corner of Salt Lake County asked me to talk with her husband. "All he does is clam up when we disagree. He won&#39;t communicate. He just walks out the door." [Think of this maturity level!] "When he cools down, he comes home, but he is like ice until I make up with him. He can go on for days or even a week or two without saying a word."<br><br>Well, I have learned that we are wrong even to say to our mates, "Just leave me alone. I&#39;m going through a rough time. Let me work it out by myself. I just don&#39;t want to be around anybody right now." That not only is unfair and genuinely insulting, but it is stupid. What is marriage if it is not sharing and helping one another through crises? We will hear all of the excuses--"It&#39;s that time, I&#39;m not feeling well." "Things are tough at the office." "I&#39;ve had a tough day at class." "I lost a big case." "My nerves are bad." "Things are tough in the ward now." None of these excuses gives the moral right to shut out someone who loves you. Keep the door to your heart open. The times when we shut others out are often the times when we need their help the most. Of course we need times of privacy, to think alone. Of course we need time to pray and to meditate. And we should understand and respect these needs in others. However, we should never be inconsiderate or unappreciative of a concerned husband or wife who is trying to help at a time of trouble and discouragement.<br><h2><b>Apologizing and Forgetting</b></h2><br>Eighth, resolve when necessary to say, "Hey, honey, I&#39;m sorry," and really mean it. Contrary to a popular saying, love, in part, means learning how to say, "I&#39;m sorry, sweetheart." So often when we make mistakes, sometimes innocently, damage has been done, and an apology is in order. Along with learning how to say, "I&#39;m sorry," husbands and wives must learn to say, "I forgive." Jesus taught that our being forgiven by our Heavenly Father depends in part--and in great part--on our ability to forgive those who have trespassed against us. Even when cheating has occurred, we must be willing, under most circumstances, to accept their true repentance. Some of the strongest marriages of which I am aware have been between partners who could say, "I am sorry," and who could forgive.<br><br>In addition to saying they&#39;re sorry and really meaning it, husbands and wives must avoid bringing up the past. Thousands of marriages have survived the most critical problems and have been successful only because godly sorrow for sin was followed by Christlike forgiveness. A woman was referred to my office for a blessing for the restoration of her health. She had been ill for seven years. She had had exploratory surgery three times, had been in the hospital a number of times, and had switched doctors more often than annually. And I declined to give her a blessing when the Spirit said there was nothing wrong physically. Brothers and sisters, you can imagine what an awkward position I found myself in, having to say no.<br><br>She said, "What do you mean?"<br><br>As we talked, she mentioned that several years earlier, during a very difficult time in life, her husband had not given her the attention that she needed, and he was sitting next to her. She had not been pleased with his behavior and had carried with her a scarred heart, emotions that had been disrupted and confused, and she was bitter. I asked, "When did this happen?"<br><br>She said, "Seven years ago. Now wait just a minute, Elder Pinnock. You don&#39;t mean to tell me that I have been sick for seven years because I can&#39;t forgive my husband." And there he sat.<br><br>I said, "I would be happy to give you a blessing for what is wrong."<br><br>Well, she was there; the moment was awkward. She said, "All right, go ahead."<br><br>I placed my hands upon her head and gave her a blessing that she could love and forgive, at that time not sure if it was her husband, but it seemed to be. As we walked the few steps to my door, I pointed to the door and said, "That door will always be open to you." And in a huff and with some discomfort, she left.<br><br>About ten days later the telephone rang. "Is that offer still good to come and see you?"<br><br>I said, "Yes."<br><br>She came in, "Do you mean to tell me that the reason I&#39;ve been sick for so many years is because I can&#39;t forgive my husband for the way he treated me seven or eight years ago?"<br><br>I said, "Yes. I have thought a great deal about it since then, and I believe that is your problem." We talked for almost an hour. As she stood up to leave, I pointed to the door again and said, "The door is always open."<br><br>The phone rang several weeks later. "May I come and talk to you, Elder Pinnock?"<br><br>I said, "Certainly."<br><br>She walked in a changed woman. She didn&#39;t even look the same. She said, "I haven&#39;t felt this good for years. I can&#39;t remember having ever felt as good as I feel now, and I love my husband so much." Well, think about it, think about it, think about it.<br><h2><b>Confiding Only in the Bishop (or Branch President)</b></h2><br>Ninth, remember never to turn to a third party in time of marital trouble except to your bishop or branch president. In sensitive and inspired ways he will direct you to a competent counselor if that is what is needed. Someone is always ready and eager to consult a hurting wife or husband, and when marriage partners have no one to talk with at home, unfortunately, too often they seek a friend elsewhere. And that, dear brothers and sisters, is where almost all adultery has its origin. It can happen in the neighborhood, in a ward choir, at the office, or anywhere else. Secret affairs begin innocently enough just by talking about mutual hurts, but then comes a dependency period that too often ends in transferring loyalty and affection, followed by adultery. Never ever, never ever, confide your marriage troubles to a third party, no, not even to your closest friend. He or she may be the first to tell your troubles to another, becoming the one to hurt you most severely. Lean on the Savior and rely upon your bishop and your stake president. Remember that because, as the years quickly come and go, there will be stressful times when you will need to talk to someone. Remember who it should be. The system which the Lord has given us is simple. It works.<br><h2><b>Having Fun</b></h2><br>Tenth, have clean, wholesome fun during your dating years and retain the same joy in marriage. God intends for us to find joy in life. Man is that he might have joy. Most marriages begin with joy, and those that succeed retain it. Last Thanksgiving we went up to Bear Lake. We have a little farm home there. My wife and I began a tickling contest. I am a world-class tickler. I am one of the greatest ticklers that has ever lived. Well, as we were laughing and giggling, in came the children. They couldn&#39;t believe what they were seeing. Soon they joined in and we had a great time. A microscopic bit of sadness attended that experience last Thanksgiving because I thought to myself, "Why haven&#39;t I introduced that type of joy into our home more often?" I hope that our home has been more joy filled since then. When a marriage loses its happiness, it becomes weak and vulnerable. Find a happy home, and you will find a joyful couple at the helm. Husbands and wives who no longer laugh and play together are losing their fondness for each other and perhaps even their capacity to stay together. True love includes a joyful, almost childlike quality. In other words, live it up--righteously.<br><h2><b>In Conclusion</b></h2><br>Well, it&#39;s almost time to say good night. Let me read to you an article that appeared in<i>Harper&#39;s Weekly</i>in October.<br><br><i>It is a gloomy moment in the history of our country. Not in the lifetime of most men has there been so much grave and deep apprehension. Never has the future seemed so uncalculable as at this time. The domestic situation is in chaos. Our dollar is weak throughout the world. Prices are so high as to be utterly impossible. The political caldron seethes and bubbles with uncertainty. Russia hangs as usual like a cloud, dark and silent, upon the horizon. It is a solemn moment. Of our troubles, no man can see the end.</i>[<i>Harper&#39;s</i>, October 1857]<br><br>Much of life does not change, but let me testify to you that one area of life is good and will never change--that&#39;s when we live the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I look to you marvelous missionaries, and, boy, do we love you! I&#39;ve just come back from touring two missions, and what a great time we had together! You are embarking upon a period when you will teach true principles to people who are struggling, are confused, don&#39;t have any idea what to do, and you will bring them the answer--that is, the gospel of Jesus Christ. And what an honor it is to serve the Master in ways that you soon will do and that many here have already done.<br><br>May I take just a moment to thank my lovely wife Anne. No matter what problems I encounter in the world fighting dragons, she always responds with love and kindness and a patient listening ear.<br><br>Your futures depend on the present. Live life well today. Life passes quickly. Let us not be guilty of hoping that someday we will become happy and contented, after college or after this next semester or after this next test or after this date tonight or after the bills are paid or after the kids are grown or when we are retired. The good will always outweigh the bad--let me say that again: The good<i>will</i>always outweigh the bad. There are far more lovely, fine, honest people in this world than those who are dishonest and injurious. May you learn at your age--and we at ours if we haven&#39;t--to recognize the good and to bring joy into the lives of others. May the Lord&#39;s choicest blessings be with each of us that we may do all within our power to do those things that are proper and right in our social interaction with each other as we date, that we may have, when that special sacred time comes, strong marriages and lives filled with joy. This I pray humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.<br><br><i>Hugh W.

<br>
To you student body officers who have just taken upon you the oath of office to uphold the constitution of the Associated Students of Brigham Young University and to sustain and promote the standards of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I compliment you. With that promise and commitment, may I remind you of the tremendous impact that your example can have as you bring honor and recognition to this great institution and the name<i>Brigham Young University.</i><br><h2><b>Premortal Commitments</b></h2><br>This year will provide for each of you a time to magnify measurably your opportunities to keep the commitments that you made before you came here to this mortal sphere.<br><br>Elder John A. Widstoe has given us the following insight regarding those commitments that we all made. He says:<br><br><i>In our pre-existent state, in the day of the great council, we made a certain agreement with the Almighty. The Lord proposed a plan conceived by him. We accepted it. Since the plan is intended for all men, we became partners to the salvation of every person under the plan. . . . We went into a partnership with the Lord. The working out of that plan became then not merely the Father's work, and the Son's work but also our work. The least of us, the humblest, is in</i>partnership<i>with the Almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation.</i>["Lesson Ten, The Worth of Souls,"<i>Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine</i>, October 1934, 25:189, quoted in R. W. Doxey,<i>The Latter-day Prophets and the Doctrine and Covenants</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1963), 1:33]<br><br>Relating to today's happenings, this agreement might even be considered as an oath of office. And what does it mean to be in partnership and to take upon us a name?<br><h2><b>Shelly's Questions</b></h2><br>Some years ago in the early spring, I took little Shelly's hand in mine, and for hours we carefully picked our way from one rock to the next along the creek bed shaded by some tall trees. The gurgling water was like a musical accompaniment to the dance we were creating as we would take a step, hesitate, take another, and then wait a moment to secure our balance.<br><br>Before long, we were drawn to an open meadow where some large cottonwood trees had been recently cut. Making my way through the tall grass, I held Shelly's hand in mine as she cautiously placed one foot ahead of the other, walking the full length of the tree and back again. We noticed in that springtime tender green shoots forcing their way through the earthy floor and the winter snow receding toward the mountain peaks. It seemed as though all of nature bore evidence of God's creations and his love for us.<br><br>Our afternoon activities continued until the evening breeze reminded us that our special day was coming to a close. Approaching the narrow, steep garden path leading to my home, I let go Shelly's hand, allowing her to go first. Our hands struck together for a moment. A bond had formed from the warmth of the day through our shared adventures.<br><br>Just before reaching the clearing near the house, we stopped. Bending down, I lifted Shelly up to see into a little nest built by a robin in the branch of a tree.<br><br>At the close of this memorable day, before tucking my little niece (whom my sister shares with me) into bed, we knelt together while she expressed her own thanks which included the creek, the slippery rocks, the big tree, and the robin's nest. Feeling a renewed appreciation for those same wonderful blessings, I tucked the covers around her and bent down for a goodnight kiss. Reaching up with both arms around my neck and pulling me close to her, Shelly whispered, "I wish we were in the same family."<br><br>"Shelly, my dear," I quickly explained, "we are in the same family."<br><br>"No, I mean the very same family. My last name is Larsen, and your last name is Kapp, and that isn't the same. I mean if you were my sister and we had the very same last name."<br><br>Even though she was very young, I felt that she might sense the security of our eternal relationship if I could awaken within her a great eternal truth. "Shelly, we really are in the very same family. You see, we are all our Heavenly Father's children, every one of us, and that makes us in one great family. We are brothers and sisters, and Jesus is our Brother, too, our Elder Brother."<br><br>"Then, what is Jesus' last name?" she asked.<br><br>"Shelly, we know our Savior as Jesus the Christ." With the pure innocence of youth, she began to make us all one family by securing this relationship as she linked my first name with the surname "The Christ."<br><br>"Oh, no, my dear. We don't put our names together like that."<br><br>"But why not?" she asked.<br><br>Wanting her to be aware of the sacredness of our relationship with the Savior, I tried to explain. "I guess maybe it's because sometimes we are not good enough. I don't feel worthy yet."<br><br>With that, she raised up on her little elbow. "What do you do that's wrong? Why don't you stop doing it, and then we can all be in the same family? We can all use his name."<br><br>As I pondered the answer to her simple questions, I heard in my mind words as though I was hearing them for the first time. And yet, it had been only two days since I had attended sacrament meeting, where I had listened to the same words. I had heard them with my ears often before, but now it seemed different. It was as though I was hearing them with my whole heart and soul:<br><br><i>That they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he has given them</i>. [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77?lang=eng#p76">D&amp;amp;C 20:77</a>]<br><br>Wasn't this the very thing that we were talking about--the responsibility of taking upon oneself that sacred name and committing to try always to remember him and keep his commandments?<br><h2><b>Meaning of the Sacrament</b></h2><br>While Shelly seemed secure and satisfied with the explanation given her at that time, over the years I have searched for a deeper understanding of this sacred sacramental ordinance in which we renew our covenant each week to take upon ourselves his name. And while that usually occurs on Sunday, what does it mean on weekdays? What difference does it make to a child, a youth, or an adult? How does it affect how we live in the summer, the winter, the fall? Should it? Can we afford to consider this sacred ordinance passively and allow it to become routine in nature?<br><br>From the writings of C. S. Lewis we read,<br><br><i>Active habits are strengthened by repetition but passive ones are weakened. The more often [one] feels without acting, the less he will be able ever to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel.</i>[The Screwtape Letters (New York: Macmillan, 1963), p. 70]<br><br>Jesus Christ came into the world--<br><br><i>to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;</i><br><br><i>That through him all might be saved.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.41-42?lang=eng#p40">D&amp;amp;C 76:41‚Äì42</a>]<br><br>It was Christ who suffered and died to atone for us. There is no possible way we can ransom ourselves. It was in the Garden of Gethsemane that his sufferings were beyond all mortal comprehension, that the weight of our sins caused him to feel such agony, pain, and heartbreak that he bled from every pore as he suffered, both body and spirit. When we see in our minds by the gift of the Spirit the reality of Gethsemane, it is his great love for us that gives us the strength to struggle and suffer in our small way to overcome our sins.<br><br>Can we possibly comprehend such love? It is this atonement that can, if we will just do our part, ransom us, qualify us, redeem us, save us, and exalt us. Our part, then, is to accept Christ's atonement by repenting of our sins, being baptized, receiving the Holy Ghost, and obeying all the commandments.<br><br><i>We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.3?lang=eng#2">Third Article of Faith</a>]<br><br>When we became members of his Church at the time of baptism, we covenanted with the Savior to take upon ourselves his name. Do we<i>remember</i>that baptismal covenant every day--and do what we really want to do in relation to that important event in our lives?<br><h2><b>Reminders</b></h2><br>Not long ago while I was sitting on the stand during the closing session of a youth conference, just as the young priest conducting the meeting rose to his feet to bring the meeting to a close, Kathy, sitting next to me, jumped up and unhesitatingly slipped in front of the young man, took her place at the pulpit, faced the audience, raised both hands in front of her with outstretched fingers, and said, "I'll bet you're all wondering why I've been wearing this ugly green nail polish." A soft ripple could be heard across the audience, and I realized that I was not the only one sharing that curiosity.<br><br>"Well," she said, "it's like this: I knew my responsibilities as one of the leaders of this conference were big. I knew I had some real challenges ahead, and I didn't want to be sorry after the chance was gone that I didn't do what I really wanted to do.<br><br>"You see, I needed something that would remind me of what I really wanted to do and help me through the things I didn't want to do. So I thought of a plan. And it worked! You see," she went on, "I wanted something that would remind me of what I really wanted to make myself do. I knew my fingernails would always be there, and if they were green, I would be sure to notice them."<br><br>After giving further details and bearing a strong testimony of the joy that comes when you do what you should, she took her seat. From this insight I was reminded of the message of the apostle Paul when he was speaking to the Corinthians and talking to them about their ways. He said:<br><br><i>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things</i>. [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.11?lang=eng#p10">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>]<br><br>Kathy had helped us all to understand the importance of reminders, but it was the combined voices of youth singing the closing song, resounding like a sacred sermon, that brought forth new appreciation for sacred reminders, as these wonderful young people sang:<br><br><i>I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine</i><br><i>To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;</i><br><i>That he should extend his great love unto such as I,</i><br><i>Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.</i><br>[Charles H. Gabriel,<i>Hymns</i>, no. 80]<br><br>You and I and Shelly--all of us--have the sacrament, a holy priesthood ordinance that helps remind us of the atonement of the Savior; it helps us keep focused on our daily progress toward exaltation, to remind us of the things we really want to do and to help us through the things we don't want to do. It is a precious and sacred reminder--not just on Sunday, but on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, spring, summer, and fall, when we're on the mountain peaks of our lives, and also when we're in the valleys. What is true for Shelly and you and me is that our Savior loves us very much.<br><h2><b>Active Participation</b></h2><br>Speaking of the Son of God, Alma, in the Book of Mormon, had this to say:<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind: . . . he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people. . . .</i><br><br><i>And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-12?lang=eng#p10">Alma 7:11‚Äì12</a>]<br><br>President Marion G. Romney's insight has made a change in my life regarding the opportunity that is mine to partake of the sacrament. May I share it with you:<br><br><i>Now, partaking of the sacrament is not to be a mere passive experience. We are not to remember the Lord's suffering and death only as we may remember some purely secular historical event. Participating in the sacrament service is meant to be a vital and a spiritualizing experience. Speaking of it, the Savior said:</i><br><br><i>And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me</i>(<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.7?lang=eng#p6">3 Nephi 18:7</a>.)<br><br>Then President Romney continued:<br><br><i>In order to testify, one's mind has to function, and it must be concentrated upon the thing to be testified. And we are not only to partake of the emblems of the sacrament in remembrance of the Redeemer, testifying that we do always remember him, but we are also thereby to witness unto the Father that we are willing to take upon us the name of his Son and that we will keep his commandments. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now there is a doctrine abroad in the world today which teaches that the physical emblems of the sacrament are transformed into the flesh and blood of Jesus. We do not teach such doctrine, for we know that any transformation which comes from the administration of the sacrament takes place in the souls of those who understandingly partake of it. It is the participating individuals who are affected, and they are affected in a most marvelous way, for they are given the Spirit of the Lord to be with them.</i>[Conference Reports, April 1946, pp. 39‚Äì40]<br><br>At those very times, brothers and sisters, when you and I feel least comfortable about carrying his holy name and have the keenest sense of our imperfections--those moments when the flesh is weak, and our spirit suffers disappointment, knowing what we can become, we might feel a sense of withdrawing, a pulling away, a feeling of needing to set aside for a time at least that divine relationship with the Savior, until we are more worthy--at such moments, the offer is there to accept the great gift of the atonement even before we change. When you feel the need to pull away, will you reach out to him? Instead of feeling the need to resist, will you submit to his will?<br><br>It is in our struggles, while striving to qualify, that our spirits reach out in greater humility and gratitude, and we are better prepared to receive the gift because we so desperately need it--in fact, we must have it if we are to receive our eternal rewards.<br><h2><b>A Precious Gift</b></h2><br>When my father was in the last stages of stomach cancer, his body wasting away--then less than 100 pounds--his spirit growing in strength every single day, he shared with me his new insights from that perspective.<br><br>"It is a fact," he bore witness, "that the body and spirit are separate. When this process of separation is witnessed firsthand," he said with conviction and even enthusiasm, "the meaning of eternal life and the resurrection takes on a new dimension of understanding. It is like discovering a precious gift you've held in your possession all this time but never unwrapped; and then the time comes when you open it, and you're more ready to fully appreciate the divine nature of the gift because you are prepared to use it for the purpose for which it was intended."<br><br>The purpose of the sacramental covenant is always in force. That gift becomes more precious when we don't leave it wrapped, but rather prepare ourselves to use it for the purpose for which it was intended. I would say now to Shelly, "Yes, my dear, put my name with the Savior's." He said we could. He wants us to feel comfortable carrying his name.<br><br>We must come to the sacramental altar hungry--a spiritual hunger and thirst for righteousness. It is a time for self-evaluation, a time to rectify our courses, if necessary, and to make right our lives. It is a time and place for us to judge ourselves and come to better understand the magnitude of that sacred divine gift and the reality of being allowed to have his Spirit with us always to direct every act of our lives.<br><br>I believe that each new day can be faced with greater anticipation and purpose when we are reminded of the words of Elder John A. Widtsoe:<br><br><i>There is a spiritual meaning of all human acts and earthly events. . . . No man is quite so happy, I think, as he who backs all his labors by . . . a spiritual interpretation and understanding of the acts of life. A piece of silver always has a certain value as it passes from hand to hand; it is weighed and we sell it in the marketplace; but, when that piece of silver is coined into a dollar, it receives the stamp of government service; it becomes a coin of the realm, and it moves from hand to hand to accomplish the work of the realm. So, every act of man, the moment it is fitted into the great plan, the plan of salvation, receives spiritual coinage, and passes from hand to hand, form mind to mind, to accomplish the great work of God.</i>[Conference Reports, April 1922, p. 96‚Äì97]<br><h2><b>Partnership with the Savior</b></h2><br>As we gradually move to that spiritual level, we will begin to experience that partnership to which we agreed in our premortal experience--to help to bring salvation and eternal life to everyone under the plan.<br><br>When Christ becomes our constant companion, it will make our whole day different, and with this Spirit reflected in our language, in our daily work, at school, on the highway, in the marketplace, slowly, day by day, our conduct will become more unselfish, our relationships more tender, our desire to serve more constant, and we will find ourselves going about doing good. Always. We will have taken upon us not only his name, but his image in our countenances also (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14?lang=eng#p13">Alma 5:14</a>).<br><br>This experiment has been tried before, even in Christ's lifetime. A few men were admitted to the inner circle of friendship and, day by day, his first disciples became more mellow and softened and began to grow spiritually with power and strength and influence.<br><br>For the apostle Paul, the process was more dramatic. On the road to Damascus he met the Savior, and from that time his words, his deeds, his career, his daily walk were different.<br><br>Have we experienced this encounter on our Damascus road? Or maybe in a less dramatic way? When it happens we will be allowed to witness miracles. We will better understand them; in fact, we will participate in them. Lives will be changed when we begin to see each other more as our Savior sees us. We will want to teach each other the way he would teach us. We will yearn for the spirituality to bear testimony of the things to which he bears testimony. And when we meet, it will be as someone said: "We will not just exchange words; what we will exchange is souls." Not just with our friends and loved ones, but with every person for whose eternal welfare we share a responsibility. With his Spirit we will be allowed to see things--not as the world sees them, but more as he would see them. We will learn to hearken to the voice of the Spirit.<br><h2><b>Influence of the Spirit</b></h2><br>President Romney, in speaking to a group of sisters who were being released from their callings in the Church a few years ago, said to us in part, "I pray that the Lord will help you to live every day so that you can have the Spirit of the Lord with you. It is a wonderful thing to try to know and to try to live so that you can<i>hear</i>and respond to the voice of the Lord. That's where the comfort comes in this life. Hearken to the voice of the Spirit, and have the discernment to know what the Spirit tells you. Then have the courage to follow that counsel."<br><br>One day I witnessed evidence of the Spirit and the courage to follow the counsel. It was in a second-grade elementary classroom. The student teacher held the children captive with her story-telling skills. In great detail, she told of a cross old man whose name was Mr. Black. In contrast, the account was given in similar detail of a Mr. Brown, who was kind and thoughtful and loved by everyone. At the conclusion of the story, the teacher asked the children, "How many of you would like to have Mr. Brown for a neighbor?" Every hand in the room was raised. Then, almost as an afterthought, she asked the question, "And is there anyone who would like to have Mr. Black for a neighbor?"<br><br>A little boy in a faded green shirt near the back of the room began to raise his hand, bringing a ripple of quiet amusement from the children. Hesitating only briefly, he looked around at his friends and still mustered the courage to hold his hand high and dare to stand alone in his difference. When called on for an explanation of his single vote, he spoke in a soft tone. "Well," he said, "I'd like Mr. Black to be my neighbor because if he was my neighbor, my mom would make a cake for me to take to him, and then he wouldn't be that way anymore." A hush fell over the room. Everyone felt something wonderful that they couldn't explain. A little child broke the silence like a benediction: "Oh . . . I wish I'd said that."<br><br>We had all made a quick decision about who would be the best neighbor, but only one--just one--had a spirit within, the discernment that allowed him to see what might be.<br><br>Another day I witnessed the need for the Spirit to help guide the service that was being performed by well-meaning neighbors. A widow lady said to me, "I don't need more food. My freezer is literally full of the neighbors' cakes and pies and goodies. But I need for someone to invite me to go to Temple Square with them and their children to see the Christmas lights. You don't really see the lights without the children."<br><br>Sometimes it's cake, but sometimes it isn't. It is the Spirit that will help us customize our service.<br><h2><b>Change of Heart</b></h2><br>As President Kimball once said, "God does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/12/small-acts-of-service?lang=eng">Small Acts of Service</a>,"<i>Ensign</i>, December 1974, p. 5). I believe it is one who hears and hearkens when the Lord speaks.<br><br>Consider now, even at this moment, the brother or sister sitting next to you, or the one nearby, through the hall, across the street, or down the road. Will you put yourself so in tune that you can try to see in that person what the Savior sees? Will you share with that brother or sister something that would ease a heavy load, brighten a dark day, expand a limited vision, or vitalize a dying hope, and try to do it the way you think the Savior might do it? Could you? Would you?<br><br>Given the opportunities available to each one of us this very week to live the sacramental life, can you feel within a growing strength, a yearning desire, an increased commitment to reach out? Will you consider seriously what truth of which you have a personal witness that you could teach another? And teach it in partnership with the Savior, even to the person sitting next to you who might be a stranger even though a brother or sister?<br><br>I tell you, if you will sincerely try to do this, something sweet and gentle will surround you. Voices will be softened, hearts touched, and a deep feeling of caring will swell up within. You will feel the Spirit even as you serve in his name. It will be a spiritual experience, the kind we yearn for and can have when we remember him and have his Spirit with us.<br><br>It is in reaching out to others that we qualify ourselves and become more worthy of his name. Our ordinary work, our routine duties, and our familiar relationships can become more sacramental in nature.<br><br>One day I experienced that great joy while casually sitting by a friend who had recently been called as mission president, and I thought, "What could I share with him that would help at this important time in his life?" I endeavored to see in this friend what I thought the Lord might see in him. I desired to say what would be of importance to him at this time. I had a wonderful feeling of love for my longtime friend come into my heart, and I was prompted to share with him the thoughts that had come into my mind.<br><br>"I guess at a time like this," I said, "one feels an increased urgency to have a pure vessel through which the Spirit can work unrestrained. Yet, isn't it a marvelous thing to know that you will have access to that great power, that inspiration, and even revelation every day while yet you and your missionaries are striving for perfection?"<br><br>Almost immediately his eyes were moist. His chin began to quiver, and he said, "You must have known I needed to hear that."<br><br>When we are in the church, on the bus, in the grocery store, in the classroom, and, most importantly, in our homes, let us strive to see each other the way we think we might, and, sensing that person's divine potential, let us take the opportunity to teach an eternal truth that will be personalized because the Spirit prompts us. In the closing moments of the Savior's life, while he suffered for us, he told us how we can be disciples for him:<br><br><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another</i>.<br><br><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.34-35?lang=eng#p33">John 13:34‚Äì35</a>]<br><br>Every act of our lives<i>can</i>become a sacramental experience when we take upon us his name; and when our performance falls short in spite of our striving for perfection, we will find ourselves eagerly and anxiously and more gratefully than ever before, drawn to the Sabbath day and the sacramental altar where we can feel the glorious transformation of the healing of our wounded spirits as we commit to strive again and again to follow him.<br><br>With a new day and a new week and a new opportunity, we will welcome another chance to feel more deeply, to care more sincerely, to understand more compassionately, to teach more purposefully, to remember him always, and to have his Spirit to be with us.<br><br>As I held Shelly's little hand in mine for one last squeeze before tiptoeing from her room that evening some years ago, a feeling of gratitude and reverence came flooding forth as I realized that--while her hand had been in mine for most of the afternoon as I helped her through the creek, across the rocks, and along the fallen tree trunk, and lifted her up to see the miracle of life unfolding in a robin's nest--this child had led me to begin a search that would lift me up to a better understanding of a great eternal truth. King Benjamin explained it for us:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7?lang=eng#p6">Mosiah 5:7</a>]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we can all be members of the same family. If you're doing something you shouldn't, consider Shelly's question to me, "Why don't you stop?" It may not always be easy, but with his help we can overcome.<br><br>I bear my witness to the reality of our eternal brotherhood and sisterhood, and extend my love unto each of you, my brothers and sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ, whose name we are privileged to bear. Amen.<br><br><i>Ardeth G.

<h1>ness of Being - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved fellow students of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I salute you. Yes, I salute you in the knowledge that in addition to studying the gospel of Jesus Christ, you are earnestly striving to apply that which you study and learn. I have a great admiration for you, and I deem it a privilege to be with you on this occasion. Incidentally, I have decided to speak in English English, although I realize that those who are not foreign students may also need an interpreter on occasion.<br><br>In the preparation of my remarks I have sought for the guidance of the Spirit and for a confirmation of that which I should convey to you today. I have sought for a subject which would be of general interest, this being appropriate since I am a General Authority. I realize that my challenge and opportunity is not merely to impart knowledge, but also to develop wisdom, and not only to develop wisdom, but also to evoke virtue. Emerson explained this when he stated:<br><br><i>He has knowledge, he has wisdom, but he has missed Virtue, which he only acquires who endures routine and sweat and postponement of fancy to the achievement of a worthy end.</i>[Emerson, E. W., And Forbes, W. E.,<i>Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1912), 7 (1845‚Äì1848): 115]<br><br>So that you will be better prepared for that which is to come, I will now announce the topic I shall address. It may sound a little deep, but have no fear; the meaning and application will become crystal clear as we proceed. My topic is "The Business of Being." Suffice it to say that whether we are studying social science or seismology, mathematics or music, biology or botany, linguistics or law, we are all, without exception, deeply involved in business, namely, the business of being.<br><br>In my remarks I have drawn largely from my own personal experience, and particularly from my experience in the world of industry and commerce. This was my domain for a quarter of a century before I was called into full-time service for the Lord. I know that when one uses the term<i>century</i>, even to the extent of one quarter, it does tend to date one. I feel I must therefore mention that when I was called as a General Authority in April of 1978, along with three other brethren whose average age was 54, we were referred to as "these young brethren."<br><h2><b>Maturity</b></h2><br>Now, as an introduction to the business of being, I shall briefly explain the concept of maturity. It is important for us to understand it so that we can use it as a foundation for our further discussion. I remember during my college days, a little over thirty years ago, I was classified as a "mature student." I learned that I apparently qualified for this distinguished status since I had served for three and a half years in the Royal Air Force and was also married with a baby daughter. Those responsible for classifying me as having attained maturity had obviously not checked the official definition which, as we all know, is "the quality or state of ... full development" (<i>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary</i>).<br><br>In that true sense of the word, was I a mature student? Had my service in India, Burma, and Hong Kong in the armed forces matured me? Wartime experiences certainly age one in many ways, and travel is said to broaden the mind. However, it does not necessarily deepen it.<br><br>Again, had my wonderful marriage to my childhood sweetheart brought me to maturity? It had certainly added to my responsibilities, presented many opportunities, and evoked significant decisions.<br><br>It is relatively easy to tell when a fruit is mature or ripe, and it becomes very clear when it becomes overripe. There are certain sensory tests which will indicate such maturity! How about us? Do we automatically mature and ripen over a period of time? Is it possible for a young person to be more mature than an older person? Or a small person to be more mature than a taller one?<br><br>There comes to mind the boy Jesus in the temple, "sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions" (Luke 2:46). The learned doctors of the Jewish law were astonished at his maturity. By what standards should we measure? In high school and college, I was subjected to numerous examinations and tests as you have been and are being and doubtless will be in the future.<br><br>Grades were awarded, some not so high as hoped for, others miraculously higher. Are academic attainments the measure of maturity? I think of the learned Saul of Tarsus, taught at the feet of Gamaliel, whose learning prompted him to persecute the Christians. How wonderful that he should declare, after his miraculous conversion, "For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified" (1 Corinthians 2:2). I repeat, then, are academic attainments the measure of maturity?<br><br>As with you, however, not all of my time as a student was in the lecture room or library. I spent many hours at the track, training for athletic events. As a result I was selected for the team, not only in athletics, but in rugby football and cricket. (Incidentally, in rugby football, which is akin to your football, we wore no padding, whereas for cricket, the so-called gentlemen's game, we did wear padding. This may change your ideas on British sports!) Are sporting achievements, then, the measure of maturity?<br><br>I am reminded of a letter from a fine young lady, divorced after only two years of marriage, who complained, "All my husband thought about was sport, sport, sport. He wasn't interested in the partnership of marriage." Perhaps we could conclude that he wasn't mature enough for marriage, even though he was a great ballplayer.<br><br>What of social pursuits? During my formal education I had gained some knowledge of the social graces, an appreciation of the arts, a certain ability to communicate with others. Are these the keys to maturity?<br><br>As is so often the case, the Savior's life provides the answer, for Luke tells us that "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). Here then is the key: balanced progression in the four fields of human endeavor--mental, physical, spiritual, and social.<br><h2><b>The Spiritual Dimension</b></h2><br>Brigham Young University excels in providing such a balanced program. Few universities can claim such a curriculum. I pray that we may all take full advantage of it and realize that we are greatly blessed to have such high standards expected of us.<br><br>When I was a full-time student in England from 1948 to 1950 at the University of Nottingham, I did not have the good fortune to be a Latter-day Saint. I did not have the vision of my purpose in life and of the pattern of progress and effort required to fulfill my purpose. Academically, athletically, socially, I did reasonably well. Spiritually, I was somewhat lacking, for I had a form of religion without real substance. I had been active in my church all my life but could not have answered basic doctrinal questions if challenged to do so.<br><br>My real progress commenced when I was almost 24 years old. I had just graduated with honors in economics and law and had started my career in industry as a management trainee with a large textiles, chemicals, and plastics company. Within weeks, Mormon missionaries were led--and I repeat, were led--to our door. As a matter of fact, the Lord sent three missionaries to our door. I think he realized it was going to be a little tough. Furthermore, my wife informed me they all had the same first name--Elmer Jones, Elmer Cordingley, and Elmer Seastrand, which only goes to show that we should speak very clearly when we're proclaiming the gospel.<br><br>Everyone who has seen the excellent filmstrip where President Kimball shows us how to be member missionaries knows that there are certain circumstances which facilitate friendshipping. We were a classic case of changed circumstances bringing added receptivity to the gospel message. Not only had I just commenced my first civilian employment, but we had moved into a new home, and, to top it all, our second baby had just arrived.<br><br>Yes, many of our circumstances in life had changed, but, through the missionaries, God bless them, our whole outlook on life subsequently changed. We were taught the plan of salvation, God's plan for our eternal progression, God's plan to help us reach full development, which is true maturity. Our values changed, and therefore our standards of measurement changed as we realized the truthfulness of the message they taught. Our lives started to become fuller and more purposeful, to ripen and mature. That message I declare to you today in all solemnity and power. Jesus Christ, the only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father, is our personal Savior and Redeemer. He has restored his church and gospel as was prophesied, and has once again spoken through prophets, beginning with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he speaks today through our beloved Spencer W. Kimball, a true prophet of the Lord.<br><br>A friend who had seen the change in our lives, particularly with regard to the Word of Wisdom, said, "You will never get on in business if you don't smoke or drink." How wrong he was, for he went bankrupt, and I progressed. Our baptism was a veritable turning point, for the eyes of our understanding had been opened. For us, the business of being had really commenced, with the Holy Ghost, bestowed upon us following baptism, to help us and guide us and comfort us and teach us "the peaceable things of the kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 36:2).<br><br>My first real assignment in industry was almost simultaneous with baptism. Some thought it was premature promotion for a junior trainee, but the windows of heaven were in reality opening up, and the promised blessings of tithe paying were pouring forth on our humble little family (Malachi 3:10). I say<i>humble</i>advisedly because it was not easy to care for a family of four on a gross income equivalent to around one hundred dollars a month! How grateful we were, and are, for the principle of tithing, and what an easy principle to observe! We pay our tithing first, and then the Lord helps us to use our nine-tenths wisely. I can bear testimony of that.<br><br>We have never worried about worldly possessions. When we joined the Church we had no car, no telephone, no washing machine, refrigerator, or vacuum cleaner. We have always appreciated the Lord's admonition and promise:<br><br><i>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</i>[Matthew 6:33]<br><br>I can certainly testify to the reality of this promise, for the things which would help us do the Lord's work more effectively were added unto us.<br><br>The reverse is also true, for we went back to our first home after 25 years. Some of our old neighbors were still there, just the same; they had not progressed at all. They had rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ and were spiritually dead.<br><h2><b>Parallels</b></h2><br>I feel sure you would be interested to hear a little more about my first major assignment in industry. It was a fascinating one, which plunged me into the marvelous world of petrochemicals. I was given charge of the costs and statistics and administration services. Suddenly I was rubbing shoulders with chemists, engineers, and chemical engineers. I was soon using their technical language, drawing process flow charts, producing progress reports, and making thousands of calculations, estimates, and projections.<br><br>There were raw materials and by-products, catalysts and joint-products, yields and efficiencies. It was a lot of work, but a lot of fun, for I enjoyed my work immensely. It was not just my vision of industry that was being widened, but my view of life. There are so many parallels between the industrial process and the business of being.<br><br>I soon discovered that petrochemicals were just the start of a whole series of interrelated processes, which on that particular industrial site covered 350 acres and employed approximately 10,000 people. It was fascinating to see the raw materials coming in through the factory gates, the trainloads of oil and truckloads of raw cellulose, and many other packages of every shape and size. After a while I would see vehicles leaving the factory laden with beautiful fabrics and useful plastics, and I wondered how this miracle had happened. The conclusion became obvious as I studied not only the industrial process but also the business of being. Conversion had taken place! I came to appreciate the industrial process which could make such marvelous transformations, so that rivers of oil and mountains of wood pulp could be converted into things to be worn and used every day.<br><br>What then of life? Is it not a process? Is it not the process of becoming? Do we not need to undergo changes, transformations, even conversions, to become what we need to become, what our Father expects and hopes we shall become?<br><h2><b>Raw Materials</b></h2><br>What are the raw materials our Eternal Father entrusted to us as we started our journey in mortality, as we commenced the process of becoming like him? First, our intelligence, "or, in other words, light and truth" within us (D&amp;amp;C 93:36); second, our spirit bodies, provided by him, for he is the very "Father of spirits" (Hebrews 12:9);third, our physical bodies, in which our spirits are tabernacled during our earthly sojourn; fourth, our inborn gifts and talents, for "every good gift cometh of Christ" (Moroni 10:18); fifth, "An earth whereon (we) may dwell" (Abraham 3:24); and sixth, the time allotted, which we should "not idle away" (D&amp;amp;C 60:13).<br><h2><b>The Process</b></h2><br>The way we use, or rather convert, these precious raw materials is the very business of being. The Savior asked: "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke 2:49). What is our Father's business? Is it not "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man"? (Moses 1:39).This then must be maturity, the attainment of full development. However, the attainment of eternal life is a very long process. The Savior taught:<br><br><i>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life.</i>[Matthew 7:14]<br><br>The way leading to life, that is, eternal life, is not only strait and narrow, requiring discipline and obedience; it is also long, very long. The prophet Nephi emphasized this fact when he declared that, after entering on the straight and narrow path,<br><br><i>ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life</i>[2 Nephi 31:20].<br><br>How great is the quality of endurance to the end!<br><br>Returning to our petrochemicals plant, the very first process was a "cracking" operation, where the oil was passed through intense furnace heat and cracked into various gas and oil components. As a young boy I was impressed, and still am, by the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who, being true to God and refusing to bow down to idols, were cast into the fiery furnace by King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. The king was astonished when he beheld not three but four men walking in the midst of the fire without hurt, and declared: "and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God" (Daniel 3:25).<br><br>Are you able to withstand the heat of criticism, the pressures of temptation, the "fiery darts of the wicked"? (D&amp;amp;C 27:17). The Lord does not want us to crack, not even to have a crack in our armor of virtue. He wants us to come through unscathed, by having taken upon ourselves truth, righteousness, and faith, and then going forth and preaching the gospel of peace through the Spirit within us.<br><br>We shall do it, providing we build our foundations on the "rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God ... a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall" (Helaman 5:12).<br><br>I have asked a number of people the question, Would you sooner feel safe or unsafe? The answer has been, without exception, "I would sooner feel safe, of course." Why is it, then, that so many of us behave as though we believe otherwise? If we do, or even think, something unclean or unworthy, we are not safe, for the Holy Ghost will withdraw. "The Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples" (Helaman 4:24).<br><br>My experience in petrochemicals gave me further food for thought, for out of the cracking process came heavier oils which were then refined into a whole range of useful products. For centuries, even millennia, the principle of refining has been a significant part of the industrial process, particularly with regard to precious metals. The Lord himself is like "a refiner's fire" (Malachi 3:2), and, as we pattern ourselves on him, we shall have the dross, the waste, cast out. On this basis, may we ask ourselves the questions, Are we purer than we were a year ago, a month ago, a week ago? Have we overcome habits and traditions which have held us back from progressing?<br><br>In the business of being, it is not only the conversion process which is important, but also the efficiency of conversion. How effectively are we converting the God-given raw materials of which we have spoken? What has been the yield of product in our lives? For example, how much time have we wasted, how much talent is still undeveloped, and how much intellect has been ignored? Yes, brain and spirit, energy and talent, space and time, are all within our stewardship. Our beneficent Father has not provided these that we might misuse them, but that we might convert them into lives of example and service to others.<br><br><i>And whoso is found a faithful, a just, and a wise steward shall enter into the joy of his Lord, and shall inherit eternal life.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 51:19]<br><br>Fellow students of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I commend you for your faithfulness, but I say to you, "Be even more faithful." I commend you for your achievements in many fields of activity and study, but I say to you, "Be even more diligent." I commend you for the spirituality you have developed and which you emanate and which I feel at this time, but I say to you, "Be even more spiritual."<br><br>I pray, in the words of the apostle Paul, that my speech and my preaching have not been<br><br><i>with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</i><br><br><i>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</i>[1 Corinthians 2:4‚Äì5]<br><br>I further pray that the "Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent [may have] wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2), this having been the transforming effect of King Benjamin's address.<br><h2><b>A Parable</b></h2><br>In closing, I would like to give you a parable. There was a certain man who, desiring to enjoy the beauties of nature, betook himself for a woodland stroll by the side of a clear, flowing river. As he contemplated the magnificence of God's handiwork, he neglected to observe the uneven path where tree roots straggled down to the water's edge. He stumbled and fell headlong into the river. The water was deeper than he had thought, and he could not swim! He cried out, but who would hear, as the water engulfed him in darkness? He surfaced and tried to shout again, his hopes bedimmed, and a second time he sank. His call was weaker as he rose for the last time, and who would hear him now? But someone else was walking nearby and heard the man's cries, dived in, saved him, and brought him safely to the bank. When the man recovered, he looked up into the face of the one who had saved him and said, "Oh, thank you, thank you for saving me. What can I do to show my love and appreciation?"<br><br>The one who had saved him smiled and said: "There are many things you can do for me," and then he taught him lovingly and carefully. Then a sad thing happened. Although the man who had been saved lived, the man who saved him died as a result of the experience. Despite his sorrow, the one saved had a warm feeling within him, for he knew what to do to show his love and gratitude for his savior.<br><br>So it is with us, for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, died that we might live. We know what we should do, for he has told us: "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><h2><b>Affirmation</b></h2><br>There is nothing more precious to me than my testimony of Jesus Christ. I have a witness that he is my Savior and Redeemer, the Son of the Almighty God; Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father. I know how Heavenly Father so loved us, so loved the world, the he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br>I am grateful for the missionaries who traveled 6,000 miles to share the gospel with our little family. I am grateful for the love of my Heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, and all those who follow him who have helped me in the business of being. I know that Jesus Christ lives today. I have a witness of the risen Lord; I know that he lives and that he leads this, his church, the only true and living church in all the world. And I know that our Savior speaks to us, as he did anciently, through prophets, through the prophet Spencer W. Kimball today, a mighty man of God, a true prophet of the Lord.<br><br>May the full blessings of the Lord be with you in your studies and in your personal lives, in your challenges and in your decision making, in your maturing and in the very business of being, which is to grow "unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Derek A.

<br>
Despite the fact that we are living in a troublesome period, we are living in the dispensation of the fullness of times, a most wonderful period in the history of the world--yes, in a new era of growth and development. In my judgment, opportunities today, for young and old, exceed those of any other age. We should be truly grateful to live at this particular time when the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon the people of the earth so abundantly.<br><br>A universal question in the hearts and minds of men and women in all parts of the world is, What is the purpose of life?<br><br>The restored gospel of Jesus Christ answers the questions, Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go after this life? With this knowledge, we are in a preferred position to accomplish worthwhile objectives through short-range and long-range goals.<br><br>I would like to discuss with you the purpose of life, how each of us is endowed with talents, and how, through proper work habits, being honest and patient, each can accomplish worthwhile objectives.<br><br>It is not unusual to hear a religious leader, a philosopher, or a poet refer to mortal beings as having a divine spark within them. Such characterizations imply that we possess great abilities and potentialities.<br><br>What does it mean to have a divine spark within you? Presumably it means that you have a certain relationship with God. From time to time, throughout the history of the world, God has made known to us what this relationship is.<br><br>The scriptures teach that God is a personal being in whose image we were created and that God the Father is the literal Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the Father of the spirits of all of us. Because of this relationship, we inherit divine attributes. This thought was beautifully stated when Job of old explained that: "There is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding" (Job 32:8). Further, the apostle John testified that Jesus was "the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (John 1:9). In this dispensation, President Joseph F. Smith bore witness to this same truth that the light of Christ, the Spirit of truth, lighteth everyone who is born into the world (see<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, p. 67‚Äì68).<br><br>This simple doctrine as taught by Christ gave way to human theories and dogmas throughout the hundreds of years of apostasy. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints proclaims to the world that the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fullness and simplicity has been restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br>We assert that God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and that Christ&#39;s church has been reestablished on the earth. Thus, through modern revelation, God&#39;s relationship to his children has again been clarified. I ask you to seriously consider the fact that the life of your earthly body is your spirit, and that God the Eternal Father is the Father of your spirit.<br><br>With this relationship we are thus blessed with many talents and possess great potentialities. The Savior set our greatest goal for us when he said: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48).<br><br>To become perfect requires growth and development, and as we contemplate perfection, we recognize that growth is the greatest phenomenon of this existence.<br><br>The Church teaches the value and possibility of eternal progression. We progressed in the preexistence, and we have the opportunity to progress in this estate and throughout all eternity.<br><br>During his earthly ministry, the Savior gave a beautiful parable dealing with the requirement that we develop the talents with which we are endowed.<br><br>The talent was an ancient weight and money unit. The dictionary defines<i>talent</i>as "the abilities, powers, and gifts bestowed upon a person; natural endowments, thought of as a divine trust; a natural capability or gift."<br><br>The parable of the entrusted talents told of a man who was about to leave on a long trip, and who therefore called his servants together and gave them his goods. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. To each man he gave according to his ability.<br><br>While the master was away, the one who received five talents put them to use and made five more talents, the man who received two talents put them to use and made two more, but the one who received one talent hid it in the ground.<br><br>After a period of time, the master returned and asked for an accounting. Unto each of the servants who had doubled his talents the master said:<br><br><i>Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</i>[Matthew 25:23]<br><br>The master called the servant who hid his talent and did not multiply it a slothful servant and said that he would take the one talent from him and give it to the servant who had ten talents.<br><br>From the man endowed with many talents, more was expected than from the men with lesser talents, yet all were expected to multiply such talents as they were given. Good use of what he was given by the man given one talent was just as important and necessary as by the men given two and five talents.<br><br>In this dispensation, the Lord has been equally direct in his charge to his children. He has told us that he has given us many things "for the benefit of the Church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold (D&amp;amp;C 82:18). He has admonished us that "of him unto whom much is given much is required" (D&amp;amp;C 82:3).<br><br>And then he also said:<br><br><i>But with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of men. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.</i><br><br><i>And it shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even that which they have.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:2‚Äì3]<br><br>And then we are charged:<br><br><i>Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 60:13]<br><br>These scriptures clearly emphasize our obligations to use and develop the gifts and talents we have been blessed with--let us say, to develop the spark of divinity that is within us. Human experience confirms the soundness of this doctrine.<br><h2><b>How to Develop Talents</b></h2><br>Each of us then should be concerned about<i>how</i>best to develop our gifts and our talents. First, we should recognize our talents and make up our minds to pay the price necessary to develop them. The price to be paid in developing talents includes, among other things, faith, work, study, persistence, and patience.<br><br>In developing faith, we must never overlook the fact that we are spirit children of God the Eternal Father, and that our Father in Heaven will assist us in developing our talents as we do our part. One way in which he will assist us is to open up opportunities for us to use our talents.<br><h2><b>Fear--A Negative Influence</b></h2><br>Some recognize their talents, but we are told they do not use them because of the fear of men. Fear destroys faith and deprives us of many blessings. This fact was clearly brought out in a revelation when the Lord said:<br><br><i>Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 67:3]<br><br>We must, therefore, overcome fear. The Lord has told us that if we are prepared we shall not fear (see D&amp;amp;C 38:30).<br><h2><b>Study</b></h2><br>Preparation involves study, and we are counseled to "seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Eternal progress involves continual study. Increased learning gives us confidence, confidence engenders faith, and faith banishes fear.<br><br>The Lord has told us that "the glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36), and that "it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance" (D&amp;amp;C 131:6).<br><br>Also:<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18‚Äì19]<br><br>An American businessmen had this to say about his study of the Bible:<br><br><i>What most impresses me, as I look backward, is the immense application I have made of Bible truths in my daily life. From the lack of education, I relied on the Bible as my textbook, in every conceivable problem that arose. Only when I deviated from this teaching did I fail.</i><br><br><i>He who does not live daily in its guidance is foolish, for he is rejecting the greatest source of personal profit that exists in the world. The Bible is the greatest how-to-do-it book ever compiled, and it covers every fundamental that anyone really needs to know.</i><br><br>Let us be honest with ourselves and get into the habit of reading and studying the Bible and the other standard works of the Church as a guide to a rich and rewarding life.<br><h2><b>Use Talents</b></h2><br>We should also appreciate that talents are developed by use, and they will not grow and multiply unless they are used. This principle was clearly taught in the Savior&#39;s parables. As we develop our talents, we should develop the spirit of sharing or giving, not only with those who are closest to us, but with all of God&#39;s children. Remember the words of King Benjamin:<br><br><i>When ye are in the service of your fellow beings, ye are only in the service of your God.</i>[Mosiah 2:17]<br><br>One of the most important and distinguishing features of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that its affairs are administered by lay members of the Church rather than by a paid clergy. Talents may be developed in many areas of teaching, speaking, missionary work, music, drama, dancing, athletics of many kinds, Scout work, genealogical and temple work, welfare programs, compassionate service, and many other fields that might be mentioned--all contributing to the development of talents and leadership.<br><br>May I encourage you, therefore, to accept every opportunity presented to you to serve with enthusiasm, not as a burden, but as a great blessing. Organize your time by putting first things first, and perform each assignment well. As you do so, the divine spark within you will be magnified, and your talents will be increased.<br><h2><b>Work</b></h2><br>Utah is known as the Beehive State. The early settlers, under the leadership of Brigham Young, named this area "Deseret," meaning<i>honey bee</i>. Therefore, the state motto is "Industry." Each of us is entitled to immortality through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, but in order to enjoy eternal life, or exaltation in the celestial kingdom, we must<i>work</i>out our salvation day by day.<br><br>A wise man said: "Yesterday is gone, tomorrow may never come, but today is here." This same impressive theme is woven into our beautiful hymn entitled "Today While the Sun Shines":<br><br><i>Today, while the sun shines, work with a will;</i><br><br><i>Today all your duties with patience fulfill; . . .</i><br><br><i>Today, today, work while you may.</i><br><br><i>There is no tomorrow, but only today.</i><br><br>[Evans Stephens,<i>Hymns</i>, no. 216]<br><br>When Adam was cast out of the Garden of Eden, he was told,<br><br><i>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken.</i>[Genesis 3:19]<br><br>What a marvelous philosophy--the gospel of work, combined with the challenge to perform willingly today&#39;s work<i>today!</i>President McKay said: "Let us . . . realize that the<i>privilege to work</i>is a gift, that the<i>power</i>to work is a blessing, that the<i>love</i>to work is success." (<i>CR</i>, October 1909, p. 94). How true this is! Yet today, as in earlier times, many misguided individuals embrace the philosophy of idleness, feeling that the world owes them a living. Many have a desire to destroy the establishment that has been built upon productive effort.<br><br>In this dispensation, the Lord has many times confirmed the eternal principle of work. We have been told:<br><br><i>The idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 75:29]<br><br>Also:<br><br><i>He that is idle shall not eat the bread or wear the garments of the laborer.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:42]<br><br>Ever since its organization, the Church has encouraged its members to establish and maintain their economic independence. It has encouraged thrift and fostered the establishment of employment-creating industries.<br><br>At the time the present welfare program of the Church was established, the First Presidency explained that the primary purpose was to<br><br><i>set up . . . a system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift, and self-respect be once more established amongst our people. The aim of the Church is to help the people help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church membership.</i>[Heber J. Grant, CR, October 1936, p. 3]<br><br>These are eternal principles and are as applicable to us today as they were when they were given. They do not mean that we do not recognize the need for change. Nothing is static! All things change! We accept the law of change; this is the law of progression.<br><br>The gospel of work brings change and progression. The Savior continually emphasized the doctrine of unselfishness and sacrifice, and it is apparent that there is no real success or happiness in being self-centered and selfish.<br><br>Let me suggest, therefore, the advisability of engaging in some work that involves service to our fellowmen and some sacrifice of our time, our talents, and our means. In this type of work one can easily develop a love of work as well as a love of people. Success in these areas almost always manifests itself in growth and change in the lives of all the persons involved.<br><br>Coupled with worthwhile objectives, we must learn to work compatibly with people. Some seem to be born with this talent, and others have to acquire it. Fortunately, this love of people and work can be developed.<br><br>Another essential factor to consider at this point is loyalty. Being loyal to an employer or to a cause for which one is working is a key step in developing a love of work and in achieving success. A great merchandiser once said: "We would rather have one man or woman working<i>with</i>us than three merely working<i>for</i>us."<br><br>The desire for superior achievement comes from our Heavenly Father. However, too many people are imbued with the spirit of "just getting by." This spirit comes from the evil one. Let us avoid the habit of "just getting by" as it will rob us of the choicest rewards. Whether our work is mainly mental or physical or a combination of both, we should learn to do it well.<br><br>In searching for ways to develop a love of work, we must not overlook the matter of relaxation. Although work is absolutely essential to achievement, relaxation and proper rest are likewise necessary. The power to pace oneself is an important factor in developing a love of work. The Lord expects each of us to work out a proper balance between work and relaxation, as well as the physical and spiritual aspects of life.<br><br>It will be to our eternal advantage to recognize that work is the secret of growth, progress, and happiness in both temporal and spiritual fields. Good work habits include such qualities as dependability, loyalty to employer, willingness to go the extra mile, and he ability to find happiness and purpose in your work.<br><br>I encourage you to set worthwhile and realistic objectives and to be satisfied only with superior achievement.<br><br>The philosophy of work, of going the extra mile, is a sound philosophy. It is a vital part of the gospel of Jesus Christ which will lead us to eternal life. Accept every opportunity to serve in building the kingdom of God, and I bear you my witness that as you do your part, the Lord will make you equal to every task that you are called upon to perform.<br><h2><b>Difficulties</b></h2><br>The story of most men and women who obtain a degree of greatness and achievement is generally the story of a person&#39;s overcoming handicaps. It appears that there are some lessons in life that can be learned only through the overcoming of obstacles.<br><br>I am told that over the entrance to a great European university campus there is an inscription that reads:<br><br><i>Nothing worthwhile ever comes to a person except by the anguish of his soul, and the sweat of his brow.</i><br><br>Although it is not customary for one to seek out difficult or unpleasant experiences, it is true that the trials and tribulations of life which stand in the way of our growth and development become stepping stones by which we climb to great heights, providing, of course, that we do not permit them to destroy us.<br><br>Two of the most interesting and trying experiences of this dispensation were those of Zion&#39;s Camp and Liberty Jail, both of which not only influenced the lives of great men but also greatly affected the history of the Church.<br><h2><b>Zion&#39;s Camp</b></h2><br>When the members of the Church in Missouri were being persecuted, the Prophet Joseph Smith made their tribulation a matter of prayer and received a revelation on 24 February 1834. The Lord instructed the prophet to assemble at least 100 young men and middle-aged men and go to the land of Zion or Missouri (see D&amp;amp;C 103:19‚Äì20, 34).<br><br>Zion&#39;s Camp, a group of approximately 150 men, gathered at Kirtland, Ohio, in the spring of 1834 and marched to western Missouri. By the time they reached Missouri, the camp had increased to approximately 200 men.<br><br>The purpose of the trek was to join the Saints in Missouri, to buy lands in Jackson County and surrounding counties, and to retrieve those lands taken by mobs who had dispossessed the Missouri Saints of considerable portions of their property.<br><br>When they reached Missouri, after extensive negotiations with Governor Dunklin failed to produce desired results, it was felt advisable to disband Zion&#39;s Camp and await some future opportunity for the redemption of Zion.<br><br>Most of those who had formed Zion&#39;s Camp returned to Kirtland which was, at that time, the center of ecclesiastical activity.<br><br>The "journey to Zion&#39;s Camp" was regarded by many as an unprofitable and unsuccessful episode. A brother in Kirtland who did not go with the camp, meeting Brigham Young on his return, said to him: "Well, what did you gain on this useless journey to Missouri with Joseph Smith?"<br><br>"All we went for!" replied Brigham Young. "I would not exchange the experience I gained on the expedition for all the wealth in Geauga County."<br><br>The journey covered more than 1,000 miles, and there were dissentions from within and hostile demonstrations from without. There were hardships and disappointments, but these experiences had real value because from this group many became the leaders in the exodus of 12,000 people from Missouri to Nauvoo, and then later many became leaders in the great western exodus from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley.<br><br>In February 1835, the brethren who had accompanied the Prophet Joseph to Missouri as members of Zion&#39;s Camp were called together, and from their numbers the Quorum of the Twelve and the Seventies were chosen. The Prophet explained that the trials and tribulations endured by the members of Zion&#39;s Camp were not in vain, and it was the will of God<br><br><i>that those who went to Zion, with a determination to lay down their lives, if necessary, should be ordained to the ministry, and go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:182]<br><br>In the light of these events, it is evident that Zion&#39;s Camp experiences were of immense value both to the individuals involved and to the Church.<br><h2><b>Liberty Jail</b></h2><br>One of the darkest periods in the history of the Church was the winter of 1838‚Äì39. The Saints had been persecuted, robbed, and murdered. The Prophet and his associates had been betrayed and were imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Dissention and apostasy were rampant, and the Church appeared to be faced with disintegration and ruin. But emerging from this dark period were the men who led the Church through trying experiences as well as amazing growth and development. But this was not all: It was during these dark days that the Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, while in Liberty Jail, a great revelation. Liberty Jail for a time became a center of instruction.<br><br>Elder B. H. Roberts, in the<i>Comprehensive History of the Church</i>, had this to say:<br><br><i>The eyes of the saints were turned to it</i>[Liberty Jail]<i>as the place whence would come encouragement, counsel--the word of the Lord. It was more temple than prison, so long as the Prophet was there. It was a place of meditation and prayer. A temple, first of all, is a place of prayer; and prayer is communion with God. It is the "infinite in man seeking the infinite in God." Where they find each other, there is holy sanctuary--a temple. Joseph Smith sought God in this rude prison, and found him. Out of the midst of his tribulations he called upon God in passionate earnestness.</i>[<i>HC,</i>1:526]<br><br>The answer came as God replied:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then,</i>if thou endure it well<i>, God shall exalt thee on high.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7‚Äì8; emphasis added]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith was told that if great tribulation should beset him and even if<br><br><i>the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou great than he?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:7‚Äì8]<br><br>We know that one of the important purposes of this life is to be proved, tried, and tested. Both the Zion&#39;s Camp and Liberty Jail experiences truly constituted a refiner&#39;s fire for those who participated in them, and both emphasize the necessity of experiencing difficult and complex situations in life in order to develop properly and to draw close to our Heavenly Father. These experiences certainly give us a better understanding and appreciation of the greatness of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the early leaders of the Church.<br><br>But what can we learn from the Zion&#39;s Camp and Liberty Jail experiences that will be helpful to us? Certainly two impressive truths are apparent: First, it is important to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and loyalty to our leaders and to the Church; second, we must endure to the end, regardless of how many difficulties we have to surmount.<br><h2><b>Patience</b></h2><br>The apostle Paul, in writing to the Roman Saints, said:<br><br><i>We glory in tribulation . . . knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</i><br><br><i>And patience, experience, and experience, hope.</i>[Romans 5:3‚Äì4]<br><br>In 1828, the Lord, in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, said:<br><br><i>Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 10:4]<br><br>By exercising patience, we will not be inclined to run faster or labor more than our strength justifies. In this regard, an adage which has been particularly helpful and inspirational to me is: "Survey large fields, but cultivate small ones." Often, we want to cultivate large fields before we are properly prepared and equipped to do so. It is not unusual for one to develop the idea that the grass on the other side of the fence is greener. But in every aspect of life, we should realize that a "rolling stone gathers no moss." Assuming that "moss" in this axiom means the better things of life, patience, or staying on the job, or magnifying one&#39;s calling, will bring these better things to us. Then to develop patience, "don&#39;t expect too much too soon." Make the most of what you have.<br><br>And so our trials and tribulations, as we meet them with patience, give us valuable experience and prepare us for challenges that lie ahead. I encourage you to develop patience in your daily lives and to enjoy the satisfaction of accomplishment, free from many of the customary pressures and strains incident to modern living.<br><br>We should exert our best efforts to accomplish our righteous objectives, utilizing every legitimate means but not permitting ourselves to commit a wrong in our quest for the right. It is better to lose than to win an unjust or dishonest cause. Each of us is endowed with the right to choose good or evil, and we should recognize that we do not succeed, neither are we destroyed by other people or by conditions, but rather by our own decisions.<br><h2><b>Purpose of Life</b></h2><br>What, then is the purpose of life? To be proved, to grow, to develop in accordance with the principles of the gospel, and to prepare ourselves for the next estate. Each of us has the capacity to achieve worthwhile objectives, and we should never forget that we are actually spirit children of our Father in Heaven and that every person is given a gift by the Spirit of God (see D&amp;amp;C 46:11).<br><br>Organize your time by putting first things first, and perform each assignment well. By so doing, you will be magnified, and your talents will be increased as the Lord has said, "Yea, even an hundred fold" (D&amp;amp;C 82:18). The Lord has indicated that it is his<i>work</i>and glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man (see Moses 1:39). What a great work! And we can help him by living in accordance with gospel principles.<br><br>I am grateful that my spirit has been reserved to come to earth in this, the dispensation of the fullness of times. I bear my witness that God lives; that Jesus is the Christ, our Redeemer and Savior; and that Joseph Smith was, and is, one of the greatest prophets of all time. The Holy Ghost has borne witness to me that the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith restored the gospel in its fullness, restored the power to act in the name of God, and reestablished his church on the earth. As a result, we have today a great prophet at the head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, our beloved Spencer W. Kimball. I, like you, love and sustain our great prophet and leader.<br><br>Brigham Young once said:<br><br><i>You cannot find a compass on earth that points so directly, as the Gospel plan of salvation. It has a place for everything, and puts everything in its place.</i>[<i>JD</i>3:96]<br><br>How true this is! The gospel explains the purpose of life. Living the gospel principles brings peace, happiness, joy, contentment, growth, and development. I bear you this witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Franklin D. Richards was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 June 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> of Charity - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The text for my address this morning, "The Bond of Charity," comes from the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the 125th verse:<br><br><i>And above all things clothe yourselves with a bond of charity as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.</i><br><br>I selected this topic because "The Bond of Charity" was the theme for the Annual University Conference this past year, a theme the administration believed should not only characterize that conference but serve as a guide to the university community throughout the year. I was assigned responsibilities in connection with that conference, one of which was to suggest possible themes. After weeks of searching for what I thought might be a possible theme and then an evening of going through many of my favorite books, sure that I would find exactly what would be the right theme for our conference, I lay down, no closer to coming to a suggested topic than I was when I began. As I lay on the bed, I felt prompted to read the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. If you have read that section lately, you know it is very long, and at one o&#39;clock in the morning I did not particularly want to read it. Themes for past conferences had been selected from the 88th section so as I was reading it, I kept saying to myself, "We&#39;re not going to take a theme from this section"--until I came to the 125th verse. As I read that, I was impressed that this verse should provide the theme. Ironically, that was the day Jeffrey R. Holland was appointed president of Brigham Young University. I met with him the following week, shared the experience I have shared with you, and asked him for his opinion. He replied, "That is a more inspired choice than you know. I have come to Brigham Young University with my own prayers for an administration characterized by unity and peace. &#39;The Bond of Charity&#39; is exactly the right phrase."<br><br>Since that experience last August, I have felt this was an inspired choice for more personal reasons. As I began to think about the bond of charity, I realize how little I really knew about charity, so I made it a study topic for the year. I read about it, thought about it, and pondered about it. I also began to be aware of the kinds of love and charity that other people extended to me. As a result of those experiences, I have tried to pull together the feelings, thoughts, and attitudes I have had as I have sought to learn about charity during this past year, and today I want to explore four main ideas that have emerged. First, what is charity? Second, why is charity, or love, important? Third, what are the effects when we love? And finally, how do we show love toward other people?<br><h2><b>What Is Charity?</b></h2><br>First, what is charity? To answer this question, I want to turn to the scriptures for some definitions. In 2 Nephi 26:30 we read:<br><br><i>The Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love.</i><br><br>In that verse we learn that<i>charity</i>and<i>love</i>are used interchangeably. In the seventh and eighth chapters of Moroni, we find considerable writing on charity. Reading first from Moroni 8, verse 17:<br><br><i>And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love.</i><br><br>In that verse we have the explanation that charity is, first of all, everlasting love and, secondly, perfect love.<br><br>As we turn back to Moroni 7, verse 47, we read:<br><br><i>Charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</i><br><br>The idea that charity is, in fact, the pure love of Christ is discussed in an article in the February 1979<i>Ensign</i>, entitled, "Becoming a Zion Society." The author, Quinn Gardner, suggested that charity, the pure love of Christ, is bestowed upon those of us who submit to the covenants and the powers of the atonement of Jesus Christ. This pure love is the kind of love that sustained a Zion society for four generations. You will remember in 4 Nephi it is recorded that the Nephites experienced no contention in the land "because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people" (4 Nephi 15). This is also the kind of love that produced the city of Enoch, that City of Holiness, even Zion, whose people, we are told by Moses, "were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them" (Moses 7:18).<br><br>I suppose the most classic and frequently referred to definitions of charity are those found in Moroni 7 and the almost identical words found in 1 Corinthians 13. Each time I read those scriptures, I have thought that Mormon and Paul were providing us with a definition of how we are to love other people. A book called "Love Is Now," by Peter Gillquist (Grand Rapids: Zondevan, 1970), suggests that, in addition to being that, it also is a definition of how our Heavenly Father loves us. Keep that in mind while I review 1 Corinthians 13. I have specifically chosen to read it not from the King James Version, but from the New English Bible because I think it gives some added insights not found in the King James Version.<br><br><i>Love is patient; love is kind and envies no one. Love is never boastful, nor conceited, nor rude; never selfish, not quick to take offense. Love keeps no score of wrongs; does not gloat over other men&#39;s sins, but delights in the truth. There is nothing love cannot face; there is no limit to its faith, its hope, and its endurance.</i><br><br><i>Love will never come to an end.</i>[vss. 4‚Äì8]<br><br>I don&#39;t have time this morning to talk about all of the characteristics of charity mentioned in 1 Corinthians, but I want to examine the first one: Love is patient, or, in the King James Version, charity suffereth long. As I have thought about this, I have come to believe that our Heavenly Father is much more patient with us than we are with ourselves. We seem to have within us a drive for perfection, and sometimes we are not very patient with ourselves. I think the drive for perfection is as it should be, for we are counseled in Matthew:<br><br><i>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</i>[Matthew 5:48]<br><br>But while there is nothing about a time limit in the perfection process, sometimes I find myself praying, "Lord, make me patient--<i>right now!</i>" I am beginning to understand and believe that perfection is a lifelong process and one that frequently is not easy, but painful. This idea is reinforced by some of the things C. S. Lewis wrote in his book<i>Mere Christianity.</i>Lewis talks about Christ&#39;s asking his disciples, his believers, to count the cost before becoming Christians.<br><br><i>Make no mistake,</i>[Christ would say]<i>if you let Me, I will make you perfect. The moment you put yourself in My hands, that is what you are in for. Nothing less, or other, than that. You have free will, and if you choose, you can push Me away. But if you do not push Me away, understand that I am going to see this job through. Whatever suffering it may cost you in your earthly life, whatever inconceivable purification it may cost you after death, whatever it costs Me, I will never rest, nor let you rest, until you are literally perfect--until My Father can say without reservation that He is well pleased with you, as He said He was well pleased with Me. This I can do and will do. But I will not do anything less.</i><br><br><i>God&#39;s demand for perfection need not discourage you in the least in your present attempts to be good, or even in your present failures. Each time you fall He will pick you up again. And He knows perfectly well that your own efforts are never going to bring you anywhere near perfection. On the other hand, you must realize from the onset that the goal toward which He is beginning to guide you is absolute perfection; and no power in the whole universe, except you yourself can prevent Him from taking you to that goal. That is what you are in for.</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1960, pp. 172, 174]<br><br>Lewis goes on to quote the analogy by George McDonald, comparing life to a house:<br><br><i>Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that he is building quite a different house from the one you thought of--throwing out a new wing here, putting up an extra floor there, running up towers, and making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage, but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.</i>[p. 176]<br><br>Heavenly Father is always patient. Love is patient; it is long-suffering.<br><br>As we look at what charity is, it is equally important and instructive to look at the kind of love Heavenly Father has for us, the kind of love for which we should strive in our own lives. It is a love that is unconditional, one of total acceptance. Our Heavenly Father does not say, "I love you<i>if</i>you do thus and so," but rather "I love you--period." Our Heavenly Father accepts us for who we are--his spirit children created in his image. And he accepts us where we are, even with all our weaknesses.<br><br>In the book<i>Fully Human, Fully Alive</i>the author, John Powell, explores this idea.<br><br><i>Wherever you are in your development, whatever you are doing, with a strong affirmation of all your goodness and good deeds, with a gentle understanding of your weakness, God is forever loving you. You do not have to change, grow, or be good in order to be loved. Rather</i>[and this is the key]<i>you are loved so you can change, grow, and be good.</i>[Niles, Illinois: Argus Communications, 1976, p. 178‚Äì79]<br><br>Then he reminds us of some of the people we read about in the scriptures. He describes Peter the Rock as a sandpile, a loudmouth, and a man who denied even knowing the One who had loved him most. He talks of Zachaeus as the runt who offered to collect taxes from his own people for a kickback of the take. He recalls to our minds Thomas, the all-star bullhead, and Martha, who was a worrier and a complainer. Then there is the prodigal son, who was pretty heartless but who came home into his father&#39;s open arms and open heart when he became hungry. And last, we are reminded of Saul of Tarsus, who was bent on destroying Christianity until he took that road to Damascus and found the loving Lord. Then Powell says:<br><br><i>Heavenly Father was loving them, affirming them, forgiving them, encouraging them, challenging them all the way into greatness, peace, and the fullness of life.</i>[p. 179]<br><br>I would suggest that our Heavenly Father does the same for us; for, indeed, his love is unconditional; he has that perfect ability to separate each of us, as a person, from our behavior. Charity is many things, but it is always patient and unconditional. I single out those two aspects only because they have specific meaning in my life as I seek to understand God&#39;s love for me and as I seek to love other people.<br><br>Before I move on, I want to touch on what charity is<i>not</i>. It is not always sweet and nice and agreeable and accommodating. It is, however, always honest and truthful. Love--true love--requires that we ask hard questions and sometimes do hard things. Parents who really love their children do not indulge them; rather they help them see what they can become and then present them with the process of growth.<br><br>I recall a time I was babysitting my younger brother Mark, who was three years old. It was quiet, which meant trouble, so I went into the kitchen. There I found him, simply sitting on the floor playing with a long, sharp, butcher knife he had pulled from the top of the cabinet. It was bright and shiny and obviously attractive to him. I knew that potential danger, and, of course, I took it away from him. He didn&#39;t understand. I had taken away something that was very attractive to him and something that he wanted, so he cried. When I reflect on that experience, I think of how much more infinite our Heavenly Father&#39;s knowledge is of those things which can be hurtful to us. Truman Madsen expands on that idea in his book,<i>Four Essays on Love</i>. He says:<br><br><i>You and I can only grow with stress and distress. There is no muscle without strain and no character without the fiery trials of action and affliction. "There must needs be opposition" not only implies an eternal resistance in the nature of things, it implies that man needs opposition in order to become what he has in him to become.</i><br><br><i>Life is an obstacle course. And sometimes a spook alley. But the before was a time of visioning the after. And some of our prayers are like the gambler&#39;s "Give me the money I made you promise not to give me if I asked for it." What does a true friend do in such a case? God will honor our first request, to let us go through it; and He will provide you with (let Him) the way to make it bearable. More, to make it productive.</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978, pp. 58, 59]<br><br>In retrospect I find myself grateful for friends who loved me enough to tell me that truth even when it was difficult and who withheld from me those things that would have weakened rather than strengthened me, for now I have come to understand that to do so is a manifestation of true love, the pure love of Christ--in fact, charity.<br><h2><b>Why Is Love Important?</b></h2><br>Now to the second question--why is love important? We know that love is one of our basic needs. Without it, people cannot develop normally. We are beginning to understand that many bodily ills are directly tied to the absence of love and that loved and loving people are healthier and, interestingly enough, better able to cope with pain. Simply put, love is necessary for life, for survival, for growth, and ultimately for perfection.<br><h2><b>What Are the Effects of Love</b></h2><br>The third idea I want to explore deals with what happens when we either receive love from others or give love? What are the effects of love? A number of years ago at a professional conference a friend of mine had a little pin--a number 3 attached to her lapel. I asked, "What does the number 3 stand for?" She replied, "I&#39;m glad you asked. It means Heavenly Father is first in my life, others are second, and I am third."<br><br>I have thought about that idea often. I don&#39;t want to wear a number 3 on my lapel because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the message we receive from the scriptures or what I&#39;ve come to understand. I believe first of all, Christ loves us. And because he loves us, we are able to love ourselves, to accept ourselves. Once we are able to do that, we are free to love other people, to reach out to them. This idea is supported scripturally in 1 John 4:19:<br><br><i>We love him, because he first loved us.</i><br><br>No matter how much we want to follow the commandments of loving others or forgetting self or serving others, first we must love ourselves and feel good about who we are. Part of that process involves coming to understand and to appreciate Christ&#39;s love for us.<br><br>At one time in my life, I reached a point of personal discouragement when I questioned my abilities and was filled with self-pity. I went to my office one night. It was dark, and I lay on the floor sobbing. I stopped crying because I finally became physically exhausted. As I lay there in the quiet, in the dark, by myself, the scripture "Love thy neighbor as thyself" came to mind. That message could not have come more strongly if the Savior himself had stood before me and spoken the words. The emphasis was not on "love thy neighbor"; it was on loving thyself. Before we can love our neighbors we must love ourselves and see ourselves as God sees us. If we cannot love ourselves, we will find it difficult to love our Heavenly Father and our neighbors. Loving oneself is, for me, an essential key to loving God, life, and others.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith touched on this when talking to a congregation in Nauvoo. He compared life to a wheel around which each of us moves. He said there are times when we are up at the top of the wheel and someone else is down. In due time, he suggested, it will be the other way around. Then he added:<br><br><i>Every man [and woman] will fail sometime.</i>[Truman Madsen,<i>The Highest in Us</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978), p. 26]<br><br>He was quick to add that this is the very reason we need others in our lives. There are times when we are on the top of the wheel, when we are alive and high, when we can lift others who are more or less barren or numbed or deadened. But our turn to be lifted by others will inevitably come.<br><br>When we love ourselves, we have a positive self-image. It allows us to love and to reach out to other people, not because we have to in order to meet a quota or because someone has told us to, but because we want to, and so we respond in a loving way to someone else.<br><h2><b>How Do We Show Love?</b></h2><br>The last question I want to explore--and the most important--is, How do we show love? We typically use the parable of the good Samaritan to answer this question. You will remember that a lawyer had asked Christ what he needed to do in order to inherit eternal life. The Savior said, "Love the Lord thy God with all they heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself." The lawyer then asked, "Who is my neighbor?" In response to that question the Lord told the story of the good Samaritan and concluded by saying, "Go and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37; 25‚Äì37).<br><br>I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;ve not seen anyone lying by the side of the road. I&#39;ve heard people say that if they ever did see someone by the side of the road, they would stop and bind up their wounds and help them. We don&#39;t often see that in our society, but we do see people in our apartments or classes, at work, in church, perhaps in our own families who are lonely and discouraged and depressed, who feel hopeless and unwanted. These are the people lying by the side of the road, who need us to love them and accept them and care about them. It is easy, I think, to give money to a good cause or to bake cookies or make something for others, but I believe one of the most important things we have to give is our time and a listening ear. Some people simply need someone to hold them and to care about them.<br><br>Remember the baptismal covenant and what we covenanted to do. It is nowhere else stated as clearly as in the 18th chapter of Mosiah. The people had gathered at the waters of Mormon, and Alma spoke to them, saying:<br><br><i>Behold, here are the waters of Mormon . . . and now, as ye are desirous to come unto the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another&#39;s burdens, that they may be light;</i><br><br><i>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort. . . .</i>[Mosiah 18:8‚Äì9]<br><br>Those three requirements--to be willing to bear one another&#39;s burdens, to mourn with those that mourn, and to comfort those that stand in need of comfort--to me suggest loving others and really caring about them.<br><br>This kind of charity is not better exemplified by anyone than by Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who founded the Sisters of Charity and who was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for peace. In an address to a group of sisters at Notre Dame, she talked about the hungry ones in today&#39;s society--not just those who hunger for bread, but those who are literally hungering for understanding love, for being wanted, for being somebody to somebody. This kind of poverty, said Sister Teresa, is all over the world.<br><br>She talked about the homeless ones, not people who are homeless because they have no houses of bricks or stone, but homeless, again, for understanding love--helpless, hopeless people who have forgotten how to smile. "There is so much suffering," she said, "and we seem to have so little time for each other and for works of love. Love begins in living reality at home." Then Sister Teresa gave what I think is an interesting challenge. She challenged people to try to make their homes a place where Christ can come and rest for awhile--a worthy challenge for each of us. This woman preaches Jesus Christ without using words; rather, she puts his love and her own into a loving action of serving people in their needs. An example worthy of emulation.<br><br>When I talked with a friend about charity she said, "It is very closely tied to compassionate service." Then she added, "You know, compassionate service is not just a loaf of bread." I believe that. Sometimes it is a loaf of bread, and sometimes that bread opens the door for many other things to happen. But charity, that about which we have spoken and that which is exemplified by Mother Teresa, is the kind of love that allows us to give of ourselves, to reach out to other people, to build them, and to really love them. The real gifts are gifts of listening and caring and sharing, those things spoken of in the eighteenth chapter of Mosiah.<br><h2><b>One Heart and One Mind</b></h2><br>In closing, I want to share an experience that Wid Tolman, who offered our opening prayer this morning, shared with me. Brother Tolman is a good friend and for many years has taken youth, members and nonmembers, into the mountains for special experiences. I have been with him on some of these trips and know they are unique. He shared with me an experience he had last summer. He was with such a group. They had had several days of hard hiking; they had gone without meals. On the third day, after the youth had been by themselves for about two hours, they came together to share testimonies and other things of importance. They were in a beautiful spot in the mountains, a place where I had been. There were tall pine trees and green grass, with a slight knoll surrounding the area where they sat.<br><br>Brother Tolman shared with me that this group of youth had become very close on this trip. They expressed concern about each other; they shared with others; there was a unity among that group that frequently isn&#39;t found among young people of 12 to 16 years of age. During this period of sharing, Brother Tolman happened to glance up and see a deer put her head over the top of the knoll, sample the air, and look at what was happening below. Then she backed down and was invisible. Brother Tolman kept watching that knoll. The deer would move about 15 feet, come up over the top and look around. She kept doing that until she came all the way around, back to where she had started. Then the deer walked slowly down the hill and moved in among the youth. Nobody moved, nobody yelled, "Hey, there&#39;s a deer!" to frighten her; they simply went on with their sharing. The deer lingered with them for a period of time, and some of the youth asked if this might be what we mean as we sing of the day when "the lamb and the lion shall lie down together." Eventually, the deer wandered back over the knoll and left the group. There was, in that group, no contention. They were of one heart and one mind, and perhaps in some lesser sense they were at that moment dwelling in righteousness as did the people of Enoch. They were united by a bond of perfectness and peace. As Brother Tolman related that to me, we both mused on whether or not the deer had, in fact, sensed that all was safe, that there was nothing to be afraid of, because you will remember in 1 John we are told that "perfect love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18).<br><br>It is very similar to the kind of thing that President Spencer W. Kimball spoke of in the closing session of general conference in April of 1978. He talked about his own vision of the future, his aspirations to establish Zion, and then said:<br><br><i>Let us unite and pray with all the energy of heart, that we may be sealed up by this bond of charity; that we may build up this Latter-day Zion, that the kingdom of God may go forth, so that the kingdom of heaven may come.</i>["Becoming Pure in Heart,"<i>Ensign</i>, May 1978, p. 81]<br><br>I pray that each of us might do our part in seeking to establish Zion, that we might reread and ponder and think about those things which Moroni taught. That we will, in fact, pray with all the energy of our hearts that we may be filled with his love so that when he appears we may be like him and be purified even as he is pure. Such is my prayer in the name of our Savior and Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Carolyn J.

<h1>nd Revelation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I stand before you today as one who has accepted the responsibility to try to guide and inspire the students of Brigham Young University to make the most of their educational opportunities and to prepare themselves to be the strongest possible members of the kingdom of God, to be people who can provide special leadership in the great work of the kingdom in these last days. But I have not been given that kind of responsibility for anyone else. I therefore direct my remarks to the students of BYU and hope that, if others choose to listen in, they may find something of value to them as well.<br><br>I will admit that I have been, and to this moment remain, somewhat fearful that the things which I feel I should say today might be misunderstood. I therefore pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with me and with you this hour that we might understand each other and that the will of the Lord might be accomplished.<br><h2><b>Influence of the Spirit</b></h2><br>Most of us here today are too young to remember the time when not every BYU professor and not even every instructor of religion had a testimony of the gospel. It seems to me that there has been considerable improvement in this regard, not only at BYU, but probably throughout the entire Church over the last few decades. As far as I know, every religion class at BYU is now taught by someone who not only understands but accepts the scriptural challenge to teach by the Spirit.<br><br>But these developments for the good have not left Satan resourceless. There are many varieties of false spirits at his command. It is because I perceive an increasing vulnerability to such false forms of spirituality that I have felt that I should raise a warning voice to the students of BYU.<br><br>From the most ancient times, there have been religious traditions which insisted that revelatory experiences involving the gods were characterized by ecstasy or frenzy of the mind. In some of these traditions, wine or drugs were used to induce the frenzied state in which one could become the mouthpiece of the gods. Certain Christian and Jewish variants of these traditions have taught that the ancient prophets wrote in excited or frenzied states in which they were not in full control of their own minds.<br><br>Stated in these stark terms, this tradition is easily recognized as something alien to the teachings and practices of the restored gospel. We know the spirit of revelation as a spirit of peace. Notice the contrast between that tradition and the scriptural references describing the voice of God as it comes to men. In the book of Helaman we are told that it is "a still voice of perfect mildness," like "a whisper," and it pierces "even to the very soul" (Helaman 5:30). As reported in 3 Nephi 11:3, it<br><br><i>was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.</i><br><br>In none of the scriptures do we see revelation come as a result of people&#39;s working themselves into an emotional state of mind. Yet, there are distinctive feelings that are produced when the voice of God speaks to men, as in this passage where it caused their hearts to burn. Because of the variety of spiritual extravagances that prevailed among the Christian sects of his time, Joseph Smith often warned the Saints against these things and showed them the way that they might avoid coming under these same influences. He commented once that<br><br><i>nothing is a greater injury to the children of men than to be under the influence of a false spirit when they think they have the Spirit of God.</i>[<i>Teachings</i>, p. 205]<br><br>On another occasion Joseph Smith taught the Saints how they might<i>learn</i>the true spirit of revelation:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ Jesus.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 151]<br><br>Perhaps it is because the Spirit does cause feelings such as a burning of the heart that it seems to be easily mistaken for other emotions. I would like to begin by pointing out some of the kinds of false spirits or emotions that seem to produce some spiritual confusion among our young people when they mistake their feelings for manifestations of the true Spirit.<br><h2><b>Sentimentalism vs. Spirit</b></h2><br>The first problem I would like to mention may be a simple hazard of youth, though I suspect it is more a problem of our times. We are observing a widespread difficulty in distinguishing between sentimentalism and true spiritual experience. Too much of the literature used, seen, and quoted in the Church today is just sentimental trash which is designed to pull our heartstrings or moisten our eyes, but it is not born of true spiritual experience. The tendency of our youth to use sentimental stories in Church talks creates a culture of spiritual misunderstanding in which thinking and learning are discouraged. When I was bishop years ago in an Orem ward, I strongly counseled the youth not to use the compilations of sentimental stories which are available. I feel that our failure to immerse these young people in the scriptures and other high quality literature makes them vulnerable to the cheap tactics of every moralistic movement which they encounter. Because our youth often respond positively to sentimentalism, there is a danger that we might cater to that in Church instruction generally.<br><br>But is it possible to imagine that Nephi was brought up on such sentimentalism? Rather he informs us in the first verse of his record that he was instructed in all the learning of his father. And that learning was of no small effect, for, as he encountered the real problems of real life, he responded in a supremely intelligent and powerful way, quickly learning the Spirit of God and obtaining its guidance in the most difficult tasks. It may be that some sentimentality is a good and necessary thing, and certainly there is a place for it in our relationship with our loved ones. But it should never be leaned upon as a substitute for spirituality. Reliance on sentimentality will stunt our own spiritual growth by misleading us and filling our understanding with false experiences.<br><br>Our spiritual immaturity can also be revealed through our tastes in books. I was dismayed on two separate occasions this past year as editors of major LDS publishing houses patiently explained to me that they are primarily interested in books which can either feature a well-known Latter-day Saint name as the author or are written on a very simple level and in such a way as to give people a warm, comfortable feeling without any challenging ideas. Anything more demanding of the reader, I was informed, will not sell well enough to justify publication. As a Latter-day Saint I was chagrined, but as I took more occasion to observe what is selling well in our bookstores, I could see they were only being candid with me.<br><br>Another manifestation of spiritual confusion occurs frequently among us when we are invited to invest in expensive items which we don&#39;t really need but which can somehow be related by the salesman to goals we develop in church. College girls frequently find themselves buying extremely expensive cookware sets so they will have first-class equipment when they get married. Somehow the purchase is supposed to improve the young woman&#39;s prospects of marriage. At the same time, her parents may be investing precious savings in some sure-fire get-rich scheme without seeking sound financial advice--relying instead on trusted friends or relatives who have no better judgment. The vast majority of these investors lose everything, and usually only the scheme perpetrators get rich. In fact, many of them turn out after the fact to be simple frauds. But instead of heeding spiritual warnings, we are lulled by other feelings into actually believing that we have spiritual reassurances and that we are going to get rich so we can help the Church or spend all our time with our children or some other worthy endeavor. I firmly believe the Lord will give us the guidance we need in our financial affairs if we will think it all through carefully and responsibly and seek him in prayer. But when he speaks, it will be by the same still, small voice he uses on other occasions and not through a burning feeling of excitement at the prospects of having more wealth than our neighbors, nicer clothes or cars, or not having to work for a living.<br><h2><b>Discernment Important</b></h2><br>In and of themselves, the kinds of problems I have suggested to this point may not be too serious, but we live in an age plagued with false gospels and pseudospiritual modes of life. Our young people will inevitably be confronted with one or more of them which will put the maturity of their own spiritual development to the test. There are Asian cults in many of our cities which appeal to troubled youth. There are many groups of Christian enthusiasts who emphasize the importance of frequent emotional experiences with the Spirit as they believe. There are cults of apostate Mormons who claim new revelations and approach our youth with a personal intensity that can very easily be mistaken for greater spirituality. Although Marxism is losing its early high position of influence among American youth, it is still very much a real force as are objectivism and numerous other moralistic philosophies that offer guidance in all moral questions and pretend to the highest ethical truths on the basis of reason or, in some cases, science.<br><br>It is therefore extremely important that as Latter-day Saints grow, mature, and seek an education, they learn to develop their ability to discern the difference between the voice of the Spirit and the many alternatives available in this world. They must be clean in every way that they might be receptive to the true Spirit. They must come to know the Spirit that they might not be misled by the imposter varieties. And they must learn to think clearly and to recognize the ways of good and evil in their many forms, that they may avoid evil early and help others to do the same.<br><br>Most of you probably assume that your education here at BYU, or even elsewhere, should help you to develop the kind of judgment and thinking ability that would enable you to recognize the dangers that I have been describing. Yet you may also have some ambivalence about the tools of analysis taught in philosophy and science and may wonder how they can help you rather than becoming an obstacle to your testimony and to personal revelation. I would like to spend the balance of the time in addressing that ambivalence. I will try to suggest an approach to our education that will help you derive strength from it without letting it develop into a spiritual stumbling block as it undoubtedly has done for many, many people.<br><h2><b>An Approach to Education</b></h2><br>I would like to begin with the observation that as infants every one of us came into this world faced with the same general problem. We knew nothing of this world, and we didn&#39;t know how to find out the truth about it. So we started from ignorance, but we were given some basic tools. We had senses with which we could establish contact with the world around us. We had minds with which we could reflect on the things we observed in the development of our understanding. There are people and a culture which will help each of us deal with the problems of life and will also pass on to us a variety of beliefs about the world in which we have found ourselves--some true, some false. And we have a basic spiritual gift. By learning to use these well, we can come to grips with this world more or less successfully.<br><br>As we mature and grow in our knowledge of the world, we can also begin to develop our knowledge of God and his ways. And just as with our knowledge of the world, our knowledge of him comes through the things told to us by others and through our personal experiences. But how do we know what is true and what to believe? Is it not reasonable to expect that our knowledge of God and his ways, though it reaches into the spiritual sphere, is built up by use of the same thinking skills and honest self-criticism that we have learned from infancy in mastering the world around us?<br><br>Countless scriptures promise us that we will be rewarded for the faith that we develop in God. We would not expect to be rewarded for faith in false things, so what basis or merit is there in our having faith in the true God? Why should we be rewarded for that? The only answer would seem to be that there is some meritorious action on our part which prepares us for the gift of faith. There must be available to every one of us some reliable means of finding a measure of truth and knowing when we have found it.<br><br>We are all in the business of developing a broad system of beliefs. Through trial and error we discover which ones are good, and we reject the bad. We can use this same method for testing our religious beliefs and the teachings given to us by others. But the problem which always confronts us is the difficulty of being rigorously honest in this process. Beliefs have implications. We cannot help wanting some things to be true and other to be false. If we love our sins, we will likely not want the gospel to be true because it commands us to forsake them utterly. So our integrity is constantly on the line, and only God knows when, in fact, we sacrifice for the truth or when we harbor error willingly. To gain increasing knowledge of him, we must learn not to promote ourselves by manipulating others, or intimidating, lying, or cheating, by exploiting others or deceiving ourselves, because none of these will work with him; and our knowledge of him comes through the revelations of the Spirit, which we receive at his pleasure only.<br><h2><b>Light of Christ</b></h2><br>The Spirit, or Light of Christ, is given to everyone to provide guidance and encouragement in those important domains of moral action where reason and experience are demonstrably inadequate guides. It is a simple fact of modern philosophy that reason has not even come close to providing anyone with a single true and persuasive set of moral principles. Even if we had such a complete set of moral guidelines, our reasoning abilities would not be adequate to use them in particular situations to always know what we should do. We are therefore all in need of an omniscient friend who knows what courses of action will have the best implications for the future. As this friend gives us spiritual guidance and tells us what is right, we will come to rely on it if we are honest in heart and as we recognize the reliability of that guidance. Thus by being rigorously honest in pursuing what is right and true, even when it requires sacrifice on our part, we can come to have faith--to act as Christ directs without knowing how or why but knowing that his is the only reliable direction we have ever discovered.<br><br>All of this assumes that his voice is distinctive, that it is recognizable by us and not readily confused with other sources of ideas. It also assumes that we have a commitment to what is right, that we will be able to respond to that spiritual guidance as we learn about it. The suggestion, of course, is that it is this very commitment to the right and our sensitivity to direction from the Lord, as well as our honesty of heart, that are being tested in this probationary state.<br><h2><b>Usefulness of Reason</b></h2><br>This analysis suggests that the Lord does expect us to use all the tools he has given us in a diligent and rigorously honest way in the pursuit of truth. Although I have already indicated that reason is inadequate to insure the discovery of truth, it is extremely useful in identifying error. There are many ways in which reason can be used to reveal erroneous or problematic claims to truth. We can identify contradictions or gaps in our own system of beliefs as we examine them rationally. Reason will also help us to identify inconsistencies which need repair that might occur between our own beliefs or ideas and the beliefs of the prophets as recorded in scripture. And it will help us compare alternative courses of action. That is, it will help us if we have developed our ability to think and to use our rational capacity.<br><br>But reason is not adequate to show us definitively which answers are true. We will always be in need of an omniscient friend to point out the way, to let light through the clouds and darkness, to open our understanding to truths and explanations we could never have thought of from our positions of ignorance.<br><br>I would like to refer to a couple of scriptures which illustrate some ways in which the Lord expects our reason to be involved in the process of receiving revelation. To explain Oliver Cowdery&#39;s failure to translate the Book of Mormon, the Lord said:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><br><br><i>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:7‚Äì8]<br><br>On a later occasion it appears that Edward Partridge and others may have inquired of the Prophet as to how they should travel to the land appointed for their new residence. Seeking direction on this point, the Prophet was instructed:<br><br><i>Wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, as they shall counsel between themselves and me.</i><br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward. Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:25‚Äì29]<br><br>The point of this scripture seems to be that these people could have counseled directly with the Lord and between themselves in seeking an answer to this question without troubling the Prophet for direction. The power was in them wherein they were agents unto themselves. It was only by exercising that agency that they could gain a reward. And yet the exercise of that agency clearly included counseling with the Lord.<br><br>The Lord delights to bless his children, and when we need answers quickly to questions where we cannot help ourselves, he does not take from us that opportunity of coming to our own decisions. We are promised the guidance of the Holy Ghost in all things. It is my belief that as we exercise our agency in humility and righteousness, the Lord will warn us spiritually should we begin to go astray. I also believe that at every stage of the process of analyzing a problem and formulating a decision, those gentle promptings are available to help us find our way and come to the proper course of action.<br><br>This process is illustrated rather well in the development of the Welfare Program of the Church. This program was not revealed full blown to the prophet or even to the Brethren in the presiding councils of the Church. Rather the need for such a program became evident to these leaders. Through inspiration they selected the individuals who would be instrumental in developing the program. After a rather long prayerful period of counseling together and experimenting with various forms of a possible program, a final proposal was prepared and brought before the presiding councils of the Church. William E. Berrett has given us one account of the results. He says he was in the first meeting in which the Welfare Program was announced to the members of the Church in 1936.<br><br><i>President Grant related that individuals had asked him whether he had been talking to Heavenly Beings, whether the Lord had given him a vision. His answer was, "No, I have not talked to angels; I have not had a vision." And he recounted that the word of the Lord on such matters was already given. A plan was worked out in accordance to earlier revelations . . . President Grant said that . . . he went before the Lord in prayer to ask him if the plan was acceptable, and he got the feeling from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet that the Lord was pleased.</i>["Teaching by the Spirit," BYU, 27 June 1966]<br><br>Our decision to follow revealed guidance will always require faith. In this life we can never act in full knowledge until we come to "see as we are seen," and "know as we are known"--undoubtedly a miraculous gift which is not widely enjoyed.<br><h2><b>The Role of Sin</b></h2><br>The iron rod goes along a straight and narrow path. There are many ways in which we can stumble and lose our footing. The most frequent cause of our wandering from that path is sin which clouds our vision and dries up our access to spiritual guidance, leaving us alone to wander with our own dim light and weakened resolve.<br><br>Pride is an obstacle for almost all of us. Somehow the requirements of faith seem to threaten our identity. This is probably true only because we choose to identify with things of this world, things which the Lord will ask us to give up. Anticipating that demand, we often find reasons in advance to steer clear of him and his guidance, thereby losing precious opportunities and stunting our own spiritual growth.<br><br>Some of us make the mistake of imposing on the Lord our conceptions of him and what he is like, what is good and right, and what is true. He may just let us have our pet beliefs and suffer the consequences. I am reminded of that great sermon in which Moses discussed this matter with the ancient Israelites before leaving them. He said:<br><br><i>Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of fire:</i><br><br><i>Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a grave image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female.</i><br><br><i>And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</i>[Deuteronomy 4:15‚Äì16, 12]<br><br>Moses was at pains to stress to the Israelites that they did not know what God looked like--quite the opposite of our present missionary approach--because he feared that they would tend to make images of God for the purposes of idol worship. Rather he stressed with them that all they knew about God was that he has a voice. That, of course, is the most important thing to know because the God of Israel can speak to man and tell him what to do. Later in the same sermon Moses warned the Israelites that in the last days their descendants could only be saved from their dispersion if they would forsake their evil ways and hearken to the voice of God once more.<br><br>We could also err by blindly trusting in others who seem to be more spiritual than we are. But in so doing we must remember that if they lead us astray it will be no excuse for us at the judgment day. At that time we must each stand on our own feet, on our own performance. We will be judged on what we did with the opportunities and talents given to us. Brigham Young is reported to have warned the Saints many times not to simply rely on his word but to get confirmation of that word for themselves, that they might know his directions were from God.<br><br>We need to be sure that our testimonies and gospel understanding keep pace with our learning of the world. Having lived many years in university communities, I have had that sad experience of working with members who have grown too sophisticated to remain faithful to a gospel which they really only understand on a grade-school level. There is always a great danger that faithful members of the Church will find their testimonies threatened by the doctrines of men as they extend their education.<br><br>But should our reaction be to simply shield ourselves from exposure to the teachings and theories of the world? Such a posture communicates a lack of confidence in the gospel itself, or possibly too much faith in reason or science, or both. For either, on one hand, we do not really believe that all truth can ultimately be circumscribed in one great whole with Jesus Christ at the center, or, on the other, we do not appreciate the fundamental limitations on the power of man&#39;s reason and science to discover truth about the world, and especially about God.<br><h2><b>Confidence in the Lord</b></h2><br>I believe that one day we will be able to understand all things, that we will rejoice to see how all things are in the Lord&#39;s hands, and that all things in the final analysis will work together for our good. But that vision is beyond human science, and I look forward to it as a matter of faith--faith based on invaluable personal experience with the Lord and his revelations. So I believe we must approach the learning of the world with open minds and with confidence that the Lord can and will protect us from error if our hearts are pure--and not lifted up in pride.<br><br>I am thinking of the kinds of confidence expressed by President Tanner in a story he told in General Conference several years ago. I will relate it in his own words:<br><br><i>Some years ago in Canada I was driving along and had two young men with me in my car, and a young man thumbed a ride with us. I asked the boys who were with me if we should take him with us, and they said yes. I picked him up, and after we had driven along a little way he said, "Do you mind if I smoke in your car?"</i><br><br><i>I said, "No, not at all if you can give me any good reason why you should smoke." And I said, "I will go farther than that." (I was stake president at this time.) "If you can give me a good reason why you should smoke, I will smoke with you." Well, my two young friends looked at me and wondered.</i><br><br><i>We drove on for some distance, about twenty minutes, I think, and I turned around and said, "Aren&#39;t you going to smoke?"</i><br><br><i>And he said, "No."</i><br><br><i>I said, "Why not?"</i><br><br><i>And he said, "I can&#39;t think of a good reason why I should."</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1965, p. 93]<br><br>This is not to suggest that I believe there is any procedure by which we can compel the Lord to reveal to us the fullness of the truths for which scientists seek. I have heard some LDS scholars announce such projects, but I have not seen them reach the promised end. The Lord has his own timetable--and his own ways. He has given us all the direction we need to get access to the most important opportunities of life. And he will quickly and constantly provide the daily personal guidance we all need to keep our feet on that straight and narrow path which leads to life eternal. Beyond that, I do not believe he objects to our further inquiry if we can keep all things in perspective. But we have no assurance of receiving early or full answers to our questions. These other matters wait on his good pleasure.<br><h2><b>Guidelines to Keep Faith</b></h2><br>We need not fear losing our testimonies or our faith through scholarly pursuits if we will observe a few basic guidelines:<br><br>1. Keep the commandments. I have heard many stories about intellectual apostasy, but I am not convinced I have ever seen a genuine case. More often intellectual dissent serves as a handy rationale to justify one&#39;s sins. Intellectuals who are morally clean, who pay their tithing, and who are not lifted up in pride find no intellectual motives to apostatize.<br><br>2. Study the scriptures. The prophets were men of great understanding and inspiration. As we grow and struggle with the problems and questions of life, we will continually find higher levels of wisdom and guidance in their writings. And the Lord will often use our scripture study as the opportunity to illuminate and expand our understanding through the Spirit.<br><br>3. Pay careful attention to the assumptions and limitations of the various forms of human intellectual endeavor. Do not be intimidated by irresponsible claims that some scientists or scholars might make. Develop a responsible awareness of the foundations of any discipline you choose to pursue so that you can assess for yourself the strength of the theories and evidences that are under discussion.<br><br>Let me interject that one of the most disappointing things I find as I interview honor students graduating from the university--and I assume that other students have the same problem--is their frequent inability to explain to me the assumptions and limitations of the particular science or discipline that they have been studying for four years. How can you appreciate the strengths and use those strengths appropriately if you do not understand the limitations?<br><h2><b>Intellect and Faith</b></h2><br>There is a strong sense in which genuine intellectual apostasy is not even a possibility for someone who has had much personal spiritual experience and has obeyed the first principles and ordinances of the gospel by repenting of his sins and receiving the Lord&#39;s forgiveness through the baptism of fire. For on one hand, those are clear and undeniable firsthand experiences with the Lord. And a well-educated and honest intellectual knows that none of the moral or scientific theories of man are nearly so certain to be true. They can never transcend tentative hypotheses. So how should he respond to a theory or doctrine, however attractive, that does not seem to square with his understanding of the scriptures? He will very naturally decide to leave the matter undecided until such time as his understanding of the world or the prophets or both progresses to the point that the two will fit together. But he would be a fool to reject that which is most certain and valuable for theories which he knows are likely to be revised or refuted by future scholars.<br><br>Another way of putting the problem of reason and revelation is to ask if revelation must give the same results as philosophical or scientific method to be valid. Because of the narrowness of these two as conceived by contemporary practitioners, the answer must be no. In the interest of time, allow me to point out only one of many reasons. Contemporary philosophy and science have accepted certain ground rules--such as the principle of naturalism--which restrict in advance the range of possible explanations that<i>can be given</i>for our observations. Specifically, no explanations are acceptable which refer to the reality of gods or other supernatural beings.<br><br>It may well be that such a principle has been necessary for secular science to make any headway when its practitioners represent so many different beliefs about the existence of gods. But it is also clearly true that to the extent that the supernatural world does exist and does interact causally with the world of our ordinary experience, science has arbitrarily erected a barrier against its own free explorations of that essential feature of reality--and has condemned itself permanently to a partial understanding of the truth.<br><br>I know some members of the Church have chosen to get very excited about the conflicts they see between the theories of science and the teachings of the prophets. But it seems to me that most of this is unnecessary and only provides the devil with another tool for introducing pointless division into the Lord&#39;s kingdom. Take, for example, theories about the origins of the universe and of life on this earth, a subject on which the scriptures do seem to say something. The scriptural accounts seem to impose at least two limits on any theories we might choose to develop. The classical Christian doctrine that the earth and the life forms were created<i>ex nihilo</i>(from nothing) is rejected. On that score Latter-day Saints agree with modern scientists. But the other clear teaching of the scriptural account is that the creation was the work of the gods, that they did it in a carefully ordered way to accomplish their eternal objectives. But science by its own game rules cannot include any gods or purposes in its explanations and theories. So the scientific theories<i>cannot</i>use anything besides chance and nature to explain our origins. Should we be surprised, or even concerned, that scientific theory does not recognize the role of the gods? Science operates under that handicap. But once we see that difference, there is a world of interesting facts that scientists have turned up which invite our analysis from a much broader point of view, a view which allows much more than chance and nature in our theories and explanations.<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>What will happen if we can repent, overcome sin and pride, and humbly seek truth and right at his hand? He will always expect us to use our own resources to the fullest--our reason, our experience, the scriptures, inspired guidance of our leaders, and the gift of the Spirit which gives new guidance and confirmation as necessary. We will come to know of his never varying goodness. We will learn that he always promotes good and warns us from evil. We will become convinced of his great love and mercy for us. How else could he tolerate us and labor with us so long and patiently and forgive us our sins? We will learn that he will exalt us above our own weaknesses to the extent that we allow it. We will gain an increasingly adequate understanding of the real world. We will learn to see the hand of God in all things. This will enable us to get both ourselves and others into perspective. On one hand, we will see the divine potential of each individual as a son or a daughter of God. On the other hand, we will recognize that as vile sinners we are forever doomed to misery if we repent not and cultivate not the heavenly gift.<br><br>Mormonism is a distinctively intellectual faith. From the very beginning great importance has been placed on giving a full picture of the world and its relation to God to the humblest member. Our members pride themselves on the ability to explain in detail the reasons for the interesting and different doctrines of this restored gospel. We can explain why we are commanded to be baptized for the dead and why the Word of Wisdom was given. Doubtless, we carry this too far, sometimes providing semiauthoritative explanations for things we really do not understand at all. But we have a much higher tolerance for that speculative error than for the attitude which tells us we should rejoice in inconsistencies when they are discovered and the lack of logic or apparent wisdom in the commandments of God. Such claims are foreign to the scriptural and the prophetic views. When we object to someone&#39;s teachings on the grounds that they do not make sense, it is a false spirit that replies, "That is the beauty of it." This is not to say that the Lord provides us with the explanations for all things. Some of the most basic teachings of the gospel are left unexplained, and we do accept them simply on the basis of faith. But overall, the Lord has provided us with a coherent picture of him and our relationship to him. He has blessed us with the ability to see continuity in our experience with him and all our daily experiences. It is because of this continuity and coherence that we are able to separate out day by day truth from error that we might grow to know and understand him and his commandments better.<br><h2><b>Education and Opportunity</b></h2><br>Just fourteen years ago I stood at this very podium to give a valedictory address to my graduating class. It has been interesting for me to note that I am delivering very much the same message again today that I prepared at that time. The primary difference is that I felt in 1967 that, as a graduating class, we needed stronger encouragement to take seriously the possibilities of spiritual direction in our daily and academic endeavors. Today, I have tried to emphasize the dangers of substitutes for true spiritual experience. I think the difference in emphasis is due more to the changing times than to changes in me, although I may be wrong. As I look back on my own educational experiences, the two most important things I learned at BYU were, first, a knowledge of the Lord and his gospel and of his expectations of me; and second, an ability to read good books, to understand the views of others, and to think independently in evaluating those views. We constantly remind ourselves that our bodies are the temples of God, that we should keep them fit and clean. Our morning streets are crowded with people jogging to maintain fit bodies. I am concerned that we are not jogging our minds sufficiently. Paul has remarked in the book of Timothy that the exercise of the mind and the spirit is far more important than the exercise of the body (see 1 Timothy 4:8). How can God reveal sublime truth to muddled minds? We must prepare an ordered mind so that he can say to us as he has on many occasions to his children anciently, "Come, let us reason together." As President Lee is reported to have said, "It is good to be faithful, but it is better to be faithful and competent." The youth of today face the greatest challenge that has ever been presented by the Lord to his servants--that of preparing the world for the last days. Their ability to handle the problems that they face will in large measure be a function of the seriousness with which they have taken their educational opportunities. In closing, I plead with you not to be misled by those who would have you believe that spirituality is simply an emotional state. Seek to prepare yourselves that you can approach the Lord with a clear and open mind and that you might be able to understand and follow his word when you receive it. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Noel B.

<h1>e Scriptures - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I think this is one of the greatest opportunities that I have ever had to give a public address. I would like to do well for a number of reasons, and I want you to know that I am very serious about what I&#39;m going to say. One reason I would like to do well is that if I do not, it might reflect adversely upon the role of Religious Instruction at BYU and upon the office I hold as dean. I would not want to say or do anything to minimize that important assignment. Also, I would not want the subject that I wish to talk about--the scriptures--to be minimized because of my poor delivery. So I think you would know that I have prayed much and read much and sought much for help and inspiration in order to give this address today. I feel a great need for the help of the Holy Spirit, not only to be with me in order that I might think clearly and speak clearly, but also to be with you so that you might hear clearly and that that same Spirit, because of your willingness, might draw out of me the things that ought to be said.<br><br>I feel a little today like something Elder Matthew Cowley said one time. He said when he was a young man getting ready to leave on a mission, his father went to the railroad station with him and said, in effect: "My boy, when you go out on that mission, you will stand before groups to speak, and you will think you are wonderfully prepared, but when you stand up your mind will go completely blank."<br><br>Brother Cowley said to his father, "What do you do when your mind goes blank?"<br><br>And his father said, "You stand up there, and, with all the fervor of your soul, you bear witness that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, and thoughts will flood into your mind, and words to your mouth, to round out those thoughts in a facility of expression that will carry conviction to the heart of everyone who listens."<br><br>Brother Cowley, being a man with a great sense of humor, said,<br><br><i>And so my mind, being mostly blank during my five years in the mission field, gave me the opportunity to bear testimony to the greatest event in the history of the world since the crucifixion of the Master.</i><br><br><i>Try it sometime. . . . If you don&#39;t have anything else to say, testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and the whole history of the Church will flood into your mind.</i>[Adapted from<i>Matthew Cowley Speaks</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1954), pp. 298‚Äì99]<br><br>Those are the kinds of things we&#39;ll talk about today. I would like to express some views and quote some of the Brethren, and I would like to read some scripture and reflect upon a few things; then I hope that by the time the clock says it&#39;s time to depart, we&#39;ll all feel good for having been here. I listened carefully to the opening prayer and to the words that were said about this being an uplifting time. I was uplifted by that prayer and by the beautiful music that we&#39;ve heard, both the solo and the congregational singing. I would like to continue my portion of this experience by talking about some very spiritual things. I would say, first of all, that there is nothing we can study in a secular way that will ever influence our lives as much as does our religion. Religion influences what we eat, what we drink or don&#39;t drink, and what we wear. It influences our speech, our choice of friends, whom we marry, where we marry, and when we marry. It influences how we spend our time as well as most of our money. There is nothing as encompassing as what we believe about religion and about the gospel. And since it is so encompassing, we ought to expect that in the gospel of Jesus Christ, there are answers to all other disciplines and all other fields of endeavor.<br><br>There are two phrases that I find in the scriptures that I will reflect upon a bit today. One is<i>gaining a hope in Christ,</i>the other is<i>filling the measure of our creation</i>; in other words, our lives have a purpose, and it is good for us if, while we are in mortality, we can discover that purpose.<br><br>I will read a statement from Elder Orson Pratt, from the<i>Millennial Star</i>, volume 28, p. 72‚Äì73. This statement by Elder Pratt gives a broad, expansive, and very realistic view of eternity. He said:<br><br><i>A Saint, who is one in deed and truth, does not look for an immaterial heaven, but he expects a heaven with lands, houses, cities, vegetation, rivers, and animals; with thrones, temples, palaces, kings, princes, priests, and angels; with food, raiment, musical instruments, &amp;amp;c; all of which are material. Indeed, the Saint&#39;s heaven is a redeemed, glorified celestial material creation, inhabited by glorified material beings, male and female, organized into families, embracing all the relationships of husbands and wives, parents and children, where sorrow, crying, pain, and death will be known no more. Or to speak still more definitely, this earth, when glorified, is the Saints&#39; eternal heaven. On it they expect to live, with body, parts, and holy passions: on it they expect to move and have their being; to eat, drink, converse, worship, sing, play on musical instruments, engage in joyful, innocent, social amusements, visit neighboring towns and neighboring worlds: indeed, matter and its qualities and properties are the only beings or things with which they expect to associate. . . . Materiality is indelibly stamped upon the very heaven of heavens, upon all the eternal creations; it is the very essence of all existence.</i><br><br>If we believe what he has said and have the feeling in our hearts that the next world is as real as this one, then, you see, the gospel that is taught to us through the scriptures and by the prophets ought to deal with more than just a narrow and flimsy idea of heaven&#39;s being only a place where we sit on a cloud and sing praises and so on. In other words, the gospel ought to cover every aspect of life. In like manner, salvation deals with every aspect of existence. I have another statement from Elder Pratt. It was included in a lecture on astronomy which he gave at the University of Deseret in Salt Lake City and was published in a little book called<i>Wonders of the Universe</i>:<br><br><i>What rational being can look upward into the blue vault of heaven, and behold the sun in its effulgent glory; the moon, shining with a silvery brightness, . . . the stars . . . twinkling, as it were, with joy, and lighting up the dark unfathomable abyss of an unknown immensity; what rational being . . . can behold this . . . sublime scenery without feeling the most intense desire to unlock the heavenly archives, and read, from the great book of creation, the grand science of the origin of worlds, the laws by which they are governed, and their eternal destinies? Kings upon their thrones, and the humble shepherd in the field, have alike participated in this sublime emotion. . . . While the man of God, with loftier views and higher aspirations, has soared aloft from nature up to nature&#39;s Author--</i><br><br>And here&#39;s the point that I want to make. A true man of God isn&#39;t content with studying just the things of the world and of the universe unless it also includes a study of the Creator.<br><br><i>and, overpowered with the infinite greatness and resplendent glories which surround him on every side, he bows in humble adoration before the great Eternal.</i>[Salt Lake City, Utah, 1937, p. 2]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball, in the April 1979 conference, discussed some of the progress the Church had made, but even more, some of the progress which it was about to make, and I&#39;d like to read what he said:<br><br><i>The Church is at a point in its growth and maturity when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way. . . . But the basic decisions needed for us to move forward as a people, must be made by the individual members of the Church. . . . We have paused on some plateaus long enough. . . . The Church is ready now to accomplish . . . things which it could not have done just a few years ago.</i>[<i>CR</i>, April 1979, p. 114]<br><br>Some of those things that are being accomplished are the great emphasis on and forward march in missionary work in lands where missionaries have not been, with more missionaries than we have ever had before. Another one of the great steps of progress that the Church is able to make now that it could not make before is in temple work and in genealogical research. There are now ability and opportunity to do things that could not be done before.<br><br>There is another aspect of progress, too, that we don&#39;t want to overlook, and that is what is being done with the scriptures in the Church. As you know, two years ago there came forth for the first time in the history of this church an edition of the Bible published by the Church. The words of the Bible are still the same (it is the King James Version), but the footnotes, the references, and the study helps and guides have been compiled in order to take full advantage of all the things the Lord has given in latter-day revelation.<br><br>We have been warned adequately in the scriptures that the Bible has not come to us in its original purity. Most of what remains is true, but there is much that is missing. When we lose something, we not only lose the part that is gone, but we often lose the key to understanding what is left.<br><br>We have now in the Church an edition of the Holy Bible with biblical aids and study helps that surpasses any edition available before. We have cross references to Joseph Smith&#39;s Translation and to the other standard works and a super ready-reference system called the Topical Guide. The new publication of the Bible also has new headings for every chapter. They were written by Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum of the Twelve and are extremely informative. You could almost get by just reading the headings without reading the scriptures. If you should get one of these new editions and read the chapter headings, you&#39;d see the great flood of information and how it helps us to draw out of the chapter that which is really there.<br><br>In August of this year there will be a new publication of the triple combination approved by the First Presidency and the Twelve. It was produced under their direction. It will contain some minor corrections in the text where there have been errors or omissions, and new cross references and footnotes. Again, the benefit we have from the Prophet Joseph Smith&#39;s translation of the Bible is clearly manifest in the new triple combination. Every chapter in the Book of Mormon, every section in the Doctrine and Covenants, every chapter in the Pearl of Great Price has a new heading, each of them informative and superior to that which was there before. And so when we are talking about the progress that the Church is making we must include the opportunity the Lord has given us to have a set of scriptures that is more revealing, more correct, and more helpful than what we have had before.<br><br>I travel around the Church a little, and I am often in a meeting somewhere other than my regular home ward. I notice as I go around that not all the teachers are using the new edition of the Bible. I had an interesting opportunity and experience recently. I was sitting in a class, and the teacher, knowing that I had had something to do with the preparation of the new LDS publication of the Bible, began to apologize to me that he wasn&#39;t using the new Bible in teaching his priesthood class. I felt that he didn&#39;t need to apologize to me, but he did so anyway. After the class was over he came to me and said, "I know we ought to be using the new edition of the Bible, but I&#39;m used to these books because these are the ones I marked when I was in the mission field twenty years ago. I am familiar with these, and I have my notes and cross references and so on." That seemed like a pretty good reason, but we walked together to the parking lot and he got in a<i>new</i>car and drove away. I thought, "He hasn&#39;t kept up in the gospel and in his scripture study the same way he has in automobiles. He didn&#39;t continue to use the same car he had used in the mission field, which was 20 years ago."<br><br>I believe that&#39;s what President Kimball is getting at when he says, "We have paused on some plateaus long enough." It is now time to move ahead in some areas which the Church could not do before this time.<br><br>I will cite some of the many places where Joseph Smith&#39;s translation throws some light upon the scriptures where they are not clear in the King James Version. One place is in the Sermon on the Mount. A statement from Matthew 6:32‚Äì33 of the King James Version is familiar to all of us. The Savior, speaking to the disciples said:<br><br><i>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</i><br><br><i>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</i><br><br>One might say, "What is the matter with that? It sounds pretty clear; it sounds good. &#39;Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.&#39;" When Joseph Smith was making a translation of it, he worded it a little differently, and this is the way it reads.<br><br><i>Wherefore, seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and to establish his righteousness.</i><br><br>At first that may not seem too different, but if you think of it, it is quite different. Do you know a little prayer that goes like this?<br><br><i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i><br><br><i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep.</i><br><br><i>If I should die before I wake,</i><br><br><i>I pray the Lord my soul to take.</i><br><br>There&#39;s nothing wrong with that. It&#39;s a nice thought to have at night when you go to bed, but it doesn&#39;t require anything of the individual. All you have to do is go to sleep. If you die before the morning, you hope the Lord will take you. I see no great harm in the thought, but it doesn&#39;t require enough of the individual.<br><br>This passage that we&#39;re talking about says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added" as though once we join, we have it made. On the other hand, in the wording given by the Prophet in the inspired translation, it reads, "Seek to<i>build up</i>the kingdom of God." That means that after we join there is still work to do. However the kingdom is when we find it, it ought to be better when we leave it, you see. "Seek ye first<i>to build up</i>the kingdom of God and<i>to establish</i>his righteousness." It takes a lot more doing to establish righteousness in our own lives or in our community or in the world than it does just to know about it. What we have here is a call for action, a call for commitment.<br><br>Now, let me give you an "inspired version" of that little prayer, but we can&#39;t thrust the responsibility for this one on the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Now I get me up to work</i><br><br><i>I pray the Lord I will not shirk.</i><br><br><i>If I should die before tonight,</i><br><br><i>I pray the Lord my work&#39;s all right.</i><br><br>That rendition requires more of the individual than just being there. It draws forth out of him a commitment and a labor and something to do. There are a number of places like that--about 3,410 of them, to be exact--in the scriptures where the true meaning of the scripture is developed and amplified in a manner that we can read and get what was intended. The Book of Mormon tells us that, when the Bible was written originally, it was clear and plain and easily understood and that it contained the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It also tells us that down through the years many plain and precious things have been lost (see 1 Nephi 13:26‚Äì39).<br><br>The point I want to make is this: I find that by and large, the King James Version tells us what happened; Joseph Smith&#39;s translation will add<i>why</i>it happened. It gives us the plain and precious insight as to why a certain thing was said or done. For instance, we have in the Bible a rather clear statement<i>that</i>God created the world. But in the inspired translation by Joseph Smith, it will also indicate<i>why</i>he created the world, which is just about as important to know as the fact that he did it. If we know why he did it, that gives us a better understanding as to how things are. The same is true of a large number of other topics.<br><br>There is an account in the seventh chapter of Mark in which it says that Jesus retired to a house and would that no man should come unto him. But he could not be hid, for a certain woman found him and said, "My daughter is ill. Will you come and heal her?" As you read that in the King James Version, you get the impression that Jesus was weary or for some reason wanted to be out of contact with people that day and that he retired to a house, but in spite of all his desires they found him. When you read it in Joseph Smith&#39;s translation (and it is Mark 7:24), the basic facts of the case are about the same. He did retire to a house, and he did desire that no man should come unto him. They found him, but not for the reason that he could not be hidden. It says that he could not refuse them, for he had such great compassion upon them. You know and I know, that if Jesus wanted to be hidden, he could stand right here near this pulpit and would not be seen. There was no task too difficult for the Lord. It is unthinkable that he wanted to be alone but couldn&#39;t find seclusion--unless we look at the dimension which Joseph Smith&#39;s translation adds, and that is that he had such compassion on humanity that his compassion would not let him stay in seclusion. The Joseph Smith Translation brings out a spiritual dimension which otherwise would be overlooked. There are a great many insights of that nature in the Joseph Smith Translation.<br><br>Now I would like to mention a few items about my feelings on some viewpoints or matters of basic understanding that every Latter-day Saint ought to have in mind.<br><br>We ought to understand that (1) each of us individually is a son or a daughter of divine celestial parents, (2) that we lived as intelligent individual spirit persons before we were born into this present mortal world, (3) that this earth was prepared on purpose by the Lord as a place for us to obtain physical bodies and to gain experience, (4) that Adam brought about the mortal conditions of this life, and (5) that Jesus Christ is our Elder Brother in the spirit and our personal Savior. (6) He is the only Begotten of the Father in the flesh and the only Savior for this whole world. (7) Without his atonement there could be and would be no salvation or redemption for the people of the world from the fall of Adam. He alone is the Savior and the Redeemer for the whole human family, for all are descendants of Adam, and all have partaken of Adam&#39;s fall. (8) We should understand that Joseph Smith is the greatest witness for Christ who lived on this earth since the time of Peter, and (9) that service in the kingdom and in the Church and to our fellow beings is of top priority as to what prepares us for eternity. (10) We should have some feeling that no one can be saved in ignorance of the gospel because without a knowledge of the gospel, we cannot exercise a true faith in Jesus Christ, and without faith in Jesus Christ, no one can be saved. (11) We should understand that there is a devil, that he is the archenemy of our souls, and that he seeks in every possible manner to destroy us. And finally, (12) we ought to have some understanding that the answer to all the problems that we will ever encounter are found in the gospel of Jesus Christ and in its application to our daily lives.<br><br>Now, that doesn&#39;t mean you could sit down and read the scriptures and immediately find the answers to your problems. It is not quite like that. Sometimes answers come quickly, but often not. The scriptures contain eternal principles. They contain the word of the Lord, and sometimes when we are reading those principles, the Spirit of the Lord puts into our minds the solution to the problem with which we have been wrestling. And sometimes, as we are reading the scriptures, we comprehend certain principles which we might have overlooked and of which we need to be reminded. Consequently, there is a reason why we ought to read daily and become acquainted with the scriptures. In addition to that, since salvation deals with every aspect of life, we ought to expect that the scriptures do also. And therefore, in every area of our study and our lives, those principles that are found in the gospel should reach over and help us solve some of the problems and theories that pertain to every other study. The Lord is not one sided. He created the whole world and all the people in it, and he has given us certain guidance so that we might make this journey through life in the best possible manner. Of course, if we are in dangerous water and someone throws us a life jacket and we say, "Oh, I don&#39;t want that," we have to go without the help we could have had.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., spoke of his feeling on the importance of spiritual learning:<br><br><i>There is spiritual learning just as there is material learning, and the one without the other is not complete; yet, speaking for myself, if I could have only one sort of learning, that which I would take would be the learning of the spirit, because in the hereafter I shall have opportunity in the eternities which are to come to get the other, and without spiritual learning here my handicaps in the hereafter would be all but overwhelming.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1934, p. 94]<br><br>And President Kimball made it marvelously clear when he said:<br><br><i>The secular knowledge is to be</i>desired;<i>the spiritual knowledge is a</i>necessity.<i>We shall use all of the accumulated secular knowledge in order to create worlds and furnish them, but only through the mysteries of God and these hidden treasures of knowledge will we arrive at the place and condition where we may use that knowledge in creation and exaltation.</i>[<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle,</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972), p. 280]<br><br>I think we should understand that individuals must shoulder the responsibility for their own preparedness and for their own acquisition of knowledge and of skills and service. We just cannot sluff that off onto anyone else. We as individuals have to take that responsibility ourselves. We should understand that the scriptures are given to us by divine revelation for our guidance and learning, that spirituality is not obtained through intellect alone but through prayer and through obedience to the commandments of the gospel, and that in times of trial we are sustained by our spirituality, not by our intellect. I remember some years ago when a prominent professor in sciences suffered the loss of his son and his wife because of leukemia. It was not his excellent training in physics that sustained him through that experience with death and loss. It was the spiritual progress that he had made through the years. It was the testimony of eternal truths that sustained him. He had acquired those things by obedience to the gospel, by study of the scriptures, and by his activity in the Church. Then when the day of trial came, he was not left entirely alone.<br><br>I would like to mention one other thing concerning Joseph Smith&#39;s work with the Bible. Occasionally people say to me, "Well, wasn&#39;t Joseph Smith just Mormonizing the Bible?" I have never heard that term; I never would have thought of it on my own. But I guess what they mean by that is "Wasn&#39;t he just going through the Bible, changing the words so that they will agree with Mormon doctrine?" And my answer to that is: "No, that is not what Joseph Smith was doing. He was not &#39;Mormonizing&#39; the Bible, and to harbor that point of view is to miss the real important thing about what he was doing."<br><br>It appears to me from what I have been able to learn in my association with the inspired version that the Lord had Joseph Smith make a translation of the Bible because of the good it would do Joseph Smith as well as the good it would also do the Church. This was the way in which the Prophet Joseph Smith learned many things about the gospel. He did not read through the Bible looking for errors, looking for ways to correct it. He studied the scripture for what he could gain. Then when it was inadequate, either because of loss of material or because of faulty translation, by inquiring of the Lord and studying and pondering and thinking about it, he was able to perceive by revelation what the intention of that passage really was. And thus there came to him knowledge which he did not possess before he made the translation. We can all gain a lesson from that in our own scripture study. We do not search the scriptures because we already know; we read the scriptures so that we can learn things and comprehend them and so that we can be built up spiritually. And that was the same experience the Prophet Joseph Smith had.<br><br>We have mentioned things today concerning salvation. I&#39;d like to read another statement about it. I wrote it for this occasion:<br><br><i>The salvation spoken of in the scriptures is not simply an acquisition of knowledge, of manners, and of learned responses. It is not just a coating of polish and veneer of sophistication. It involves some of that, but the salvation that comes through Jesus Christ is much more. It includes a mighty change in the heart, a cleansing from past sins, a baptism by the Holy Ghost and of fire, and, if you will, a sanctification of the very tissues of our bodies. Salvation involves being born again, becoming a new creature in Jesus Christ, having the dross purged by the Holy Ghost, and having an eye single to the glory of God. Intellectual attainment is an aid to salvation, but it will not sufficiently change the heart of man. It takes the Spirit of God speaking to man&#39;s spirit to give it a testimony and to cleanse and change a person from a natural man into a saint. Salvation is brought about by faith in Jesus Christ, by baptism in water, by keeping the commandments, and by the operation of the Holy Ghost. Salvation encompasses every aspect of life--social, spiritual, physical, economic, intellectual, and emotional. For these reasons we understand that the gospel of Jesus Christ is more than a system of ethics, more than a social order, and more than a mental exercise. Without the divine birth of Jesus Christ, without his sinless life, the shedding of his blood in Gethsemane, his death upon the cross, and his bodily, physical resurrection from the grave, there would have been no redemption from sin or death. Even if we had the same set of rules, even if we had the same set of ordinances and the same ethics that we now have, without the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, none of the other would bring about salvation. Nothing is more basic to the gospel than the fact of Jesus&#39; atonement. He came to atone for the fall of Adam as well as for our personal sins. He paid for a broken law. Without that payment, nothing we could do would save us in this life or in the next. If Christ had not made the atonement, nothing that we would do would make up for the loss.</i><br><br>A few closing comments. The importance of searching the scriptures was the subject of an editorial in the<i>Deseret News</i>. It is dated 7 February 1852. Although the article is unsigned, the idea sounds very much like President Brigham Young. Listen to these words:<br><br><i>Some have supposed that it would make but little difference with them whether they learn much or little, whether they attain to all the intelligence within their reach or not while they tarry in this world, believing that if they paid their tithing, went to meetings, said their prayers, and performed those things which are especially commanded, that it would be well with them and as soon as they laid off this mortal body, all would be well with them. This is a mistaken idea and that will cause every soul to mourn who embraces and practices upon it. When we arrive in the world of resurrected bodies, we will learn, to our sorrow</i>[if we have not done what we should do]<i>that God requires of us in this world not only obedience to his revealed will, but a searching after his purposes and plans.</i><br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say today is this: in the revelations which the Lord has given to us, we ought to find the principles and the basic concepts that will enable us to establish our lives on a basis not only in spiritual things, but in all other things--secular, intellectual, all other areas. Using the scriptures as our basic source of truth, all other things that we do can be put in proper perspective. But if we go through this life doing only those things we are particularly commanded to do, we will probably not have the spiritual insight and understanding necessary to recognize God&#39;s purposes and plans. Elder John A. Widtsoe has said:<br><br><i>It is a paradox that men will gladly devote time every day for many years to learn a science or an art. And yet they expect to gain a knowledge of the gospel, which comprehends all sciences and all arts, through a perfunctory glance at books or an occasional listening to sermons.</i><br><br>I&#39;ll add the comment: We don&#39;t want to remain kindergartners in the gospel while we become Ph.D.&#39;s in other subjects; in other words, we want to progress in the gospel at the same rate that we are progressing in other things.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith said:<br><br><i>A fanciful and flowery and heated imagination beware of because the things of God are of deep import, and time and experience and careful and ponderous thought and solemn thoughts can only find them out.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 137]<br><br>President Hugh B. Brown said:<br><br><i>I am impressed with the testimony of a man who can stand and say he knows the gospel is true. What I would like to ask is, "But, sir, do you know the gospel?" I say it is one thing to know the gospel is true, and it is another thing to know what the gospel is. Mere testimony can be gained with but perfunctory knowledge of the Church and its teachings, as evidenced by the hundreds who are now coming into the Church with but bare acquaintanceship. But to retain a testimony, to be of service in building the Lord&#39;s kingdom, requires a serious study of the gospel and knowing what it is.</i>[Personal correspondence, dated 28 January 1969]<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball gave this counsel to seminary teachers:<br><br><i>I hope that you teachers will involve students heavily in scripture reading. I find that when I get causal in my relationship with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice speaking, that I&#39;m far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures, the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and might and mind and strength. And loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel. We learn the lessons of life more readily and surely if we see the results of wickedness and righteousness in the lives of others. . . . All through the scriptures every weakness and strength of man has been portrayed, and rewards and punishments have been recorded. One would surely be blind who could not learn to live properly by such reading.</i>[Address to seminary and institute personnel, Brigham Young University, July 11, 1966]<br><br>I live on a little one-acre farm about 7 miles north of here, and some time ago I was planting a garden in an area that until then had been a hayfield. In preparing the soil for the first planting, I found hundreds of rocks about the size of my hand. Everyone knows that rocks are of no value in a vegetable garden, so I threw all the rocks out beyond the garden area. What was left was fine, powdered soil, easily worked and easily furrowed. After the seeds were planted, we needed to irrigate, so we made some long, straight rows of water ditches in between each of the rows of seeds. As the water cam tumbling down through the main ditch and turned into the head of each row of the garden, I saw it wash away the finely powdered soil and do great damage to the rows of seeds. Do you know what I needed then more than anything else? I needed some rocks. I quickly got the hint that there is a proper place for the strength of a rock in a vegetable garden. I scrambled over the ground, gathering as fast as I could the rocks that I had once thrown away. They needed to be put at the head of each row to withstand the onslaught of the water. Through it all I began to see a need for proper balance in life. You need a garden; the garden needs water and soil and rocks, but they need to be in the proper place and in the proper proportion. If everything were a rock, nothing would grow. It is too rigid. But if there is no principle and no stability, and too much flexibility, everything will be washed away in the day of trouble. If we have an individual philosophy so bland that anything goes, we&#39;ll soon find that everything goes. I saw an application to life, and I recognized that in my own life I need conviction and testimony. Every organization that is to endure must have leaders that are like rocks, not easily moved, not washed away from their foundations. You know, we can&#39;t live on borrowed light. We must have within ourselves our own principles based on the gospel of Jesus Christ and a testimony that is born of the Spirit.<br><br>At Caesarea Philippi Jesus spoke to the Twelve and asked them, "Who do men say that I am?" He did it in a most interesting way. First, he said, "Who do other people say that I the Son of man am?"<br><br>They replied, "Some think you&#39;re Elijah, and others think you&#39;re Jeremiah or one of the prophets."<br><br>Then he turned to the Twelve, and he asked, "Whom do you say that I am?" Can you see the Master Teacher teaching by contrast? "That&#39;s what they say; what do you say?"<br><br>Peter, speaking for the Twelve, said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."<br><br>Jesus replied, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona. You say I am Christ. I say you are Peter. Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but your Father which is in heaven, and upon this rock, I will build my church" (see Matthew 16:17‚Äì18).<br><br>We understand that rock to be the rock of revelation. And when you actually go to the place where that was done, where that conversion took place, you get the message even more clearly. It is a very impressive place. The area near Caesarea Philippi consists of huge outcroppings of stone. It is rock upon rock. There are rocks as big as houses there. Can you see Jesus and the Twelve in that circumstance and Jesus teaching them, "Upon this rock of revelation I will build my church"? They couldn&#39;t have missed the message. You can get it from the scriptures, but you get an additional dimension when you stand in that place in the presence of those big rocks.<br><br>I certainly appreciate the confidence which the university administration and the Board of Trustees have placed in me to honor me with the position of dean of Religious Instruction. I hope what I have said today has touched the heart of each of us that we might realize the place that the gospel has in the large area of our lives, that we might know why religion is required at BYU, why it is helpful to us (whether it is required or not) to become acquainted with the scriptures and to search out the eternal truths.<br><br>I am thankful for a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know those things that are taught in the scriptures and by the Brethren are true. I am grateful for that knowledge.<br><br>Joseph Smith said in substance: "It is one thing to know there is a heaven; it is another thing to have the Lord tell you that you are going there" (see<i>Teachings</i>, p. 306). And that&#39;s the way I feel at this point: there&#39;s no question in my mind that the gospel is true, that there is a heaven, and that Jesus is the Christ. I have the knowledge not just through study but through the whisperings and the manifestations of the Holy Spirit. And now I pray that we might all live in such a manner that we might use the opportunities that are now before us and that we might rise to a level of spirituality where we comprehend all truth about all things because of the revelations of the Lord. May we find ourselves saved in every way in the celestial kingdom in the presence of our God and our Savior. For this I pray and express my gratitude for the opportunity of living now when the gospel is here, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert J.

<h1> Form of Godliness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The late Samuel Johnson once said, "There's nothing like an imminent hanging to concentrate the mind upon a single idea!" For the past several weeks my mind has focused upon a central theme which I would like to share with you today. Inasmuch as speakers generally learn more than listeners, I need to improve my life in a number of ways, so I've chosen to speak to the topic "Having a Form of Godliness."<br><br>Above the desk in my office are a number of photographs which are very significant to me. One of them is a picture of the Provo Temple taken at night. The illuminated golden spire of that temple is a light upon a hill which cannot be hid (see Matthew 5:14). When I look at that photo, I behold a beautiful building with unpretentious architectural lines. But within the walls of that temple, ordinances are performed which have eternal significance. Indeed, the lives of millions in an unseen world have been forever influenced by the ordinances performed therein. Instruction is given which provides us with an eternal blueprint, a spiritual life-script which, if followed carefully, will help us return to the presence of a loving Heavenly Father. I keep this photo nearby to remind me of covenants I have renewed in that holy place.<br><br>Beneath the picture of the Provo Temple is a photograph of another building, an edifice embellished with nearly every imaginable form of ornamentation. This building is a virtual temple of art, the Vienna Museum of Art History. I keep this photograph near to remind me of some wonderful experiences which my family and the family of Professors Garold and Norma Davis, and 30 beautiful, inquisitive BYU students had in Austria just a year ago. This massive, ornate structure adorned in a neo-Baroque style houses more than a thousand of the world's greatest paintings and other works of art. In many respects it embodies much that is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Thirteenth Article of Faith). Even devoid of its masterworks, this building would be a work of art in its own right. The grandeur of its architectural symmetry, its beautifully sculptured marble columns, and its ornate ceilings evoke feelings of awe and appreciation for the talents of the builders and those who gave of their means to help construct this beautiful building.<br><br>On one occasion as I visited this inspiring museum, I reflected upon the words of the Savior to a boy prophet in the spring of 1820:<br><br><i>They draw near to me with their lips ... having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.</i>[Joseph Smith 2:19; see 2 Timothy 3:5]<br><br>Each time I revisited this museum or a concert hall or the famous Vienna State Opera House, I felt inspired by the talents of others, all of whom lived as best they could within the light they'd been given. But in each of these buildings returned the reverberating theme "[they have] a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof."<br><br>And then, suddenly, I was struck with a three-hundred kilovolt question: It's wonderful that you belong to a Church which has a form of godliness and also the power thereof, but what of you and your<i>personal</i>life? Bibbed and tuckered in your white shirt and Sunday suit, with your spit-shined shoes and your missionary haircut, Brother Condie, do you perhaps sometimes have a<i>form</i>of godliness, but does your personal life really reflect the<i>power</i>of the priesthood of God?<br><br>Like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas Eve, I felt a pallor of gloom sweep my soul as I reflected upon the many times I had exercised my priesthood unworthily and the times I had partaken of the sacrament without sincere intentions of renewing covenants. I retrieved painful memories of having reproved others many times with sharpness without having been moved upon by the Holy Ghost (see D&amp;amp;C 121:43). I recalled the conscience-wracking consequences of covering my sins in an interview when the bishop asked me just one question: "Have you been a good kid lately?" I replied yes, but in my heart I knew, and I knew the Lord knew, that a more careful interview would have yielded some soul-searching signs of wavering worthiness.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, for one of the few times in my life, I gained a glimpse into the depths of my own soul, and I didn't like everything I saw. Like Enos, the son of Jacob, I have observed through personal experience the egocentricity of sin. As Enos went hunting and his soul began to hunger for the things of the Spirit, his first recorded thoughts were upon his<i>own</i>soul. It was not until he had prayed all day long and into the night and had received a confirmation of forgiveness of his<i>own</i>sins that his thoughts were turned to his brethren, the Nephites, and then to the Lamanites (see Enos).<br><br>Through personal experience I have found that when one does not have the Spirit of the Lord, any service within the Church becomes extremely arduous. Perhaps David described the predicament best when he wrote in Psalm 88:15, "While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted." One of the Brethren described this phenomenon as "going through life serving the Lord in such a way as not to offend the devil."<br><br>On the other hand, when our spirits are in tune, the powers of heaven can and do distill upon us, drenching us with joy in serving the Lord through service to others. It is then that our confidence waxes strong before God and the Holy Ghost becomes our constant companion (see D&amp;amp;C 121:45‚Äì46).<br><h2><b>King David</b></h2><br>There are few examples more poignant than the life of King David in illustrating the corrosion of confidence in the sight of the Lord. As a na√Øve shepherd boy whose thoughts were garnished with virtue, filled with faith and confidence, he slew Goliath while his compatriots cowered in the background. As a poet-king, anointed to that position under the hands of the prophet Samuel, he exemplified a form of godliness as he wrote of green pastures, still waters, and paths of righteousness. Filled with faith he humbly, yet confidently, proclaimed:<br><br><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</i>[Psalms 23:4, emphasis added]<br><br>In his very next recorded psalm he asserted that those who shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord must have "clean hands, and a pure heart" (Psalms, 24:3‚Äì4).<br><br>But some time later, after becoming the king of all Israel, David, the shepherd boy grown tall, "lifted up his soul into vanity"; and, following the lusts of a heart no longer pure, he committed a sin for which forgiveness is difficult, and then compounded it by covertly committing an even greater sin.<br><br>The psalms of David provide us with an excellent barometer of his spirituality just as our own personal journals reflect our own spiritual strengths and weaknesses. Thus, it is of interest to read David's journal entry shortly after his encounter with Bathsheba. Wracked with unrelenting remorse he wrote in Psalm 51:<br><br><i>Have mercy upon me, O God ... blot out my transgressions.</i><br><br><i>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</i>[vss. 1, 11]<br><br>No longer possessed of faith which fears no evil, David's green pastures had become deserts of despair. Without divine guidance, how was he now going to lead Israel and defend her borders? In 1 Chronicles 21, we learn that Satan placed in David's heart the desire to take a census of all his people. His chief commander, Joab, was a bit distressed at David's request, for had not God always helped his chosen people in battle, regardless of their numbers? Hadn't Jehovah trimmed Gideon's troops from 32,000 to 300 to prove that it was the Lord's power and<i>not</i>sheer numbers which was responsible for the victory over the Midianites? (see Judges 7). Had not David the shephard boy been a majority of one in single-handedly defeating the Goliath-led Philistines? Little wonder that Joab questioned the king's sudden striving to find safety in numbers.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee, upon becoming the prophet of the Church in July 1972, said:<br><br><i>The safety of the Church lies in the members keeping the commandments.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>15 July 1972, p. 3]<br><br>And what of the safety of a nation? Is our nation any less exempt from the blessings of obedience and the consequences of disobedience? Were the matter not so serious, I could chuckle at the similarities between David's census of the Israelites and our own nation's compulsive counting of nuclear warheads. How many missiles does it take to protect a nation in which abortion is currently the most frequently performed operation in hospitals and clinics throughout the land? (see<i>Statistical Abstracts of the United States,</i>Washington, D.C., U. S. Department of Commerce, 1980, pp. 69‚Äì71). Is national security possible for a country whose citizens are addicted by the millions to movies, magazines, and television programs which vividly portray Satan's smutty smorgasbord on a daily basis? In my humble view, parity in nuclear numbers may numb our fears, but it is a sad substitute for spiritual strength and security.<br><br>Sometimes, even within the Church, an undue concern with numbers can impair human relationships as people become pawns in a quantitative quest for perfection. But what of<i>qualitative</i>perfection? Do our statistical reports sometimes have a<i>form</i>of godliness devoid of godly power? Elder Dean L. Larsen reminds us that<br><br><i>the qualities of the spirit are susceptible to assessment, but they must be assessed by spiritual means</i>[Dean L. Larsen "Some Thoughts on Goal-Setting,"<i>Ensign</i>, February 1981, pp. 62‚Äì65]<br><br>Paul's counsel to the Corinthians may be helpful to us in this regard. Said Paul:<br><br><i>The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</i>[2 Corinthians 3:6]<br><br>I suppose the secular equivalent to this statement is the observation of Roy Frances that "too much rigor often leads to mortis."<br><h2><b>Means and Goals</b></h2><br>I make no claim to being a theologian, but with my limited knowledge and perspective, it appears to me that in the eternal economy of things, the methods we use to achieve our eternal goals are often as important as the goals themselves.<br><br>In the fourth chapter of Moses we learn of the council in heaven wherein Satan proposed what appears to be a very laudable goal:<br><br><i>I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it.</i>[Moses 4:1]<br><br>Now, what could possibly be wrong with such a lofty goal, to absolutely assure eternal salvation to all mankind? The Lord himself answered this question:<br><br><i>Because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, ... I caused that he should be cast down.</i>[Moses 4:3]<br><br>In other words, exaltation is<i>not</i>to be purchased by the surrender of one's free agency, but rather through the Atonement and "by grace after all we can do" (2 Nephi 25:23). This latter step involves the proper use of our free agency, not its enforcement by others.<br><br>In the fourth chapter of Ephesians the apostle Paul explained that the Church was organized (Ephesians 4:11) "for the perfecting of the saints" (Ephesians 4:12). And how is this perfecting process to proceed? By "speaking the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15).<br><br>Alma gave his son, Shiblon, similar advice prior to his departure to win souls for the kingdom. Said Alma:<br><br><i>Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions.</i>[Alma 38:12]<br><br>As we continually contemplate this vital relationship between mortal means and eternal goals, it may be well to reflect upon the fact that the Savior called Peter and Andrew to become "<i>fishers</i>of men" (Matthew 4:19),<i>not</i>hunters. Whereas hunters pursue their quarry, assailing it with slings and arrows, the fishers of man are to use the methods of "persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41). It is well to remember also that when we are fishing, the fish must take some of the initiative in order to swim into the net, and therein one finds an eternal meaning in one's life within the gospel net.<br><h2><b>Sunday Neurosis</b></h2><br>In his book<i>Man's Search for Meaning,</i>the Viennese psychiatrist Viktor Frankl discusses individuals whose lives have no sense of meaning. He refers to this empty feeling or existential vacuum as a "Sunday neurosis," a kind of depression<br><br><i>which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest.</i>[New York: Pocket Books, 1963, p. 169]<br><br>In other words, who are we and what are we on Sundays when we don't go to work to perform the roles of accountant, electrician, truck driver, beautician, or nurse? Or who are we after we have been released as bishop or Relief Society president or elders quorum president? Or, with the new consolidated meeting schedule, who are we on Sundays when we're not in church? Is the Sabbath a day of spiritual regeneration or one of emptiness and boredom, devoid of celestial content?<br><h2><b>Sunday Nostalgia</b></h2><br>One Sunday this past spring I emerged from a priests quorum meeting in one of the wards in our stake. I had been touched by the lesson given to a pride of prospective missionaries, young lions preparing to preach the gospel. The adviser's quiet, yet firm, testimony reminded me once again that the gospel<i>really</i>is true. As I journeyed home that day, I felt no Sunday neurosis; it was more of a feeling of Sabbath nostalgia, a sense of longing for a celestial home. As I drove homeward, a familiar message found expression in song:<br><br><i>Yet ofttimes a secret something</i><br><i>Whispered, "You're a stranger here."</i><br><i>And I felt that I had wandered</i><br><i>From a more exalted sphere.</i><br>[Eliza R. Snow,<i>Hymns</i>, no. 139]<br><br>Our beloved prophet, President Kimball, has given us the solution to resolving feelings of emptiness in our lives:<br><br><i>When we are engaged in the service of our fellowmen, not only do our deeds assist them, but we put our own problems in a fresher perspective. When we concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned with ourselves. In the midst of serving, there is the promise of Jesus, that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves</i>(see Matthew 10:39). ...<br><br><i>The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways, the more substance there is to our souls. ... Indeed, it is easier to "find" ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!</i>["Small Acts of Service,"<i>Ensign,</i>December 1974, p. 2]<br><br>I hope those of you who are on a diet will take the figurative meaning of that statement.<br><h2><b>Serious but Not Hopeless</b></h2><br>The Viennese social critic, Karl Kraus, wrote a biting satire on the glorification of war in his play<i>The Last Days of Mankind</i>(<i>Die letzten Tage der Menschheit,</i>Vienna, 1922). At the outbreak of World War I, Kraus described the situation in Berlin as "serious but not hopeless, whereas in Vienna things are hopeless but not serious."<br><br>The Viennese took their operas and their arts very seriously. In the kaffee houses of Vienna, fighting was not uncommon. And what was the source of these heated debates? Whether Wagner was a greater composer than Brahms! But war--that was different. Music should be taken seriously, but not war. That was a matter of pomp and glory and good, heroic fun. Little mention was made of death and destruction. "It was perhaps the only instance in history of an army that went off to war and never came back" (Richard Rickett,<i>Austrian History,</i>Vienna: Georg Prachner, 1966, p. 122).<br><br>I suspect that sometimes our personal lives are like Vienna. We take the wrong things seriously and make light of sacred covenants which should be taken most seriously. Martin Duberman's description of the "bit" technique illustrates this problem, and I quote:<br><br><i>The "bit" technique goes like this: At all costs one must avoid the stigma of being too serious; to do so, you stick a self-mocking label on any scene in which you might be caught displaying deep emotion. Thus: I don't want to do the "engaged-couple bit," but--or "I don't want to do the "expectant-father bit," but--. Doing "bits" with people is the "in" way of establishing fellowship. They allow one to show affection while ridiculing it, to be sentimental while appearing tough.</i>[Martin Duberman,<i>New York Times Book Review,</i>19 September 1965, pp. 60‚Äì61]<br><br>Perhaps King Saul did the "sacrifice bit" by not taking the word of the prophet Samuel seriously. You will recall that Samuel had commanded Saul to slay all the Amalekites and all their animals. When Saul returned home from battle, Samuel was distraught to discover that Saul had brought several animals back with him, supposedly to sacrifice them upon his arrival home. Saul learned the hard way that "to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (1 Samuel 15:22).<br><br>I hope you youth of Zion will not engage in the "dress-standards bit" or the "missionary bit" or the "temple-marriage bit" or any other "bits" which may have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. When we make covenants in the temple of the Lord, they are to be valid for time and all eternity--period.<br><br>Consider the following practices, some of which have a form of godliness and some of which have both the form and the power:<br><br>Do we appreciate the difference between fasting and skipping breakfast?<br><br>Is there a crucial distinction in our lives between praying and saying prayers?<br><br>Can we discriminate between music which edifies and that which debases? The amplification of three basic guitar cords through sixteen-inch speakers still begs the question of whether some music is good and loud or just loud.<br><br>Do we appreciate the distinction between consecration and contribution?<br><br>Can we discern between obedience based on faith and obedience based on fear? Elder Theodore M. Burton provided some very interesting insights in this regard, and I quote from his general conference address of 1974:<br><br><i>Some members of the Church have said to me, "Why should we keep a store of food on hand? If a real emergency came in this lawless world, a neighbor would simply come with his gun and take it from us. What would you do if a person came and demanded your food?" I replied that I would share whatever I had with him, and he wouldn't have to use a gun to obtain that assistance either.</i><br><br><i>"I wouldn't," replied one man. "I have a gun, and I wouldn't hesitate to use it to defend my family. Anyone would have to kill me first in order to get food away from me! After all, they bring their own misery on themselves by not being prepared!"</i><br><br>Elder Burton, with a twinkle in his eye, continued: "Well, one way to solve this problem is to convert your neighbors to become obedient Latter-day Saints with their own supply of food." ("The Power of Elijah,"<i>Ensign</i>, April 1974, p. 62). I suppose that gunpowder would also keep the boll weevil out of the flour.<br><br>Of course, another solution to this "drawbridge mentality" is obedience to the counsel of the Lord: "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear (D&amp;amp;C 38:30) and "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40).<br><h2><b>Activity vs. Devotion</b></h2><br>Can we discern a difference between Church activity and devotion?<br><br>It has been interesting to note the extremely widespread use of the words<i>active</i>and<i>inactive</i>to describe members of the Church. If people show up for most of their meetings, we call them active. On the other hand, if they miss most of their meetings, we label them inactive. Over the years it has been interesting to observe how many so-called "active" Saints seldom contribute to the ward budget or attend the temple or render much help on the welfare farm. By contrast, there are Saints whose neighbors call them "inactive" but who frequent the stake farm and also contribute generously to the ward budget and building fund.<br><br>It seems that the words<i>active</i>and<i>inactive</i>don't adequately capture the dimensions of devotion, consecration, commitment, and godliness. For example, the sons of Eli regularly officiated in the temple despite the fact that they were impure and desecrated the sacrifices of those who had come to worship (1 Samuel 2‚Äì3). By today's statistical standards, they were "active" because they showed up every day.<br><br>The importance of discerning the contents beneath the form was brought forcefully home to a shopper in an Austrian supermarket. He was perplexed to observe two cans of mushrooms of identical size with different labels and very discrepant prices. He asked one of the clerks what the difference was between the cans of mushrooms for 13 shillings and the ones for 26 shillings. With a smile, the clerk replied, "The ones for 26 are guaranteed not to be poisonous."<br><h2><b>Power vs. Form</b></h2><br>There are many organizations and activities which compete for our time, our means, and our loyalty. Many of these are what Robert Bellah ("Civil Religion in America," Daedalus, 1967, pp. 1‚Äì21) calls "civil religion," for they have the form of religion. For example, there are civic organizations and learned societies which have a hierarchical structure complete with high councils. They solicit contributions in proportion to one's income and even hold general conferences. Their purposes are generally lofty, and membership in such organizations is to be encouraged. But after all is said and done, in an eternal perspective, more is often<i>said</i>than<i>done</i>, for the priesthood of God is absent from such organizations.<br><br>Even as great an organization as the Boy Scouts of America, with its inspiring Scout Law and inspired motto, must recognize that it is the power and authority of the Aaronic Priesthood--not the authority of an Eagle Scout--by which young priests bless sacred emblems.<br><br>The training and self-discipline of athletic competition does much to remind us that our bodies are temples for our spirits (1 Corinthians 3:16). For some, however, interest in athletics, either as participant or spectator, takes on a sacred aura which has a form of religious devotion. But what of the power of God? A million-dollar baseball contract pales in comparison to the priesthood promises contained in the oath and covenant found in section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br>As a rabid boxing fan in my high school years, I was dismayed when Gene Fullmer, the "Mormon Mauler," lost his bid to be the middle-weight champion of the world, and I asked my stake patriarch how the Lord could allow Sugar Ray Robinson to beat Gene Fullmer. His reply was succinct, "I don't think the Lord caught the match."<br><br>Patriotism, misused and misdirected, may also assume a form of godliness devoid of godly power as we have seen in Ireland and Iran. As we visited the Nazi concentration camp at Mauthausen, our souls were subdued by this memorial to the high costs of hatred and the wreckage of patriotism gone awry. What began with exclusionary ethnic epithets grew into vicious vandalism and eventually ended in mass murder. After that visit, I made a promise, with God as my witness, that I was going to refrain from telling ethnic jokes and that I was going to try harder to substitute charity for criticism. I'm still wrestling with that promise.<br><br>I fear that many of us, like Saul, are more willing to sacrifice other people's possessions than to sacrifice our own sins. This was the sacrifice which the father of King Lamoni made when he prayed:<br><br><i>God ... I will give away all my sins to know thee.</i>[Alma 22:18]<br><br>And this kind of sacrifice is precisely the price that must be paid to know him and to enter his presence.<br><br>Even King David, in the depths of despair, realized better than Saul, his predecessor, what kind of sacrifices the Lord requires. In Psalm 51 he wrote:<br><br><i>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</i><br><br><i>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart.</i>[Psalms 51:16‚Äì17]<br><br>I sense that sometimes as Latter-day Saints we are often too ready to sacrifice and too slow to obey. I sometimes question how much of what we call sacrifice really constitutes a sacrifice on our part. For example, if we invest several thousand dollars in long-term savings certificates with the intent of gaining a rich return on our long-term investments, do we ever refer to such investments as a sacrifice? I've heard of stockbrokers, realtors, and investment counselors, but I've never heard of sacrificial account executives.<br><br>Then what of financial contributions to the kingdom of God? And what of the time we spend in preparing Primary lessons, singing in ward choirs, or taking a troop of Boy Scouts to Camp Poison Sumac for a week's retreat on the shores of Mosquito Lake? Do these contributions constitute a major sacrifice, or are they eternal investments in a paradisiacal portfolio promising divine dividends that "all that [our] Father hath shall be given unto [us]"? (D&amp;amp;C 84:38).<br><br>In section 84 we learn from the words of the Lord that<br><br><i>without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:21]<br><br>It is in the ordinances of the priesthood, not in numbers, that the power of godliness is manifest. And what of the daughters of Zion who do not hold the priesthood?<br><h2><b>Motherhood and Priesthood</b></h2><br>In the book Priesthood and Church Government, Elder John A. Widtsoe poses a profound question: "Why should God give his sons a power that is denied his daughters? He then proceeds to answer his own question:<br><br><i>This division of responsibility is for a wise and noble purpose. Our Father in Heaven has bestowed upon His daughters a gift of equal importance and power; the "gift" referred to is that of motherhood. Woman may claim other activity, but motherhood should take precedence in her entire scheme of life. ... Our Father even chose a daughter of Eve to be the earth-mother and guide of His Only Begotten Son, and thus honored womanhood for all time and eternity!</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1963, pp. 84‚Äì85]<br><br>In the divine justice and loving mercy of an omniscient, loving, and wise Heavenly Father, all women will be eligible for the blessings of priesthood ordinances, and those women who are denied the power of motherhood in this life will receive eternal compensation if they remain true and faithful. Of that modern prophets have borne witness (see Harold B. Lee,<i>Ye Are the Light of the World,</i>Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974, p. 292).<br><h2><b>Godliness and Perfection</b></h2><br>In closing, I should like to speak briefly about the relationship between godliness and perfection. In a fourteen-stake fireside in June of last year, Elder Bruce R. McConkie identified as fallacious the belief that we must be perfect to gain salvation. I was heartened by his address, for I have counseled with many students who have disclosed their distress in having failed to reach perfection by the second semester of their junior year. Or they are discouraged because they failed to return home from a mission perfect. Or they were married in the temple to a "perfect" companion, when they themselves were not perfect. (Those of you who have perfect roommates know what I'm talking about.) Elder McConkie's statement is true: We will not achieve perfection in this life. The Savior himself is the only one to accomplish this goal upon this earth. But if we are to become as the Savior, and he has commanded us to strive to do just that (see Matthew 5:48, 3 Nephi 12:48), we would do well to follow the admonition of Moroni in the final verses of the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</i>[Moroni 10:32]<br><br>The pathway to perfection will always be punctuated with painful and unpleasant events. After all, Lehi instructed Jacob that "it must needs be that there is an opposition in all things." (2 Nephi 2:11). He didn't say "there could be" or "there might be" or even that "there would be" opposition. He said "it<i>must</i>needs be that there is an opposition in all things." Opposition is indispensable to the plan of salvation and for the eternal experiences and growth afforded therein.<br><br>The pathway to perfection and godhood begins with the acquisition of such godly attributes as those described in section 4: "faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, [and] diligence" (D&amp;amp;C 4:6). In our personal strivings and in assisting those who are lost or faltering to obtain the power of godliness, may we keep in mind the Savior's thrice-given injunction to Peter: "Feed my sheep," "feed my lambs," "feed my sheep." It seems significant to me that the Lord said "<i>Feed</i>my sheep," not "<i>herd</i>them." Means are often as important as goals.<br><br>It is my prayer that each of us may leave this gathering this day with a firmer resolve to cultivate the attributes of godliness, having both the form of godliness<i>and</i>the power thereof. Many things in our lives are important but not true. There are other things, unfortunately, that are often true but not important. I bear you my testimony that the restored Church of Jesus Christ is not just true, but important--a matter of spiritual urgency, a matter of eternal life or death. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Spencer J.

<h1>in the Footsteps of Jesus - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Presidents of the fourteen stakes on this great Brigham Young University campus and your wives, President Holland and Sister Holland, President Christensen and Sister Christensen, all of you wonderful young brothers and sisters, and you remarkable missionaries, all dressed as you should be dressed:<br><br>I have the privilege of presiding over the Addison Pratt Fourth Branch at the Missionary Training Center. There are generally forty or fifty missionaries in that branch preparing to preach the gospel. There are 30 missionary branches in the Missionary Training Center. Each is named for a great missionary of the past. Addison Pratt was one of the first missionaries to go to the South Sea Islands and one of the first to learn a language. He was called by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1843.<br><h2><b>Dan Jones</b></h2><br>But of all the missionaries, there was one little fellow that seemed to impress me more than any of the others. (For some reason or other, my young brothers and sisters, I like little men.) And that little fellow was Dan Jones. I would like you missionaries and every one of the rest of us to remember two expressions of this remarkable man, Dan Jones, who went to Wales and who set a record that no missionary since that time has ever equaled. In less than four years, that man converted almost 4,000 people, an average of 1,001 a year. And when he was asked by his mission president, Orson Spencer for his formula, he said this--and I hope we'll all remember it:<br><br><i>We fight hard for all we get, and contend, toe to toe, and point to point, for every inch of ground we gain. And who would not fight when immortal souls are the prize and laurels of victory?</i>[Wendell J. Ashton,<i>Theirs Is the Kingdom</i>, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1970), p. 342]<br><br>I hope you missionaries and every one of the rest of us who has a responsibility in the Church will take the attitude of Dan Jones about the importance of his calling. He was asked by some of the Welshmen, "Who are you?"<br><br>Now listen to this gentlemen's words. His reply was (he was a college graduate):<br><br><i>I am a minister plenipotentiary for the King of Kings, an envoy extraordinary, bearing important dispatches, fraught with life and peace to the best, having my credentials emanating from the high court of heaven, sealed with the kingly authority of Omnipotence.</i>[Ashton,<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 336]<br><br>Now that's a mouthful, and you remember it.<br><h2><b>Halt, Rebecca</b></h2><br>Well, it's just wonderful to be here. You know, years ago when President Holland was just a little boy in St. George, I went down there to visit some of my students. I went to a farmer's place--I think it was in Washington. I had a boy in a class at Brigham Young University. His father used the horse to cultivate the crops, and I asked this father, "How is John doing on the farm since he has been attending Brigham Young University?"<br><br>He said, "Well, he's just as good a farmer as he ever was, but I've noticed that since he has been to BYU, his language has changed. When he used to get to the end of a furrow, he would yell out, 'Whoa there, Becky, get around there, giddap.' Now when he gets to the end of the furrow, he calls out, 'Halt, Rebecca, pivot and proceed.' And so, with that, my brothers and sisters, I will proceed with my talk.<br><h2><b>In Jerusalem</b></h2><br>Having lived in Jerusalem for a period of time with Sister Barrett and having traveled over the land of Israel extensively, I can say with Daniel S. Twohig: "I walked today where Jesus walked." In Nazareth and Galilee I have walked over the rolling hills and along the shore of that lake that Jesus loved so much and knew so well. I have drunk of the water from Jacob's well where the Savior taught the Samaritan woman and to her statement, "I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things," he replied, "I that speak unto thee am he" (John 4:25‚Äì26). I have walked over the Mount of Olives to Bethany, where he raised Lazarus from the tomb and where he later ascended into heaven. I have bowed in prayer and humility in the garden called Gethsemane, knowing that our Savior suffered so intensely that he bled at every pore and would that he might not drink the bitter cup and shrink. I have been in the Temple Court where he drove the money changers out and have climbed the hill of Calvary or Golgotha where on the cross he died. And I have sat in the Garden Tomb and read the words of St. Mark: "He is risen. He is not here" (Mark 16:6).<br><br>As I look around, many of you have walked where Jesus walked, and I am inclined to believe that you have felt him close to you. But I would like to ask the question, How many of us are walking in his steps--his life steps--his example? He invited us to do so when he said, "Come follow me. The things that I do ye do also" (see John 12:26).<br><br>In June 1977 in the Alkazar Hotel above Wadi Jos in east Jerusalem, I talked to the owner and some of his Arab friends. One of them, Riad Tahbamb, said, "You Christians don't know anything about the Moslems' beliefs. The Moslems believe in Jesus, the son of the Virgin Mary. No true Arab can be a true Moslem and not believe in Jesus, the son of the Virgin Mary." I asked him if he believed Jesus to be his Savior and his Redeemer, and that he rose from the tomb. He replied, "We believe in his ascension, that Jesus never died. We believe in Jesus the Messiah. You Christians don't know what<i>Messiah</i>means." I informed him that Messiah in the Greek is<i>Christ,</i>meaning<i>the Anointed One.</i><br><br>"Oh no," exclaimed Tahbamb, "it means the Eraser--one who wipes out."<br><br>I asked, "Does that mean he makes your life as though it were a clean sheet?"<br><br>"Yes," he nodded.<br><br>"Mr. Tahbamb, if you accept Jesus as your Savior and Redeemer and obey his commandments and repent of your sins, then they will be erased by him, and you'll start with a clean sheet," for<br><br><i>He marked the path</i><br><i>And led the way,</i><br><i>And every point defines</i><br><i>To life and light</i><br><i>And endless day</i><br><i>Where God's full presence shines.</i><br>[Eliza R. Snow,<i>Hymns,</i>no. 68]<br><h2><b>Christ the Ideal</b></h2><br>Recent discoveries (and we're all very much aware of this) urgently call attention to the need for peace, for brotherhood and mutual understanding, if our civilization is to survive. We must have peace, or we might have nothing.<br><br>We must not minimize the evils of envy, greed, intolerance, and lust for power while cynicism and materialism must be resisted and replaced by spiritual vitality.<br><br>My young friends, as we glimpse what the future holds, let us ponder the poem written by the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier entitled "Problems" and hear his concluding couplet:<br><br><i>But solution there is none,</i><br><br><i>Save in the rule of Christ alone.</i><br><br>Louis Pasteur, the famous French scientist, had the power within him to overcome impossible obstacles. Although paralysis made him a useless cripple, he nevertheless contributed more than all the soldiers of France; his researches have saved countless lives. One day he revealed his secret when he said, "The secret of what I have been able to do lies in the One to whom I surrendered my life. Christ made me what I am."<br><br>May we follow Christ, the Prince of Peace. He invited us to do so with this comforting promise:<br><br><i>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</i>[John 14:27]<br><br>May each of us follow that, and may each of us, my young friends, enfold within our very selves the ideals for perfect living left us by the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. President David O. McKay often said:<br><br><i>The highest of all ideals are the teachings and particularly the life of Jesus of Nazareth, and that man is most truly great who is most Christlike. What you sincerely . . . think of Christ will determine what you are, will largely determine what your acts will be.</i>[<i>Gospel Ideals</i>(Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1953), p. 34]<br><br>Someone else has said (and this is often quoted; you're familiar with it):<br><br><i>Ideals are like stars. You cannot succeed in touching them with your hands but like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them for your guides and by following them reach your destiny.</i>[Carl Schurtz, quoted by Harold B. Lee,<i>Youth and the Church,</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1970), p. 36]<br><h2><b>Mental Development</b></h2><br>All we have of the record of Jesus' boyhood and young manhood is a snapshot, a Kodak portrait. Just one line which tells us that his growth was normal, but well integrated. In his boyhood he did nothing unusual or spectacular. Later, when he began his ministry and returned to his hometown of Nazareth, his old neighbors were astonished at his wisdom and deeds. They asked, "Didn't he grow up right here in town? Isn't he the carpenter, and don't we know his mother and his brothers and his sisters?" (see Mark 6:1‚Äì3).<br><br>He laid in his young manhood the foundation for his later life. He sensed his sonship to his Heavenly Father. He knew then what many people do not learn until they are old, and some never at all: that the greatest thought ever to enter a man's mind is his responsibility to God. We see him in the temple at the age of twelve, "sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers" (Luke 2:46‚Äì47). When his mother and Joseph found him<br><br><i>they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me: Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</i>[Luke 2:48‚Äì49]<br><br>On the day of his martyrdom in the Carthage Jail with his brethren, the Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of his Savior and commented on his boyhood:<br><br><i>When still a boy He had all the intelligence necessary to enable Him to rule and govern the kingdom of the Jews, and could reason with the wisest and most profound doctors of law and divinity, and made their theories and practices appear like folly compared with the wisdom He possessed; but He was a boy only, and lacked physical strength even to defend His own person, and was subject to cold, to hunger and to death.</i>[<i>HC</i>6:608]<br><br>I remember well when President Harold B. Lee was talking to the student body here. He counseled them thus:<br><br><i>We're here for only one purpose, and that's to develop the whole man or the whole woman. Instead of you growing up to be just an intellectual giant, we want you to grow up to be a whole person. We want you to be spiritually attuned.</i><br><br>Jesus grew that way. Luke gives us that snapshot of his growth:<br><br><i>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</i>[Luke 2:52]<br><br>Years ago, when I had the opportunity of being president of the Northwestern States Mission, Sister Barrett, my assistants, and I rewrote the missionary handbook. We started it out with "Preparation for You, the Missionary," and we quoted those sublime words of Luke, and then we listed: physical preparation, mental preparation, social preparation, and spiritual preparation. At that time, the missionaries' free day was called "diversion day." We changed it to "preparation day." About the only thing I can remember from my stay in the missionary home fifty years ago was an expression given by a tall, handsome apostle, David O. McKay, "Preparation precedes power." I think all of us need more than one day to prepare for our lives. In fact, the Greek words used by Luke was translated into English<i>increased</i>but originally was made up of the words<i>cut</i>and<i>forward</i>. It seems as if Luke wanted us to understand that in his youth Jesus cut his way forward. What he gained he acquired by effort. Say the scriptures,<br><br><i>And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace, . . . continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness;</i><br><br><i>And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:12‚Äì14]<br><br>Jesus increased in wisdom, and so should we. Our minds are the center of our actions. You know, my young friends, as shown by the Savior's public ministry after he became a man, those early years were spent in active effort, both physical and mental. Jesus was a close observer of nature and people. He drew illustrations from the varied occupations of the time, of the professions, of the trades--the ways of the lawyer; the ways of the physician; the manner of the scribes and the Pharisee and the rabbi; the habits of the poor; the covetousness of the rich; the life of the shepherd, yes, even the life of the fisherman.<br><br>When the people heard him speak of the lilies of the field, the woman baking bread, the laborers and the vineyard, the king going to war, the good Samaritan, the prodigal son, the unforgiving servant--understanding life and all its facets, perplexities, joys, sorrows, and testings--exclaimed: "Where did this man learn wisdom, seeing he never learned?" He never went to the synagogue schools of the day.<br><br>The poet has said:<br><br><i>He talked of grass and wind and rain</i><br><i>And fig-trees and fair weather,</i><br><i>And made it his delight to bring</i><br><i>Heaven and earth together.</i><br><br><i>He spoke of lilies, vines and corn,</i><br><i>The sparrow and the raven;</i><br><i>And words so natural, yet so wise,</i><br><i>Were on men's hearts engraven.</i><br>[Copied from an old pulpit commentary and quoted by Obert C. Tanner,<i>The New Testament Speaks</i>(Salt Lake City: Department of Education, 1944), p. 246]<br><br>He counseled us:<br><br><i>Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br>I hope that each one of us cultivates the companionship of good books, especially the scriptures. Abraham Lincoln referred to the Bible as the best book God has given to man. Joseph Smith referred to the Book of Mormon as the keystone of our religion, the Doctrine and Covenants as the standard of our faith. May we each heed the injunction of the Savior to "search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39).<br><br>Thomas A. Edison, when a boy, had the insatiable urge to read every book in the library. After reading fifteen feet of books, he gave it up, saying:<br><br><i>Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.</i>[Francis Bacon, "Of Studies,"<i>Essays</i>]<br><br>Will you picture with me a boy named David O. McKay riding on a wagon from Huntsville to Ogden, reading, as he rode along, the classics, the scriptures, committing to memory many choice quotations which he later used most effectively as an apostle and a prophet of God. There are too many of us, my young friends, who have the attitude of the boy who said, "There are only two books that ever done me any good: my mother's cookbook and my dad's checkbook." Yes, we are ever pursuing but never completely encompassing. Hudson put this idea into a compact paragraph when he said:<br><br><i>This day before dawn I ascended a hill and looked at the crowded heaven, and I said to my spirit, "When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them shall we be filled and satisfied then?" And my spirit said: "No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond."</i>[Quoted by Hugh B. Brown, "Mussings and Browsings,"<i>Continuing the Quest</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1961), p. 501]<br><br>Certainly to become as perfect as our Savior is an eternal quest.<br><br>The principle of knowledge, as each one of us knows, is the principle of salvation. The Savior said to the Jews that believed on him:<br><br><i>If ye continue in my word, then ye are my disciples indeed;</i><br><br><i>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</i>[John 8:31‚Äì32]<br><br>In our day, he described truth as being the "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24).<br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:19]<br><br>Will you please remember the words of President Joseph F. Smith, speaking to a group of young people such as yourselves. He said:<br><br><i>Educate yourself not only for time, but also for eternity. The latter of the two is the more important.</i>[<i>GD,</i>p. 269]<br><br>From out of the best books we fill our minds with wholesome thoughts. After all, our lives are pretty well determined by our thoughts:<br><br><i>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</i>[Matthew 12:34]<br><br>The Savior said, "Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8), and then warned that "whosoever looketh . . . to lust . . . hath committed adultery . . . in his heart" (Matthew 5:28). I hope we'll all remember that lust is the devil's choicest temptation, and the archenemy of love. Self-mastery is here enjoined by our Savior:<br><br><i>Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart.</i>[3 Nephi 12:29]<br><br>I hope that you, while you're young, will avoid the very appearance of lustful temptation. I hope you young men and women will remember the little pioneer girl who was taken for a buggy ride by her young escort. They rode down a deserted road, and the horse stopped. The young man clucked at the horse and gently clapped the lines over the horse's back, but the horse just stood there. So he sidled over to the girl, pulled her over to him, and said, "Honey, how about a little kiss?"<br><br>She asked, "What's the good of a kiss; what'll it do for me?"<br><br>"Oh," he said, "a kiss will make you so happy and lively."<br><br>She said, "Then kiss the horse, and let's get out of here."<br><h2><b>Physical Development</b></h2><br>Jesus increased in stature. He grew physically into a perfect specimen of manhood. The scriptures tell us that he was without spot or blemish, and let me give you a picture of his inheritance, as it were. With God as his Father and Mary, "a virgin most beautiful and fair above all other virgins" (1 Nephi 11:15) as his mother, what a perfect person in every way he was! In his premortal state he said to the brother of Jared:<br><br><i>Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</i>[Ether 3:15‚Äì16]<br><br>Elder Orson F. Whitney saw in vision the Savior praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, and each time I visit the garden, I remember this beautiful vision. He was able to look upon the Savior and later described him:<br><br><i>He was of noble stature and majestic mien--not at all the weak, effeminate being that some painters have portrayed; but the very God that he was and is, as meek and humble as a little child.</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Through Memory's Halls,</i>1930, pp. 82‚Äì83]<br><br>Certainly as a young man Jesus was no physical weakling. He pushed the plane and swung the axe. He slept outdoors and spent his days walking around his favorite lake and over the hills of Palestine. His muscles were so strong that when he drove the money changers out of the temple, not one dared oppose him. Jesus was no namby-pamby with forearms. He was strong, vigorous, and handsome.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith has said:<br><br><i>We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom.</i>[I hope we get that.]<i>The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man, and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine, showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none.</i><br><br><i>All beings who have bodies have power over those who have not.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 181]<br><br>Being created out of the elements of the earth, my brothers and sisters, we have enough water to fill a 10-gallon barrel, enough fat to make 7 bars of soap; carbon for 9,000 lead pencils, phosphorus for 2,200 match heads, iron enough to make a small or medium-sized nail; enough lime to whitewash a small chicken coop, and small quantities of magnesium and sulphur--all of which can be purchased at the corner drugstore for $10. Yet when the Lord breathed into us the breath of life, we became the temples of God. Said Paul:<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i>[1 Corinthians 3:16‚Äì17]<br><br>And then this modern scripture:<br><br><i>For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy.</i><br><br><i>And when separated man cannot receive a fulness of joy.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:33‚Äì34]<br><br>Like Jesus, may we increase in stature. May we take the most precious care of these bodies, which one day we'll be required to present to our Heavenly Father in the celestial kingdom.<br><h2><b>Spiritual Development</b></h2><br>Jesus grew in favor with God. To grow in favor with God we must know him. In the Lord's great high priestly prayer, he prayed:<br><br><i>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</i>[John 17:3]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith, in his King Follett discourse, said:<br><br><i>There are but a very few beings in the world who understand rightly the character of God. . . . If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 343]<br><br>In August of 1977, Sister Barrett and I were invited to the home of Dr. Abraham Ziv Baron, head of the philosophy faculty at Hebrew University. He invited in a number of colleagues and their wives. The evening was spent in discussing our belief in God. After telling them the character of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of his fathers and the God of ours, that he has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's, Dr. Baron said, "The rabbis teach that God is a spirit." And then he added, "I do not believe the creature can ever become like the Creator."<br><br>His wife spoke up and said, "When God appeared to Moses, he was a flame of fire." Another gentlemen in the group observed that when Moses and seventy of the elders saw God, they saw his back parts.<br><br>"Indeed they did," said I, "because God is a divinely exalted man in whose image we are created. Have you not read in Exodus 33:11, 'And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend'?"<br><br>"This is a new idea about God," said Dr. Baron, "but I like it. I have never before understood the true character of God."<br><br>And then I quoted to him the words of the Prophet Joseph, and I think we can all observe them and meditate on them, even the missionaries in the high multitudes up there:<br><br><i>Ask yourselves, turn your thoughts into your hearts, and say if any of you have seen, heard, or communed with him. This is a question that may occupy your attention for a long time. . . . What kind of a being is God?</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 343]<br><br>Then I said to Dr. Baron, "He answered his own question. He is a prophet, and here is a man who knew whereof he spoke because he had seen God." Joseph said:<br><br><i>God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! . . . If you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form--like yourselves in all the person, image, and very form as a man; for Adam was created in the very fashion, image and likeness of God, and received instruction from, and walked, talked, and conversed with him, as one man talks and communes with another.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 345]<br><br>A few days after our evening with Dr. and Mrs. Baron, we met them coming from a large auditorium near David Markus Street. (When you go to Jerusalem, you can pick that out.) They had attended and participated in an international gathering of philosophers, and Dr. Baron had given the keynote address. He smiled all over as he said, "My lecture was on the nature and character of God. I thought you'd like that."<br><br>And Sister Barrett asked, "Did you give it right?"<br><br>Jesus revealed to us our Father. According to President Joseph F. Smith, the first of the five subjects that constitute the heart and soul of the gospel of Jesus Christ is "the fatherhood of God" (see<i>GD</i>, p. 29). Jesus taught us to pray, "Our Father which art in heaven" (Matthew 6:9). To Mary Magdalene he said, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father" (John 20:17). The Son-Father relationship of Jesus and our Father was perfect. We need to develop knowledge of God and personal contact with him as Jesus did to grow in favor with God.<br><br>Heber C. Kimball, the grandfather of our beloved prophet today, said that after he and Vilate Murray were married, President Brigham Young's father came to see them almost every day. He told them stories, and he sang songs and did everything he could to make them happy. And then note this: "I cannot refer to any of my acquaintances in my life as being so much like God as Brother Brigham's father." (W. R. Werner,<i>Brigham Young</i>[New York: Harcourt Brace, 1925], p. 6)<br><br>Is our Heavenly Father interested in our happiness? Well, I should say. You and I know he does all he can to help us be happy. After all, the object and the design of life is happiness, and it will be the end thereof if we follow the path that leads to it. That path is keeping all the commandments of God. And then note this, my young friends: President Brigham Young, way back in 1857, said to the Saints in Salt Lake Valley:<br><br><i>I want to tell you, each and every one of you, that you are well acquainted with God our Heavenly Father, or the great Eloheim. You are all well acquainted with Him, for there is not a soul of you but what has lived in His house and dwelt with Him year after year; and yet you are seeking to become acquainted with Him, when the fact is, you have merely forgotten what you did know.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:216]<br><br>He even went on to say that when we see our Heavenly Father, we will want to run up to him and embrace him just as we would want to run up and embrace our earthly father because we'll know him, for we once knew him. The soul of our religion, my young friends, is prayer. It began with an answer to prayer. Jesus enjoined, "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation" (Matthew 26:41). I'm a firm believer that prayer keeps one from sin, and sin keeps one from prayer. Among the Nephites Jesus prayed, and "so great and marvelous were the words which he prayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be uttered by man" (3 Nephi 19:34). Then he said to the Nephites:<br><br><i>Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father.</i>[3 Nephi 18:24]<br><br>A Nobel Prize winner had this to say, and it's worth our pondering:<br><br><i>When we pray, we link ourselves with the inexhaustible motive power that spins the universe. When we address God in prayer, we change both body and soul for the better. Prayer is the most powerful form of energy we can generate.</i>[Alexis Carrel]<br><br>As we grow in favor with God, let us be assured that<br><br><i>If radio's thin fingers</i><br><i>Can pluck a melody</i><br><i>From night and toss it over</i><br><i>A continent or sea;</i><br><br><i>If petaled white notes</i><br><i>Of a violin</i><br><i>Are blown across a mountain</i><br><i>Or city's din;</i><br><br><i>If songs like crimson roses</i><br><i>Are called from thin, blue air,</i><br><i>Why should mortals wonder</i><br><i>If God hears prayer?</i><br>[Quoted by William R. Sloan,<i>CR,</i>April 1930, p. 114]<br><br>A clean life, my young fiends, puts us in a condition to pray and ask our Father for his sustaining protection and power throughout life. A little boy was dressed up in his Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes by his mother and told to sit out on the porch and not get dirty. He sat there in his Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes. (This was many years ago. You youngsters, even these folks on the stand, don't know anything about Lord Fauntleroy clothes, but as a little fellow, I wore them; and I could describe them, but I shan't.) He sat there on the porch, and he was amusing himself until the butcher boy came down the street. He saw this boy dressed in his go-to-meeting clothes and yelled out, "Hello there, you sissy."<br><br>Well, that's more than any red-blooded American boy can take. He ran off that porch and into the street, punched the butcher boy in the face, and knocked him down. But the butcher boy soon got up and shoved this boy in his clean Sunday clothes into a mud puddle, then he ran down the street laughing. The boy got up and tried to brush the mud and water off of him, and, crying, he ran toward the house. As he reached the porch, he heard the ice cream man coming down the street ringing his bell and calling out, "Ice cream cones, five cents." He forgot all about his disobedience to his mother and his dirty clothes. He ran through the door and said, "Mother, give me a nickel so I can buy an ice cream cone."<br><br>His mother scrutinized him from head to foot and said, "Look at yourself. You're in no fit condition to ask for anything."<br><br>John Milton, as a youth of twelve years, had a heart wish that he might write a heroic poem, a poem that would live and influence mankind. He knew that anyone who would write a heroic poem must live a heroic life, so he chose Jesus as his hero, and all his days he tried to exemplify in his daily contacts the ideals of a noble character. Out of his experience came the immortal poem Paradise Lost. In his last moments, as he moved into the valley of the shadow of death, he whispered, "Still guides the heavenly vision." To follow in the footsteps of Jesus, my young friends, we too may be sustained, as Alma declared that "whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be sustained in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day" (Alma 36:3).<br><h2><b>Social Development</b></h2><br>And Jesus grew in favor with man. Note this, my young friends who like the extracurricular activities at BYU which you missionaries cannot indulge in for two years. Jesus was a social man. He was no killjoy. That the wedding festivities might not be saddened or hampered, he performed his first miracle, changing water to wine. He was the most popular dinner guest in Jerusalem and Capernaum. The criticism which proper people made was that he spent too much time with the publicans and sinners and enjoyed society too much. They referred to him as a "man gluttonous, and a winebibber" (Matthew 11:19). He loved people. As Peter declared after Pentecost, he "went about doing good." People responded. Thousands followed him in his triumphant entry into Jerusalem, singing and throwing palm branches. He cheered and comforted: "Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full" (John 16:24). "Be of good cheer" (John 16:33). These are the words by which he wished to be remembered. He gathered around him a circle of friends. During the last supper he said to them, "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you" (John 15:14). And he enjoined: "This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you" (John 15:12).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith made this statement, and I love to quote it:<br><br><i>Friendship is one of the grand fundamental principles of "Mormonism";</i>[it is designed]<i>to revolutionize and civilize the world, and cause wars and contentions to cease and men to become friends and brothers. . . . It is a time-honored adage that love begets love. Let us pour forth love--show forth our kindness unto all mankind . . . cast our bread upon the waters and we shall receive it after many days, increased to an hundredfold. Friendship is like Brother Turley in his blacksmith shop welding iron to iron; it unites the human family with its happy influence.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 316]<br><h2><b>Walking in the Steps of Jesus</b></h2><br>Walking in the steps of Jesus will give us peace amidst turmoil, courage to face all perplexities, and assurance we'll meet him later and behold his face. One of the most sublime passages in scriptures is in Doctrine and Covenants 93:1:<br><br><i>Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am.</i><br><br>Now, my young friends and some of you who may not be so young, we shall see him as Elder Melvin J. Ballard in vision saw him, "the most glorious Being my eyes ever have beheld or that I ever conceived existed in all the eternal worlds." (Bryant S. Hinckley,<i>Faith of Our Pioneer Fathers</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1956], p. 266‚Äì27).<br><br>I hope that our greatest expectation is the one expressed by President Harold B. Lee when he said, "My greatest expectation is that one day I may be in the presence of my Savior eternally."<br><br>As we walk in his steps and keep his commandments, we shall have that joyous privilege, for which I humbly pray in his sacred and hallowed name. Amen.<br><br><i>Ivan J. Barrett was a branch president in the Missionary Training Cener of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 2 August 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬©Brigham Young University.

<h1> and Bring In Those People:&quot; Our Brother‚Äôs Keeper - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The Prophet Joseph Smith went through many great trials in his life. One time, you may recall that, when he was in Kirtland, Brother Behunin came to him and said, "Brother Joseph, many of the brethren have left the Church, and not only have they left the Church, but they have turned against the Church and become some of our most bitter persecutors. I will never leave the Church, but if I do, I will move out in the country and buy a little farm somewhere, and I promise you that I will never turn against the Church."<br><br>Joseph said something that was very prophetic. He said, "Brother Behunin, you do not know what you will do. When you join the Church of Jesus Christ, you leave neutral ground forever behind."<br><br>Elder Packer said this in just a little different way. He said, "They leave the Church, but they can't leave it alone." I have thought about Joseph Smith and some of the great trials of the pioneers. One of the things that comes to mind is the time when George Q. Cannon, a convert, came up that Mississippi River and docked in Nauvoo. He was standing on the river boat looking down on the dock, and he said there were about 200 men waiting for the people who were on the boat to disembark. He said, "If there had been a thousand men, I would have known which one was the Prophet Joseph." And then later on, there were others who came in great numbers to Nauvoo. At one time, Joseph Smith, feeling that he ought to make sure they came for the right reason, put on his oldest tattered clothing, mounted his horse, and rode down to meet the<i>Maid of Iowa</i>as it came up the Mississippi with many immigrants from England. As they disembarked, he took aside one of the first ones and asked, "Why are you here?"<br><br>And the good brother said, "Well, because I have joined the Mormon Church, and I wanted to come and be in Zion with the Saints."<br><br>Joseph Smith said to him, "What do you know about Joseph Smith?"<br><br>Very humbly this man said, "I know he is a prophet of God."<br><br>Joseph said, "What if I told you I was Joseph Smith?"<br><br>As the man looked at him in his tattered clothing, he said, "Then, sir, I know that you are a prophet of God."<br><br>It is interesting to look back on the life of the Prophet Joseph, and that leads into the things I would like to discuss this morning.<br><h2><b>Drama of the Pioneers</b></h2><br>Possibly no greater story can be told than the unfolding of the drama of the pioneers. Converts by the thousands seemed to be relentlessly pulled toward the great Salt Lake Valley (Zion as they supposed). The poor, the abandoned, the rich (leaving all worldly goods behind), the educated, and those with limited schooling all came forth. Their unwavering faith in Christ and their commitment to his cause led them on. I should like to share with you some of the experiences that I have studied that have humbled me to the earth. Those brave souls left us a legacy and a rich heritage. No amount of money could purchase what they freely gave. It cost life and limb. It cost great suffering and the most severe kind of heartache imaginable. Theirs was the noblest gift--that of love. The Savior said,<br><br><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</i>[John 15:13]<br><h2><b>Rebecca Winters</b></h2><br>There have been great stories of the pioneers who crossed the great plains and the Rocky Mountain passes to reach the Salt Lake Valley. On the fifteenth of August 1852 ten wagons under the leadership of Hiram Winters separated themselves from the main body of the eighteenth pioneer company, which was under the direction of Captain C. Snow. Rebecca Winters, the wife of Hiram, was dying of cholera. Her passing took place about noon. Sister Winters was one of more than 6,000 who were buried alongside the old Mormon Trail. Her husband and those in the other wagons laid her to rest in a deep grave. That evening and into the night, a friend of the family, William Reynolds, using a chisel, inscribed on the outside surface of an iron tire, "Rebecca Winters, aged 50 years." This wheel rim was placed over the grave with her husband's remark that later proved prophetic, "That name will remain there forever." The following morning the pioneers pushed on, and the location of the grave seemed to be lost or forgotten to her family in Utah.<br><br>Later travelers and finally settlers in the area did not forget, and when the cowboys found her marker, they gave her name to a nearby stream and a spring and later to a precinct in Scotts Bluff County and finally to a street in the city of Scottsbluff. In 1900, when the Chicago and Burlington Railroad was being surveyed up the north side of the Platte, their survey crew rediscovered the marker right in the center of the planned grade. Not wishing to disturb the grave, they backed up several miles and moved the line over a few feet so that the grave would be beside the tracks. The chief surveyor also sent a notice of his discovery to the<i>Deseret News</i>, and when an article was written about it, the grave came to the attention of Rebecca's descendants. One was Augusta Winters Grant, the wife of Heber J. Grant who served as the president of the Church for 27 years.<br><br>They provided that a "temple" granite marker (made of granite from the temple) be placed over her grave in 1902. Sometime after that, the Burlington Railroad had a small wrought iron fence placed around the burial plot. And then the section foreman, E. F. Despain, had a well dug to water the shrubs and lawn and the flowers that adorned the grave.<br><br>Rebecca Winters's grave still stands as a pillar in honor of all those noble and brave pioneers who died and were buried in unmarked and lost graves. And thus her monument, as Hiram Winters stated, "will remain there forever."<br><h2><b>The Last Wagon</b></h2><br>Around the time of the centennial, President J. Reuben Clark, who was in the First Presidency, gave one of the greatest pioneer talks ever delivered, I suppose, in the history of the Church. He entitled it<i>To Them of the Last Wagon</i>. Let me give you a small quote from that. He said:<br><br><i>But back in the last wagon, not always could they see the brethren way out in front and the blue heaven was often shut out from their sight by heavy, dense clouds of the dust of the earth. Yet day after day, they of the last wagon pressed forward, worn and tired, footsore, sometimes almost disheartened, born up by their faith that God loved them, that the Restored Gospel was true, and that the Lord led and directed the brethren out in front.</i>[(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1947), p. 13]<br><br>Now here is a great principle. I believe that as we consider some of these other journeyings, we find that there is a faith, a purging, and a need to feel close to the Brethren and not compromise the standards.<br><br>Only God knows the sufferings of every soul who crossed or attempted to cross the plains. Surely these magnificent and faithful souls have stories to tell that would melt the hardest heart. Women nursing newborn babies at their breasts, children walking until their poor little feet would blister and bleed, fathers and mothers working together in a state of exhaustion, but always, always pushing onward.<br><h2><b>The Handcart Companies</b></h2><br>Perhaps the most touching of all stories are the various accounts of the handcart companies. As you know, the Emigrating Fund was organized to assist Saints to come to Zion. The financial strain on the emigrating company in 1855 (only eight years after the first Saints arrived in the valley) was almost impossible. President Brigham Young wrote a letter to Franklin D. Richards, who at that time was president of the British Isles mission, and said something like this:<br><br><i>I have been thinking how we should operate another year. We cannot afford to purchase wagons and teams as in times past, I am consequently thrown back upon my old plan--to make hand-carts and let the emigration foot it, and draw upon them the necessary supplies, having a cow or two for every ten. They can come just as quick if not quicker, and much cheaper--can start earlier and escape the prevailing sickness which annually lays so many of our brethren in the dust. A great majority of them walk now even with the teams which are provided, and have a great deal more care and perplexity than they would have if they came without them. They will only need 90 days' rations from the time of their leaving the Missouri River, and as the settlements extend up the Platte, not that much. The carts can be made without a particle of iron, with wheels hooped, made strong and light, and one, or if the family be large, two of them will bring all that they will need upon the plains.</i><br><br><i>If it is once tried you will find that it will become the favorite mode of crossing the plains; they will have nothing to do but come along, and I should not be surprised if a company of this kind should make the trip in sixty or seventy days. I do know that they can beat any ox train crossing the plains. I want to see it fairly tried and tested, at all events, and I think we might as well begin another year as any time and save this enormous expense of purchasing wagons and teams--indeed we will be obliged to pursue this course or suspend operations, for aught that I can see at the present.</i>[Gustive O. Larson,<i>Mormon Handcart Story,</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1956), pp. 7‚Äì8]<br><br>In 1856, the first handcart companies were organized and commenced the journey. The handcarts were made out of Iowa hickory and oak. The wood was properly selected and seasoned. The box was constructed of Iowa hickory or oak and the shafts also. The axles were uniformly hickory. The length of the side pieces and shafts was about 6 or 7 feet with three or four binding crossbars from the back part to the forepart of the body of the cart, and the lead space for a man to pull the cart was 2 or 3 feet. When necessary, the wife or the children or all of them would push. The handcarts could be loaded with 400 to 500 pounds of flour, bedding, extra clothing, cooking utensils, and a tent. Each individual was allowed seventeen pounds of clothing, and that meant clothing and bedding. Then they were allowed one pound of flour per person per day. And so if there were four in the family, they would have four pounds of flour times ninety days for the trip. That would be about 360 pounds of flour that they would put on the cart plus their 68 pounds of clothing (seventeen times the four members of the family), plus their cooking utensils and the tent and maybe a very special prized possession, what they would call an heirloom, something that they wanted to bring along, something they felt was worth bringing. (One woman had been given 18 ounces of soap and felt it was one of the most prized possessions she had at that day.) And so the total weight would be nearly 500 pounds.<br><br>The first three handcart companies left in June. The first one left on 9 June, the second one two days later, and the third one on 23 June. The first company arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on 26 September; and the second one had caught up, so they also arrived 26 September. The third arrived on 2 October. The first company suffered one death, the second company suffered seven deaths, and in the third company there were none who died on the way. This was no greater and oftentimes less than the regular covered wagon trains' mortality rates.<br><br>When the first two companies arrived, all three of the First Presidency, President Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Daniel H. Wells, went up to the mouth of Emigration Canyon to welcome these marvelous, wonderful Latter-day Saints. I want to share with you some of the feelings that an eye-witness wrote:<br><br><i>As they came down the bench you could scarcely see them for the dust.</i>[I want to have you think about that.]<i>When they entered the City the folks came running from every quarter to get a glimpse of the long looked-for hand-carts. ... I shall never forget the feeling that ran through my whole system as I caught the first sight of them. The first hand-cart was drawn by a man and his wife. They had a little flag on it ...</i>[And may I say it may be time to raise this flag. There does come a time to raise a "title of liberty" flag, and this was that kind of flag. They had made that great journey of ninety days, pushing and pulling; I don't believe we can comprehend what they went through. And here was their little flag]<i>They had a little flag on it, on which were the words, "Our president, may the unity of the Saints ever show the wisdom of his counsels."</i>[May we have that same faith in President Kimball. There may be nothing more important that I'll say today than just quoting the faith of those people as they inscribed it on a little flag.]<br><br><i>The next hand-cart was drawn by three young women. ... The tears ran down the cheeks of many a man who you would have thought would not, could not, shed a tear.</i>[Larson,<i>Handcart,</i>p. 16]<br><br>The next two companies that followed after the first three were told, "You will go forward at your own risk." It was late in the season. The immigrants had just crossed the Missouri River and paused to recondition their handcarts at Florence, Nebraska. They were wholly ignorant of the country ahead, the rigors of camp life, the impending winter, and the Rocky Mountains. So anxious were they to reach Zion that they chose to commence the journey. The James G. Willie Company left Iowa city on 15 July 1856, with about 500 in the company. Thirteen days later the Edward Martin Handcart Company followed.<br><br>During July and August they made fairly good distances. But the handcarts were not well constructed, and they began to fall apart. There was much time lost in repairing them, but they did make fairly good time. Then fall came early, and the chill of winter brought frosty nights. The consciousness of threatening storms, decreased rations, and insufficient bedding and clothing dampened their spirits.<br><br>Day after day they pulled painfully forward. "We traveled on in misery and sorrow," wrote John Chislett of the Willie Company. "Sometimes we made a pretty good distance and other times we were only able to make a few miles of progress" (Larson,<i>Handcart,</i>p. 22).<br><br>Instead of getting up refreshed, vigorous, and prepared for a hard day of toil, the poor Saints were to be seen crawling out from their tents haggard, benumbed, and showing an utter lack of the vitality which was so necessary. When the first snowstorm came, scarcity of food, lassitude, and fatigue from overexertion soon produced their effects. Brother Willie described the situation, and I quote:<br><br><i>Our old and infirm people began to droop, and they no sooner lost spirit and courage than death's stamp could be traced upon their features. Life went out as smoothly as a lamp ceases to burn when the oil is gone. At first the deaths occurred slowly and irregularly, but in a few days at more frequent intervals, until we soon thought it unusual to leave a campground without burying one or more persons.</i><br><br><i>Death was not long confined in its ravages to the old and infirm, but the young and naturally strong were among its victims. ... Many a father pulled his cart, with his little children on it, until the day preceding his death. I have seen some pull their carts in the morning, give out during the day, and die before next morning....</i><br><br><i>Each death weakened our forces. In my hundred I could not raise enough men to pitch a tent when we camped, and now it was that I had to exert myself to the utmost. I wonder I did not die, as many did who were stronger than I was. When we pitched our camp in the evening of each day, I had to lift the sick from the wagon and carry them to the fire, and in the morning carry them again on my back to the wagon. When any in my hundred died I had to inter them; often helping to dig the grave myself. In performing these sad offices I always offered up a heartfelt prayer to that God who beheld our sufferings, and begged him to avert destruction from us and send us help.</i>[LeRoy R. Hafen and Ann W. Hafen,<i>Handcarts to Zion,</i>(Glendale, CA: Arthur H. Clark, 1960), pp. 102‚Äì3]<br><br>They traveled on. The snowstorms came, and the shrill wind blew furiously about them. The snow was several inches deep, but they had to travel an additional sixteen miles to get wood for fire and water to drink. It was that way for the Willie Company, and the Martin Company was still two weeks further behind. The Willie Company recorded the snow over a foot deep after a storm. Five persons lay in the cold embrace of death. They camped and waited for aid to come.<br><br>Mrs. Jackson, in the Martin Company, recorded:<br><br><i>My sister became sick. So severe was her affliction that she became deranged in her mind, and for several days she ate nothing but hard frozen snow.</i>[Hafen,<i>Handcarts,</i>p. 112]<br><br>Perhaps this good woman knew that the rations wouldn't last, and maybe this was her way of diverting her rations to someone else. She passed away soon. Continuing to quote from Mrs. Jackson:<br><br><i>A few days after the death of my husband the male members of the company had become reduced in number by death and those who remained were so weak and emaciated by sickness, that on reaching the camping place at night, there were not sufficient men with strength enough to raise the poles and pitch the tents. The result was that we camped out with nothing but the vault of Heaven for a roof and the stars for companions. The snow lay several inches deep upon the ground. The night was bitterly cold. I sat down on a rock with one child in my lap and one on each side of me. In that condition I remained until morning.</i>[Hafen,<i>Handcarts</i>, p. 112]<br><br><i>Deaths continued in the camp. Some died ... lying side by side with hands entwined. In other cases, they were found as if they had just offered a fervent prayer and their spirit had taken flight while in the act. ... Some died sitting by the fire; some were singing hymns or eating crusts of bread.</i><br><br><i>... Captain Martin [of the last handcart company] stood over the grave of the departed ones with shotgun in hand, firing at intervals to keep the crows and buzzards away from hovering around in mid air [until they could bury them].</i><br><br><i>Sister Sirman, whose husband was near death and whose two sons were suffering from frozen feet, appealed to Captain Martin, "Do you think that the relief party will come soon with food, clothing and shoes?"</i><br><br><i>... The Captain's answer was, "I almost wish God would close my eyes to the enormity of the sickness, hunger and death among the Saints. Yes, Sister Sirman, I am as confident as that I live that the President [Brigham Young] will and has dispatched [relief wagons].</i>[Hafen,<i>Handcarts,</i>p. 113]<br><h2><b>Get Them Here</b></h2><br>On 5 October 1856 at general conference, the commanding figure of Brigham Young, 55-year-old prophet of God, stood at the pulpit in the Tabernacle. Said he--and I'd like to have you think about our day, about the General Authorities who have their talks prepared--to the congregation:<br><br><i>I will now give this people the subject and the text for the Elders who may speak to-day and during the Conference, it is this, on the 5th day of October, 1856, many of our brethren and sisters are on the Plains with hand-carts, and probably many are now seven hundred miles from this place, and they must be brought here, we must send assistance to them. The text will be--to get them here! I want the brethren who may speak to understand that their text is the people on the Plains, and the subject matter for this community is to send for them and bring them in before the winter sets in.</i><br><br><i>That is my religion; that is the dictation of the Holy Ghost that I possess, it is to save the people. ... This is the salvation I am now seeking for, to save our brethren that would be apt to perish, or suffer extremely, if we do not send them assistance.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:113]<br><br>He then called on the bishops for sixty good mule teams, twelve or fifteen wagons, forty teamsters, twelve tons of flour, and other supplies; then he said:<br><br><i>I will tell you all that your faith, religion, and profession of religion, will never save one soul of you in the celestial kingdom of our God, unless you carry out just such principles as I am now teaching you.</i>[And then I believe he must have said this with all the fervor of a prophet:]<i>GO AND BRING IN THOSE PEOPLE NOW ON THE PLAINS.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:113]<br><br>At that time, Samuel and Margaret Pucell, husband and wife, were out on the plains with their two daughters: Maggie, 14, and Ellen, 10. Listen to their circumstances:<br><br><i>Margaret became ill, so had to ride in the handcart part of the way.</i>[So Brother Pucell was then pulling not only the 500 pounds but also his wife who was on top of the handcart.]<i>Her husband grew so weary and weakened from the lack of food that this additional burden caused him to slip and fall one day as he crossed the river. Having to travel in the cold, wintry weather with wet clothing he, too, became ill and died from hunger and exposure. His wife died five days later, leaving ten-year-old Ellen and fourteen-year-old Maggie orphans. ... Many died and many others suffered from frozen limbs, among them the Pucell girls, both having badly frozen feet and legs. ... When shoes and stockings were removed from the girls' feet, the skin came off. Although Maggie's legs were frozen, she would not allow them to do more than scrape the flesh off the bones, but Ellen's were so bad they had to be amputated just below the knees.</i>[Hafen,<i>Handcarts,</i>p. 138]<br><br>On 30 November, a Sunday (now think about the weather and the time and season and how cold it is--oftentimes we're skiing after Thanksgiving), the Saints were assembled in the Tabernacle again with President Brigham Young presiding. Having been apprised of the imminent arrival of the immigrants, the Martin Handcart Company, he spoke to the congregation:<br><br><i>When those persons arrive I do not want to see them put into houses by themselves; I want to have them distributed in the city among the families that have good and comfortable houses; and I wish all the sisters now before me, and all who know how and can, to nurse and wait upon the new comers and prudently administer medicine and food to them. To speak upon these things is a part of my religion, for it pertains to taking care of the Saints....</i><br><br><i>As soon as this meeting is dismissed I want the brethren and sisters to repair to their homes, where their Bishops will call on them to take in some of this company; the Bishops will distribute them as the people can receive them....</i><br><br><i>The afternoon meeting will be omitted, for I wish the sisters to go home and prepare to give those who have just arrived a mouthful of something to eat, and to wash them and nurse them up. You know that I would give more for a dish of pudding and milk, or a baked potato and salt, were I in the situation of those persons who have just come in, than I would for all your prayers, though you were to stay here all the afternoon and pray. Prayer is good, but when baked potatoes and pudding and milk are needed, prayer will not supply their place on this occasion; give every duty its proper time and place....</i><br><br><i>Some you will find with their feet frozen to their ankles; some are frozen to their knees and some have their hands frosted. ... We want you to receive them as your own children, and to have the same feeling for them.</i>[Hafen,<i>Handcarts,</i>p. 139]<br><br>Then in a way of the prophets, this great man, Brigham Young, told the bishops to send all of the immigrants for whom accommodations were lacking to his home. I believe that's exactly what President Kimball would do today if he were in a similar circumstance.<br><br>There were 66 deaths in the Willie Company and 135 deaths in the Martin Company.<br><h2><b>"The Cart Began Pushing Me"</b></h2><br>President David O. McKay, in an address given at an annual Relief Society Conference in 1947, the centennial year of the Saints' arrival in the valley, talked of the criticism given by a teacher conducting a class, who commented that it was very unwise to have even permitted the Saints to cross the plains under such circumstances, and they were talking about the Willie and Martin handcart companies who left later than they should have. President McKay said:<br><br><i>Some sharp criticism of the Church and its leaders was being indulged in for permitting any company of converts to venture across the plains with no more supplies or protection than a handcart caravan afforded.</i><br><br><i>An old man in the corner</i>[and this was written by President William Palmer, who was present]<i>sat silent and listened as long as he could stand it, then he arose and said things that no person who heard him will ever forget. His face was white with emotion, yet he spoke calmly, deliberately, but with great earnestness and sincerity.</i><br><br><i>In substance the father above mentioned said, "I ask you to stop this criticism. You are discussing a matter you know nothing about. Cold historic facts mean nothing here, for they give no proper interpretation of the questions involved. Mistake to send the Handcart Company out so late in the season? Yes. But I was in that company and my wife was in it and Sister Nellie Unthank whom you have cited was there, too. We suffered beyond anything you can imagine and many died of exposure and starvation, but did you ever hear a survivor of that company utter a word of criticism?</i><em>Not one of that company ever apostatized or left the Church, because everyone of us came through with the absolute knowledge that God lives for we became acquainted with him in our extremities.</em><br><br><i>"I have pulled my handcart when I was so weak and weary from illness and lack of food that I could hardly put one foot ahead of the other. I have looked ahead and seen a patch of sand or a hill slope and I have said, I can go only that far and there I must give up, for I cannot pull the load through it." [And a wife with a baby in her arms by his side!] "I have gone on to that sand and when I reached it, the cart began pushing me. I have looked back many times to see who was pushing my cart, but my eyes saw no one. I knew then that the angels of God were there.</i><br><br><i>"Was I sorry that I chose to come by handcart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay, and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Handcart Company."</i>["Pioneer Women,"<i>Relief Society Magazine,</i>January 1948, p. 8]<br><h2><b>Chief Joseph and His People</b></h2><br>Nor was the cross any easier to bear for our beloved Lamanites. Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Indian tribe was told by his father as a young man:<br><br><i>When I am gone, think of your country. You are the chief of these people. They look to you to guide them. Always remember that your father never sold his country. You must stop your ears whenever you are asked to sign a treaty selling your home. A few years more, and the white men will be all around you. They have their eyes on this land. My son, never forget my dying words. This country holds your father's body. Never sell the bones of your father and your mother.</i>[Alvin M. Josephy, Jr.,<i>Chief Joseph's People and Their War</i>, Yellowstone Library and Museum Association, 1964, p. 2]<br><br>Chief Joseph kept his commitment to his father. He would not sign the treaties that other chiefs signed consigning their people to reservations. Finally, a commission of five men was sent to speak with Chief Joseph and to make a final settlement.<br><br>Why, they asked him, did he refuse to give up the Wallowa? He answered by referring to the land as the Mother of the Indians, something that could not be sold or given away. "We love the land," he said, "It is our home."<br><br>But, they persisted, Lawyer had signed it away in 1863.<br><br><i>Joseph had a ready reply that embarrassed them. "I believe the old treaty has never been correctly reported," he said. "If we ever owned the land we own it still, for we never sold it. In the treaty councils the commissioners have claimed that our country has been sold to the government. Suppose a white man should come to me and say, 'Joseph, I like your horses, and I want to buy them.' Then he goes to my neighbor, and says to him, 'Joseph has some good horses. I want to buy them but he refuses to sell.' My neighbor answers, 'Pay me the money, and I will sell you Joseph's horses.' The white man returns to me and says, 'Joseph, I have bought your horses and you must let me have them.' If we sold our lands to the government, this is the way they were bought."</i>[Josephy,<i>Chief Joseph's People,</i>pp. 3‚Äì4]<br><br>It was determined later that Chief Joseph and his people would be placed on the reservation by force. General Howard was assigned to the task. The Nez Perce made one of the greatest retreats and attack strategies in all of open war. And mind you, they had every squaw and child and infant in addition to the warriors, and they retreated. They went into the Salmon River country, crossing and recrossing the river. (I don't know if you have floated the middle fork of the Salmon or the main Salmon, but that would not be an easy task.) Oftentimes General Howard's soldiers could not get across and were delayed, but somehow the Indians crossed. They battled the army of men and won at every turn. They made a march and forced journey from Oregon into Washington, over into Idaho and the Salmon River country, all the way across the 1,300 miles to Wyoming, and then into Montana. Finally, they camped near the Bear Paw Mountains, some 17 miles from the Canadian border where they felt that after they'd crossed the border, they would be safe. Troops were sent. A siege took place that lasted several days. Finally, Joseph mounted his horse and, followed by several men, rode up the hill from the camp and across to the army lines where Generals Howard and Miles waited for him. He dismounted, handed Miles his rifle, adjusted his blanket to leave his right arm free, and, addressing Miles, began one of the most touching and beautiful surrenders ever made:<br><br><i>Tell General Howard I know his heart. What he told me before I have in my heart. I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. Toohoolhoolzote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is the young men who say yes or no. He who led the young men is dead. It is cold and we have no blankets. The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food; no one knows where they are--perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children and see how many I can find. Maybe I shall find them among the dead. Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired; my heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.</i>[Josephy,<i>Chief Joseph's People</i>p. 19]<br><h2><b>Your Brother's Keeper</b></h2><br>Now, the application of these things to our generation: Winston Churchill said, "We have not made this journey across centuries, across oceans, across mountains, across prairies because we are made of sugar candy" (<i>Reader's Digest Treasury of Modern Quotations</i>[Pleasantville, NY: Reader's Digest Press: 1975], p. 719). James Bond Stockdale, vice admiral retired, spent eight years as a prisoner of war in Viet Nam prisons. His philosophy and the principles he learned may help make all I have said today relevant. Said he, "Pressurized experiences have a way of giving us an overload of dilemmas that can't wait for a waffled solution" (<i>Vital Speeches of the Day,</i>vol. 57, no. 18, 1 July 1981, p. 546). He also says, "A sort of transformation takes place under pressure" (p. 546). And, "Prisons have been crucibles of both degradation and creative impulse throughout history" (p. 547), and were they not indeed for Joseph Smith?<br><br><i>From this eight-year experience I distilled one all-purpose idea, plus a few corollaries.</i>[And mind you, he was in Viet Nam in a prison for eight years without seeing one other living soul. Robby Reisner said that he remembered the little corner where they had a hole that they would use for their urinal. He put his head down through that and saw one blade of grass, and, knowing that something was living, he kept contact with reality that way. They went year after year without seeing anyone. And James Stockdale came up with one idea.]<i>It is a simple idea, an idea as old as the scriptures, an idea that is the epitome of high mindedness, an idea that naturally and spontaneously comes to men under pressure. If the pressure is intense enough or of long enough duration, this idea spreads without the need even for its enunciation. It just takes root naturally. It is an idea that in this big easy world of yackety-yack seems to violate the rules of game theory if not of reason. It violates the ideas of Adam Smith's invisible hand, our ideas of human nature, and probably the second law of thermodynamics. That idea is: "You Are Your Brother's Keeper."</i>[pp. 547‚Äì58]<br><br>Eight years in a prison camp, and Admiral Stockdale tells us that an idea that is the epitome of high mindedness is, "You Are Your Brother's Keeper." When he is asked, "What kept you going? What was your highest value?" he answers, "The man next door." Eight years, and he said that patriotism didn't bring him through, as much as he loved the country. They punished him too greatly and severely. But he said that knowing there were other prisoners, that he was his brothers' keeper and, for their sake, had to continue on, kept him going.<br><br>We have read and been moved by the Prophet Joseph's experiences in Liberty Jail. Joseph understood this same principle: "If my life is of no use to my friends it is of none to myself" (<i>HC</i>6:549). Willard Richards stated, "Joseph, if you are condemned to be hung for treason, I will be hung in your stead, and you shall go free" (<i>HC</i>6:616). Brigham said, "Go and bring in those people now on the plains."<br><br>We, all of us, are our brothers' keepers. When we are endowed with charity and love from on high, then the eternal welfare of our neighbor, our brother, our son, our daughter becomes more important than life itself. Ours is a generation of "hunters and fishers of men." We cannot, we must not, isolate ourselves from the world. We must go among them and declare "glad tidings" from Zion. We must give them hope. We must go out on the plains after each of them; we must respond because we have seen "something in his eye that won my love; I knew not why." And when our scanty meal is spread, we must be there to give him our crust, to let him drink and quench his thirst with the water in the stream. We must, in a very real sense, welcome the stranger and lay him on our couch to rest. And we must be there to rouse his pulse, bring back his breath, revive his spirit, and then the time may come when we must decide whether we are willing to give our lives for the Martin cause. When we do, the sweet words that will and have come to those great pioneers are, "Fear not, Joseph, Brigham, the Martin Handcart Company, the Willie Handcart Company, Rebecca Winters, and all others, thou didst all these things unto me" (Adapted from "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief,"<i>Hymns,</i>no. 153).<br><br>Now, I suppose the things that I prize most dearly in my life are those that relate to the prophets and the leaders of this kingdom. I love them with all my heart and soul. I believe that I may qualify, as George Q. Cannon said, "There will come a generation who will follow the prophets out of sheer obedience's sake."<br><br>I believe I qualify. I don't question when they speak; I simply honor them and love them and follow them to the grave if necessary. Of course, Christ is the supreme example of all that I hold precious and dear. I love him, I love you, and I love his prophet; and I commit my soul to his work and to the work of being my brother's keeper. I would rather have my children come across the plains and suffer and even die with a testimony, being faithful, never leaving the Church, having the angels walk with them and push the handcarts, than to have all the comforts of life and lose their faith. That is my testimony. I love the Lord, and I intend to follow the prophet and obey his counsel in unity with the other Brethren, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Vaughn J. Featherstone was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 August 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>at Our Children May Know&quot;: Generational Testimony - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I thought perhaps we'd have four or five people here this morning and we could have a friendly little fireside chat. I would still very much like to do that in spirit, but obviously our numbers will not allow us to get very chummy. We are delighted to have you here, and I say<i>we</i>meaning not only the whole university family, but I specifically include my wife Pat, who is here with me. I'd like her to stand and be acknowledged if she would. You'll feel a lot better about me having met her.<br><br>I have to tell you a bit about how this assignment came to me (as I hear the Continuing Education people behind me begin to squirm). Anyone in his right mind, who knew that I had commencement exercises last week, with all the presidential duties that that requires, and our preschool faculty meetings and university conference next week, with all the presidential duties that that requires, and then school starting the week following, with a major address to the student body, might wonder why I would volunteer for the devotional at Campus Education Week. Well that's what I wondered when I opened the booklet a couple of days ago and read my name printed here just inside the cover, where you've probably seen it. I think we saw it at the same time. I contacted my beloved associates in Continuing Education and said, "I am flattered and thrilled to speak to this group"--(and in fact I am. There's not a group I would rather address. But I said) "At about what point in the week was I going to be notified about this assignment?"<br><br>Then there was, "Well, didn't you--. Surely you--Well, uh ...." It turns out that they had certainly agreed that I was going to speak, but the pony express ran into an ambush just outside my office.<br><h2><b>Henry Ford II</b></h2><br>With that in mind, no story seems quite so appropriate as one told about Henry Ford II. While he was still head of Ford Motor Company a number of years ago, he was approached by a little band of sisters running a convent who, after laboring for years to get a school started, wanted to provide a hospital somewhere in upstate Michigan. It was not to be a big hospital--in fact, it was not a very big community. But that was the very point--it had not had adequate medical facilities, and they wanted to do what they could. They needed several thousand dollars. They summoned all the courage they had and made a journey downstate to Mr. Ford. There in his office they approached him for a gift toward their little hospital.<br><br>Well, I'm sure Mr. Ford and others like him are used to that kind of thing, and he said, "I'll be glad to help. I do a lot of this around the country and can't do a great deal for any one group, but I'll be glad to help. I'm touched by your sincerity," and he wrote out a check for $10,000. This was many years ago, and $10,000 on a first contact was more than these sisters could imagine. They ran home to their little community absolutely delighted, shared it with the local press, which was a little hand-run operation, and the newspaper came out that weekend saying, "Henry Ford II gives $100,000 to hospital."<br><br>Well, you see the problem. These nuns were very embarrassed because they lost both ways. First of all, people thought they had $90,000 that they didn't have and I can imagine them explaining that. On the other hand, if Mr. Ford saw it and read about it, he would be embarrassed.<br><br>They did not know what to do. They worried about it and prayed about it and talked to each other about it and finally and fearfully returned to Mr. Ford, showed him the headlines, and said, "We are deeply apologetic. We will work it out. We'll just go tell the people that you didn't give $100,000." He sat in silence and then smiled and said, "That probably isn't a good thing for my image." Then he took his checkbook out of his pocket and wrote another check for $90,000 and handed it to them.<br><br>They were stunned. They were emotional and very, very grateful and said, "What can we do? What can we do to thank you?" And he said, "Really nothing, but you'll probably have some dedicatory space in this hospital somewhere. I don't want any personal publicity; I would not like my name associated with it. But somewhere in that hospital on a brick or a small plaque, just record Matthew 25:35,--no message, just the numerals and the citation."<br><br>They were a little embarrassed, religious women that they were, that they couldn't quite, without scriptures in hand, identify Matthew 25:35. As they got home, (as you are now doing) they opened the covers of their scriptures and read simply, "I was a stranger and ye took me in."<br><br>That's a longer story than you needed, but it will help explain the state I'm in this morning as I speak to you from some notes, knowing full well that the television camera is absolutely unforgiving, not only today but forever and ever and ever. For all of that, I thank you for coming, and I thank our Continuing Education people for inviting me to give these remarks about which I have strong feelings.<br><h2><b>Conference Theme</b></h2><br>Your theme is taken from 2 Nephi 25:26, and while I am not anxious that you tear the pages out of the scriptures searching for Matthew 25, you could do worse, if you have them, than to note this passage in your Book of Mormon. I want to say a word or two about this verse, and I assume it will come up all week long one way or another.<br><br>If we were to identify general sections of scripture that are absolutely central to the mission of the Book of Mormon, I'm not sure that there are any more important pages in the book than those that start with 2 Nephi 25 and conclude with Nephi's testimony at the end of chapter 33. That's only about fifteen pages, and yet it is a strong, central statement giving significance to the purpose of the Book of Mormon: to declare that Jesus is the Christ. This is Nephi's closing testimony. It is, for all intents and purposes, the end of his life. In verse 19, in declaring who the Messiah is and for whom the Jews should look, Nephi said, "His name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God." Begin in verses 17 and 18 to see how complete the testimony is.<br><br><i>And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the children of men.</i>[These passages from this ancient book are specifically for our time. They are latter-day, dispensation-of-the-fullness-of-times messages. The context is for a marvelous work and a wonder, a gathering in a "second time."]<br><br><i>Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, ... and they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come ... and, ... his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</i><br><br>Then 21 and 22:<br><br><i>Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down ... from generation to generation....</i><br><br><i>... These things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they will go according to the will and pleasure of God.</i><br><br>And then, with that background, the passage from which our theme is taken:<br><br>"We labor diligently to write, to persuade our children," in 23.<br><br>In 26,<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i><br><br>First line of 27:<br><br><i>Wherefore, we speak concerning the law, that our children may know.</i><br><h2><b>Our Obligation</b></h2><br>In anticipation of your week's activity, my brief remarks this morning are devoted to the obligation upon us to have our children know, to fulfill the promise of the prophets and the obligation put upon us by them to establish these things and to declare them and hand them down from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand.<br><br>You've chosen to come today to a university which has as its motto a line from the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants which reads, "The glory of God is intelligence." It could go on to say, "Or in other words light and truth," and, further, to say that "light and truth forsake that evil one" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36‚Äì37). You don't have to read that very often before you begin to understand why knowledge is important, why intelligence is necessary, why light and truth are tools in forsaking the evil one.<br><br>Let me read you a passage first pointed out to me by my colleague Joe Christensen, now serving as president of the Missionary Training Center. It is from the first issue of the first volume of the first periodical published by the Church--the lead editorial of the 1832<i>Evening and Morning Star</i>:<br><br><i>The disciples should loose</i>[sic]<i>no time in preparing schools for their children, that they may be taught as is pleasing unto the Lord, and brought up in the way of holiness. Those appointed to select and prepare books for the use of schools, will attend to that subject, as soon as more weighty matters are finished. But the parents and guardians in the Church of Christ will not wait--it is all important that children, to become good should be taught so....</i><br><br><i>If it were necessary then to teach their children diligently, how much more necessary is it now, when the Church of Christ is to be an ensign, yea, even a sample</i>[sic]<i>to the world, for good. A word to the wise ought to be sufficient, for children soon enough become men and women. Yes, they are they that must follow us and perform the duties which not only appertain to this world but to the second coming of the Savior, even preparing for the Sabbath of creation and for eternity.</i><br><br>"The disciples will attend to this subject" (I suppose meaning the Brethren) "as soon as more weighty matters are finished, but the parents and the guardians in the Church of Christ must not wait--it is all important that children, to become good should be taught so."<br><br>I don't know that these folks had been reading from 2 Nephi 25, but they might have. Great obligations are upon us to continue to teach "that our children may know."<br><br>Brother Christensen said another thing which has impressed me for these many years and which I share with you this morning. It is the simple suggestion--in light of our schools and Education Week and why you're here and what it means to be a parent or a child in this Church--a simple reminder that this Church is always only one generation away from extinction. That does not change however many decades old we are now. It was true in 1840, it was true in 1891, and is true in 1981. We are always just one generation away from extinction. All we would have to do, I assume, to destroy this work is stop teaching our children for one generation. Just everybody stop, close the books, seal up your heart, keep your mouth shut, and don't bear a testimony. In one generation it would be 1820 all over again. We could hunt around and find somebody to go out and pray in a grove of trees. With the blessings of the Lord, we could get six people together to organize a church. We could hand Samuel Smith a Book of Mormon and say, "Go knock on the door and see if we can start somewhere." That could happen. It won't happen. It mustn't happen. It won't happen in 1981 or 1991, but it could if we ceased to accept the obligation upon us, always upon those who have known and believed the truth, to teach it, especially to their children. I am not minimizing other help. We think even BYU can help. But while there are other weighty matters in the kingdom for the disciples, parents and guardians must not wait.<br><h2><b>Doctrinal Importance of Generational Testimony</b></h2><br>Let me just suggest doctrinally again how important this has been from the beginning. May I quote from the second Lecture on Faith. These are the concluding lines of the second lecture, and I'd just share them with you. They deal with generational testimony.<br><br><i>We have now</i>[for 55 paragraphs of this lecture]<i>clearly set forth how it is, and how it was, that God became an object of faith for rational beings.</i>[The question has been for this entire lecture, "Why do people ever believe in God in the first place? How did it start? And that's not a bad question if you're addressing a young family with young children]<i>We have now clearly set forth how it is, and how it was, that God became an object of faith for rational beings; and also, upon what foundation the testimony was based which excited the inquiry and the diligent search of the ancient saints to seek after and obtain a knowledge of the glory of God; and we have seen</i>[please note]<i>that it was human testimony, and human testimony only, that excited this inquiry, in the first instance, in their minds. It was the credence they gave to the testimony of their fathers</i>[and, I would add, their mothers],<i>this testimony having aroused their minds to inquire after the knowledge of God; the inquiry frequently terminated, indeed always terminated when rightly pursued, in the most glorious discoveries and eternal certainty.</i>[Doctrine and Covenants, 1891]<br><br>How did it start in the first place? With human testimony. How does it start in our first place? With human testimony. How does it start in the life of your child? Nowhere more clearly, more emphatically, more importantly than with your human testimony. The will, indeed, along the way, have experiences of their own. They must. But in the beginning it was human testimony--yours and mine and the ancients'--which excited the inquiry and brought the diligent search that ends "in glorious discoveries and eternal certainty."<br><br>Well, "we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children ... to believe in Christ. ... we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, ... we prophesy" that our children may know.<br><br>We don't need to belabor what a break in that generational testimony can mean. It is apostasy. It can be personal apostasy, it can be familial apostasy, it can be dispensational apostasy--it's apostasy--some break in that generational contact.<br><br>The dispensational bond against such a break is, of course, very important in our theology. Joseph Smith said that we might well have rendered this bond as<i>welding,</i>and maybe that's a more graphic image than<i>sealing.</i>I think<i>sealing</i>has several applications, not the least of which is the royal seal by the King of kings and Lord of lords. Beyond that, there certainly is the image of being sealed together, locked, linked, bound, tied, in a way that does not let evil in, that does not allow for personal or familial or dispensational apostasy, and that keeps those generations intact for time and all eternity.<br><br>May I just read to you from the Prophet Joseph what I assume is the responsibility for the living as well as for the dead. You all know the language for the dead. You all understand our obligation to seal our families back through every generation. What I'm not sure we have understood--in those revelations about work for the dead and baptism for the dead and sealings and why temples are built--is the language from the lips of the Prophet Joseph Smith himself about what we're obligated to do for the living, indeed the living in our own households, indeed, the children at our knee who eat at our table and pray at our beside. Let me give you that language from section 128: Quoting Malachi, the Prophet Joseph Smith said (I'm in verse 17 if anybody wants to follow):<br><br><i>Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</i><br><br>Now, I think everyone understands, especially in terms of the work for the dead, the idea of turning the heart of the children to their fathers, but what is the meaning for your family in turning the heart of the fathers to the children? I think he goes on to talk about that.<br><br><i>I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind.... It is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this...</i>[not only the dispensational ties, but in our time in 1981 on this campus, in your home]<i>... not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</i><br><br>As I understand it, that latter portion of the scripture just read has nothing to do with work for the dead or sealing back through generations to Adam. No, it has to do with things that have been hidden from the wise and prudent and they are to be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fullness of times, in this, your home and mine, today.<br><br>Well, I don't know whether that helps us understand why this Church talks so much about family, but it might. Why do we talk so much about Family Home Evening and Home Teaching? Family Home Evening, Home Teaching, even Four-generation Group Sheets, certainly family and personal histories. Why does this Church take the stand it takes on things that relate to family--things like abortion and premarital chastity? Why does President Kimball want a picture of a temple on the wall of the bedroom of each of the children in our homes? Is it just a response to 1960s' pressure or 1970s' trouble? Is it really a twentieth-century phenomenon to offset movies and magazines and trouble in the schools, difficulty in the streets, problems in the community? I don't think so. At least not anything that I read suggests that it's so recent. It is, in fact, as old as the family of man.<br><br>I had a chance to suggest last spring to some of the women who gathered on this campus that Adam and Eve left the garden primarily for two reasons, and as I read it, they had a lot of other reasons to stay. They could backstroke in the lagoon every morning and pluck wild berries for lunch and avoid all these problems of growing up with all the difficulties you and I know about. I noticed the headlines on the front page of the paper this morning and just jotted them down. The front page of the paper this morning, moving clockwise around the page told of the U.S./Libyan shootout over the Mediterranean, the sentencing of John Lennon's murderer, the official indictment of President Reagan's would-be assassin, and the expulsion of Senator Harrison Williams for his "repugnant conduct in the Abscam affair." The only good news was the weather. It said it was going to be hot and muggy.<br><br>As I understand it, Adam and Eve could have avoided all of that if they stayed in the garden, but in pursuit of eternal progress they chose to leave for two reasons: family and knowledge. They would not have had children and they could not have become like the gods, knowing good from evil. And against all of those other very attractive and very accommodating and very pleasant reasons to stay in the garden, they left to have a family and gain knowledge and pass that knowledge on to their family.<br><br>Is it just coincidence that the great biblical and scriptural stories are family stories? Was it happenstance that Satan began immediately to try to rend the family, to break the generation, immediately turning Cain against Abel? Why did Abraham's own father try to take his life? I'm sure Satan knew what Abraham was going to be. We see David's tragedy and then see it compounded in his son, Absalom. Then the difficult family experiences Solomon had that finally led to the rending of the kingdom. They are all part of the generational pattern. The Book of Mormon is from beginning to end a profound statement about a family which was involved in a warring experience of good against evil in an attempt to keep that generational experience intact. Ultimately in the end it was not, but for our dispensation, we are to learn from their failures and guard against repeating them. And as near as I can tell, if we learn from them, we will take advantage of Family Home Evening, we will write personal and family histories, we will accept the challenge of having a condensed schedule on Sunday that can provide time for teaching the gospel in our homes by parents who "must not wait."<br><h2><b>Sally Bush's Example</b></h2><br>Well, I have 101 things I could say and should say about families. I read something once about what Abraham Lincoln's step-mother did for him. She felt she "must not wait."<br><br><i>She was sometimes called Sally, a widow with three children. Perhaps life had been a little harsh and she would have welcomed a change for the better, the easier, if it came. She thought she saw it come when a man, a widower from her past, returned with a proposal of marriage in his nice suit of clothes and talk of a prosperous farm. The prospects of a better life grew, and she understood him to mention servants and to be a man of substance. She accepted and crossed the river with him to view her new possessions: A farm grown up to wild blackberry vines and sumac, a floorless, windowless hut, the only servants were two thinly clad barefoot children, the father of whom had borrowed the suit and the boots that he had gone a-courting in. Her first thought was the obvious one: go back home. But she looked at the children, especially the younger, a boy whose melancholy gaze met hers. For a moment she looked while a great spirit subdued the passions of the flesh and then, rolling up her sleeves, she quietly spoke immortal words which ought to be engraven on every parent or teacher's heart: "I'll stay for the sake of this boy."</i><br><br><i>"Oh, Sally Bush, what a treasure trembled in the balance that day," wrote one whose mother was a neighbor of the boy. And Sally Bush didn't know, when she looked at that melancholy face of ten years, that her stepson would someday save this nation, heal a generational breech, and become the immortal Abraham Lincoln. She uttered what should be engraven on every parent or teacher's heart, "I'll stay for the sake of this boy."</i><br><h2><b>Suzanne Shakespeare's Example</b></h2><br>What if it isn't pleasant? What if it's more difficult than you or the children counted on? I'm not sure that Stan and Barbara Shakespeare are in the room, but I close with this from their daughter, Suzanne, age 16:<br><br><i>Of all the ugly words conceived, chemotherapy must be the very worst. How I hated to see the number four person coming, knowing that after he was finished with his part, mine would begin: Nausea so violent I couldn't keep anything on my stomach, lips so cracked and raw it was like I'd been beaten every morning, my hair began falling</i>[and to any girl nine or ninety, that's a blow to pride only we can understand].<br><br><i>How I hated to be thin and pale and have people look at me like I was going to disappear before their very eyes. My parents prayed for a miracle. I prayed that it was a bad dream and that it wasn't really happening to me. I knew prayers were answered, and I wanted mine answered right now. Five long, painful learning years (I can see now) later the miracle had happened. I was alive. I was fourteen, and life was beginning all over again. I still remember the day the doctors told me I wouldn't have any more medicine and I was free of the disease. It's true I had a limp and one leg was several times smaller than the other, but I had a beautiful head of my own hair and life. Could anything stand in my way now?</i><br><br>Well, life was wonderful. She went back to school and prepared to rejoin her friends. She began to be interested in boys and to think of driving a car, and in the midst of all of that, the hurt came again, same leg, same place, new examination, increased inflammation, pain that wouldn't go away, and now another type of cancer.<br><br><i>Ridiculous. I was cured. September 13, 1978, I lost my left leg about 4 inches above the knee and with it many of the dreams only a sixteen-year-old has. I couldn't decide whether to pray for recovery or for complete oblivion. My world had shattered and I wanted to stop right now--stop because my leg was gone. Stop because I was facing chemotherapy again. Stop because I was once again going to lose my crowning glory. What was left? The Lord blessed me with two very special parents. How hard they must have prayed for me and pleaded that I would have the strength to forge ahead and learn to accept this happening as an opportunity and challenge. I didn't want to get out of bed, but my parents made me. I didn't want to face my friend, but my parents invited them in. I didn't want to go to school. You can imagine how I felt going that first day with my pant leg flapping, but my parents left me at the door and told me I could do it, and I did. Me, Suzanne Shakespeare, who thought my friends wouldn't like me now and that I wouldn't be able to do anything. I learned something those first few days that is more precious than all my material possessions. I wasn't really different at all. I was still the same girl--the one who joined the clubs and had friends and loved to study. The only thing that had really changed was my capacity to understand and appreciate. What wonderful things to have learned. And guess what. I've had one date and I'm learning to drive and I'm going to try out for the school musical. I'm getting my new leg soon and I know there will be many hard adjustments ahead. I have had chemotherapy and I've been sick, but I'm alive, and the Lord must have something wonderful ahead just for me. And you know what? I'm going to find it. Signed Suzanne Shakespeare, age 16.</i><br><br>Epilogue: Suzanne continued having chemotherapy until January 1979. On a routine visit to the Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, a chest x-ray revealed widespread cancer cells in the lungs. There was nothing more medical science could do. Her mother is writing:<br><br><i>How do you tell a sixteen-year-old girl she is going to die? Straightforwardly, with tears, with love and determination to continue as normally as possible. That's how. Time? Maybe two months.</i><br><br><i>Soon after she returned home, Suzanne went on a family trip to Disneyland, her favorite place. She attended a four-day forensic meet in Salt Lake, she auditioned and received a part in the high school musical, she asked a young man to the sweetheart ball and danced all evening without crutches on a newly acquired artificial leg. She carried a full load at school and, despite a record winter for snow and ice, rarely missed a day. There began to be shoulder pains, shortness of breath, then loss of appetite, but Suzanne would take nothing but aspirin because pain pills might interfere with her school activities. On 15 March she began a three-week tour of the South with her grandmother. The pace of the tour and her increasing loss of strength made her extremely tired. Breathing became so difficult it was impossible for her to lie down. But still it was only aspirin and determination to see the trip through to Disneyworld. On 27 March her father flew to Miami Beach to bring her home. Her condition was critical. They arrived home early in the morning on the 28th. She had her first pain pill that afternoon and passed away in her sleep that night. On 29 March the rest of the group reached Disneyworld.</i><br><br>These are my childhood friends, Stan and Barbara. I grew up with them, and my daughter has not had cancer. But theirs has and she's gone. And how do you tell a child that life isn't entirely a Disneyworld? Will there be times in your life or theirs that they will need the substance of the gospel in a way that only you can teach it? I close with the counsel of a prophet:<br><br><i>I have spoken of reservoirs of faith,</i>[said President Kimball]<i>and who is to build these reservoirs? Is this not the reason that God gave to every child two parents? It is those parents who sired and bore them who are expected by the Lord to lay foundations for their children and to build the barns and the tanks and the bins and the reservoirs of faith?</i><br><br>I testify of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ and of the need for faithful teaching concerning it that indeed "our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins." It is in the name of that source, even Jesus Christ, that I do testify. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R. Holland was BYU president when this devotional address was given on 25 August 1981 during Campus Education Week.</i><br><br><i>¬© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<br>
I&#39;m glad to be welcome. Facing a group like this, I wouldn&#39;t want to be unwelcome. This is a marvelous sight, to see all of you here and feel your heartbeat. I like to think it&#39;s yours--perhaps it is mine that&#39;s beating so rapidly.<br><br>As I consider the position you are in as you start another school year, I have a lot of empathy for you--from both sides of the fence, so to speak. I spent thirteen years, as you have already heard, trying to get out of school and then found myself back in school right here at this institution, for which I am grateful. Brigham Young University has a great impact in the lives of a lot of people, and while you&#39;re here I hope that you&#39;ll let it make as great an impact in your life as it can.<br><br>Tonight we have with us some very special guests. Most of them are wearing blue and white. They&#39;re called missionaries. I am grateful to see them. I&#39;m especially grateful to call on you tonight; I need your prayers. You think you need to pray for your investigators--well, I need just that kind of a prayer tonight. As you go throughout the world, you will be facing a group that is somewhat like the group you see here, only you will see them one at a time. You&#39;ll see them in their doors and you&#39;ll see them on the street; and I hope that, as you leave here to go see them, you will carry with you the spirit that radiates from your training at the Missionary Training Center and the spirit that is at BYU. The world needs that, just as it needs you.<br><br>Tonight I&#39;ve prepared a message that I hope will be of use to all of you, whether you are a missionary, a student, or a nonstudent. I hope that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us in answer to the prayer that was offered, that both you and I may feel the presence and power of the Holy Ghost so that we may be edified together.<br><br>This summer has been an eventful one for me. Much of my time has been spent in assignments with the young men of the Church and with their leaders. One of these occasions was the National Jamboree for the Boy Scouts of America at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia. The highlight of that jamboree was a special meeting held on Sunday where President Ezra Taft Benson of the Quorum of the Twelve was the speaker. As he addressed those 3,000 Aaronic Priesthood young men and their leaders, he spoke to the topic "On My Honor." Several times during his address he referred to the life of George Washington and the making of this great man. He quoted the following from the foreword of a book he had read about Washington:<br><br><i>We are superbly qualified as makers of excellent machinery, fine automobiles, great spaceships. We have amassed great wealth.</i><br><br><i>Yet the times cry out for excellence of a higher order. They demand men fashioned in the likeness of George Washington. We need to know how to make men of his calibre.</i>[William H. Wilbur,<i>The Making of George Washington</i>, foreword by Kenneth D. Wells, 1973, p. ix]<br><br>This statement remained in my mind, and, upon returning to Salt Lake City, I obtained a copy of the book from which it was quoted and read it. I made a rediscovery of the truth I already knew--that great leaders do not just happen; they are made through education, experience, and a personal commitment to a high standard of excellence. Let&#39;s talk about those things.<br><h2><b>Importance of Education</b></h2><br>First, let&#39;s talk about education. That&#39;s what you&#39;re here for, and it will take various forms while you are here. The Lord has said,<br><br><i>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</i>[Proverbs 22:6]<br><br>George Washington&#39;s education during his boyhood days occurred largely under the tutorship of his father at his home in Virginia. George&#39;s father, August, received his education at Appleby Grammar School in England. He provided educational experiences for George that were quite similar to the ones which he had received under the headmaster at Appleby. George was given responsibilities of significance early in his youth. There was not much time for frivolous behavior on a Virginia farm in those days. His mother would follow up to see that assignments in penmanship, arithmetic, and so forth were carefully recorded by George in his notebooks. (Fortunately for us, the Library of Congress has been able to obtain a large number of those notebooks.) Hour after hour this boy would practice making ovals and circles and slants. They had to be done just right; his father would expect excellence from his son.<br><br>In one section of his notebook, George Washington meticulously copied rules of conduct. The Bible provided the foundation for general living, but these rules provided practical guidelines for behavior in everyday life experiences. These rules were to help George develop outstanding social graces and display the marks of a self-disciplined gentleman. August felt that George would be more likely to remember and follow these rules if he had copied them in his own hand. This part of his education must have been based on sound principles, for George Washington was known throughout his life for the strength of his personal demeanor.<br><br>Another aspect of George Washington&#39;s education included study of the lives of great men of character and dedication. Addison Cato, which glorified the deeds of the citizens of Rome as patriots of courage and sacrifice, probably helped Washington during his sufferings with his troops at Valley Forge. He admired the early Persians, who were men of virtue and who fled from that which would destroy the mind or weaken the body. Through all his education, Washington benefited from one of his rules: Accept correction with thankfulness. George&#39;s father taught him with love, patience, personal leadership, but also with strict expectation of obedience.<br><br>Assignments given were expected not only to be completed, but to be done perfectly. Well, anyone can do things halfway, or almost anyone can bring in an assignment partly finished, partly fulfilled, partly followed through. But the mark of greatness, as shown by Washington, was to expect from oneself perfection in performance. His father told George that, when one receives correction regarding assignments, it is not merely enough to obey, but it must be done with cheerfulness. Under those conditions, the attitude becomes more important than mere obedience.<br><br>Now, George didn&#39;t just have lessons. He wasn&#39;t just taught certain things to copy in a notebook. He was provided with experience, life experiences on the farm and in the community. His education was carried forward, following his father&#39;s death, by his half-brother Lawrence, who had also received his education at Appleby. Lawrence was able to follow through with the same type of instruction, the same type of philosophy, that George had received during his earlier years.<br><h2><b>Importance of Experience</b></h2><br>The Lord tells us how important experience is. From Doctrine and Covenants, section 105, verse 10, we learn that the Lord has placed us here on the earth--<br><br><i>That my people may . . . have experience, and know more perfectly</i>.<br><br>So experience is necessary if we are to understand perfectly the things that we are taught.<br><br>George was taught by experience the rudiments of military life and tactics. The discipline acquired through persistence in penmanship during earlier years had trained the muscles and developed the visual perception for excellence in drafting. His studies in mathematics aided him in acquiring greater-than-average competence as a surveyor. Lawrence helped George acquire the opportunities to put skill and learning into practice. George spent long, physically tiring days during those years. Upon the passing of his father, he moved from his home to live with his brother Lawrence. The move was due to the desire of his mother that he continue his education, even though it would mean that she would be left with more than she could effectively manage on the farm. George would commute on foot or horseback to assist his mother with the planting and the harvesting even though he had spent a full day at his studies. Some of you will appreciate that. Some of you will be working as well as studying. When you get tired, remember George on horseback or afoot. It&#39;ll help, I think.<br><br>George was also much more adept than was his mother at handling the problems with the slaves. Caring for these matters added to the physical and emotional demands which were placed upon him. The physical strength and the self-confidence that George Washington had developed under the careful supervision and education of his father and his brother provided the stamina and the ability to meet these special challenges. Until Lawrence died, he maintained his concern for George&#39;s training and experience. George was then well established in his work as a surveyor.<br><h2><b>Great Expectations</b></h2><br>We have seen in this brief glimpse of George Washington&#39;s life evidence of his personal expectation of perfection in his own performance. He was willing to be meek--that&#39;s teachable. The Greek translation of that word<i>meek</i>in the New Testament means to be<i>teachable</i>, to be willing to listen, willing to cooperate. It certainly describes the attitude of George Washington. Through his willingness to listen and to cooperate, Washington made decisions deliberately. He would not be rushed into a decision, but rather he would wait until as many facts as possible could be obtained regarding the matter under consideration. The strength of such a quality became evident several times during the war for independence. I would suggest that demanding the best from yourselves may not always keep you from making errors; it didn&#39;t keep George from making mistakes. But it will help you to do your best. George always returned to succeed in the area where his education and his experience had previously been insufficient to earn him success. When we do the best we can, we sustain our resolve rather than becoming mired down in the morass of discouragement and regret. Mary Pickford once wrote:<br><br><i>Today is a new day. You will get out of it just what you put into it. If you have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, there is always another chance for you. And supposing that you have tried and failed again and again; you may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing we call failure is not falling down, but staying down.</i><br><br>George Washington never stayed down.<br><br>President N. Eldon Tanner has long held before us a personal example of excellence. When asked how he is able to make the many decisions that his duties require, his response is reported to have been most enlightening:<br><br><i>Gather all the facts you can about the matter. Review it in light of past experience with similar situations. Ponder carefully the consequences, pray for guidance, make the best decision you can, and never look back.</i><br><br>He later explained that, if new information comes forward and a change of decision is necessary, it can be made with clear conscience. This counsel applies to you, to me, to all of us. We cannot fail as long as we are doing our best.<br><h2><b>Commitment to Excellence</b></h2><br>Like Washington, each of us should make excellence the objective of every endeavor. We are here to train our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. We are to use this life to perfect ourselves, to subjugate the flesh, to subject the body to the spirit, to overcome all weaknesses, to govern self so that we may give leadership to others. George Washington was like the Daniel he read about in the Bible. He was preferred above others of his generation because of the excellence of the spirit within him--excellence in preparation, excellence in experience and in desire to live in complete harmony with God.<br><br>Perhaps one of the greatest stories I have heard recently on the importance of this personal commitment to doing our best was an experience of a young man at the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. When this young man reported in at headquarters for a particularly difficult trail experience, he weighed only 85 pounds. The pack he was required to carry weighed 35 pounds. The men at the base camp doubted very much that he would be able to make the trek, which included over 280 miles of trail and the performance of specific training tasks at the numerous camps along the way. All of this was to be done within a two-week period. There would be seven other boys in the group who were to make this packing trip. They would be on their own; each man would have to fend for himself. The young man visited with the LDS chaplain, Rulon Doman, prior to going out on the trail from the base camp. He explained to Brother Doman that he just had to make it. He had to reach this goal for himself. He asked Brother Doman to pray for him and to pray that the Lord would give him the strength to carry his own pack. Brother Doman said that he prayed for him and with him, but he still had reservations as he looked at the boy&#39;s small stature.<br><br>The boy left the camp with the group at the specified time. Twelve days later, Brother Doman met him at a sacrament service up on the mountain trails away from the base camp. Two more days of hiking were to be completed before the trek would be finished. When it was time for testimonies to be borne during the meeting, the young man stepped forward with a testimony of great power. He said,<br><br><i>As I left the base camp, I wondered if I could make it. But I knew that if the Lord would bless me, I would have the physical strength to accomplish the task. At the end of the first day my shoulders were raw with blisters. My feet were sore. I could hardly rest that night, but I knelt in prayer and asked the Lord to please give me the physical strength for one more day, the strength to carry my own pack, to carry my own weight. The next day came. A similar experience occurred. My feet were sore and blistered. I wondered if I could make it. The other fellows were concerned because I was the last one to come up the trail that day. Again that night I prayed. I pleaded with the Lord to give me the physical strength to endure the pain and to carry my own pack, to make my own way. Somehow the next day seemed a bit better. I found that the Lord was my strength. I ate well. I cooked well. I performed all the trail requirements at each camp. I found myself having more and more strength.</i><br><br>Then the young man closed with these words:<br><br><i>I know that the greatest source of physical strength or any other strength is the strength that comes from the Lord if we can just be content to seek for the strength to go one day at a time.</i><br><br>He then expressed his gratitude to the Lord for blessing him and promised Brother Doman that in two days he would lead the team off the trail. He kept his word and, in fact, was the first one to return to base camp. He appeared to be in good physical condition and in great spiritual condition. Relying upon the Lord and expecting the best from himself had enabled him to reach his goal.<br><h2><b>Character</b></h2><br>You&#39;ll think that I just have Scouting stories, and you&#39;re right. I happen to have an assignment with the young men of the Church, and I listen to what happens to Scouts because, you see, you were there just a short time ago. You were there in that field of preparation to come here. Just as George Washington was preparing with his father before he began his training with Lawrence, you were there training before you came here. And so as we look back to those days of experience at an earlier time in our lives, perhaps we can draw from them the strength that we need to go forward today in the new challenges of education. Remember that the requirement is no less in the classroom than it is on the trail. You are still on your own. You are still facing the challenges by yourself, for the decision must be yours. Will you require sufficient from yourself to do your best? Will you be willing to listen, willing to learn, as George Washington spoke about himself? Listen to another experience of a young boy on the trail.<br><br>This was one of those boys who is present in almost every Scout troop. He is the one who has wanted to be included in everything but somehow never quite measured up. When his pack was all put together, it seemed that there were always one or two things left out. Maybe it was the salt; maybe it was the cooking equipment. On one occasion he even forgot to pack his bedroll. That spring his Scout troop planned a trip to the high Uintas as a culminating activity for their summer&#39;s work and training. In order to qualify, each boy had to take five successive hikes, each one requiring the development of a particular skill that would be needed on this longer venture into the Uintas. This young man worked hard, but every trip seemed to present the same dilemma: something was missing. He didn&#39;t quite qualify under the regular circumstances. Well, additional help needed to be given, and his Scout master willingly provided the additional training. After the fifth trip the lad had reached the point where he finally qualified to go on the extended hike. The Scoutmaster was grateful--kind of a mixed gratefulness because he knew that he would have that young man with him on a difficult backpacking trip for several days. He could see himself having to carry the young man&#39;s pack or having to carry the young man himself or discovering that some very important, essential items had been left at home. But the boy had qualified, and so the Scoutmaster cheered him on with these words: "I&#39;m surely glad you made it. Come on, we&#39;ll make it together, and you&#39;ll really like it."<br><br>Well, the day for the trip came, and they started on their way up into the Uintas. As had been anticipated, at the end of the first day&#39;s hike something was missing. When they were ready to put up the tent, the stakes had been left out. Quickly they cut some stakes from the limbs of a fallen tree. It wasn&#39;t a serious matter; they could put the tent in its rightful place, and the troop could continue on its way.<br><br>The second day had barely gotten underway, however, when one of the boy&#39;s pack gave way. It had been put on incorrectly and therefore had worn out prematurely. Since each boy had made his own equipment as a part of the requirement for preparation for the trip, the boy again had been responsible for the error. Well, they improvised. The Scoutmaster was able to help him make a new strap from a piece of leather and a belt, and they continued their journey. It seemed that every day was the same.<br><br>At the end of the sixth day they reached the summit. They arrived at the close of the day, near sundown. A magnificent scene unfolded before them. The Scoutmaster was pleased and relieved. All the boys had made it to the top. He then looked around, and to his dismay the thing he had feared the most had happened--yes, our young Scout was missing. Where was he? His pack was there, but the boy was nowhere in sight. The Scoutmaster went back down the trail quite a distance, and, still unable to find him, thought he should return and get some help from the other boys. As he came back up the trail near the top, he noticed a clearing that he hadn&#39;t seen on his way down. There was the boy. The Scoutmaster walked toward him. As he came closer, he detected that the boy was kneeling, so he hesitated within earshot and could hear the boy speaking. The boy, out at the edge of the clearing near a rock where he could look down across the peaks over the great valleys, was saying as he named each peak, "Number one, I beat you. I climbed. I beat you." Then he named the next peak, then the next, each time with the same exclamation, "I beat you. I climbed beyond you."<br><br>When he reached the fifth peak, tears were streaming down his face, and he repeated again, "I beat you. I beat you. I made it." The boy closed with a prayer of gratitude.<br><br>Not wanting the boy to know he was there, the Scoutmaster (Elder S. Dilworth Young) remained hidden from view. He knew that that had to be a moment for the boy to be alone. It was his accomplishment, not the Scoutmaster&#39;s. As the Scout came from the clearing where the Scoutmaster stood, the man took the young boy in his arms, held him close to him, and congratulated him on his success.<br><br>While these two experiences are examples of great triumph over personal challenges and seem to have been accomplished in a relatively brief time, the principles underlying the successes of these two young men are the same ones which brought greatness to the life of George Washington. You and I, like them and George Washington, must take advantage of our educational opportunities so that our lives will be filled with successful experiences. Successful experiences come when we realize that we have done our best.<br><h2><b>"You Can Do It."</b></h2><br>Some years ago at this same institution, I looked at myself and said, "I don&#39;t think I can make it." And then someone, some teacher, had the courage to say, "You can. I know you can."<br><br>I looked at him and thought, "Then you&#39;re the only one who does." My report cards wouldn&#39;t have revealed that same secret. Maybe it was too well kept a secret. But he encouraged me and said, "You can do it." He asked me where I was from. I told him, and he already knew. He said, "Yes, I know you&#39;re from Spanish Fork. That&#39;s my home too. Anybody from Spanish Fork ought to be on the honor roll."<br><br>I determined that if a man had that kind of courage--to look at me, to see what I was, and still to have the strength to say, "You can make it"--I would. There was a lot of praying--not just on my part, but on the part of my wife. We wanted to be successful. How grateful I am that the Lord gives us courage, strength, faith, experiences, and opportunities to succeed.<br><br>I hope that as you go forward this year and every year hereafter, you will conduct yourselves in such a way as to know that the Lord is pleased with your performance, and then you will be. Only under those conditions can you really do your best. George Washington hoped that he would live in perfect harmony with the Bible. Today we would say, "With the scriptures." He did it because he had the personal commitment to excellence which will build understanding and greatness in a person&#39;s life. May each of us commit ourselves to obtain that excellent spirit and to give our best, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex D.

<h1>t Veritas: - Jeffrey R. Holland - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Welcome to BYU. I'm back for my sophomore year; and while that won't impress the seniors, it ought to be stunning to the freshmen, evidence one again of life after death. One of the great things about your year, this year, at BYU is that you're going to share it with my wife, Pat Holland. I'd like her to step up here and say, "Hi," to you. We do this sort of business together throughout the year. The Proverbs say, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing" (18:22), and I found a really, really good thing. In fact, just this morning I heard her down fixing breakfast. Our youngest came in and said, "Mom, did you wake up grumpy this morning?"<br><br>And she said, "No, I'm just letting him sleep in. It's school today."<br><br>Sweetheart, would you give them a greeting?<br><h2><b>Patricia Holland</b></h2><br>Jeff is kidding you. We really have a perfect marriage. My father told me we would have even when we were dating. Just a few nights before we were to be married, we had some kind of a little lovers' quarrel, and I was really upset with Jeff and said, "Please take me home." He brought me home and I ran into the house, slammed the door, ran into my father's bedroom, woke him up out of a dead sleep, and said, "Daddy, you've got to call this wedding off. This marriage just won't work."<br><br>My father in all his wisdom sat up in bed and said, "I will not call this marriage off. This marriage was made in heaven." When I stopped crying long enough to find out why, he said, "Because the rocks in Jeff's head will fill the holes in yours."<br><h2><b>President Holland</b></h2><br>This business with my father-in-law is real. I had a real challenge. It took me a while to win him over, but I knew I was home free in one of the most difficult moments of all. It was, in fact, at the very hour I had come in my best LDS fashion to ask for her hand. He just went to pieces. He ranted and raved and charged around and said she was too young and why did I think I'd be able to marry her and on and on and on and finally said, "Do you think I want her tied to an idiot for the rest of her life?"<br><br>I said, "No; that's the reason I've come to ask for her hand."<br><h2><b>Patricia Holland</b></h2><br>In a kind of friendly, family way, I am happy to have this opportunity to welcome you back to the university at the beginning of a new year. And I would like to extend a very special warm greeting to those of you who are new to the university. As my husband mentioned, we have been here just a year now, and we have learned so many things this past year--both through our challenges and through our blessings that have come from being at this university. One of them is that Security will stop you on campus no matter whose wife you are, and the other is that the university does have a mission. We hope that everyone here at BYU can realize that.<br><br>President Kimball said in my husband's inaugural:<br><br><i>As the Church continues to progress, BYU will be thrust forward.</i><br><br>He also said in a recent general conference that<br><br><i>There is a tide to be taken now in the affairs of the Church in all the earth which will lift us up and carry us forward as never before.</i>[<i>"Let Us Not Weary in Well Doing," Ensign</i>, May 1980, p. 80]<br><br>You, my young friends, are part of that tide. We are all part of that tide. And BYU is one of the greatest instruments the Lord has to prepare you for that service. So let me strongly encourage you that while you're here you take advantage of every opportunity there is here at this university to grow.<br><br>Some have worried whether the idealism that is here at BYU really prepares you to adjust to the harsh realities that you will be facing in the "real" world. But the vision that we have for you, the vision that my husband and I have for you, is that by the time you leave BYU you will have become so healthy and so strong and so well nourished, intellectually and especially spiritually, that the world will have to adjust and conform to you.<br><br>My hope for you today is that you will work for, and especially pray for, and that you will reach to know and understand, your full potential. And I promise you that potential will come when you are then ready and willing to return that full capacity back to the purposes of our Father in Heaven. Of that I bear testimony and leave my love with you today, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>President Holland</b></h2><br>Well, now you know why it's easy for me to do this job.<br><br>There are many things I would like to say to you in a setting like this, and yet obviously by the very nature of our first devotional hour with you, we don't have that time. Perhaps later in the year, when things are a little less hectic, I can have an hour with you to talk about things of mutual importance. Let me at least say this morning that we love you, that we welcome you to BYU, and that you're needed here. May I suggest briefly some of the hopes we have for you.<br><br>To get into that, let me just imagine that some of you are wondering about how the Hollands feel after their first year. I can tell you in one word--we feel terrific. We've never had a more rewarding or exciting experience than the chance to be with you in this greatest of all universities. Our children have to walk a mile to see their next-door neighbors, but they believe the game room in the Wilkinson Center makes up for that. We're grateful for your kindness to them as they mow you down with their bicycles on their way to Wasatch Elementary.<br><br>There have been some peculiar aspects to our experience, however, one of which saw its most dramatic realization about four weeks ago. You may not have thought about it, but it is an interesting challenge for the president of BYU, particularly when living on campus, to have some semblance of a private life in a very public word. We have had student visitors call and ask if our dog would bark into their family home evening microphone, if my wife would play the Cougar Fight Song on the piano to fulfill scavenger hunt obligations. We have been asked to hold in safekeeping pumpkin pie until an unsuspecting Mr. Wonderful was contacted, anonymously of course, and informed that his would-be eternal flame had left such a token with us for him and for him alone. We've had couples want to get engaged in our living room; we've had families want to have their pictures taken on our balcony; we have untold requests for moonlight dinners for two in our garden gazebo (we assume not to be catered by us). Now, because I hear all kinds of new wheels turning, I hasten to add that we have declined such requests, not because we wouldn't like to be part of every scavenger hunt on campus, but because we can't be. In spite of their father, I believe my wife hopes for some reasonable normality in our children so that only he, and not they, will be institutionalized upon release from the presidency of this university.<br><br>Another aspect of that constant challenge has been to go off campus. Our family loves pizza. My wife ate so much pizza when she was expecting our second son that his first words upon entering the world were not "mama" or "dada" but rather "pepperoni and mushroom, and keep the crust thick." But in my quest for anonymity, I have discovered that it is difficult to eat pizza through a ski mask, especially if you order Canadian bacon. We slip into a restaurant somewhere near campus, and there's a low buzz as if to say, "Surely they don't eat food." When we order a local Big Mac or Whopper, the main topic of conversation for a week is, "Did he hold the pickles?" I occasionally stun them, eat the pickles, and hold the onions. Of course, if I really want to be stunning, I eat the onions and hold the rest of the burger. But it does make one a little self-conscious to have his cheeseburger analyzed and then watch a brief entry being made in a Book of Remembrance. Oh, the price one pays for public life!<br><h2><b>Going to the Movies</b></h2><br>Now all of this, slightly exaggerated, is only to set the stage for this most dramatic moment about four weeks ago. The Hollands actually decided to go to a movie. We don't go to lot of movies. We venture out about once a year, and then we hit the Varsity Theater. That's more our speed, and the price is better. But our children prevailed upon us for a family home evening activity that would actually take us into the outside world for an honest-to-gosh movie. We weighed carefully the kind of movie we were going to, found one that seemed appropriate for the family, and went. It was one of those new combined theater arrangements where sixteen people and a keg of popcorn make a full house, so we knew it was going to be cozy, but we didn't realize how cozy.<br><br>We came a little late; the movie was more popular than we had supposed, and the lines were long. By the time we bought tickets, there were, by actual usher's count, only seven seats left in the house. Now, there are five of us. That left two. We said we'd take the five wherever they were and agreed as a family to regroup under the nearest streetlamp after the movie. As luck would have it, on one of the back rows of the theater where we entered were two seats together with a third nearby. We quickly inserted our children into those seats and thought at least they would enjoy the movie.<br><br>Now, out of a total of seven, that should have left four, but somebody must have been hiding them as we began our long march down the aisle. It didn't appear to me that there was an extra arm in the room, speaking, of course, of movie seats and not human flesh. We were looking for arms without fingers on the end. Then the comments started--first a kind of low hush, growing but increasingly audible to us and, I assume, to everyone else in the theater. I was a little embarrassed. "Oh, they're coming to a movie, an actual movie, and I'm here in this very movie with them." Well, I didn't think our arrival deserved all of that; I mean I know we're famous, but I suppose President and Sister Oaks went to movies. We kept walking. "Oh, look, they bought popcorn. I want to talk to the girl who sold them that popcorn. I wonder if it's buttered or plain."<br><br>By now I was thinking, "Shucks, we're just ordinary folks. Anybody could be president down there at BYU." But the chatter went on. The farther down the aisle we went, the more the heads turned. Indeed, I was amazed at how impressed the younger crowd seemed to be. Some of the group were probably BYU students, but the larger part seemed to be younger--high school or junior high, sort of teenyboppers, if you will. I leaned over to Pat and said, "You're causing quite a stir, dear. They want to know if you have butter on your popcorn."<br><br>"This is ridiculous," she whispered back. "I feel like Bonnie and Clyde after holding up a bank, and you're Clyde."<br><br>"Thanks," I said, "but I prefer Chuck."<br><br>"Chuck what?" she said.<br><br>"Just Chuck, you know, short for Charles--Prince Charles, and you're Lady Diana. The carriage is just out by the fire hydrant, and we all turn into groundhogs at 10:00 p.m." (That's BYU curfew in advance of midnight. I just added that for you.)<br><br>"Don't make fun of the royal wedding," she said.<br><br>"I'm not making fun," I replied. "I'm just asking you to keep your royal eye open for a vacant throne."<br><br>By then it was obvious that not only were we not going to find two adjoining seats, but it looked doubtful whether we'd find any seat at all, and we were near the front of the theater by now. "Oh, they're not going to sit together," someone moaned. Another girl, about thirteen, actually started to cry. It was obvious this whole thing was a very moving experience, but I didn't think it should be that moving. "It's okay," I kept saying in a sort of large-stage whisper. "Don't worry about it; it's okay." But the moaning and the wailing and the tears increased.<br><br>Just when it looked as if we were going to turn the whole theater into the downtown equivalent of the Relief Society nursery on homemaking day, we spied two vacant seats a couple of places apart. Some young woman, sensing our plight, moved over into one of them, leaving hers adjoining the other single, and we sank into them, safe, our noses eight inches from the screen. This was going to be a stereophonic experience with a vengeance. But interestingly enough, the moaning and the wailing and the whispering and the pointing went on. It continued to be directed generally toward us but with something of a glazed look now in the eyes of these young people. "This is ridiculous," I said to my wife. "They don't need to act like we're from another planet."<br><br>"Maybe they wouldn't," my wife said, "if you'd left your cap and gown home." She was only kidding of course, but I gave her a little elbow in the ribs.<br><br>Well, the teenyboppers were still bopping, and I thought we certainly had some responsibility. Something had to be done; it was my moral duty. So I stood in my front row aisle seat to acknowledge their feverish applause and turned head on, face to face, nose to nose, into Steve Craig and Marie Osmond, who had been walking down the aisle stride for stride behind us.<br><br>Some of you who may be new to this campus won't know Steve Craig or Marie Osmond. Steve is from our very successful basketball team of last year. Steve has the kind of handsome looks that make Robert Redford consider plastic surgery. And Marie is a local working girl. (You certainly can't be expected to know everyone your first day on campus.) Well, so much for Prince Charles and Lady Di. Actually, we knew that Steve and Marie were behind us; we bribed them with the last two tickets. We thought it would look like we were on a double date. You can check with me afterward and I'll tell you whether they had butter on their popcorn.<br><h2><b>Dress and Grooming</b></h2><br>Well, to slightly more serious matters. I had hoped last year--and said so--after spending some considerable time in my first address to the students stressing why I thought clean, attractive dress and grooming were an important part of the mission of BYU, that I would never have to do it again, at least not at any length or at the repeated expense of other more important subjects. However, some redefinitions in our standards this year and the recent publicity about them suggest that I need to make it clear once again how we feel about this whole matter, and then I hope we won't need to belabor the matter again. It is important that no one misunderstand our intents nor underestimate our firm expectations. Let me give you just a little history. (And may I pause editorially to say don't be nervous about the hour; class won't start until I let you go.)<br><br>Nearly two years ago, President Oaks and others at BYU began long, thoughtful conversations with the commissioner's office and the Board of Trustees about updating BYU's dress and grooming code. After several months of review and counsel, the Board of Trustees invited President Oaks to redefine and, in so doing, reemphasize two particularly important elements in our dress and grooming expectations. Shortly after that directive was given by the board, President Oaks was released, and I was appointed to succeed him. I then began to work with President Kerr and Deans Sorenson, Mouritsen, and Halvorsen and others in the Student Life area on this important matter. Last spring I then issued a memorandum to the university from which I now quote in part:<br><br><i>Our individual and collective image has to do with the very mission of the university and the Church which sponsors it. By asking us to maintain a modest, neat, and clean appearance, our Board of Trustees are inviting us to aid them in making a deeper statement to the world about our beliefs, our convictions, our civility, and our discipline.</i><br><br><i>In</i>[that]<i>spirit, ... may I say something of the two areas in our dress and grooming code which seem to cause the most difficulty--hair length for men and wearing apparel for women.</i><br><br><i>Regarding men's hair length, the Trustees have said, "Hair must be styled so as not to cover the ears and must be above the collar in the back." Neither the Trustees nor the administration intend this to mean that men's hair cannot</i>touch<i>the ear. If clean, well-groomed hair brushes over the top of the ear, a student is not in violation of the spirit of this code. However, it is clearly stated that the ear is not to be</i>covered<i>. If the brushed "touch" at the top of the ear progresses to "covering" a major portion of the ear, we ask that the hair be trimmed</i>. [Furthermore, if a young man has managed to limit the hair on his ear but the rest of his locks look as if they or he had been electrocuted, then we ask that the hair be trimmed, or at least better groomed.]<br><br><i>As for women's wearing apparel, the Trustees and the administration have always stressed clean, modest attire. The intent of the code is to encourage attractive and appropriate women's wear which avoids a quasimale or unisex dress standard. This spirit should govern women's dress on the campus rather than endless debate as to whether a "designer jean" is also a slack or whether the fabric is cotton, polyester, or denim or whether it is colored red or white or blue.</i>[Some modest, dressy jeans seem to be very appropriate. Grubby, faded, frayed, sloppy-looking jeans are not--whatever the fabric and whatever the color. And that goes for men's wear as well.][Jeffrey R. Holland, "Dress and Grooming Standards at Brigham Young University." Unpublished memo, 10 April 1981]<br><br>Now, in the spirit of love and friendship and as an adult to an adult, we ask your support. We have given our University Standards Office the responsibility and authority to interpret and apply our definitions. Most of you look terrific; most of you look perfect. I was delighted as I watched you coming on campus this morning. But a few of you will need to attend to this soon. Last Saturday night at the talent show, I saw several young men who needed to get their hair trimmed or ironed, I don't know which. I also saw several young women in jeans hardly fit for a car wash. We ask your help in conveying a positive and appropriate image to a world that watches us even more closely. These slightly more generous redefinitions have been made as a courtesy to you. We will always adjust anything that is adjustable if it can further the purposes of the university and make you that much happier here. But as we do so, the spirit of our standards must be firmly maintained. We have tried to be helpful to you; we ask for your support in this effort. Now, having said all of that, I really do hope that I never again have to use precious time with the greatest audience in the world on this subject. I hope we can accept, implement, and move beyond it to much more important tasks. It does seem important to have said this in a year of some adjustment and change.<br><h2><b>Mission Statement</b></h2><br>Now let me briefly note two such tasks that are indeed more important to me. I will mention them here; I can only mention them; then I will find other ways to visit with you about them in the months and years ahead. Our entire BYU family of faculty, staff, and administrators were together last week in preparation for your arrival and the beginning of another school year. I tried to give them something of an accounting, a stewardship report, if you will, of my first twelve months in office. I reviewed some changes, documented what I thought were at least some accomplishments over the past year, and then read them a draft of a mission statement for BYU over which I have labored for hours and days and weeks. I tried to read almost everything that had been said about BYU and then attempted to reduce that down to a single statement, a brief outline in about 500 words, as to why BYU exists and what it should try to do in the decade ahead. I will not take time to read that this morning, but after it has been finalized by our Board of Trustees, we will publish it and distribute it to you so that you know what our faculty, staff, and administrators are aiming for in providing you with and education. Suffice it to say here that it focuses strongly on academic excellence in the context of religious faith and the broad, balanced development of the total person.<br><h2><b>Virtus et Veritas</b></h2><br>As a result of pursuing that university goal, I developed several personal goals of my own, two of which I combined into a little phrase<i>Virtus et Veritas</i>--virtue and truth. As for truth, that goal ought to speak for itself. I hope we all understand that this is a university for which you have spent good money--yours and other people's--to attend. It is not a young adult conference nor a missionary reunion nor a dating bureau nor an intramural athletic depot, though it may incidentally bless us with elements of all those activities and many more. But it is first, and foremost, and forever a university which has taken the very pursuit of godly knowledge and divine intelligence as its motto. We can have the fun and the football and the firesides and the Frisbees if we don't forget that a century of human life and hundreds of millions of dollars have been devoted to us--to you and to me--so that we could learn everything we can learn in this ideal but fleeting moment, which moment, like a mission, will never ever quite be ours again. I ask you the way the mission presidents plead with their missionaries: Don't miss this opportunity. It won't come again. It is here, we reach for it, and all too soon it will be gone.<br><br>I speak from experience, my young friends. It seems only about twenty minutes ago that I sat in those seats as a student and must have heard something very much like this same speech, and I, too, smiled and knew I had all the time in the world. Well, I don't have any time now, and twenty minutes or so from now, neither will you. Give it everything you have now, this semester, lest, like Oliver Cowdery, you realize too late that the opportunity of a lifetime has to be taken in the lifetime of the opportunity. We are moving out and we are moving up at BYU, and we ask you to do the same in your attempt to learn all that you can of what God knows and is anxious to make known to you. Learn how to learn; learn to love it. Learn to use it to bless lives in time and eternity. The truth will make you free. As a personal goal, I intend to join with you in that lifelong quest.<br><br>My other linked Latin goal, along with truth, is not in this case<i>lux</i>, or light, as in the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants, but<i>virtus</i>, or virtue. In our theology light is synonymous with and inseparable from the truth. Virtue, on the other hand, is all too often separated from both. Indeed, Lucifer was a son of the morning, a bearer of light (that's what his name means), but somehow he got light without getting virtue. I do not ever want us to be guilty of that here. To be ignorant is pitiable, and to be mistaken is unfortunate, but to know the truth and not conform our life to it is a crime which heaven and earth condemn. We are not interested at BYU in an alchemy which would adulterate the truth simply because that is easier than purifying the soul. The secularization of the western world has robbed education of what was once its chiefest and most important characteristic. "Education in virtue," said Plato in his<i>Laws</i>2,400 years ago, "is the only education which deserves the name." Dallin H. Oaks fought to keep our institutional independence intact. If I am free to pick my battle, then I wish to fight to keep our institutional virtue intact. There are schools enough that have it. I want us value laden and moral. I want us a veritable rod of iron in what is too often a dark and misty ethical void. How dark and misty? Consider this fictional observation from one contemporary writer:<br><br><i>This is the story of an imaginary teacher: One of his students, living off campus, vandalized her apartment to the tune of several thousand dollars and</i>[then]<i>refused to reimburse the landlord. As the college did nothing to encourage her to pay for the damages, a professor took the matters into his own hands. He gave her an "F" in the course</i>[she was taking from him]<i>and told her that he would not change it until she had paid the landlord. He justified this, he told the college, "on the solid Socratic ground that if a student did not know right from wrong, she should not pass a college course."</i>[Alston Chase,<i>Group Memory</i>(Boston: Little, Brown, 1980), p. 180]<br><br>Does that have meaning at BYU? Why is it necessary to lock a bicycle on this campus? Can anyone here help me with this personal dilemma? Why do my children or you have to lock bicycles on this campus? Convince me that it is really only because of a non-BYU group that might come on campus. Why do I see Smith's Food King Grocery carts upside down in a ditch six blocks from the store, often very near a student apartment? Is that a new program implemented by local store managers? Why do some merchants post signs for all the world to see reading "No checks cashed for BYU students"? Why do some large telephone bills go unpaid or get left for the last roommate in the apartment to assume? Now, these are problems that I hope are the exceptions and not the rules. I believe the BYU family, speaking collectively and by comparison, are more honorable in such matters than any other in education, but in today's world that could be damning with faint praise. "He gave her an 'F' in the course...and justified it...on the solid Socratic ground that if a student did not know right from wrong, she [or he] should not pass a college course."<br><br>My beloved young friends, we have a chance at BYU. We have a chance to make a difference, to stand for something. A recent writer in the<i>New York Times</i>said:<br><br><i>The gut issue in the United States today is the lack of quality from top to bottom in American life.</i><br><br>Well, we have an answer to that frustration. If we miss this chance, some future historian will ask why we became part of the world's ethical drift rather than seeking to shape it by our own strengths and scholarship and moral convictions. Such a historian will conclude that ours will not have been a failure of opportunity but of seeing opportunity, not a failure of wisdom but of the will to use the wisdom God has given our dispensation for a century and a half, a failure not of training but of purpose and integrity.<br><br>The moral qualities of higher education in this country are now a little like Louis XIII in the last year of his life. His doctors didn't know exactly what to do with him either, so they bled him 47 times, purged him 215 times, gave him rebeneese from a pharmacopia, which included the left foot of a tortoise, the urine of a lizard, some elephant dung, a mole's liver, blood drawn from the right wing of a white pigeon, an elixir of quicksilver, and an elixer of arsenic. They didn't lengthen his life; they just made it seem longer. He died at 41 years of age.<br><br>Now, we have some answers at BYU, answers to questions now being asked. We have a contribution to make. We can offer truth and virtue to a world which desperately needs them both. But we have got to demonstrate both here, in our personal lives at BYU. I ask you to join in this call this morning to high adventure.<br><h2><b>A Privilege, Not a Right</b></h2><br>Now, I tried to begin the hour in a light way, commenting on what it is like to be the president of BYU. When asked how I like it, I said "Terrific; I love it," and I meant it. But I need to say to you that I love it with one exception.<br><br>The part I don't love about this job is that it appears I will be the first president in the 106-year history of this institution to tell an increasingly larger number of prospective students that they cannot come to BYU. I had been in office only a matter of hours late last summer when I began to understand what real personal pain it would mean to families, friends, alumni, and high school graduates throughout this Church to be told that there was no available space remaining at Brigham Young University. The frustration and disappointment and anger many feel over this has been the most difficult part of my year; and without going into that detail, I do need to say to you that it is in every way a privilege and not a right to be at BYU. I say that of myself, I say it of Sister Holland, I say it of colleagues in the administration, faculty, and staff. But certainly it must also be said of you. What I am sure you don't need to be told in light of the pain of so many parents and prospective students is that I'm going to be pretty unsympathetic with a student who comes to BYU in this decade to play, to goof off, to loaf in and out of class, to defy our standards and our expectations and our values, whether those be moral values, whether those be moral or academic or otherwise. By the same token, we never wish to be cold or unkind. We certainly will not be unfair. Where honest help is needed, honest help will be given. But a carelessness--and I use that word specifically and literally--on your part about what BYU intends to stand for will not be impressive to me at a time when 4,500 students every year are being turned away. We are going to be as fair and as equitable in our retention policy. But it will be with the assumption that students who come to BYU and who stay at BYU will be those who love learning, who love Christian living, and who want to make a constructive contribution to their world.<br><br>Please know that you are loved; please know that you are needed. It is for you that this university has been established. There is an investment on the part of tithepayers the length and breadth and history of the Church devoted to what you will become. I join hands with you to stand by that trust and give honor to the meaning of it.<br><br>Now, last night I was restless. And late--because I wanted to and we needed to--Pat and I left the house and the children in bed and walked. We walked across the campus--around it, through it--and looked at it and thought of you. We saw some of you scurrying here and there, anxious to get home, ready to start a new year. And I did indeed think in the beauty of the night and the grandeur that is this campus--I did indeed think about what the Prophet Joseph Smith said about Nauvoo. Of it he said and of you I say that it was the best place on earth, and you are indeed the best people in it. May this be your highest, healthiest, happiest year, the best of your life, in the search for self-discovery and in the discipline of matters of both truth and virtue that will be important for your contribution now and forever. I pray that for you and for us all in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<br>
<br>
President and Sister Holland, brothers and sisters all, even more fervently than you, I wish President Kimball were here today to be appropriately honored as was planned. However, what was postponed, as President Holland indicated, can now be anticipated, and I join with you in prayerful anticipation.<br><h2><b>Growth of the Church</b></h2><br>Since President Kimball is not here today and since we are out of the immediate range of his modesty, it is perhaps appropriate to share several statistical indicators about the Church growth in this vibrant era. Thus far in President Kimball&#39;s not-quite-eight years as president, the Church has grown from a membership of about 3.3 million to a membership of nearly 5 million.<br><br>As a better indicator of true growth, the total number of stakes has grown from 630 to 1,293--663 additional stakes as of today, more than doubling in less than eight years. The 109 missions have grown by 85 to a total of 194. Nineteen more countries outside the United States have been added to the 47 where the Church is established, opening the work for a total of 66 countries wherein units of the Church operate. The language areas in which the Church now functions have grown by 27, from 31 to 58, so that, as the scriptures foreshadow, people can hear the gospel in their own languages (see D&amp;amp;C 90:11). A symbolic statistic is this one: There are now more stakes and members of the Church in Chile than in Canada, with 28 stakes and approximately 100,000 members in Chile!<br><br>The indicators just recited do not have even a close parallel in Church history. Beyond the dramatic demographics, however, there is something much more significant. We are blessed, all of us, by the personal impact of President Kimball on our lives. As such a beloved leader, his personal influence is impossible to measure, but it is even more pervasive and remarkable than the numbers recited.<br><h2><b>Grounded, Rooted, Established, Settled</b></h2><br>Indeed it is in the context of such pleasing but challenging growth that the theme for today will be addressed--from the words of Paul and Peter, "grounded, rooted, established, and settled." This is a vital objective for all members of the Church, but especially for your generation because of the special circumstances which will confront you. In fact, you may be the first generation in Church history, because of lamentably changing conditions in the world, who will be asked to believe and to behave "because of the word" and not circumstances. In varying degrees, you will not have the same affirmative influence of societal institutions which once strongly supported the family and principles such as chastity and fidelity. Those supporting influences, in many respects, will, unfortunately fall away like so much scaffolding. Then we will see who stands, both on holy ground and on holy principles!<br><br>Jesus described some of these realities and the casualties of conversion and retention thusly:<br><br><i>Some</i>[seeds]<i>fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</i><br><br><i>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</i>[Matthew 13:5‚Äì6]<br><br>Happily, Alma elaborated concerning how that gospel seed can grow, nourished by "faith with great diligence, and with patience" (Alma 32:41). Properly nourished, it will develop a good root system, and even when the heat of the sun comes and scorches, it will not wither (see Alma 32:28‚Äì38). By using a word as graphic as<i>scorched</i>to describe the heat which believers will feel, the Lord, who is not given to hyperbole, tells us something about the heat that will come, not alone in the rigors of individual life, but also in the special summer of circumstances which Jesus said would come when the leaves of the fig tree sprouted (see Matthew 24:32). That summer is upon us, and only those who are grounded, rooted, established, and settled will survive spiritually.<br><br>I do not, therefore, worry about your generation&#39;s lack of adventure. Before you are through, you are likely to appreciate, in those lines from<i>Fiddler on the Roof,</i>what Tevye said when he wished aloud that the Lord would choose someone else for a change. You will become very conscious of who you are. However, today I will not stress the extraordinariness of your times but the immense possibilities which lie within the seeming ordinariness of your lives.<br><br>Since you are part of the Lord&#39;s unfolding purposes, remember how deep the divine determination is.<br><br><i>There is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.</i>[Abraham 3:17]<br><br>You are a part of that unfolding process. But he will not revise the structure of this second estate just because you and I have had a bad day.<br><h2><b>Attributes and Skills Never Obsolete</b></h2><br>It is especially helpful to remember also that the temptations and challenges we face are common to man (see 1 Corinthians 10:13), yet we must respond uncommonly. It is also useful to ponder the fact that, along with even the Savior himself, we are to experience certain things "according to the flesh" (Alma 7:12) and to learn "in process of time" (Moses 7:21). Built, therefore, into the seemingly ordinary experiences of life are opportunities for us to acquire such eternal attributes as love, mercy, meekness, patience, and submissiveness and to develop and sharpen such skills as how to communicate, motivate, delegate, and manage our time and talents and our thoughts in accordance with eternal priorities. These attributes and skills are portable; they are never obsolete and will be much needed in the next world.<br><br>How often have you and I really pondered just what it is, therefore, that will rise with us in the resurrection? Our intelligence will rise with us, meaning not simply our I.Q., but our capacity to receive and to apply truth. Our talents, attributes, and skills will rise with us, certainly also our capacity to learn, our degree of self-discipline, and our capacity to work. Note that I said "our capacity to work" because the precise form of our work here may have no counterpart there, but the capacity to work will never be obsolete. To be sure, we cannot, while here, entirely avoid contact with the obsolescent and the irrelevant. It is all around us. But one can be around irrelevancy without becoming attached to it, and certainly we should not become preoccupied with obsolete things.<br><br>By these remarks I do not intend to create discontent with the paraphernalia of this probationary estate, but it is a grave error to mistake the scenery and the props for the real drama which is underway. Nor do I wish to bear down too much on the fact that certain mortal vocations will be irrelevant in the next world. A mortician does useful work here, especially if it is done with excellence, compassion, and reverence for life. Whatever our vocation, we should be sweetened, not hardened. Keeping our sense of proportion<i>whatever</i>we do, keeping our precious perspective<i>wherever</i>we are, and keeping the commandments<i>however</i>we are tested reflect being settled, rooted, and grounded in our discipleship.<br><h2><b>A Precious Perspective</b></h2><br>Remaining settled and established is not easy, for we are crowded by the cares of the world. We are diverted by the praise of the world; we are buffeted by the trials of the world, drawn by the appetites and tempt-ations of the world, and bruised by the hardness of the world. But when we are grounded, rooted, established, and settled, we can have a precious perspective which puts other things in their proper place. This is no small blessing, for it lifts us above our immediate circumstances and concerns, giving us a larger view of things, as this secular episode illustrates:<br><br><i>In 1918, Ernest Rutherford, a physicist, missed a meeting of experts advising the British government on anti-submarine warfare. When criticized for missing the meeting, he replied, "I had been engaged in experiments which suggest that the atom can be artificially disintegrated. If it is true, it is of far greater importance than a war."</i>[George F. Will,<i>The Pursuit of Happiness, and Other Sobering Thoughts</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1978), p. 228]<br><br>The precious perspective of the gospel also helps to keep before us the reality of what lies ahead. Malcolm Muggeridge put it so very well:<br><br><i>Now, the prospect of death overshadows all others for me. I am like a man on a sea voyage nearing his destination. When I embarked, I worried about having a cabin with a porthole, whether I should be asked to sit at the captain&#39;s table, who were the more attractive and important passengers. All such considerations become pointless, however, when I shall soon be disembarking.</i>[Ian Hunter, ed.,<i>Things Past</i>(New York: Morrow, 1979), p. 166]<br><h2><b>Guidance of the Holy Spirit</b></h2><br>So it is, brothers and sisters, that neither a sense of impending cataclysm nor of our eventual death should keep us from proceeding with our mortal chores. It is very desirable, for instance, that you go forward with your education even in the midst of the gathering storm. I cherish these lines from C. S. Lewis given over 40 years ago to students and scholars at Oxford in the midst of another gathering storm. He said:<br><br><i>If men had postponed the search for knowledge and beauty until they were secure, the search would never have begun. . . . Life has never been normal. . . . Humanity . . . wanted knowledge and beauty now, and would not wait for the suitable moment that never comes. . . . The insects have chosen a different line: they have sought first the material welfare and security of the hive, and presumably they have their reward. Men are different. They propound mathematical theorems in beleaguered cities, conduct metaphysical arguments in condemned cells, make jokes on scaffolds, discuss the last new poem while advancing to the walls of Quebec, and comb their hair at Thermophylae. This is not a</i>panache<i>; it is our nature.</i>["Learning in War-Time,"<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1980), pp. 21‚Äì22]<br><br>Be true, therefore, to the buoyancy in your nature which responds to your innate cravings for truth and beauty in spite of circumstance. Besides, in a very real sense, given the purpose of the mortal experience, your university education is an education within an education. You will wonder sometimes about life--if mortality consists only of large classes. In fact, life is designed to be quite tutorial in nature so far as how the lessons are usually taught and learned. Each of us will surely need to take the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, Guide, and Comforter throughout this stretching experience (see D&amp;amp;C 45:57). He can reassure us that the president of the Church is a prophet of God. There will be times when you will need that reinforcement. After all, prophets are not just for following in the Sinai or on a westward journey. President Brigham Young told of one man who, instead of going west, wanted to wait in the East for the impending redemption of Zion and who was told by George A. Smith that the nearest way to Missouri was through Salt Lake City (<i>JD</i>8:198). There will be some equivalent counsel given to you in your lifetime.<br><br>Moses, an inspired leader, desired an inspired people. On one occasion reports reached him that certain members of the camp were prophesying, and when Joshua wanted it forbidden, Moses said unto him:<br><br><i>Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord&#39;s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!</i>[Numbers 11:27‚Äì29]<br><br>It is not merely a matter of lessening the burden of the few, but of enlarging the perspectives of the many.<br><br>With the Holy Spirit as our guide, our conscience stays vibrant and alive. Things which we had never supposed come into view. Seeming routine turns out to be resplendent. Ordinary people seem quite the opposite. What we once thought to be the mere humdrum of life gives way to symphonic strains. Circumstances or a mere conversation which look quite pedestrian nevertheless cause a quiet moment of personal resolve, and a decision affecting all eternity is made. Sometimes you and I even sense it as it happens, but there are no bands playing, and there are no headlines. Therefore, a very significant part of getting settled in one&#39;s discipleship consists of coming to terms with the realities around us that seem so routine. Routine, like trials, can bring us closer to God or move us away from him. What seems commonplace seldom is.<br><h2><b>Danger in Lack of Love</b></h2><br>Occasionally I see individuals who are meeting life&#39;s challenges reasonably well but who unfortunately fail to appreciate the general adequacy of their response. They let the seeming ordinariness of life dampen their spirits. Though actually coping and growing, some ack the quiet inner-soul satisfaction which can steady them. Instead they seem to experience a lingering sense that there is something more important they should be doing or that their chores are somehow not quite what was expected, as if what is quietly achieved in righteous individual living or in parenthood is not sufficiently spectacular.<br><br>Feeling unrequited as to role and feeling underwhelmed do not occur, however, because of a structural failure in this divinely designed second estate. Rather they occur because of a lack of love, for love helps us to see and to respond to those opportunities which have been allotted to us and which lie unused all about us. Before we complain about the curriculum in mortality, or more particularly our current class schedules, we would do well to remember who designed the curriculum and to allow for however many other places it has been successfully used.<br><br>True, there are more things to be done than we do, more opportunities for service than are used. True we make mistakes. Even some of our achievements are flawed by a lack of finesse. True there are seeming flat periods in life when we may feel underwhelmed. In such situations, however, we had best get back to the basics of why we are here. In the terse communiqu√© from the Gods about our being placed on this planet, the basic objective of life on this planet was stated:<br><br><i>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.</i>[Abraham 3:25]<br><br>This is a pithy but sweeping declaration of divine intent. The second estate has been carefully structured so as to carry out that intent. To misunderstand this straightforward and tutorial purpose of life as a proving process is to make a fundamental error which ensure that thousands of additional errors will naturally follow. If our focus on the fundamental purpose of life is blurred, we will not see "things as they really are" (Jacob 4:13).<br><h2><b>Some Lessons the Hard Way</b></h2><br>Hence there should be no surprise about the second estate when it features lessons to be learned the hard way "according to the flesh." There should be no resentment or mystery regarding the patient personal development which must occur "in process of time." God&#39;s purposes are plain!<br><br>Since we are here to thus be proved, how can that occur except we are tested? If we are here to learn to choose wisely, how can that occur except there be alternatives? If our soul is to be stretched, how can that happen without growing pains? How can personal development really occur amid routine unless we have authentic challenges on which to practice? Therefore, those who wait for some other insight about the purpose of this life heretofore inscrutably withheld from us will wait in vain. A sense of surprise, if there is one, is far more likely to occur, therefore, when some plain truth which we have known all along intellectually is suddenly or dramatically confirmed experientially. They err who, instead of concentrating on commandment keeping and personal spiritual progress, desire sweeping significance and high visibility in the second estate.<br><br>Is it really numbers of people touched at the moment which measure the impact of an individual? Did tens of thousands hear the Sermon on the Mount? Did it make the six-o&#39;clock news? Is Abraham to be measured by the volume of his trade with nomadic caravans in the desert or by living quietly and righteously so as one day to see fulfilled the promise that his posterity would be as numberless as the stars in the heavens? Was Ruth&#39;s eloquent and touching entreaty to Naomi to be assessed by the size of her audience? Demographics are not a complete measure.<br><br>Or is it the terrain one traverses which is the true test of his life? If so, should those of us who travel in the jet age view with condescension the mileage logged by Jesus during his mortal ministry? In those days, "from Dan to Beersheba" seemed so sweeping, yet it involved only a little over a hundred miles. One day our travels about his planet will seem quite provincial too when we are wafted from planet to planet. Distance, therefore, is not much of a determinant either.<br><br>Actually if it is sweeping insight we desire, and surprise, let us save room for surprise as the moment arrives when the eternal family&#39;s eventual itinerary is fully unveiled. But family life seems so ordinary now. Even so, some may still say, "Should I not be doing something else?" Ah, but that is not the real question! The real question is: "Why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?" (Alma 29:6). That is the question.<br><h2><b>Patience and Enduring Well</b></h2><br>One&#39;s task is to do more and to perform well within his callings, but it is not something else or another work he should seek. God will not judge us according to the calling of another. Therefore, how we utilize the seemingly ordinary experiences of our life and how well we keep the commandments are true tests of our performance in this second estate. One can, while in the employ of a railroad company, learn something of patience while struggling to keep the train schedule meticulously up to date. But the patience will long outlast the printed train schedule. A discovering scientist may augment his awe and meekness before his Creator because of the breathtaking order in the universe even if his new discoveries erelong are swallowed up in even more immense discoveries.<br><br>But it is also true that routine may cause a gravedigger to become indifferent to the sorrows of the bereaved gathered about those fresh mounds of earth. The gravedigger may even become cynical about the resurrection which one day will empty all those graves. A marriage counselor can become encrusted with a protective layer of clinical indifference brought on by the routine and incessant nature of his chores. If so, his techniques will never compensate for his lack of caring. A civil servant who has forgotten how to be civil may have some sway now in the procurement division of a vast governmental direction, but he is headed in just the opposite developmental direction needed for sway in the next world.<br><br>On the other hand, one who listens more and more effectively to others with a genuine desire to understand and to help, if not always to agree, will have no regrets later on. Such an individual may occasionally run out of time here, but he is fitting himself for eternity. Love and patience are never wasted; they only appear to be. The devoted wife and mother who is a quiet but effective neighbor but whose obituary is noticed by a comparative few may well have laid up precious little here in the current coin-of-the-realm, recognition, yet rising with her in the resurrection will be relevant attributes and skills honed and refined in family and neighborhood life. Contrariwise, the civic leader whose thirst for recognition causes him to do things to be seen of men has his reward. He too will receive the gift of immortality during which expanse he can work on meekness and humility.<br><h2><b>Look beyond Appearances</b></h2><br>Thus when life is viewed superficially, it seems routine and even pedestrian. However, what appears on the surface can be a thin cover for developments of great spiritual significance. Those who passed by the football stadium at the University of Chicago several decades ago did not know what was underway below those empty seats. The atom was being split, after which the world was never again to be the same. Such a quiet stadium too. It is left to us, therefore, in our varied circumstances but with common challenges to make the interplay of our time and talent bring about the development of the key eternal attributes and the everlasting skills. A botched performance here means less chance to serve there. Any resulting advantage we have in the world to come clearly will result from taking advantage of the opportunities this life affords us. Hence those who are grounded, rooted, established, and settled will be serious about the eternal objectives on which this life should focus.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, when anciently we shouted for joy in anticipation of this mortal experience, we did not then think it would be ordinary and pedestrian at all. We sensed the impending high adventure. Let us be true to that first and more realistic reaction.<br><h2><b>Perspective Much Needed</b></h2><br>May I note in closing how much needed the perspective is which goes with being established and settled as we contemplate our varied circumstances. Some in the Church are divorced; some are unmarried but yearn to be and are worthy to be married. Some are widowers, and some are widows; others are blessed to be in traditional intact families. Some are healthy; others are ill, some seriously and terminally ill. Some members are struggling economically, but a few are quite comfortable economically. Some are lonely, and others have almost more friends than they can manage. Our immediate circumstances surely differ, but these circumstances will pass away soon enough, though at times it may seem otherwise.<br><br>Notice in contrast how our basic circumstances and eternal opportunities are strikingly similar. Each of us is a child of God. Each of us agreed to pass through this mortal experience with its common temptations and seeming ordinariness. Eventually each of us can have the privilege of receiving all the gospel ordinances. Each of us is accountable for our thoughts and actions. Each of us is loved perfectly by a Heavenly Father who knows us and our needs perfectly. Each of us has the same commandments to keep and must walk the same straight and narrow path in order to have happiness here and there. Each of us has the same eternal attributes to develop. So our fundamental circumstances are the same.<br><br>A hundred years from now, today&#39;s seeming deprivations and tribulations will not matter then unless we let them matter too much now. A hundred years from now, today&#39;s serious physical ailment will be but a fleeting memory. A thousand years from now, those who now worry and are anguished because they are unmarried will, if they are faithful, have smiles of satisfaction on their faces in the midst of a vast convocation of their posterity. The seeming deprivation which occurs in the life of a single woman who feels she has no prospects of marriage and motherhood properly endured is but a delayed blessing, the readying of a reservoir into which a generous God will pour all that he hath. Indeed, it will be the Malachi measure: "there shall not be room enough to receive it" (Malachi 3:10).<br><br>In eternity, the insensitivities and injustices of today&#39;s grumpy boss will not matter when we then live in the presence of a God who is perfect in his justice and his mercy. A thousand years from now, today&#39;s soul pain inflicted by a betraying or deserting spouse will be gone. A thousand years from now, if one has been misrepresented or misunderstood, the resentment will be gone. So much depends, therefore, upon our maintaining gospel perspective in the midst of ordinariness and the pressures of temptation, tribulation, and deprivation. As we come to love the Lord more and more, we can understand, rather than resent, his purposes. He who should know has said that there is no other way. Besides, when the Savior urged even his closest disciples to "settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you" (JST Luke 14:28), he spoke of the high cost of discipleship, "signifying there should not any man follow him, unless he was able to continue" (JST Luke 14:31). Clearly Jesus was underscoring the importance of having his followers become thoroughly grounded in the gospel, rooted in resolve, established in their expectations about life, and settled in their devotion to the Savior. May we so become I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<br>
<br>
I am going to speak this morning about revelation. Revelation is communication from God to man. It can occur in many different ways. Some prophets, like Moses and Joseph Smith, have talked with God face to face. Some persons have had personal communication with angels. Other revelations have come, as Elder James E. Talmage described it, "through the dreams of sleep or in the waking visions of the mind" (<i>Articles of Faith,</i>p. 229). Inits more familiar forms, revelation or inspiration comes by means of words or thoughts communicated to the mind (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2-3?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 8:2‚Äì3</a></span>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.10?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enos 1:10</a></span>), by sudden enlightenment (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6.14-15?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 6:14‚Äì15</a></span>), by positive or negative feelings about proposed courses of action, or even by inspiring performances, as inthe performing arts, the beautiful music weheard at the beginning of this devotional assembly being a notable example. As Elder Boyd K. Packer has stated, "Inspiration comes more as a feeling than as a sound" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/11/prayers-and-answers?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Prayers and Answers,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1979, p. 19</a></span>).<br><br>Assuming you are familiar with these different forms of revelation or inspiration, Ihave chosen to discuss this subject in terms ofa different classification--the purpose of the communication. I can identify eight different purposes served by communication from God: (1) to testify; (2) to prophesy; (3) to comfort; (4)to uplift; (5) to inform; (6) to restrain; (7) to confirm; and (8) to impel. I will describe each of these in that order, giving examples.<br><br>My purpose in suggesting this classification and in giving these examples is to persuade each of you to search your own experience and to conclude that you have already received revelations and that you can receive more revelations because communication from God to men and women is a reality. President Lorenzo Snow declared that it is "the grand privilege of every Latter-day Saint . . . to have the manifestations of the spirit every day of our lives" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://archive.org/details/conferencereport1899sa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>CR,</i>April 1899, p. 52</a></span>). President Harold B. Lee taught:<br><br><i>Every man has the privilege to exercise these gifts and these privileges in the conduct of his own affairs; in bringing up his children in the way they should go; in the management of his business, or whatever he does. It is his right to enjoy the spirit of revelation and of inspiration to do the right thing, to be wise and prudent, just and good, in everything that he does.</i>[<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974), p. 141‚Äì42]<br><br>As I review the following eight purposes of revelation, I hope you will recognize the extent to which you have already received revelation or inspiration and resolve to cultivate this spiritual gift for more frequent use in the future.<br><h2><b>Purposes of Revelation</b></h2><br>1. The<i>testimony</i>or witness of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ and that the gospel is true is a revelation from God. When the apostle Peter affirmed that Jesus Christ was the Son of the living God, the Savior called him blessed, "for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is heaven" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.17?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 16:17</a></span>). This precious revelation can be part of the personal experience of every seeker after truth and, once received, becomes a pole star to guide in all the activities of life.<br><br>2.<i>Prophecy</i>is another purpose or function of revelation. Speaking under the influence of the Holy Ghost and within the limits of his or her stewardship, a person may be inspired to predict what will come to pass in the future. This is the office of the Prophet, Seer and Revelator, who prophesies for the Church, as Joseph Smith prophesied the Civil War (D&amp;amp;C 87) and foretold that the Saints would become a mighty people in the Rocky Mountains. Prophecy is part of the calling of a patriarch. Each of us isprivileged to receive prophetic revelation illuminating future events in our lives, like aChurch calling we are to receive. To cite another example, after our fifth child was born, my wife and I did not have any more children. After more than ten years, we concluded that our family would not be any larger, which grieved us. Then one day, while my wife was in the temple, the Spirit whispered to her that she would have another child. That prophetic revelation was fulfilled a year and a half later with the birth of our sixth child, for whom we had waited thirteen years.<br><br>3. A third purpose of revelation is to give<i>comfort.</i>Such a revelation came to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. After many months in deplorable conditions, he cried out in agony and loneliness, pleading with the Lord to remember the persecuted Saints. The comforting answer came:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7-8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 121:7‚Äì8</a></span>]<br><br>In that same revelation the Lord declared that, no matter what tragedies or injustices should befall the Prophet, "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 122:7</a></span>).<br><br>Each of us knows of other examples of revelations of comfort. Some have been comforted by visions of departed loved ones or by feeling their presence. The widow of a good friend told me how she had felt the presence of her departed husband, giving her assurance of his love and concern for her. Others have been comforted in adjusting to the loss ofa job orabusiness advantage or even a marriage. Arevelation of comfort can also come in connection with a blessing of the priesthood, either from the words spoken or from the feeling communicated in connection with theblessing.<br><br>Another type of comforting revelation is the assurance received that a sin has been forgiven. After praying fervently for an entire day and night, a Book of Mormon prophet recorded that he heard a voice, which said, "Thy sins areforgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed."<br><br>"Wherefore," Enos wrote, "my guilt was swept away" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/enos/1.5-6?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enos 1:5‚Äì6</a></span>; also see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61.2?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 61:2</a>). This assurance, which comes when a person has completed all the steps of repentance, gives assurance that the price has been paid, that God has heard the repentant sinner, and that his or her sins are forgiven. Alma described that moment as a time when he wasno longer "harrowed up by the memory" of his sins.<br><br><i>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy . . . there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.19-21?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma 36:19‚Äì21</a>]<br><br>4. Closely related to the feeling of comfort isthe fourth purpose or function of revelation, to<i>uplift</i>. At some time in our lives, each of us needs to be lifted up from a depression, from a sense of foreboding or inadequacy, or just from a plateau of spiritual mediocrity. Because it raises our spirits and helps us resist evil and seek good, I believe that the feeling of uplift that is communicated by reading the scriptures or by enjoying wholesome music, art, or literature is a distinct purpose of revelation.<br><br>5. The fifth purpose of revelation is to<i>inform.</i>This may consist of inspiration giving a person the words to speak on a particular occasion, such as in the blessings pronounced by a patriarch or in sermons or other words spoken under the influence of the Holy Ghost. The Lord commanded Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to lift up their voices and speak the thoughts that he would put in their hearts,<br><br><i>For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/100.5-6?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 100:5‚Äì6</a>; see also <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.85?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84:85</a>; <span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.97?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">124:97</a>]</span><br><br>On some sacred occasions, information has been given by face-to-face conversations with heavenly personages, such as in the visions related in ancient and modern scriptures. In other circumstances, needed information is communicated by the quiet whisperings of the Spirit. A child loses a treasured possession, prays for help, and is inspired to find it; an adult has a problem at work, at home, or in genealogical research, prays, and is led to the information necessary to resolve it; a Church leader prays to know whom the Lord would have him call to fill a position, and the Spirit whispers a name. In all of these examples--familiar to each of us--the Holy Ghost acts in his office as a teacher and revelator, communicating information and truths for the edification and guidance of the recipient.<br><br>Revelation from God serves all five of these purposes: testimony, prophecy, comfort, uplift, and information. I have spoken of them only briefly, giving examples principally from the scriptures. I will speak at greater length about the remaining three purposes of revelation, giving examples from my personal experience.<br><br>6. The sixth type or purpose of revelation is to restrain us from doing something. Thus, in the midst of a great sermon explaining the power of the Holy Ghost, Nephi suddenly declared,<br><br><i>And now I . . . cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.7?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Nephi 32:7</a></span>]<br><br>The revelation that restrains is one of the most common forms of revelation. It often comes by surprise, when we have not asked for revelation or guidance on a particular subject. But if we are keeping the commandments of God and living in tune with his Spirit, a restraining force will steer us away from things we should notdo.<br><br>One of my first experiences in being restrained by the Spirit came soon after I was called as a counselor in a stake presidency in Chicago. In one of our first presidency meetings, our stake president made a proposal that our new stake center be built in a particular location. I immediately saw four or five good reasons why that was the wrong location. When asked for my counsel, I opposed the proposal, giving each of those reasons. The stake president wisely proposed that each of us consider the matter prayerfully for another week and discuss it further in our next meeting. Almost perfunctorily I prayed about the subject and immediately received a strong impression that I was wrong, that I was standing in the way of the Lord's will, and that I should remove myself from opposition to it. Needless to say, Iwas restrained and promptly gave my approval to the proposed construction. Incidentally, the wisdom of constructing the stake center in that location was soon evident, even to me. My reasons to the contrary turned out to be shortsighted, and I was soon grateful to have been restrained from relying on them.<br><br>Several years ago I picked up the desk pen in my office at BYU to sign a paper that had been prepared for my signature, something I did at least a dozen times each day. That document committed the university to a particular course of action we had decided to follow. All the staff work had been done, and all appeared to be in order. But as I went to sign the document, I was filled with such negative thoughts and forebodings that I put it to one side and asked for the entire matter to be reviewed again. It was, and within a few days additional facts came to light which showed that the proposed course of action would have caused the university serious problems in the future.<br><br>On another occasion, the Spirit came to myassistance as I was editing a casebook on alegal subject. A casebook consists of several hundred court opinions, together with explanatory material and text written by the editor. My assistant and I had finished all of the work on the book, including the necessary research to assure that these court opinions hadnot been reversed or overruled. Just beforesending it to the publisher, I was leafing through the manuscript, and a particular court opinion caught my attention. As I looked at it, Ihad a profoundly uneasy feeling. I asked my assistant to check that opinion again to see if everything was in order. He did and reported that it was. In a subsequent check of the completed manuscript, I was again stopped at that case, again with a great feeling of uneasiness. This time I went to the law library myself. There, in some newly received publications, I discovered that this case had just been reversed on appeal. If that opinion had been published in my casebook, it would have been a serious professional embarrassment. I was saved by the restraining power of revelation.<br><br>7. Seventh. A common way to seek revelation is to propose a particular course of action and then pray for inspiration to<i>confirm</i>it. The Lord explained the confirming type of revelation when Oliver Cowdery failed in his efforts to translate the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</i><i> But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me ifit be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i>[<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7-8?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 9:7‚Äì8</a></span>]<br><br>Similarly, the prophet Alma likens the word ofGod to a seed and tells persons studying the gospel that if they will give place for the seed to be planted in their hearts, the seed will enlarge their souls and enlighten their understanding and begin to be delicious to them (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma 32</a>). That feeling is the Holy Ghost's confirming revelation of the truth of the word.<br><br>When he spoke on the BYU campus some years ago on the subject "Agency or Inspiration," Elder Bruce R. McConkie stressed our responsibility to do all that we can before we seek a revelation. He gave a very personal example. When he set out to choose a companion for eternity, he did not go to the Lord and ask whom he ought to marry. "I went out and found the girl I wanted," he said. "She suited me; . . . it just seemed . . . as though this ought to be. . . . [Then] all I did was pray to the Lord and ask for some guidance and direction in connection with the decision that I'd reached" (<i>Speeches of the Year,</i>1972‚Äì73 [Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1973], p.111).<br><br>Elder McConkie summarized his counsel on the balance between agency and inspiration in these sentences:<br><br><i>We're expected to use the gifts and talents and abilities, the sense and judgment and agency with which we are endowed</i>[p. 108]. . . .<br><br><i>Implicit in asking in faith is the precedent requirement that we do everything in our power to accomplish the goal that we seek</i>[p. 110]. . . .<br><br><i>We're expected to do everything in our power that we can, and then to seek an answer from the Lord, a confirming seal that we've reached the right conclusion</i>[p. 113].<br><br>As a Regional Representative, I was privileged to work with four different members of the Council of the Twelve and with other General Authorities as they sought revelation in connection with the calling of stake presidents. All proceeded in the same manner. They interviewed persons residing in the stake--counselors in the stake presidency, members of the high council, bishops, and others who had gained special experience in Church administration--asking them questions and hearing their counsel. As these interviews were conducted, the servants of the Lord gave prayerful consideration to each person interviewed and mentioned. Finally, they reached a tentative decision on the new stake president. This proposal was then prayerfully submitted to the Lord. If it was confirmed, the call was issued. Ifit was not confirmed, or if they were restrained, that proposal was tabled, and the process continued until a new proposal was formed and the confirming revelation was received.<br><br>Sometimes confirming and restraining revelations are combined. For example, during my service at BYU, I was invited to give a speech before a national association of attorneys. Because it would require many days to prepare, this was the kind of speaking invitation Ihad routinely declined. But as I began to dictate a letter declining this particular invitation, I felt restrained. I paused and reconsidered my action. I then considered how I might accept the invitation, and as I came to consider it in that light, I felt the confirming assurance of the Spirit and knew that this was what I must do. The speech that resulted, "A Private University Looks at Government Regulation," opened the door to a host of important opportunities. I was invited to repeat that same speech before several other nationally prominent groups. It was published in<i>Vital Speeches</i>, in a professional journal, and in several other periodicals and books, from which it was used as a leading statement of the private university's interest infreedom from government regulation. This speech led to BYU's being consulted by various church groups on the proper relationship between government and a church-related college. These consultations in turn contributed to the formation of a national organization of church-related colleges and universities that has provided a significant coalition to oppose unlawful or unwise government regulation. Ihave no doubt, as I look back on the event, that this speaking invitation I almost declined was one of those occasions when a seemingly insignificant act made a great deal of difference. Those are the times when it is vital for us to receive the guidance of the Lord, and those are the times when revelation will come to aid us if we hear and heed it.<br><br>8. The eighth purpose or type of revelation consists of those instances when the Spirit<i>impels</i>a person to action. This is not a case where a person proposes to take a particular action and the Spirit either restrains or confirms. This is a case where revelation comes when it is not being sought and impels some action not proposed. This type of revelation is obviously less common than other types, but its rarity makes it all the more significant.<br><br>A scriptural example is recorded in the first book of Nephi. When Nephi was in Jerusalem to obtain the precious records from the treasury, the Spirit of the Lord directed him to kill Laban as he lay drunk in the street. This act was so far from Nephi's heart that he recoiled and wrestled with the Spirit, but he was again directed to slay Laban, and he finally followed that revelation (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Nephi 4</a>).<br><br>Students of Church history will recall Wilford Woodruff's account of an impression that came to him in the night telling him to move his carriage and mules away from a large tree. He did so, and his family and livestock were saved when the tree crashed to the ground in a tornado that struck 30 minutes later (see Matthias F. Cowley,<i>Wilford Woodruff: History of His Life and Labors</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964], pp. 331‚Äì32).<br><br>As a young girl, my grandmother, Chasty Olsen Harris, had a similar experience. She wastending some children who were playing in a dry riverbed near their home in Castle Dale, Utah. Suddenly she heard a voice that called her by name and directed her to get the children out of the riverbed and up on the bank. It was a clear day, and there was no sign of rain. She saw no reason to heed the voice and continued to play. The voice spoke to her again, urgently. This time she heeded the warning. Quickly gathering the children, she made a run for the bank. Just as they reached it, an enormous wall of water, originating with a cloudburst in the mountains many miles away, swept down the canyon and roared across where the children had played. Except for this impelling revelation, she and the children would have been lost.<br><br>For nine years Professor Marvin Hill and Ihad worked on the book<i>Carthage Conspiracy,</i>which concerns the 1845 court trial of the murderers of Joseph Smith. We had several different sources of minutes on the trial, some bearing their authors' names and others unsigned. The fullest set of minutes was unsigned, but because we had located them inthe Church Historian's Office, we were sure they were the minutes kept by George Watt, the Church's official scribe who was sent to record the proceedings of the trial. We so stated in seven drafts of our manuscript, and we analyzed all our sources on that assumption.<br><br>Finally, the book was completed, and within a few weeks the final manuscript would be sent to the publisher. As I sat in my office at BYU one Saturday afternoon, I felt impelled to go through a pile of unexamined books and pamphlets accumulated on the table behind my desk. At the very bottom of the pile of 50 or60 publications, I found a printed catalog of the contents of the Wilford C. Wood Museum, which Professor LaMar Berrett, the author, had sent to me a year and a half earlier. As I quickly flipped through the pages of this catalog of Church history manuscripts, my eyes fell on apage describing the manuscript of the trial minutes we had attributed to George Watt. This catalog page told how Wilford Wood had purchased the original of that set of minutes in Illinois and had given the Church a typewritten version, the same version we had obtained from the Church Historian. We immediately visited the Wilford Wood Museum in Woods Cross, Utah, and obtained additional information which enabled us to determine that the minutes we had thought were the official Church source had been prepared by one of the lawyers for the defense. With this knowledge, we returned to the Church Historian's Office and were able to locate for the first time George Watt's official and highly authentic set of minutes on the trial. This discovery saved us from a grievous error in the identification of one of our major sources and also permitted us to enrich the contents of our book significantly. The impression I received that day in my office was a cherished example of the way the Lord will help us in our righteous professional pursuits when we qualify for the impressions of his Spirit.<br><br>I had another choice experience with impelling revelation a few months after I began my service at BYU. As a new and inexperienced president, I had many problems to analyze and many decisions to reach. I was very dependent on the Lord. One day in October, I drove up Provo Canyon to ponder a particular problem. Although alone and without any interruption, I found myself unable to think ofthe problem at hand. Another pending issue I was not yet ready to consider kept thrusting itself into my mind: Should we modify BYU's academic calendar to complete the Fall Semester before Christmas? After ten or fifteen minutes of unsuccessful efforts to exclude thoughts of this subject, I finally realized what was happening. The issue of the calendar did not seem timely to me, and I was certainly not seeking any guidance on it, but the Spirit was trying to communicate with me on that subject. I immediately turned my full attention to that question and began to record my thoughts on apiece of paper. Within a few minutes, I had recorded the details of a three-semester calendar, with all of its powerful advantages. Hurrying back to the campus, I reviewed it with my colleagues and found them enthusiastic. A few days later the Board of Trustees approved our proposed new calendar, and we published its dates, barely in time to make them effective in the fall of 1972. Since that time, I have reread these words of the Prophet Joseph Smith and realized that I had the experience he described:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas . . . and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation.</i>[<i>Teachings</i>, p. 151]<br><h2><b>Revelations Not Received</b></h2><br>I have now described eight different purposes or types of revelation: (1) testifying, (2) prophesying, (3) comforting, (4) uplifting, (5) informing, (6) restraining, (7) confirming, and (8) impelling. Each of these refers to revelations that are received. Before concluding I will suggest a few ideas about revelations that are<i>not</i>received.<br><br>First, we should understand what can be called the principle of "stewardship in revelation." Our Heavenly Father's house is a house of order, where his servants are commanded to "act in the office in which [they are] appointed" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.99?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D&amp;amp;C 107:99</a></span>). This principle applies to revelation. Only the president of the Church receives revelation to guide the entire Church. Only the stake president receives revelation for the special guidance of the stake. The person who receives revelation for the ward is the bishop. For a family, it is the priesthood leadership of the family. Leaders receive revelation for their own stewardships. Individuals can receive revelation to guide their own lives. But when one person purports to receive revelation for another person outside his or her own stewardship--such as a Church member who claims tohave revelation to guide the entire Church ora person who claims to have a revelation to guide another person over whom he or she has no presiding authority according to the order of the Church--you can be sure that such revelations are not from the Lord. "There are counterfeit signals" (<span style="color: #33cccc;"><a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1979/10/prayers-and-answers?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boyd K. Packer, "Prayers and Answers,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1979, p. 20</a></span>). Satan is a great deceiver, and he is the source of some of these spurious revelations. Others are simply imagined.<br><br>If a revelation is outside the limits of stewardship, you know it is not from the Lord, and you are not bound by it. I have heard of cases where a young man told a young woman she should marry him because he had received a revelation that she was to be his eternal companion. If this is a true revelation, it will be confirmed directly to the woman if she seeks to know. In the meantime, she is under no obligation to heed it. She should seek her own guidance and make up her own mind. The man can receive revelation to guide his own actions, but he cannot properly receive revelation to direct hers. She is outside his stewardship.<br><br>What about those times when we seek revelation and do not receive it? We do not always receive inspiration or revelation when we request it. Sometimes we are delayed in the receipt of revelation, and sometimes we are left to our own judgment. We cannot force spiritual things. It must be so. Our life's purpose to obtain experience and to develop faith would be frustrated if our Heavenly Father directed us in every act, even in every important act. We must make decisions and experience the consequences in order to develop self-reliance and faith.<br><br>Even in decisions we think very important, we sometimes receive no answers to our prayers. This does not mean that our prayers have not been heard. It only means that we have prayed about a decision which, for one reason or another, we should make without guidance by revelation. Perhaps we have asked for guidance in choosing between alternatives that are equally acceptable or equally unacceptable. I suggest that there is<i>not</i>a right and wrong to<i>every</i>question. To many questions, there are only two wrong answers or two right answers. Thus, a person who seeks guidance on which of two different ways he should pursue to get even with a person who has wronged him is not likely to receive a revelation. Neither is a person who seeks guidance on a choice he will never have to make because some future event will intervene, such as a third alternative that is clearly preferable. On one occasion, my wife and I prayed earnestly for guidance on a decision that seemed very important. No answer came. We were left to proceed on our own best judgment. We could not imagine why the Lord had not aided us with a confirming or restraining impression. But it was not long before we learned that we did not have to make a decision on that question because something else happened that made a decision unnecessary. The Lord would not guide us in a selection that made no difference.<br><br>No answer is likely to come to a person who seeks guidance in choosing between two alternatives that are equally acceptable to the Lord. Thus, there are times when we can serve productively in two different fields of labor. Either answer is right. Similarly, the Spirit of the Lord is not likely to give us revelations on matters that are trivial. I once heard a young woman in testimony meeting praise the spirituality of her husband, indicating that he submitted every question to the Lord. She told how he accompanied her shopping and would not even choose between different brands of canned vegetables without making his selection a matter of prayer. That strikes me as improper. I believe the Lord expects us to use the intelligence and experience he has given us to make these kinds of choices. When a member asked the Prophet Joseph Smith for advice on a particular matter, the Prophet stated:<br><br><i>It is a great thing to inquire at the hands of God, orto come into His presence: and we feel fearful to approach Him on subjects that are of little or no consequence.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 22]<br><br>Of course we are not always able to judge what is trivial. If a matter appears of little or no consequence, we can proceed on the basis of our own judgment. If the choice is important for reasons unknown to us, such as the speaking invitation I mentioned earlier or even a choice between two cans of vegetables when one contains a hidden poison, the Lord will intervene and give us guidance. When a choice will make a real difference in our lives--obvious or not--and when we are living in tune with the Spirit and seeking his guidance, we can be sure we will receive the guidance we need to attain our goal. The Lord will not leave us unassisted when a choice is important to our eternal welfare.<br><br>I know that God lives and that revelation tohis children is a reality. I pray that we will be worthy and willing, and that he will bless us to grow in this principle of revelation. I bear you my testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>ry Experiences - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I&#39;m very happy to greet all of you wonderful students here this morning and your leaders, and I understand that you have a group of missionaries here, as you did a year ago when I spoke at a devotional; so being a missionary, I decided, when I was trying to decide what to speak about this morning, to tell you some of my mission experiences. I think that you&#39;ll get more out of that than if I tried to discuss any particular subject or principle of the gospel. If you don&#39;t think I could, read the books I&#39;ve written, and you&#39;ll know that I could.<br><br>First, I started way back in 1905 when I went on my first mission to Holland. My cousin and I rode together until we reached Liverpool, then he was sent up into Norway, the Land of the Midnight Sun, and I was sent into Holland. After we had been in the mission field a few months, I received a letter from him calling me by name, and he said, "I met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I&#39;ve ever dreamed of knowing, and I told him if he had something better than I had, I&#39;d join his church."<br><br>So I wrote him back and called him by name, and I said, "If he has something better than you have, you<i>ought</i>to join his church, but does he have something better than a personal visitation to this earth after centuries of darkness by God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ to usher in the dispensation of the fullness of times and to reveal the real personalities of God and his Son Jesus Christ? Does he have something better than the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, which gives us the history of God&#39;s dealings with his prophets in this land of America over a period of a thousand years? Does he have something better than the coming back to this earth of John the Baptist, who was beheaded for his testimony of Jesus, to restore the Aaronic Priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins? Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John, who were upon the Mount of Transfiguration with the Savior and returned to this earth to restore the holy priesthood, the power of the apostleship, the power to organize the church and kingdom of God upon the earth? Does he have something better than the coming of Moses with the keys of the gathering of latter-day Israel? Does he have something better than the coming of Elijah the prophet, of whose coming Malachi testified that before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, the Lord would send Elijah the prophet to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers, lest he come and smite the whole earth with a curse? Now that&#39;s an important mission." I said, "If he has something better than that, you ought to join his church."<br><br>I tell the missionaries that, if you learn how to tell our story, you never need to argue with anybody. You tell them things they&#39;ve never heard of, and you prove them out of the Lord&#39;s holy scriptures.<br><br>When I was president of the Southern States Mission, I preached a sermon down in Quitman, Georgia, on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I quoted from Rulon Howell&#39;s book<i>Do Men Believe What Their Churches Prescribe?</i>Along one side he has the names of all the important subjects and across the top the names of various large churches of the world. I read from that book. Not one of the major churches believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. As the meeting closed, I stood at the door shaking hands with the people who were there. A man came up and introduced himself as a Baptist minister, and I said, "Did I misquote you here tonight?"<br><br>"No, Mr. Richards," he said. "It&#39;s like you say; we don&#39;t all believe all the things that our churches teach."<br><br>I said, "You don&#39;t believe them either. Why don&#39;t you go back and teach your people the truth. They&#39;ll take it from you, and they&#39;re not ready to take it from the Mormon elders yet."<br><br>He said, "I&#39;ll see you again."<br><br>I didn&#39;t see him for about four months until I went back to that branch. My coming was announced in the newspaper, and as I walked to that little church, there stood that Baptist minister. As we shook hands, I said, "I&#39;d certainly be interested to know what you thought of my talk the last time I was here."<br><br>He said, "Mr. Richards, I&#39;ve been thinking about it ever since. I believe every word you said, only I&#39;d like to have heard the rest of it." Now you know we never get talked out when we get talking about the principles of the gospel. There was a man occupying a pulpit in the Baptist Church who believed every word I&#39;d said, and yet he couldn&#39;t preach it to his people.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we read about when Lehi was in the desert. He told his son Joseph that the Lord had promised Joseph who was sold into Egypt that in the latter days he would raise up a prophet from his loins whose name would be Joseph and whose father&#39;s name would be Joseph. (Now obviously that was Joseph Smith.) The Lord said about him:<br><br>[That prophet shall]<i>bring forth my word</i>. [2 Nephi 3:11]<br><br>The Prophet Joseph brought us the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and many other writings. He has given us more revealed truth than any other prophet who has ever lived upon the face of the earth as far as our records are concerned. That was written in the Book of Mormon before this Church was ever organized.<br><br>Then he said,<br><br><i>Not to the bringing forth my word only . . . but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.</i>[2 Nephi 3:11]<br><br>What did he mean by that? That in this world, where there are hundreds of different churches preaching men&#39;s interpretation of the scriptures, the Lord would give this new prophet an understanding of the scriptures to reveal them in the spirit in which they were written. Then he said:<br><br><i>For the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</i>[2 Nephi 3:15]<br><br>Why? Because this prophet would be clothed upon by the holy priesthood, the power to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel.<br><br>Then the Lord adds:<br><br><i>And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.</i>[2 Nephi 3:8]<br><br>Whatever the world may think of this prophet of this dispensation, there&#39;s the testimony of the Lord that he shall be great in his eyes.<br><br>Now, referring to the statement about "convincing them of my word which shall have already gone forth among them," I want to tell you of a little experience I had when I was in Holland. I had an invitation from some businessmen to attend one of their Bible classes. They met every week in one of the homes. We met that week in the home of a prominent furniture dealer. There were about 20 men there, and the only woman was the daughter of the man of the house. They gave me an hour and a half to discuss universal salvation, which includes our doctrine of preaching the gospel in the eternal worlds to the spirits that were disobedient here upon the earth and the doctrine of baptism of the living for the dead. So after I had discussed that matter, I just gave them chapter and verse and let them read it in their own copies of the Bible. I figured that they would believe it more if they read it in their Bible; otherwise, they would think that I had a different Bible. When I was through, I laid my Bible on the table and folded my arms and waited for a comment.<br><br>The first comment came from the daughter of the man of the house. She said, "Father, I just can&#39;t understand it. I have never attended one of these Bible classes in my life when you haven&#39;t had the last word to say on everything, and tonight you haven&#39;t said a word."<br><br>He shook his head and said, "My daughter, there isn&#39;t anything to say. This man has been teaching us things we have never heard of, and he&#39;s been teaching them to us out of our own Bible." That&#39;s what the Lord meant when he said that the prophet of this dispensation would not only bring forth his words, but would convince people of his words that had already gone forth among them.<br><br>Along that line, some years ago the congregational and evangelical churches of these western states--California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada--were holding a conference of their leaders and ministers in Salt Lake. The leader of the group wrote a letter to President McKay and asked him if he would send one of the General Authorities of the Church to attend the morning session of their conference and tell them the story of Mormonism, to be their guest for lunch, and to remain for an hour and a half in the afternoon and let them ask questions. I got the assignment, and I don&#39;t mind telling you that I was happy to get it. I tell the missionaries you&#39;ll never need to argue with anybody if you learn how to tell our story and you keep the lead. So when I arrived I said, "Do you want it just the way we got our Church and what we believe?"<br><br>The man in charge said, "That&#39;s just what we want."<br><br>Some of them wanted to get away on earlier planes to the Northwest, so they set the luncheon back half an hour so that they could give me two and a half hours in that morning meeting. I presented our message to them just about the same way that I have presented it in<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, which many of you have read, showing what we got by revelation rather than by reformation. The churches of this world have not been able to agree because they have not understood the scriptures as they have tried to interpret them; and no two of them can agree, so that has brought into the world many churches. But we have a gospel that has come directly from heaven. When I wrote<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, I predicated it on the thought that we are the only Christian church in the world that didn&#39;t get our religion out of the Bible; we got it by revelation from heaven; then we use the Bible to prove that what we have is what we should have.<br><br>After I had presented what we got by revelation (and I&#39;ve already referred to a little of that when I told you about my cousin who was in Norway), I said, "While I was the presiding bishop of the Church, we directed the building program of the Church. We had the plans prepared for the Los Angeles Temple. One day we showed those plans to the First Presidency. We had 84 pages about 4 feet long and 2 1/2 feet wide. We didn&#39;t have the electric plans or the plumbing plans complete, and yet there was that temple built spiritually, and there was not a hole in the ground. You could take those plans and go all over the world and try to fit them to every building in the world, but there&#39;s only one building they would fit, and that&#39;s the Mormon temple in Los Angeles. Of course, you could find buildings that have material in them like the material in that temple, such as lumber, cement, tiling, electrical wiring, and plumbing, but you can&#39;t find any other building in the world that those plans will fit except the Mormon temple in Los Angeles."<br><br>Then I held up the Bible and said, "Here&#39;s the Lord&#39;s blueprint. Isaiah said the Lord had declared the end from the beginning. It&#39;s all here when you know how to understand it. Isaiah said,<br><br><i>The grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shall stand forever.</i>[40:8]<br><br>You could take this, the Lord&#39;s blueprint, and try to fit it to every church in this world, but there&#39;s only one church that it will fit, and that&#39;s The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Of course, you can find other churches that have some of the same things in them like are in this blueprint, but you can&#39;t find any other church that this, the Lord&#39;s blueprint, will fit."<br><br>Then I said, "Now, I&#39;ll proceed to illustrate to you what I mean. In Farrar&#39;s<i>Life of Christ</i>, he said there were two passages in the New Testament for which he could find no excuse. The first was John 10:16, where Jesus said,<br><br><i>Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</i><br><br>I said, "Do any of you men know why that is in the Bible?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Do any of you know any church in the world that does know why it&#39;s in the Bible?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Well, we know all about it." Then I tied it to what I&#39;d told them about the promise of Moses to Joseph who was sold into Egypt of a new land separated from his brethren in the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, and, describing that land, Moses used the word<i>precious</i>five times in just four little verses (see Deuteronomy 33:13‚Äì16).<br><br>"Do any of you know where the land of Joseph is?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Do any of you know where any church in the world that does know where it is?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Well, we know all about it," I said. "It&#39;s the land of America." And then I led up to where the Lord commanded Ezekiel that the two records should be kept, one of Judah and his followers, the house of Israel, and one of Joseph and his followers, the house of Israel, and in the days of their children--that is in the latter days--when they would say,<br><br><i>Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?</i><br><br><i>Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand</i>. [Ezekiel 37:18‚Äì19]<br><br>"Do any of you," I said, "know where that stick or record of Joseph is that the Lord commanded should be written?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Well, we know all about it; it&#39;s the Book of Mormon. And when you get the Book of Mormon, you read about when Jesus visited his people here in the land of America, when he told them that they were the other sheep of whom he spoke to his disciples in Jerusalem. He said never at any time had the Lord commanded him to tell his disciples who the other sheep were, only that he had other sheep that were not of that fold." See how beautifully the scriptures fit together when you understand them?<br><br>The second passage that Canon Farrar couldn&#39;t understand is 1 Corinthians 15:29, where Paul said:<br><br><i>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</i><br><br>I said, "Do any of you know why that is in the Bible?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Do any of you know of any church in the world that does know why that&#39;s in the Bible?"<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"Well, we know all about it." Then I told them that Peter said that Jesus was<br><br><i>put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</i><br><br><i>By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</i><br><br><i>Which sometime were disobedient . . . in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</i>[1 Peter 3:18‚Äì20]<br><br>"Now," I said, "obviously if Jesus preached to them, his gospel was faith, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. And since you can&#39;t baptize a spirit in water, the Lord had to give them a vicarious baptism of the living for the dead so that holy and sacred ordinance could be performed for them." I went on to point out that Peter said,<br><br><i>For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</i>[1 Peter 4:6]<br><br>That helps you to understand what Jesus meant when he said:<br><br><i>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</i>[John 5:25]<br><br>The world has interpreted that to mean those who are dead in sin, but Jesus amplified it by saying:<br><br><i>Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice.</i>[John 5:28]<br><br>See how beautifully that fits together?<br><br>Then I gave those men some more passages concerning the kingdom that God was to set up in the latter days and the heavens that were to receive the Christ until the restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began and then the angel that was to bring the gospel in the latter days to be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; and in each one I would say, "Do you know why these passages are in the scripture as part of the Lord&#39;s blueprint? Do you know any church in the world that claims that these things have been fulfilled?" Do you see how beautifully the gospel and all these beautiful fulfillments of the words of the holy prophets fit together?<br><br>Toward the close of my remarks, the man in charge said, "Now, Mr. Richards, we&#39;ve heard it said that you believe God has a wife. Would you explain that to us?" I think he thought he had me over a barrel or in a corner that I couldn&#39;t get out of.<br><br>Rather facetiously I said, "Well, I don&#39;t see how in the world God could have a son without a wife, do you?" They all began to twitter, and I didn&#39;t have any trouble with that question.<br><br>Those ministers and church leaders wanted to have an hour and a half to ask questions, and after they had listened to me for two and a half hours, I got that one question from them, and that was the only one. The man in charge said when I left them, "Mr. Richards, this has been one of the most interesting experiences of my entire life." No wonder Isaiah said it would be a marvelous work and a wonder. That&#39;s what it is to me, and that&#39;s what every missionary ought to make it be to those who are yet in darkness.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ll tell you a little experience. I had a debate with a minister in Amsterdam when I was on my first mission. One of the Saints invited me to come to her home. She wanted to invite her neighbor in and let me preach the gospel to her. When my companion and I went to that home, the neighbor was there, but she brought her minister with her. Well, we had a little difference of opinion on the discussion of the priesthood, and right there he challenged me for a debate in his church. I was young and had a lot of umph in me, and I accepted the challenge. We were not advised in those days not to debate.<br><br>When we arrived in his church on Saturday night according to our appointment, that church was full. All of his people were there, and all of our people were there. I didn&#39;t know how our people found it out; I didn&#39;t tell them. He stood up and said, "Now inasmuch as Mr. Richards is a guest in our church, we&#39;ll accord him the privilege of opening the debate. We&#39;ll each talk for twenty minutes and continue as long as it is mutually agreeable. Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Richards?"<br><br>I said, "Very much so." I didn&#39;t tell him, but I would have given him the shirt off my back for the privilege of opening that debate, and he just handed it to me on a silver platter. I didn&#39;t know whether the Lord had anything to do with that or not, but I always thought he did.<br><br>I stood up and said, "The last time I talked to my friend here, we had a difference of opinion on the principle of priesthood. I&#39;ve come here tonight prepared to discuss that subject, but I don&#39;t propose to start at that point. If you were going to build a house, you wouldn&#39;t try to put the roof on it until you got the foundation in because if a foundation were faulty, it wouldn&#39;t do you any good to put the roof on because the house would fall. I propose to open this debate by laying the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I choose for my text the sixth chapter of Hebrews where Paul said:<br><br><i>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</i>[Hebrews 6:1‚Äì2]<br><br>I hurried over faith and repentance because I thought they believed them. I spiked down baptism by immersion for the remission of sins until everybody in the audience was giving me approval. Then I came to the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. They didn&#39;t believe that. They thought the Holy Ghost came just like the breezes that blow over your head. You remember when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God through the preaching of Philip. They sent Peter and John to them, and when they came, they prayed for those men. They laid their lands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. And when Simon the sorcerer saw that the Holy Ghost was conveyed by the laying on of the apostle&#39;s hands, he offered them money, saying:<br><br><i>Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou has thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</i>[Acts 8:19‚Äì20]<br><br>Then I gave another reference or two about the laying on of hands out of the Bible and sat down. "My friend" stood up. He never mentioned a word I&#39;d said. He started on the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the Golden Bible and the fact that Joseph Smith admitted that he&#39;d made many mistakes, and then he turned to me and said, "Now if Mr. Richards will explain these matters, this audience will be most appreciative."<br><br>I was on my feet just like that. (My companion said, "How did you think so fast?" and I said, "What have you been praying for all week?") I stood on my feet and said, "In the days of the Savior, his enemies tried to trick him with cunningness and craftiness. I don&#39;t suppose there is anybody here today that would like to see us resort to those old tactics. This friend of mine offered me the courtesy of opening this debate as a guest in his church, and now he wants to steal from me the very courtesy that he extended me, and I don&#39;t propose to let him do it. So, my friend, you may have your twenty minutes over again."<br><br>He couldn&#39;t do it, and he knew he couldn&#39;t. His wife stood up in the audience and said, "What Mr. Richards is asking is fair; you ought to answer him." Even then he couldn&#39;t do it.<br><br>I said to my companion, "Stand up and give me my coat and hat." It was wintertime. I said, "I am willing to remain here till 10 o&#39;clock tomorrow morning, when I have to be in my own church, provided this debate can go forward on the basis that you set up, but if not, I&#39;m going to leave and ask my companion to leave and ask our Saints to leave, and we&#39;ll leave it to you to settle with your people what&#39;s happened here tonight." He still couldn&#39;t do it, so we all walked out on him. I met him on the street time and time again after that, and he always ducked his head so he wouldn&#39;t have to speak to me.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, as you&#39;ve listened to me this morning, I think you can understand why I tell our missionaries you never need to argue with anybody if you learn the sweetest story that has been told in this world since the resurrection of the Christ. It is true, and that is my testimony to you. I pray God to help you to do your part to share it with those who are yet in darkness, and I leave you my love and blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 20 October 1981.</i><br><br><i>¬© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ness‚ÄîSelfishness - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
When I was a student here, I used to attend the devotionals and listen to great men give powerful messages. I couldn't imagine how they could possibly do it. I still can't imagine it.<br><br>I received a call to serve as a missionary, and after my mission I had a military obligation. I married and began to raise a family and never did get back to complete my formal education. I believe it is possible for a person to become educated without necessarily being schooled, but I have grieved over the fact that I was not able to get more formal education. I have struggled with a compensatory effort to overcome that problem. I have not always succeeded, and in many ways I am still unschooled. If it were not for the powers of heaven helping to educate me, it would be most difficult to carry on with my assignments. I recommend education to you with all my heart and congratulate you for being here.<br><br>If you will be attentive and patient, I will attempt to convey some thoughts that have come to me.<br><h2><b>Presentation of the Plan</b></h2><br>If the veil that covers our remembrance and view of our pre-earthly past were somehow lifted, we would see ourselves in that glorious assembly where our Eternal Father presented to us the plan for our salvation and exaltation.<br><br>How long it took I do not know, the time doesn't matter. What matters is that it really happened. It must have been a most interesting time. I suppose there were some anxious moments as one thing built upon another. There must have been intense emotion--the anticipation, the waiting for the next part to unfold, the pondering and discussion. Father was about his work teaching us how to exercise our agency by unfolding truth to our understanding.<br><br>As these truths unfolded, there must have been many questions and concerns on our part--the creation of the earth, our leaving Father's presence, our need for physical bodies, the veil, living by faith, symbolic ordinances, death and the resurrection, the conditions upon which our return to Father would be based.<br><br>We must have understood some very basic principles then. We must have been able to see that all living things are designed to reproduce after their own kind, that as children of an eternal Father, the seed of a God, if you will, it is our nature to grow and develop into eternal beings with the potential to become as he is.<br><br>There must have been anxiety on our part when we learned of the need to leave our Father and come to this earth, having the veil of forgetfulness cover our minds. How would we know what to do and how to do it? And then there would be opposition, choices to make, and the possibility of mistakes and failure.<br><br>It must have been a great comfort as Father made covenants with us to send one of his counselors as a guide and companion, one of his counselors with delegated power to communicate the truths of the plan to us, that by the power of spiritual communication we could know how to make correct decisions and understand how to act so as to grow and mature after the nature of the species of our Father, who is a God. We know this great counselor as the Holy Ghost.<br><br>A pattern begins to unfold as the Father taught us. It must have been obvious that there would be many things that we could not do for ourselves. Someone would have to serve us. It would not be possible for us to create or control after its creation this world upon which we were to be placed. It would be a delicate environment--its relationship to the sun, the need for rain and fertile soil to sustain life, the governing laws of gravity and electricity, the elements and their reaction and interaction with each other. We would have no control of these things. Someone would have to control them for us.<br><br>A sense of calmness and peace with the Father's plan must have come to us as he made covenants to give us his other counselor, who would have power to do all these things for us that we could not do for ourselves. We would not be able to provide for ourselves the physical bodies we would need to become like Father. Someone would need to serve us by being parents--mothers and fathers. We would not have power during our infancy to sustain ourselves. Someone would have to serve us. The basic unit to provide the service, the family, was outlined to our understanding and put into place in our behalf.<br><br>We learned that the physical bodies we would receive would be temporary and would be subject to weakness, disease, and finally death. If we were to return to Father with bodies like his--glorified, sanctified, celestialized bodies--someone would have to do something for us, something we could not do for ourselves, something that would reunite our spirit bodies with a physical body after the pattern in which God our Father created us.<br><br>There were some other serious needs. It was clear to us that, because of the influence of opposition, we would make mistakes. Since Father taught us that these mistakes constituted sin, and that sin could not be tolerated by him, and that no sinful thing could return to his presence, we were faced with a dilemma. There would have to be a way to overcome these mistakes. Someone would have to intercede for us. The need for a redeemer became very clear. Who would it be?<br><h2><b>Two Volunteers</b></h2><br>It was then that Satan came before the Father and issued the most selfish of all statements ever spoken in the heavens.<br><br><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i>[Moses 4:1]<br><br>It was then that the most selfless of all service in the heavens or upon earth was offered as Christ the "Beloved Son, which was ... Beloved and chosen from the beginning" came before the Father and said,<br><br><i>Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</i>[Moses 4:2]<br><br>By holy covenant between Father and us as his children, Jesus Christ was sent to serve us in all things, to do all things for us that we cannot do for ourselves. The laws and the covenants were clear to us. They required that we come to this earth to work through the natural process of growth and maturing that will take us back to Father to be like him and to live the type of life he lives.<br><h2><b>Serving and Being Served</b></h2><br>We are to work through this process. The work is one of serving and being served. The pattern is clear. Happiness in this life can be obtained only by establishing the proper balance between serving and being served. We are social beings. We cannot live in happiness if we attempt to live alone. Self-imposed celibacy and isolationism are extreme expressions of selfishness and unwillingness to serve or to be served. Our eternal destiny is welded to the destiny of our fellows. The very nature of our existence is interdependence on one another.<br><br>A mother serves by giving birth to a child and continues in its service until the child grows to independence. For life to continue, the process must repeat itself. When one is serving, another is being served. Faith, love of God and fellowman, patriotism, and self-esteem all depend on how we practice serving and being served.<br><h2><b>Selflessness</b></h2><br>Perhaps this principle is best understood if it is referred to as selflessness. Selflessness is the giving of oneself in the serving of others and the giving of oneself in being served by others.<br><br>Selflessness is a marvelous virtue. It embraces the true spirit of companionship. It is the very essence of friendship. It is the portrayer of true love and oneness in humanity.<br><br>Fundamental to our individuality is agency. The divinely given and heaven-protected gift of agency allows us to determine our own balance of selflessness. How and to what degree we serve others and allow them to serve us are our choices to develop.<br><br>In infancy and childhood we are predominantly served. Our parents provide us with food, clothing, and shelter and nourish our spirits with love and companionship that give us a sense of belonging and security. We develop kindred ties as we accept from them this service. The very act of our accepting it is in and of itself a returning of the gift to the giver. Parents find joy and comfort in participating in the care and training that brings about that maturity and integrity of the adolescent and then the adult. Their joy is consistent with the progress of the child. It falters only when their service is rejected, as when disobedience occurs. The very nature of selflessness keeps them giving of themselves in spite of setbacks.<br><br>A time always comes when the level of our maturity as individuals dictates that we must seek for ourselves expanded experiences and companionships. If the ties we have made as children with our parents have had the proper balance of selflessness, we will have developed a kinship that no physical separation can ever break. There will be an unspoken understanding of oneness. Even with physical separation, each will maintain the joy and spiritual companionship that have been created as eternal happiness, the products of selflessness.<br><br>Very often as young adults move away from the home environment for employment or for further education, they suffer a tremendous emotional shock. Suddenly the balance of service and being served is drastically altered. Companionships are new and unproven. No feeling of love and unity has yet been developed. Old relationships seem distant. We call this homesickness. It is a period of adjustment and growth. Parent-child relationships turn into teacher-student or boss-employee relationships. Associations change from kindred to peer relationships. As these changes take place, it is important to understand the principles of selflessness.<br><h2><b>Selfishness</b></h2><br>In order to understand selflessness, we must also understand its opposite, selfishness. Selfishness is the closing of the door of service to others and the disallowing of others to serve us in love, while at the same time we attempt to serve ourselves or wrongfully exact service from others.<br><br>There is no happiness in selfishness. It is a sin. Its products are misery and loneliness. It alienates companions and develops enmity in human relationships.<br><br>Selfishness and greed, put into the heart of Cain by Satan, caused our first parents, Adam and Eve, to mourn before the Lord for him and his brethren. It was Cain's selfishness that caused him to bind himself up to Satan and, to get gain, murder his brother Abel. Selfishness inspired the children of Israel to their indulgences as they drank and played and corrupted themselves around the idol of the golden calf. Only selfishness could have induced Judas to betray the holy, selfless Lord.<br><br>Selfishness is the basic substance, the raw material, if you will, out of which are produced almost all other sins that Satan has introduced upon the earth. Under his skillful management, this insidious element manifests itself in such a myriad of ways that almost no one escapes its influence. In its subtlety it can camouflage itself to our senses with such proficiency that we are often oblivious to its presence. Its magnetic tentacles stretch out and draw to itself every indulgence that can block us on our quest for exaltation.<br><br>Greed, envy, covetousness, lust, rebellion, thievery, idleness, lying, hypocrisy, falseness, backsliding, immorality, infidelity, pride, arrogance, gluttony, and most other evils are drawn to selfishness as though it were the music of the flute of the Pied Piper. If we place sin in the sunlight, it will cast the shadow of selfishness.<br><br>In its simplest form, selfishness is the retaining to oneself that which one has the power to give away in benevolence. To some it sounds innocent, almost justifiable, but the truth is that it soon creates people whose<br><br><i>hearts are not satisfied. ... obey not the truth ... but have the pleasure in unrighteousness. ... that will not give</i>[their]<i>substance to the poor. ... whose spirits are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who will not labor with</i>[their]<i>own hands.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 56:15‚Äì18]<br><br>That which a man serves himself upon the platter of selfishness and greed may appease his mortal appetite but will leave him spiritually starved and malnourished. As a thought precedes an act, so does selfishness precede sin. Immorality of every kind has its basis in selfishness. Why else would a man commit an immoral act if not to satisfy his own pleasure? Selfishness embraces corruption as men scheme and bribe and take unfair advantage to satisfy their wants and obsessions. It becomes pride as men forsake things of eternal value--even marriage, family and God--for supposed high position and fame. Consider how many are infidel to one another and to God as they selfishly squander their lives and means on the evaporative pleasures of what the world holds out as fashionable.<br><br>Satan's subtle use of selfishness causes even parents to justify wasting away countless hours before a television set, absorbing violence, sensuality, vulgarity, and the foolishness of the world while their children, usually allowed to view the same things, are starving for affection and attention. Can such selfishness be condoned, or are they bringing condemnation upon themselves and sin down upon their heads by not using this time to teach their children the doctrines of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, baptism and the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and "to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 68:25, 28)?<br><br>Selfishness draws men into a spiritual vacuum where, absorbed in self-service, they shut out all others. Selfish idleness, with its "I'll do it later" attitude, provides the base of procrastination that keeps righteous work from being done.<br><br>Since Satan has sworn to do all possible to stop righteous work upon the earth, what better way than to lead us into procrastination, it being the product of selfish idleness? Within the Church it is manifest in a failure to faithfully comply with callings. Home teaching goes unattended. Tithes and offerings go unpaid. There is neglect in keeping personal histories and family records and in doing temple work. There is an unwillingness to give service in the missionary effort. How it must please Satan to see his success in influencing into nonparticipation those who could be the builders of God's kingdom!<br><br>Of all influences that cause men to choose wrong, selfishness is undoubtedly the strongest. Where it is, the Spirit is not. Talents go unshared, the needs of the poor unrequited, the weak unstrengthened, the ignorant untaught, and the lost unrecovered. Selfishness viewed in its true sense is the absence of empathy and compassion, the abandonment of brotherhood, the rejection of God's plan, the very isolation of one's soul.<br><br>Just as selflessness can carry us to our exaltation and eternal lives, so can selfishness lead us to our destruction and eternal damnation. Each day we are faced with the challenge of decision. Will our acts be selfless or selfish?<br><br>This is a competitive life. There is competition for space. Imaginary lines are drawn over which others are not welcome to step. Mental walls with closed doors are built, and we dare anyone to intrude. There is competition for companionship. We ask, "Who will be my friends?" If they are my friends, my best friends, there is jealousy, a feeling that they cannot be the friends of others. There is competition for recognition--my looks, my clothes, my possessions, my stereo, my car, my money, and so on. There is competition for intelligence, talent, conversation, and experiences. As we size one another up and try one another on, we are constantly faced with the challenges of selflessness versus selfishness.<br><h2><b>The Only Way</b></h2><br>The only way given in heaven and upon earth whereby any of us may be sanctified is in the service of others. Every requirement of God's plan for our salvation places upon us the responsibility of giving of ourselves.<br><br>In the spirit of selflessness, men and women share themselves, their talents, and their means in benevolent service to mankind and God. Their reward is the freeing of their souls, the growth of their love, their nearness to Divinity, their worthiness for the companionship of the Spirit.<br><br>Are we like the man who came running unto Jesus pleading, "What must I do to be saved"? After Jesus had explained to him the commandments he must live and the man assured him that he had done all these things from his youth, Jesus told him he lacked but one thing:<br><br><i>Sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, and take up the cross, and follow me.</i><br><br><i>And he was sad at that saying, and went away and grieved: for he had great possessions.</i>[Mark 10:17‚Äì21]<br><br>Or are we like the widow who cast her two mites into the treasury? Jesus seeing her said to his disciples,<br><br><i>This poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</i><br><br><i>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living</i>. [Mark 12:43‚Äì44]<br><br>Each of you finds yourself in circumstances unique to you alone. Each must practice the acts of your own character. If you would be truly happy, these acts must be acts of selflessness. Selflessness will turn sadness into a cheerful countenance. Selflessness produces kindness and dispels hypocrisy. Selflessness develops love, confidence, and trust. It is the vehicle of generosity. It is the resource of God to answer the prayers of his children.<br><br>With selflessness we demonstrate our true relationship and intimacy with the Savior. It is the link that binds together the family of God.<br><br>May we be selfless and exalted, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>William R.

I had to chuckle as President Holland was commenting about ages. This last month I reached my fortieth birthday, and my children were kidding me a lot about being so old, telling me "Dad, you're just about over the hill; you're about finished; when are you going to check in?"--those kinds of comments. I was kiddingly telling some of the Brethren about that, and they were quick to say, "You'll get no sympathy in this audience, Elder Cook."<br><br>I really am pleased to be here, my brothers and sisters. I'm pleased that President Holland is here. We've been good friends for a number of years, and he is a great president. I know you know that. I'm impressed with these stake presidents and their wives, whom I've had opportunity to meet as well, and particularly with you. I imagine anyone who is the least bit sensitive to the Spirit would be moved by being in your midst. The Spirit of the Lord is here. You brought it here.<br><br>I bear testimony to you, my brothers and sisters, in the very beginning of what I want to say tonight, that to the degree you and I are both receptive, we may learn some things that might be of great assistance to both of us.<br><br>I appreciate Randy's prayer and the music that has been rendered--"I Need Thee Every Hour"--and I hope and pray, my brothers and sisters, that all of you believe that, to the extent that you are continually praying every hour for the Lord to direct your steps, he'll tell you what to do, what to say, and what not to say; he'll bless you and prosper you in your relationships with others. I am truly convinced that if you pray continually without ceasing throughout a day, hour upon hour, you will find that you are able to live in this world and yet not be part of it, that you really can have your hand in the Lord's hand and be directed from on high (see D&amp;amp;C 101:36‚Äì38). To that I bear witness.<br><br>I debated for some time to determine what I might say this night. I have determined to share with you some ideas, some principles from the scriptures that of necessity I will have to read. I pray that you might be attentive, and that the Spirit might inspire us all.<br><h2><b>Making Things Happen</b></h2><br>Someone said long ago, when great events occur, there are three types of persons manifested: First, the one who doesn't realize that anything great is happening; second, the one who realizes something is going on but doesn't know what it is; and third, the one behind the scenes making it all happen.<br><br>How does a person make things happen? How can someone be effective as a young man or woman, as a father, a mother, as a leader in the Church, in schoolwork, in life? I submit that it is by doing things "the Lord's way." This evening I want to center on a basic principle of the gospel--how you make things happen through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Some of you are concerned about schoolwork and are unable to perform as well as you would like to. Can faith in the Lord mark the way? Some of you are worried about employment opportunities and what will occur after you finish your studies at the university. Can faith in the Lord mark the way? Some of you are concerned about marriage--will I get married? If so, to whom and when? Some are concerned about raising families, sickness, death, personality problems, personal growth. Once again, can faith in the Lord mark the way?<br><br>Some people try to answer these difficult questions on their own and hope for the best but still end up making wrong choices. Well might the Lord say to them: "How long will you kick against the pricks? How long will you go along your own way?"<br><br>Faithful Latter-day Saints will want to know how to use their faith to cause all things to work for their good (see D&amp;amp;C 90:24), to act and not be acted upon (see 2 Nephi 2:13, 14, 16‚Äì27), and to righteously prevail over self and others and situations (see 3 Nephi 7:17‚Äì18). They will want to know the specific will of the Lord concerning themselves and then, in faith, discipline themselves to submit to his will.<br><h2><b>What Faith Is</b></h2><br>What is faith? What does the word convey? The following are thirteen descriptive statements to help us define faith:<br><br>1. Faith makes men sure and steadfast.<br><br>2. After the trial of your faith comes the witness.<br><br>3. Faith is evidence of things not seen.<br><br>4. Faith is related to hope.<br><br>5. Faith is related to belief.<br><br>6. Faith is the substance of things hoped for.<br><br>7. Faith is not a perfect knowledge.<br><br>8. Faith is not associated with doubt and fear.<br><br>9. Faith is not physical exertion. It is utilizing words.<br><br>10. Faith does not come by signs.<br><br>11. Faith is a principle of action in all intelligent beings.<br><br>12. Faith is maintained by personal righteousness; and lastly,<br><br>13. Faith is power.<br><br>To have one last definition of faith, listen to the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>Had it not been</i>[said he]<i>for the principle of faith the worlds would never have been framed, neither would man have been formed of the dust. It is the principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all temporal as well as eternal things. Take this principle or attribute--for it is an attribute--from the Deity, and he would cease to exist. ... Faith, then, is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of God. Without it there is no power, and without power there could be no creation or existence!</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith,</i>Lecture First, 16, 24]<br><br>The simplest definition I know of faith is, "Faith is power."<br><br>How do you exercise faith in the Lord to help you resolve the challenges of life? How do you learn to use that power to bless yourself and others? May I provide you with six specific suggestions that may be of assistance to you in exercising your faith in the Lord. Listen carefully to the principles from the scriptures. Then later, when I illustrate with some actual experiences, you will understand better your role in exercising faith and the Lord's role in a given set of circumstances.<br><h2><b>Be Believing</b></h2><br>1. Be believing with desire single to the glory of God. Be believing. How I love these simple but sacred words uttered by Nephi:<br><br><i>I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, ...did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that</i>I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father;<i>wherefore, I did not rebe</i>l<i>against him like unto my brothers.</i>[1 Nephi 2:16; emphasis added]<br><br>Are you believing? Are you able to exercise faith in the words of your father, your husband, a priesthood leader, with little or no tangible evidence? Remember that unbelief destroys faith. We learn this about unbelieving Laman and Lemuel.<br><br><i>Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel,</i>for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. [1 Nephi 3:28; emphasis added]<br><br>Some of us are confused and deceived and follow strange voices as Lemuel did and believe in unworthy causes or men or untrue principles. Nephi later taught his brethren how one receives most communication from God:<i>He hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words</i>. [1 Nephi 17:45]<br><br>As you exercise your faith, my brothers and sisters, you may want to consider how much evidence you require before you are able to act in faith. Do you believe my words or only your works? Are you capable of believing inspired words, or do you have to go through the actual process yourself before you're able to believe?<br><br>You will receive spiritual evidence as you go forth believing, but it is whether you require it all in the beginning or not that makes the difference in your faith. Do you need a sign--then you will believe? No, you exercise your faith, and signs will follow those that believe. That is the true principle.<br><h2><b>Commit Yourself</b></h2><br>2. Commit and discipline yourself totally in word and deed. For many it is harder to make a true commitment than to actually fulfill what the commitment requires.<br><br>Many people go through life allowing life to serve up the menu. They seem to be subject to every wind of doctrine and mood of the world. They seem to go forth lost in the world with only a vague idea of what they would have from life.<br><br>Some decide what they want, commit themselves to obtain it, and, in righteousness, exercise their faith until they obtain. They keep spiritual priorities ever present in their minds and hearts until they have received that which they righteously desire. Once again, Nephi's sacred commitment and personal discipline in this respect greatly move me. He said:<br><br><i>As the Lord liveth, and as we live</i>, we will not go down<i>unto our fathers in the wilderness</i>until<i>we have accomplished that thing which the Lord hath commanded us</i>. [1 Nephi 3:15; emphasis added]<br><br>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is fully sustaining. You can pay the price by disciplining yourself and then causing things to happen. Hold your word as sacred to God, to others, and to yourself. Be truly committed, and you will see the hand of the Lord revealed in your behalf.<br><br>Let me tell you of a young man I knew when I was a mission president who knew how to apply these principles. He was a missionary full of faith. He was Uruguayan. He had been in the mission about three or four months when I arrived as the mission president, and I noticed that wherever he served, there were people baptized. In the beginning I thought it was his senior companion because he seemed too young, too new, to be the cause--that was my mistake. He knew how to make things happen.<br><br>He was called as a senior companion and a district leader. I sent him into a city that had gained a reputation of being a tough, "no results type" city. Missionaries had not baptized anyone there for nearly a year--not one person! The members were discouraged. Only ten to twelve members were attending the branch. I didn't tell him anything--I just notified him of the transfer. It took him three weeks, and he and his companion began baptizing. He served there about ten weeks. All of his district also started baptizing, which was most pleasing to them.<br><br>It is great to have a missionary who can baptize, but if he can teach others how to do it, his leadership can bless the lives of many.<br><br>This missionary never wrote me much in his weekly reports. He would only write, "Dear President, I sure love you. Things are going great. Sincerely," or "President, the Lord is blessing us greatly. I love the work. Your brother."<br><br>He was called later to serve as a zone leader and sent to supervise the whole upper area of the mission where there were some very challenging cities. As a new challenge, he would have to teach the missionaries to do what he was doing now through the district leaders. He served there two or three months and was responsible for scores of baptisms and literally changed the spirit of the whole zone and many members and leaders, as well as missionaries--one single man. They very frankly together wrought a spiritual miracle.<br><br>Then came a spiritual struggle for me, a restless feeling about him. The impression was that he should be sent to Paraguay! At that time, the work was very slow in Paraguay--an average of only 20 to 25 baptisms a month in the whole country. I wrestled with that and thought to myself, "He has really proved himself here, but to put him in that situation might drag him down in discouragement as it has so many of the others. He may have a hard time sustaining his faith there." I had to struggle with my faith to convince myself that he really ought to go, but the promptings were obeyed.<br><br>He was sent a telegram transferring him to Asuncion, Paraguay, as a zone leader and telling him that he should leave the very next day. When he came in to Montevideo, he didn't even come to see me. He was modest and always a little embarrassed and seemed always to avoid "the president."<br><br>He departed from the mission home, but he left a letter, which was the first that I ever received from him. It said, in effect, "Dear President Cook, I received a telegram today telling me to go to Paraguay, and I thought you ought to know a few things: (1)You can't baptize in Paraguay. I have had at least ten to fifteen elders tell me of their experiences there. (2) The members are not helping at all. (3) There are some real morality problems among the nonmembers there. (4) Many people live together unmarried, (5), (6), (7), (8) ..." And he went through and listed ten to twelve of the most negative things I have ever heard in my life.<br><br>I thought to myself, "Oh, no, unbelieving people have gotten to him."<br><br>But as he finished the list, he said, "I just want you to know, President, that I don't believe any of those things." Talk about faith! Then he committed himself, after expressing his faith, saying, "I want you to know, President Cook, that on Christmas Day (and the date of the letter was December 1), we are going to baptize 25 people."<br><br>When I read that I prayed for him and thought, "The Lord bless you, Elder. You have a tremendous amount of faith, and the Lord will sustain you. You don't know the country. You haven't ever been there. You don't know where you are going to live. You don't know your companion, the leaders, or the members. You don't know anything, and yet you, in faith, believe and are willing to commit yourself to baptizing 25 people in 25 days."<br><br>Well, this young man was full of faith and was a real example of a great Latin leader. On December 25, he and his companion baptized 18 people. They hadn't reached the 25, only 18, which was just about all that the whole country baptized in a normal month. It was a great privilege two weeks later, when I was in Paraguay, to participate in a baptismal service where he and his companion baptized 11 more. His district baptized about 30 that day altogether. Can you see how one righteous man can turn around a whole set of circumstances? He believed, he made the commitment, and he and the Lord did it.<br><br>You never forget that. Whether it be a General Authority, like President Kimball, who turns around the world and sets us on a different course, or a bishop, or a father, or a student, or a fine young woman--you can literally cause things to work for your good both in your life and in the lives of others if you are full of faith in the Lord.<i>All things are possible to him that believeth.</i>[Mark 9:23]<br><br>Commit yourself in advance to what you righteously desire. The righteous exercising of faith will bring it about.<br><h2><b>Do Your Part</b></h2><br>3. Do all in your power to fulfill your part. Men falter and expect the Lord to do more than his part. It is evident in all of scripture that, unless a man does do all in his power, the arm of the Lord will not be revealed in his behalf.<br><br>After a man truly has sacrificed and done all in his power, God will come and save him in his time of need. As James taught us:<br><br><i>By works was faith made perfect.</i>[James 2:22]<br><br>Man must search not only to pay the price the Lord requires but to understand in what currency it will be required. Many times it helps to have the attitude, "What price is attached to this blessing? How much must I pay, and in what currency?"<br><br>The sacrifice most often required by the Lord is your own personal sins. He desires you to sacrifice those to him and obtain this broken heart and contrite spirit which he requires of all people.<br><br>Do all in your power to do your part.<br><h2><b>Pray</b></h2><br>4. Pray as if all depended upon the Lord. Will the Lord not honor the sacrifice of his servants who have tried to do all in their power if they will now ask it of him? Sometimes you may arrive at this point and do not actually come to ask the Lord for the gift of faith or for power in the priesthood. The Lord taught:<br><br><i>Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 4:7]<br><br>The initiative rests with the man. The Lord said,<br><br><i>It</i>[shall]<i>be granted unto them according to their faith in their prayers</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 10:47]<br><br><i>And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 42:14]<i>You have supposed that I would give it to you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 9:7]<br><br>If you exercise great faith in your prayers and fast as needed, your loving, all-knowing Father will provide you with that which you righteously desire. Pray, believing you will have your righteous desires, and they will, in the Lord's time, be given to you.<br><h2><b>Expect Trials of Your Faith</b></h2><br>5. Prepare for constant and intense trials of your faith. Tribulation is a refiner of faith. The Lord said,<br><br><i>For after much tribulation come the blessings</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 58:4]<br><br>The Lord will never tempt you, but<i>he will</i>try you. Tribulations and problems are<br><br>what this earthly school is made of. Life is all upstream--all uphill. You may at times desire to remove yourself from the swift current to rest a while, but you must go on. If you are on a plateau, you need to be on your way. You are not praying fervently and receiving trials in the right spirit.<br><br>Challenges and difficulties that many of us resist are the very elements which refine us and make godly men and women. The Lord will try you in every attribute possessed by man and at all stages of development in your life. He will try you again and again until you know that you are able and will serve him at all costs.<br><br>How comforting the words of Moroni:<br><br><i>I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.</i>[Ether 12:6]<br><h2><b>Expect the Lord to Act</b></h2><br>6. Expect the Lord to perform according to his holy will and your faith. The Lord will perform. The Lord's arm will be revealed. He will take care of his Saints. He has great desire to see you cause other people to learn how to exercise faith by your own example.<br><br>He desires you to be one who causes things to happen. He desires you to draw upon the all-powerful arm of God and the power which resides in you to do things in God's own way. He desires you not be deeply involved or absorbed by worldly, temporal, superficial, or secondary things. These things must be dealt with, but even they must be handled spiritually.<br><br>To enrich and accelerate the growth of your faith, you may wish to measure it by the number of your predetermined righteous desires that are fulfilled. However, you must always remember that, when you pray and exercise faith in something that does not occur the way you hoped it would, your only object in view must then be to redouble your faith the next time.<br><br>Prayers that appear on the surface not to be answered, my brothers and sisters, are often the very ones that are answered most meaningfully. One must double one's faith in these apparent trials lest it be lost.<br><br>Be sure to receive whatever the Lord gives to you with a thankful heart. Alma said,<br><br><i>There are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they migh</i>t. [Alma 32:25]<br><br>The same could be said of those who have a thankful heart: "There are some among you who would have a thankful heart, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might."<br><br>Remember the heartfelt response of Job after losing all he possessed. He said,<br><br><i>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</i>[Job 1:21]<br><br>Be submissive, humble, and patient, and the Lord will deliver to you that which will always be for your best good.<br><br>I would like now to relate one last very personal experience in faith that demonstrates, to a degree perhaps, these six suggestions I have tried to describe. Consider the six suggestions as you listen to this example. This is the first time, in a totally public sense, that I have ever shared this account.<br><br>On 29 July 1977, Sister Cook and I had just finished visiting in the Bolivia Santa Cruz Mission and were stalled in the Cochabamba, Bolivia, airport for some five hours. I recall that we were very tired, having had few hours of sleep the night before. We were both delighted in reality to have a few hours in which we might be able to rest in the airplane. As I was drifting off to sleep, I had a very strong feeling that I should awaken and write down some ideas. The desire to sleep was strong, but the promptings of the Spirit were more powerful. I did write; in fact, I wrote for nearly three hours, solving some organizational problems I had struggled with for a number of years previously concerning priesthood leaders and their roles. I felt a great outpouring of the Spirit on that day and excitedly wrote down each inspired thought. The experience took most of the time of the delay.<br><br>We were then off to La Paz, Bolivia. We were graciously met by President and Sister Chase Allred at the airport and driven in their van to the mission office. The mission president informed us that he needed to take care of a small item of business in the office and then we would be on our way to his home. We determined that we ought to go in with him to see the mission office. We locked the car and left our luggage and briefcase in the van, and Sister Allred asked an elder to keep his eye on the car.<br><br>Upon entering the office, the president was confronted with a difficult case of a woman whose husband was dying, and it necessitated an interview by both of us in order to properly calm her and assist with her needs. In the meanwhile, Sisters Cook and Allred left for the mission home.<br><br>When the president and I returned to the van, I realized immediately that all our goods were gone but assumed that Sister Cook had taken them with her to the mission home. While we were driving toward the home, I discovered that the right front small window-wing had been damaged and began to fear the perhaps our goods had been stolen.<br><br>Upon arrival at the mission home, it was quickly determined that all our luggage, our briefcase, and all our goods had been stolen. The loss of a substantial amount of money and of all our clothing created an immediate but only temporary problem. What was more disheartening than all that was my scriptures were in the briefcase together with the inspired ideas I had just received in Cochabamba. The overwhelming sensations of discouragement, anger, and inability to do anything about the situation were overpowering.<br><br>My wife and I prayed alone. We prayed with those present. We tried to enjoy our dinner but could not. Who could know of the great loss I personally felt? The scriptures had been given to me as a young man by my parents, a sacred inscription placed in one of them by my mother and in the other by my father before he died. I had spent literally thousands of hours marking, cross-referencing, and loving every moment of it in the only tangible earthly possessions I had ever considered of much value. I had on many occasions instructed my wife, if there were ever a fire in our home, to be sure to remove the children and, if there were time, to take my scriptures and not to worry about anything else.<br><br>The president and I had much to discuss as we were to be together only that evening. However, I felt a strong impression that we must do all in our power in order to attempt to recover the scriptures. After supper, all present knelt in a circle in prayer once again. We determined to search the immediate area near the mission office and a nearby field, hoping that the thief or thieves might have taken the salable items and discarded the English books.<br><br>In the prayer the pleadings were that the scriptures would be returned, that the persons who had taken them would be led to know of their unrighteous act and repent, and that the return of the books would be the means of bringing someone into the true church.<br><br>Eight or ten of us then loaded into the van with flashlights and warm clothing and drove up to the mission office in the central city. We scoured vacant lots across the street and adjacent streets and alleys; we talked with guards and anyone else we could find, exhausting all possibilities. No one had seen or heard anything. Finally we returned home, dejected, to be able only to pray individually and wait. President Allred and I were able to finish our business late that night, and the next day Sister Cook and I flew back to Quito, Ecuador, where we lived.<br><br>The mission, in the meantime, during the next few weeks searched the lots again. They looked in the hedges and garbage cans, searched a nearby park, placed a sign on a wall where the books were stolen requesting their return, and kept a watchful eye to see if the books might show up in an unexpected place nearby. In sheer desperation, trying to do all in their power, the missionaries decided to place an ad in two daily newspapers, offering a reward and giving explicit information concerning the books.<br><br>In Quito, Ecuador, I began a personal spiritual struggle that was a very difficult one for me. After nearly three weeks, I had not studied the scriptures at all. I had tried on numerous occasions, but every time I read a verse I recalled only a few of the many cross-references that had been made over twenty years. I was disheartened and depressed and had no desire whatsoever to read. I prayed many times telling the Lord that I had never tried to use my scriptures for any purpose other than glorifying his name and trying to teach others the truths that he had taught me. I pleaded with the Lord that he would do anything that had to be done in order to have them returned. My wife and little children prayed incessantly as well for the same blessing. After two or three weeks they continued praying every day, "Heavenly Father, please bring back Daddy's scriptures."<br><br>After about three weeks, I felt a strong spiritual impression, "Elder Cook, how long will you go on without reading and studying?" It seemed to me to be a test or a trial and to have something to do with the "cost" of the blessing I desired. The words burned, and I determined that I must be humble enough and submissive enough to start all over again. I began to read Genesis in the Old Testament and, with the permission of my wife to use her scriptures, to mark and cross-reference once again.<br><br>On 18 August, a friend, Brother Ebbie Davis, arrived in Ecuador from Bolivia, and laid both sets of my scriptures on my desk along with a manila folder which contained the papers that I had written in Cochabamba and some recently prepared mission budgets that were also stolen. He indicated that they were the only things recovered, that the mission president had given them to him in La Paz as he boarded the plane, and that he did not know how the books were found, but that I would be told when I arrived there in the next few days to tour the mission.<br><br>The joy I experienced in that moment and later that day is indescribable. To realize that the Lord, in some miraculous way, could lift those books out of a city of 700,000‚Äì800,000 people like La Paz from the hands of thieves and return them intact, not one page removed, torn, or soiled, is still beyond me. How the faith of our family and many Bolivian missionaries was rewarded! That day I promised the Lord that I would make better use of them and my time, as instruments in his hands for teaching the gospel, than ever before.<br><br>On Sunday, 21 August, I flew to Guayaquil, Ecuador, and on to La Paz, Bolivia, arriving on 22 August, Monday. Upon arrival in Bolivia I was given the following account:<br><br>A lady had been in a marketplace, one of the hundreds that there are in La Paz. She was a member of the Protestant church. She indicated that she saw a drunk man waving around a black book. She had the strongest spiritual impression that something holy was being desecrated. She approached the man and asked him what it was. He did not know, but showed her the book. She asked if he had anything else. He pulled out another black book. She asked if there were more. He removed a folder full of papers that he said he was going to burn. She then expressed the desire to purchase those things from him, and he agreed, for the price of 50 pesos or about $2.50, U.S. currency.<br><br>After she made the purchase, she felt totally taken aback by the fact that she had purchased the books. She realized they were in English--she didn't speak, read, or understand English--and she had no desire to have any English books. It would have been like one of us, my brothers and sisters, paying nearly 10 percent of our monthly income to buy some books in Chinese, which we could not read. For what purpose she knew not except that she knew she had the inspired feeling to buy that which was being desecrated. She immediately began a search for the church that was named in the front of the books. Fortunately, it translated from English into Spanish accurately, and after approaching a number of other churches, she finally arrived at the mission office in La Paz, directed by the hand of the Lord. She was only a block away from the mission office when she was told where the office was. She had never heard of the reward nor of the ad in the newspaper which was to appear that very day. She did not ask for any money, not even to reclaim the 50 pesos that she had paid. The elders received the books and greatly rejoiced and paid her the reward anyway.<br><br>She told the missionaries she was associated with a Pentecostal sect but listened very intently as they unfolded the gospel to her. She recalled reading something about Joseph Smith from a pamphlet she had picked up in the street two or three years earlier. After their first discussion with her, they reported, "She is a golden contact." After the second discussion, she agreed to be baptized in two weeks. Two weeks later, 11 September 1977, on a Sunday afternoon at Branch 1 in La Paz, Bolivia, Sister Maria Cloefe Cardenas Terrazas and her son, Marco Fernando Miranda Cardenas, age twelve, were baptized into the true church of Jesus Christ by Elder Douglas Reeder.<br><br>Who could describe the deep, discouraging, depressing, disheartening, overpowering feelings of helplessness when the scriptures were lost? Who could describe the great feeling of joy and rejoicing to see the hand of the Lord revealed in as miraculous a way as many accounts recording in Holy Writ? Our Heavenly Father does hear and answer the prayers of his sons and daughters if they exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord said:<br><br><i>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</i><br><br><i>Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</i>[Mark 11:23‚Äì24]<br><br>My brothers and sisters, today is a day of miracles. We believe in miracles. The Latter-day Saints may expect miracles according to their faith. As a member of this Church, you have an authorization to take a leading part in the development of the kingdom of God on earth within your respective responsibilities. Pray fervently. Actively seek to increase your faith, and with that great gift from God, you can cause great things to occur in your life and in the lives of others.<br><br>May the Lord bless you that that responsibility may rest squarely upon you. Remember, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is fully sustaining. Will the Lord mark the way in your schooling, in your employment, in your future marriages, in your families? He will. The Lord is full of mercy, forgiveness, patience, and longsuffering, and he is desirous of unlocking his treasure house of blessings to you who are full of faith.<br><br>I testify that the Lord is all-powerful and will perform according to his promises. Jesus is the Christ, the one in whom we exercise our faith, the only Being under heaven whereby we and all people may be saved, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gene R.

<br>
This is a wonderful week to be together with so many things going on: the temple dedication, the groundbreaking of your new stadium facility, and the victory you all have enjoyed so warmly. I noted that it was not clearly emphasized that I was a graduate of the University of Utah, probably so that there wouldn't be tears in our behalf, but I am very, very proud to be a member of the Church, and I'm proud of what goes on here on this campus, and of the things we hear about as we go out in the world and meet people who have been guests on this campus. They are impressed with how you look, how you behave, and how you handle your football games.<br><br>Following the game Saturday, two of the players were overheard talking. It's hard to be humble when spirits are still so high, but I've always felt that humility is still a God-given virtue and probably necessary for the celestial kingdom. But this particular couple of men, one a Utah man and one a BYU star, were discussing the outcome of the game. The BYU man boastfully said, "Why, of course we won. My ancestors are traced back to William the Conqueror."<br><br>The Utah man, properly put in his place but still hopeful, said scoffingly, "I hope your aren't going to tell me that your family were with Noah on the ark."<br><br>The BYU man said, "Certainly not, my people had their own boat!"<br><br>Well, I appreciate your laughing at the little jest. It was a tough thing to sit among your rooters and have to keep reminding my husband who had been a student body officer, class officer, and so on at the University of Utah back in the olden days, "Now, honey, rise and shout. Now!" And we'd get him up to shout for the right team.<br><br>I have it in my heart today to talk to you about the season that we're in, Thanksgiving, and the forthcoming season of Christmas. I want you to know the things that couldn't be said about me in the kind introduction that President Holland gave you in the beginning: my testimony of the gospel, my great love of the Lord, the witness I have through the Spirit that the work we're engaged in is the work of the Lord and is very important. One of the wonderful things about special Church service as it comes to us when a mantle falls and hands are placed upon our heads is that we're set apart from the world for a time. One of the wonderful things that I must say to you before I say anything else, so that you'll know from whence I come today as I try to share some things that I hope will be helpful to you--one of the wonderful things--is to bear testimony to the ever-recurring support from the Spirit and the awareness that the Lord Jesus Christ is at the head of this church and that he cares about every one of us and what we're doing to help his children.<br><h2><b>Preparation an Obligation</b></h2><br>I want then to talk about my gratitude and what ought to be your gratitude at this season of Thanksgiving. I have an emphasis that I hope will come out of the things I say. It is that I feel that, having been given so much, we need to go forth and do great things. That's a commandment to us, but it's very important that we be prepared instruments.<br><br>President Holland mentioned that I was involved in Church publications, getting the youth magazine set up and edited over the period of some long years, actually. One of the things that we published in this little magazine was a fine essay called "Bind on Thy Sandals." It was written by a brilliant graduate student. It had to do with the benchwarmer who had just taken off his cleats, thinking that for him the game would never get underway. Suddenly the coach called him in to play. That's a terrible dilemma. The essay, in developing this situation, likened it to our own situation of being prepared to answer the call from God in behalf of his work. It happens that the author of that article is now the president of your institution. I think it ought to be required reading at Brigham Young University. It has great, great merit still. If I didn't think that the time was terribly short and perhaps you might have heard it, I would read it to you.<br><br>But we're meeting here in an academic setting, and I want to take a minute to urge you that, with all of your wisdom, with all of your preparations, with all of the marvelous excitement that is churning within you about the new things that you're being exposed to, I would hope that you will become somewhat interested in, if not addicted to, fine literature. I really can't tell you how much it means to me in my life, and I strongly recommend it. If you could find occasion to read aloud to each other the literature of the holy books and the literature that has come to us down through the history of mankind from great thinkers and writers, you'll find your enjoyment enhanced with each other as you share these things out loud.<br><h2><b>Making a Difference in the World</b></h2><br>I want to read something to you in keeping with my theme today of gratitude and being prepared to go forth to make a difference in the world. Some of you may be familiar with Eudora Welty's charming, charming short story "A Worn Path." Oh, it would be great Christmas reading in the family setting. Let me just read excerpts from it. I can't, of course, give it all to you. It begins this way:<br><br><i>It was December--a bright frozen day in the early morning. Far out in the country there was an old Negro woman with her head tied in a red rag, coming along a path through the pinewoods. Her name was Phoenix Jackson. She was very old and small, and she walked slowly in the dark pine shadows, moving a little from side to side in her steps, with the balanced heaviness and lightness of a pendulum in an old grandfather clock. She carried a thin, small cane made from an umbrella, and with this she kept tapping the frozen earth in front of her. This made a kind of grave and persistent noise in the still air that seemed meditative like the chirping of a solitary little bird. ...</i><br><br><i>Now and then there as a quivering in the thicket.</i><br><br><i>Old Phoenix said, "Out of my way, all you foxes, owls, beetles, jack rabbits, coons, and wild animals! Keep out from under these old feet, little bobwhites. ... Keep the big wild hogs out of my path. Don't let none of those come running in my direction. I got a long way."</i><br><br>The story continues, the adventures unfold, in most pleasing and picturesque language. She goes up hard hills, and her aged feet feel like they're bound in chains. Down through the oaks, past the little bushes that her old eyes think to be green, but are instead thorny and brambled and worrisome as she catches her skirt that must not be torn. And then she climbs over barbed wire past big, dead trees that look like black men with one arm, standing in the field of purple stalks of the withered corn and cotton. And through pathless cornfields then shaking the dry husks to whirl around her skirts, past snake pits, bull pens, alligator ponds, and scarecrows dancing and frightening. And then she comes to a terrible place in the path that she's following to her destination to town, loses her step, and tumbles over and down into the ditch and she can't get back up.<br><br>After a time a white man comes along, a young man, a hunter, with his dog on a chain.<br><br>He sees her lying there and he says,<br><br><i>"Well, Granny, what are you doing there?"</i><br><br>She gives this marvelous line:<br><br><i>"Lying on my back like a June bug waiting to be turned over, mister," she said, reaching up her hand.</i><br><br><i>He lifted her up, gave her a swing in the air, and set her down. "Anything broken, Granny?"</i><br><br><i>"No sir, them old dead weeds is springy enough," said Phoenix when she had got her breath. "I thank you for your trouble." ...</i><br><br><i>"On your way home?"</i><br><br><i>"No sir, I going to town."</i><br><br><i>"Why, that's too far! That's as far as I walk when I come out myself. ... Now you go on home, Granny!"</i><br><br><i>"I bound to go to town, mister," said Phoenix. "The time come around."</i><br><br>When the man leaves, she finds a nickel on the ground that apparently fell out of his pocket when he stooped to pull her up. She takes the nickel, puts it in her pocket, and goes the rest of the way to town. Finally, arriving at her destination where she sees the stone building, she climbs the tower of the steps until her feet know where to stop. She goes in and is greeted by a nurse there, and the nurse asks her about a grandson who apparently had swallowed some lye some two or three years before.<br><br>Granny Phoenix has made that long, perilous journey that I've spared you many of the details of to get the medicine for that little boy. The nurse asks Granny if the boy is dead, and Phoenix replies:<br><br><i>"No, missy, he not dead, he just the same. Every little while his throat begin to close up again, and he not able to swallow. He not get his breath, he not able to help himself. So the time come around, and I go on another trip for the soothing medicine." ...</i><br><br><i>"My little grandson, he sit up there in the house all wrapped up, waiting by himself. We is the only two left in the world. He suffer and it don't seem to put him back at all. He got a sweet look. He going to last. He wear a little patch quilt and he peep out holding his mouth open like a little bird."</i><br><br>She adds this important line:<br><br><i>"I could tell him from all others in creation."</i><br><br>"All right," the nurse says, trying to silence her. She doesn't want the story to turn into one of those old-people recitations. She gives her the medicine, marks down, "Charity," and then says:<br><br><i>"It's Christmas time, Grandma, could I give you a few pennies out of my purse?"</i><br><br><i>"Five pennies is a nickel," said Phoenix stiffly.</i><br><br><i>"Here's a nickel," said the attendant.</i><br><br><i>Phoenix rose carefully and held out her hand. She received the nickel and then fished out the other nickel out of her pocket and laid it beside the new one. She stared at her palm closely, with her head on one side.</i><br><br><i>Then she gave a tap with her cane on the floor.</i><br><br><i>"This is what come to me to do. I going to the store and buy my child a windmill they sells made out of paper. He going to find it hard to believe there such a thing in the world. I'll march myself back there where he waiting, holding it straight up in this hand."</i><br><br><i>She lifted her free hand, and gave a little nod, turned around, and walked out of the doctor's office. Then her slow step began on the stairs, going down.</i>[<i>The Green Curtain and Other Stories</i>(New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1979), pp. 275‚Äì289]<br><br>I love the story of Phoenix Jackson. She was one who knew her duty, who did it in compassion, but who cared about the wants of other people. She was going to buy him a windmill. That's when the real joy came into the whole thing.<br><h2><b>Showing Gratitude by Becoming Prepared</b></h2><br>I think it was Thoreau who wrote about the fact that we don't need friends to feed and clothe us; we have kind neighbors for that, but what we do need is someone who will enrich our souls when we are in need. In the Doctrine and Covenants in the 59th section we have been given clear instructions, young people. As I've prepared for this season, as well as for my talk this morning and for a rather large event of the young women this evening, I have been struck with a mighty fear that I've lived so long without expressing proper gratitude for all that I have, for all that we have--for the places we enjoy while we learn our lessons, for the comforts that come to us when we're stricken with sadness, for the fantastic support that this system gives to us, for the guidance of God, and the direction and comfort and sustaining influence and witness that is ours of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>In the 59th section, in the 88th section, in the 82nd section--all of those references that we might give--we have been commanded to give thanks. We have been told that in nothing does man really offend God except in not being grateful for all the good things of the earth and for all the blessings from heaven. I toss this out as a very important point in my presentation: we must be grateful.<br><br>And grateful though we feel at this season, my suggestion this day is that we go forth in gratitude and share some of what we have. One of the things we're conscious of is the fact that in a rapidly growing church--one of our problems is the fact that we're growing so rapidly across the face of the earth, and this kind of growth introduces many kinds of challenges and concerns for all of us--but in a rapidly growing church and in a world with the forces of the adversary lining up for the great battle that is underway--a checkered flat has been dropped, I believe--we need a prepared army of Saints to make a difference with all that we have, with all that we can take advantage of yet to enrich us--particularly you who are in this academic situation. How important it is that we have a prepared army, that we are prepared to make a difference, that we are effective in how we give, that we are successful in our service.<br><h2><b>Meeting People's Wants</b></h2><br>Let me give you a quick story to tell you why I'm locked into this attitude. I think it's great to lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees, and succor and enrich people's souls, and feed their bodies and cover their bodies, and so on. Oh, my goodness, how important it is to come into the company of someone who knows how to do things beautifully, who can meet people's wants! You might want to look up that reference in Mosiah, 4th chapter. I think King Benjamin talks about that we should do all of these things, but the very last line is that we should deal with people spiritually and temporally according to their wants.<br><br>This brief story teaches a lesson that I learned when I was very young. We were fairly newly married, living in a subdivision with echoes of ourselves all around us: people in the same boat. It was that kind of community.<br><br>There moved into our place a young couple from a small Utah town. They had big dreams: he was going to go to school; she would teach piano lessons and make the money. They'd move ahead and not be stuck down in some little place where they couldn't progress.<br><br>But things seldom work out exactly as we plan. She was always pregnant or always playing at funerals or always diapering. He was always doing little odd jobs to get a little more money because she was always having babies and taking care of them. So his schooling didn't go very fast, and life got away from them. The house got out of control. The children were left pretty much to themselves, and chaos soon took over.<br><br>She was taken to the hospital desperately ill in a season like this we're coming into--struggling for her life. No piano lessons now, no money coming in. He had to be gone at least sixteen or seventeen hours a day trying to get money to keep food on the table.<br><br>When the word got around into our neighborhood, the sisters moved on it. We were good do-gooders, we were going to help, and I will never forget going into the house and suddenly becoming aware of what people do in a house that is unattended by the owners. Judgment and criticism, unhappy partners, complaints over the refrigerator, over the organizational structure, over the d√©cor, and it was finally agreed--you see, hearts were opened then in the season of the celebration--"Let's change all this. We'll paint it, we'll clean it up, we'll make it wonderful, and when she comes back it will be pleasing."<br><br>This family liked every room brightly colored. What happened in this well-meaningness was the rooms were scraped and scrubbed and painted clinical white. The kitchen cupboards were rearranged according to a stranger's kitchen habits. Pictures were hung at the eye level of the person who now had the hammer. Worst of all, the children's progress marks of growth were painted off the wall.<br><br>The family came back intact. We were surprised when a few weeks later they moved from our neighborhood. It was the day of a terrible snowstorm, so thick it fell that everything was whitened like the clinical rooms. As the family left, they preceded the moving van, and they had crepe paper streamers tied to the handles and the antennae and the d√©cor on the front of the grillwork of the car, and they proved they liked color, and they honked all the way through the neighborhood, down the hill, out of our lives.<br><br>You see, like a deciduous tree at this season, like our Christ upon the cross, they had been exposed to the neighborhood and found wanting. Help was necessary, but not complete change from what they had established as their life style.<br><br>I have thought of that often. As a young person I was enamored of the book<i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>written by Dale Carnegie. I give him full credit for an idea I've used a lot of times over a lot of years of talking with people about how to get along with each other a little better. He tells about going fishing. If you're going fishing and you want to catch fish, you take what the fish like to eat, not what you like to eat. A lot of men take six-packs of you-know-what and go fishing. But if you want to catch fish, you take worms. You don't take your favorite food--strawberries and cream or whatever. You learn how to reach people effectively. You do not paint the rooms white if you find that they are a family who wants their rooms colored. You do unto others as you would like to be done unto, say the scriptures. I just add a little addendum (and hope I won't be struck by lightening!): Treat people the way they want to be treated, the way it will bring them the most joy.<br><br>As we go forth as a prepared army with all of those people out there waiting for the truth that is ours to share, how wonderful it will be if we have learned how to communicate, learned how to discern what someone is feeling, learned to care enough to want to deal with their wants as well as what we think they need.<br><h2><b>Learning the Fundamentals</b></h2><br>I have in mind a great spiritual and emotional high in my life. I really enjoyed going through the British Gallery of Art. I will never forget how I felt coming around the corner and seeing that familiar painting of Van Gogh's called "Sunflowers." I'd seen it on postcards that had been given me and stamped on stationery. It has been copied in many, many forms, prints to hang on people's walls. But to see it in the original, the colors so dazzling, the details so breathtaking, was thrilling to me. I became immediately a fan of anyone who could make the common things of the earth lovely.<br><br>Van Gogh's life story tells of an incident that applies to what we're talking about today--about being prepared to make a difference in the world as we take all that we have and make it useful to other people. Vincent Van Gogh had not been a very good student. He had been lacking in direction. He had been a big disappointment to his brother Theo, who was financing the education, and in a confrontation Vincent said, "But I want to paint. I have something inside of me that says I must paint. Don't pin me down. Don't pen me in. I must paint."<br><br>His brother replied, "All right, all right, but learn how to hold the brush."<br><br>I think that's great. "I want to be a writer, a great writer," some cry. And we answer, "All right, but learn how to spell." Some want to be great doctors. All right, but they must learn what makes the body tick. If we want to do good we must be sure it's good, and that we don't go painting people's rooms white when they want them colored.<br><h2><b>Adding the Spiritual Dimension</b></h2><br>Do you see what I'm trying to say? In the study of the life of our Savior, our model, our master Miracle Worker in the life of people, I have been conscious of something that to me is very significant. It is a great strength to me; I hope it may be of worth to you as you look for ideas to help you in your life. As you follow through in the Gospels and the Book of Mormon in 3 Nephi where Christ was teaching here on earth, you learn one significant thing. You have to watch for it as you're reading, though, because the recitation of miracles and the marvelous comforts and the skill with which Christ taught and with which he handled people might hide the point I want to make.<br><br>Every single time in his life that a great good was accomplished--when the apostles were chosen, when whole series of miracles happened, when the scribes and the Pharisees and the scoffers and the sinners were taken on by Christ--each of these was preceded by such phrases as "he withdrew himself," he went into "a certain place," "he went out into a mountain," he held himself "apart." (We are set apart, too.) Even when the scriptures tell about his being baptized, it is there. We come away thinking that God spoke from the heavens about this being his beloved Son, about the Holy Ghost descending like a dove at the baptism, but there's a little word in there that says, and Jesus, "praying," was filled with the Spirit, and "was led by the Spirit into the wilderness" (Luke 3:21; 4:1). Sometimes, the word says,<br><br><i>He ... continued all night in prayer to God.</i>[Luke 6:12]<br><br>The five thousand were fed, he walked on water, the storm was quieted. This is the way our Lord Jesus Christ prepared. He came forth from the wilderness with the power of the spirit. I suggest it's the way it ought to work with us--that we retreat, that we pray, that we follow the guidance of the Spirit, that we go prepared with power to make a difference.<br><br>Many of you have filled missions. Many of you are thinking about it. One of our nephews wrote a letter home from the mission field. He and his companion were in one of these situations where two young Mormon elders had come up against a very professional scholar of the Bible, one who really knew how to spell<i>Haggai</i>, for example, or who knew where to find Lamentations sandwiched in there in the Old Testament.<br><br>They finally had the man convinced that he ought to read the Book of Mormon. He read the Book of Mormon, and they came back to talk to him about it. He didn't know what to do. He really understood the Bible, but there was this other book that he didn't know what to do with. As he began to give way to that feeling, confusion took over; darkness and depression enveloped him. The missionaries decided to give him a blessing, and the feeling lifted.<br><br>As they were marveling about this, there came a knock at the door, and two other missionaries from another church (that some of you may have tangled with) were there. They were invited in, and the man excitedly told them what happened to him. Immediately there was rancor. The two other missionaries began to protest: "There is no revelation and there is no other word but the Bible." Well, the whole tone of the gathering had changed. The missionaries kept very quiet. They knew when they were being intimidated. Then, as this nephew wrote home, he said, "Suddenly, as I sat there, I found myself praying to Heavenly Father. We had a golden prospect, someone that we really had in the palm of our hand for the kingdom. Why should I be sitting there intimidated?"<br><br>A little warm feeling began to creep in him: "We have the truth; they don't." So then he turned his thinking around and prayed, "Heavenly Father, help me, help me, guide me." And the little warm feeling grew and became a big feeling, he said, and "I felt the Spirit grow within me until I took courage." This young elder then spoke forth with power of the Spirit, ending by saying, "Why don't we all kneel in prayer?"<br><br>They did and before he could pray one of those other missionaries prayed in a boisterous, multiplying-words manner. The Spirit didn't change much. Then this young, comparatively inexperienced Mormon elder who felt the Spirit grow within him moved forward prepared now, took his turn. It was a gentle prayer--a prayer of thanksgiving for a prophet today, for an additional witness that Christ is the Redeemer, for a gospel that gives people answers when they need them. The prayer was over, the others quickly left, and the investigator made plans to join the Church.<br><h2><b>Taking Time to Seek the Lord</b></h2><br>A prepared army--this is what we need. We need to do what Christ did, brothers and sisters, to grow as he did in the synagogue, learning and listening and praying. We need to go to the wilderness, to go to the mount; to take ourselves to a place apart; to really find out what it is we have to work with and be filled with the Spirit as we do it.<br><br>I grew up in Salt Lake City on Capitol Hill--many of you know this. But we've been talking about how you get hold of your life and how you prepare. Our house was in the foothills at the big, bald, beehive-shaped mountain in back of the capitol. We used to watch it in winter from our kitchen table where the family ate. We'd watch the skiers make herringbone patterns down. We'd watch the summer hikers. We'd go up there as a family and as Church groups with our lunches squashed down into our sweaters tied around our hips. The day came when--I was about your age, a little younger maybe--I felt that I needed to go to the mountain. I needed to be alone and think lofty thoughts and get my philosophy of life intact and all of that. I set out and climbed that peak by myself. Getting to the top of it and seeing the very interesting perspective of my neighborhood--the places that I walked; the paths I took to church, to school, to the Church leaders, to friends, to the little neighborhood store; and all those people who had been in my life--I realized suddenly with a new awareness that all that I was I owed to them, especially that little white stucco house, scene of my tenderest times and most important learnings, our family home. I knew I had a debt to pay. It seemed like a tremendous debt. I knew I needed to be useful. I knew I needed the help of God, and, when I turned to him, my soul was filled with an awareness that he lives, that he cares even about a little stringed-out person sitting on the top of a mountain thinking she can make a difference in the world.<br><br>This week I was given a gift, unexpected, from somebody I haven't seen since those days when I lived on the hill. It's this little ivory sacrament cup. I remember taking the sacrament from this cup in the Capitol Hill Ward. It came to me from a woman whose son was part of an elders quorum clean-up project in the old basement storage rooms of that building where I went to church and learned those sacred things that we're trying to apply in our lives. Rather than throwing away the sacrament cup, he gave it to his mother and she sent it to me. In my day, as in yours, you take the cup that you may always remember him,that you may have his Spirit to be with you. In Mark 14:23 it says,<br><br><i>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</i><br><br>We may not be able to do exactly what Christ did; we probably won't even be like Phoenix Jackson; but like Van Gogh we can learn to hold that brush, and we can learn to use our skills. Like the Lord Jesus Christ, we can learn how to cultivate the Spirit so that it is there with us, so that we can be as skilled as Carnegie, meeting wants, but with the sensitivity of Christ dealing with the great spiritual needs of people.<br><h2><b>Going Forth to Make a Difference</b></h2><br>This is a wonderful season. This is a great joyous time to be alive in the Church, when there are temples dedicated, two in the valley; when there are marvelous institutions like this and money enough for young people to come and have their brains awakened and enriched and skills developed and hearts and spirits strengthened. But you're not perfect--I hate to tell you this--you are not perfect, and there is much work that needs to be done one with another.<br><br>My prayer always is that I may not be found wanting in a moment of somebody's need; that my cultivation of the Spirit will be effective enough that I can help more than I hurt. I suggest to you that, in this season of thanks and giving, our preparations will be so adequate, so beautiful, so Christlike that we will, in fact, go forth and make a difference. May we prepare to do so is my earnest prayer.<br><br>I leave you with my love and my prayers for you always, my testimony that I can give you through the power of the Spirit in me that Christ lives and loves us and wants us back; and that great reward, great joy, and great blessing of success will come to us as we prepare ourselves to do the work that is ours to do in the kingdom to help Christ bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Elaine A.

<h1> That Matters Most - J. Richard Clarke - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Realizing the time of year it is--that you are getting ready for finals and the kind of hours that you keep--and realizing what I've been through the last few days, I want you to know that I feel just like one of you. I don't know which one of you it is that I feel like, but whoever it is probably ought to be home in bed.<br><h2><b>"Gold, Circumstance, and Mud"--Christmas Gifts</b></h2><br>I would like to begin tonight by reading a story by Rex Knowles. He titles it "Gifts of the Wise Children; or Gold, Circumstance, and Mud."<br><br><i>It was the week before Christmas, I was baby-sitting with our four older children while my wife took the baby for his check-up. (Baby-sitting to me means reading the paper while the kids mess up the house.)</i><br><br><i>Only that day I wasn't reading. I was fuming. On every page of the paper, as I flicked angrily through them, gifts glittered and reindeer pranced, and I was told that there were only six more days in which to rush out and buy what I couldn't afford and nobody needed. What, I asked myself indignantly, did the glitter and the rush have to do with the birth of Christ?</i><br><br><i>There was a knock on the door of the study where I had barricaded myself. Then Nancy's voice, "Daddy, we have a play to put on. Do you want to see it?"</i><br><br><i>I didn't. But I had fatherly responsibilities so I followed her into the living room. Right away I knew it was a Christmas play for at the foot of the piano stool was a lighted flashlight wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a shoe box.</i><br><br><i>Rex (age 6) came in wearing my bathrobe and carrying a mop handle. He sat on the stool, looked at the flashlight. Nancy (10) draped a sheet over her head, stood behind Rex and began, "I'm Mary and this boy is Joseph. Usually in this play Joseph stands up and Mary sits down. But Mary sitting down is taller than Joseph standing up so we thought it looked better this way."</i><br><br><i>Enter Trudy (4) at a full run. She never has learned to walk. There were pillowcases over her arms. She spread them wide and said only, "I'm an angel."</i><br><br><i>Then came Anne (8). I knew right away she represented a wise man. In the first place she moved like she was riding a camel (she had on her mother's high heels). And she was bedecked with all the jewelry available. On a pillow she carried three items, undoubtedly gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</i><br><br><i>She undulated across the room, bowed to the flashlight, to Mary, to Joseph, to the angel, and to me and then announced, "I'm all three wise men. I bring precious gifts: gold, circumstance, and mud."</i><br><br><i>That was all. The play was over. I didn't laugh. I prayed. How near the truth Anne was! We come at Christmas burdened down with gold--with the showy gift and the tinsely tree. Under the circumstances we can do no other, circumstances of our time and place and custom. And it seems a bit like mud when we think of it.</i><br><br><i>But I looked at the shining faces of my children, as their audience of one applauded them, and remembered that a Child showed us how these things can be transformed. I remembered that this Child came into a material world and in so doing eternally blessed the material. He accepted the circumstances, imperfect and frustrating, into which He was born, and thereby infused them with the divine. And as for mud--to you and me it may be something to sweep off the rug, but to all children it is something to build with.</i><br><br><i>Children see so surely through the tinsel and the habit and the earthly, to the love which, in them all, strains for expression.</i>[<i>The Guideposts Christmas Treasury</i>(Carmel, NY: Guideposts Associates, 1972), pp. 197‚Äì98]<br><br>Now, I realize that story carries a little risk because it is so interestingly told. I suppose we look to the gifts of children, and by children we are taught. Christmas is so often interpreted by children. I have record of a fifth grade at Christmas time in High Point, North Carolina. The teacher asked them to answer this question: "If you could give any gift you wanted to, what would you give and to whom?" Here are some of the students' responses:<br><br>John Brandon said, "The gift I would most like to give would be love. It lasts forever and never grows dull. It can be given to anyone that you like."<br><br>Fonda Hunter said, "If I could give one gift I would give it to my parents. If I could get them to get along together. And live together forever. Year after year, and month after month. If I could give that gift, I would give anything in this world if they would live together. And make up their minds if they are going to live together."<br><br>Amanda Green said, "I would give a small orphan child friendship, fun, and a home where he would be happy. I would tell him never to be sad."<br><br>Laurie Kerr said, "I would give jobs and good homes to the poor and stop poverty all over the world."<br><br>Larry Shaw said, "I would like to give happiness to the people that have not smiled."<br><br>Darlene Byrd said, "If I had one gift, I would give it to my mother. I would give her a washer and dryer. Because I love her and she works too hard."<br><br>Sylvia Johnson finally said, "I would give my crippled grandmother the power to walk. She stays alone down in her home in South Carolina. We left our dog down there to keep her company. She seems real happy when we come; but she gets sad when we leave. She stayed two years in our house, but she wanted to go back home because she thinks she is too much trouble; but she's not." [Adapted from "One Gift to Give,"<i>The Guideposts Christmas Treasury</i>(Carmel, NY: Guideposts Associates, 1972), p. 215]<br><br>If you had the power to give one gift, what would the gift be and to whom would you give it? I've been pondering that the last couple of days. Not the gift you would like to receive, but what gift you would like to give that would make you the most happy this Christmas? As I focused on the gift I'd like to give, I believe that I would go to the statement made by Moroni. I'd like to give this gift to my family more than anyone else, for he said:<br><br><i>Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and ... love God with all your might, mind, and strength.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32?lang=eng#p31">Moroni 10:32</a>]<br><br>I would wish that same gift to all of you tonight. I would wish that same gift to all people everywhere, because I believe that it transcends every other gift. I believe it is the gift that is needed most. It is certainly the gift that I would like most to give.<br><br>I know that Valentine's Day to many of you is the official day of love. But when understood, the day we have set aside to honor the birth of Christ stands preeminent. In celebrating this great day, we commemorate the greatest act of love that has ever been demonstrated. We read:<br><br><i>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, ... that the world through him might be saved.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/3.16-17?lang=eng#p15">John 3:16‚Äì17</a>]<br><h2><b>Importance of Values</b></h2><br>The Christmas season is a wonderful season because it precedes the new year. It begins to temper us. We being to search our hearts deeply in introspection about what kind of a year we have had. What are our essential values? Which are most important to us in our lives? We know that as we come to the first of the year we will be thinking again about new year's resolutions. But I believe it is the preresolution time, as we go through this great religious celebration, that helps us to put things in perspective probably better than any other experience we could have which would be so beneficial in helping us to plan our next year and the many years beyond.<br><br>I believe there are probably two great words which suggest a challenge to all of you. Those two words are<i>change</i>and<i>choice</i>. In an excellent essay Brother Lowell Bennion suggested that there are two worlds. First is the physical world--the world of reality, everything that exists, the laws of nature all around us. With regard to these, we as individuals are quite powerless because these great laws always existed. We didn't have a whole lot to do with them, and we don't have a whole lot to do with them now. There are also many other forces within this world in which we live--politicians, energy czars, hijackers, and highway drivers. We seem to be at the mercy of all of them. They are also somewhat beyond our control.<br><br>Brother Bennion says:<br><br><i>Within this larger context of total reality, I live in a second world</i>[which is even more important]<i>--a world of values. It is a life of my own choosing and building. Within the complexity and multiplicity of reality, I make choices, I choose those things which I prefer, things I desire, things precious to me. I place value on them. They become the things that matter most.</i><br><br><i>As I decide on these values and live by them I gain a sense of individuality, a feeling of creativity, an assurance of measured self-determination. Life becomes purposeful, hence meaningful.</i>[I can take command and feel secure.]<i>... The good life evolves as we learn to live by the things that matter most. ... We become the values we live by.</i>[Lowell L. Bennion,<i>The Things That Matter Most</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978), pp. 19‚Äì22]<br><br>In thinking about this statement of Brother Bennion, I recall with you the event in the Book of Mormon where a great prophet stood chained before a wicked king. In the last little while before he was killed, he bore, without any hesitation, what I believe is one of the most powerful testimonies of the Christ that is recorded in literature. Of course, the wicked king and his court generally rejected the message. But there was one young priest whose heart was touched. He believed, and his life became transformed.<br><br>This young priest, Alma, set in motion one of the greatest dynasties that, I think, has ever been recorded in history. Ten generations of leaders of the Church came because of this one man's decision, this one choice of a young priest. Just imagine! For over five hundred years the Church was led by his descendants; and how blessed we are as we read of their testimonies!<br><h2><b>Your Influence</b></h2><br>Tonight, I have come to testify in behalf of Jesus Christ. How you accept him and how valiant you are in your testimony of him will have an enormous compounding impact upon the Church. That is, this concentration of young Latter-day Saints will have a compounding effect and great impact on the Church for generations. Let me just illustrate it.<br><br>I can't tell you if this story is true, but it's a good story. It is a fable of a young Chinese emperor who became bored and wanted to have someone relieve that boredom with a new kind of game or amusement. So he sent out word that he would give a reward to anyone who could invent a game or amusement that would help him be relieved of his boredom. A young inventor came along, and he brought with him a board with 64 squares and a bunch of little carved images which he called pawns. He sat down with the emperor, and he taught him how to play a game which he called chess. The emperor was so delighted with the game that he said, "This is more than I'd ever hoped for. I'm so appreciative that I'll give you anything in my empire as a reward."<br><br>As the story goes, the young inventor said, "I don't want a reward. I'm happy that it served its purpose."<br><br>The emperor said, "I insist on it. Anything in my empire is yours."<br><br>He said, "Well, if you insist, then this is what I'd like to have you do. I would like you to put a kernel of wheat in the first square of this board. In the second square put two kernels. In the third square put four kernels; in the next one, sixteen; and continue compounding these kernels of wheat until you get to the sixty-fourth square. That's all I want."<br><br>The emperor was insulted. He said, "I've given you your choice of any reward, and this is what you do." He called to his aide and said, "Take this guy out and get him a sack of wheat to pay him off and get him out of here." What they discovered, as they began to pay of the request, was a figure something like this: 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 kernels of wheat. At that time, I am told, it was the equivalent of the world's supply of wheat for five years.<br><br>Now, the point that I want to make is this: You, as Latter-day Saint students, are committed to a testimony of Jesus Christ. Suppose this burns so brightly that you marry, and your husband or wife feels the same way you do about it, and you continue to have a wonderful Christian home--a home of faith and love. If this testimony continues through you to four children (assuming that every one of your descendants has four children), by the time you get to the fourth generation, you will have affected the lives of 256 direct descendants. Suppose this continues on for ten generations. Your choice will have affected the lives of one million people.<br><br>You can work with that any way you want to, but I'm just trying to make the point that the choices we make in our lives are so powerful that, when compounded, they can affect the lives of many generations yet unborn. What will your children believe? What will your grandchildren believe? How strong will your faith be following after you? To whom will you leave your children to teach and to instruct and to direct? Will you leave them to someone else, or will you be the commanding influence? Will you be with your children long enough so that whatever it is you have chosen and what you deeply believe will be those things which affect their lives for good, that will move on into the succeeding generations?<br><h2><b>Knowledge of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>I come to you as a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. I make no special claim to superior knowledge or spiritual gifts. My desire is to express the sincere feelings which I have for the Savior and for our covenant opportunities to serve him. I hope that I may be able to strengthen your testimonies with the few things that I may say in the remainder of this time that you may be able to magnify your life as a Latter-day Saint and Christian.<br><br>There are few false accusations which disturb me quite so much as the one that says that the Mormons are not Christians. We're seen by some uninformed critics as being cultists who are unworthy of full fellowship in the traditional family of Christian churches. Are we Christians? Naturally we'd answer with a resounding yes. Jesus Christ is our Lord and our Savior. We declare with Peter that he is "the Christ, the Son of the living God" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/16.16?lang=eng#p15">Matthew 16:16</a>) and, with John, that grace and truth come by Jesus Christ (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.17?lang=eng#p16">John 1:17</a>). We are his church. We bear his name. And as his church, we are the repository of more information about him and from him than anyone else on the earth.<br><br>The writers of the four Gospels deal with only three years out of thirty-three. They tell us of less than forty days out of those three years in the life of the Savior. Of these selected days, they deal only with fragments and shreds of information. Now, through his great American prophet, Joseph Smith, whom he has called as the Prophet of the dispensation of the fullness of times, he has revealed himself. The Lord has opened the earth and vouchsafed to him the record by the descendants of Joseph, who were brought here from the land of Abraham under His direction, that he might stand as His witness. As He directed the establishment of His church in these latter days, He has revealed the essential doctrines and the instructions for the plan of salvation for true believers everywhere. From the Nephite records we learn the inspired messages carefully selected by holy prophets of ancient America for us, in this generation, for the sole purpose that we might come to a knowledge of Christ.<br><br>Consider what this church has contributed to the knowledge of Jesus Christ. First of all, we have the testimony and the personal witness of Joseph Smith, who was the first since the meridian of time to declare with words of soberness, "I saw. I know because I experienced." What a marvelous statement of fact! Then through the inspired records which he left us, both ancient records and also the revelations of the Lord, he has given us some very powerful information.<br><br>As you know, the brother of Jared had a face-to-face experience with the premortal Christ. Where anywhere would you go for information that would be so powerful and so moving about the Lord Jesus Christ before he took on a tabernacle of flesh? You know the incident where the brother of Jared was in conversation with the Lord concerning light in the ships which had been prepared. Then he saw the finger of the Lord. This conversation pursued from the third chapter of Ether:<br><br><i>And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.6?lang=eng#p5">Ether 3:6</a>]<br><br>He was asked why he had fallen, and he said,<br><br><i>I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.8?lang=eng#p7">Ether 3:8</a>]<br><br>Then the Lord said:<br><br><i>Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.9?lang=eng#p8">Ether 3:9</a>]<br><br>You know what follows: The Lord could not withhold his presence from the brother of Jared because of his mighty faith. He told him that he was redeemed from the fall.<br><br><i>Ye are brought back into my presence; therefore I show myself unto you.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.</i><br><br><i>And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</i><br><br><i>... This body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.13-16?lang=eng#p12">Ether 3:13‚Äì16</a>]<br><br>Where would you go to get a description of the spirit of man that equals this testimony of the brother of Jared?<br><br>There is so much controversy in the world over the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ. Consider the following in the eleventh chapter of 3 Nephi. After the people were prepared through the testimony of the elements, then the voice from heaven testified of the coming of the Christ. Listen to this tender scene. Jesus said to his disciples:<br><br><i>I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. ...</i><br><br><i>Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.10,14-15?lang=eng#p9">3 Nephi 11:10, 14‚Äì15</a>]<br><br>We have again in latter-day scripture, in section 76 and also in section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, testimonies of certainty that men saw the God of heaven, even the Lord Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery testified:<br><br><i>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.22?lang=eng#p21">D&amp;amp;C 76:22</a>]<br><br>I relate these things simply to remind us all that we have so much. We have so many blessings of the knowledge of Jesus Christ through the restoration of the gospel. How much understanding would we have of the atonement of Christ without the record of the Book of Mormon? How much would we know about justice and mercy? In summary, I would simply say that in this great volume of the Book of Mormon--522 pages covering a period of some 1,000 years, records which have been accumulated and abridged simply to testify to the world of the reality of Jesus Christ--we have a treasure for the world that they might know that he is who he claimed to be.<br><br>Have you ever stopped to think that the Doctrine and Covenants also contains the words of Jesus Christ? We have at least 120 revelations given directly by him, containing over 200 pages of instruction by the Lord Jesus Christ to modern Israel--you and me--during this great period.<br><br>Now we read in the book of John, chapter 18, verse 37, of an intriguing dialogue that went on between the Roman governor Pilate and Jesus. Pilate was trying to figure it out. He didn't know what to think of Jesus. He wanted to know if he was a king. Jesus said (in verse 37):<br><br><i>Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</i><br><br>I want to emphasize directly to all of us here that, as disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ today, we have made a covenant that we too will bear witness to the truth and, in so doing, that we will be witnesses of Jesus Christ. We make this covenant at the time of our baptism. As we read in Mosiah 18, the saints at that time covenanted that they were willing to stand as a witness of Jesus, in all places wherever they might be, under all circumstances (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9?lang=eng#p8">Mosiah 18:9</a>). Then, as recorded in section 20 of the Doctrine and Covenants, have you thought about the covenant that we have made as candidates for baptism? I hope that we would be reminded of this and ponder this as we partake of the sacrament as we renew this covenant:<br><br><i>All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p36">D&amp;amp;C 20:37</a>]<br><br>That's a pretty weighty obligation that we have agreed to. I hope that, as we partake of the sacrament, as I said before, we will recognize that we affirm that we do witness unto God, the Eternal Father, that we are willing to take upon us his name.<br><h2><b>Characteristics of Reliable Witnesses of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>I would ask you and me the question, Are we reliable witnesses? BYU collectively represents one of the greatest witnesses to all the world of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You are the product of the system, of the doctrines, of the principles. You are the product of the families and the parents who have sacrificed that you might be here. So much hinges upon the reliability of the witnesses for truth and of the Christ. I'd like to suggest some of the characteristics that we might consider. You may have another list or some other ideas. I'd like to share mine.<br><br>I realize that we're all in the process of becoming what we want to be. None of us has arrived at the place where we are satisfied. But I would think that, first, a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ is one who loves the Lord and is not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Secondly, he or she is one who has a general love for all the children of our Heavenly Father, with a special feeling for those who need him the most and maybe do not look as if they even care or have any interest whatsoever or are not worthy of the blessings. The rebellious, the unconverted, the disbelieving--they need him more than anyone else. It is important for those who know to share their love with those who need. It is easier to fellowship those who are faithful; but can we ignore the sick in spirit and reserve the medicine only for those who are well?<br><br>I believe a witness for Jesus Christ would practice integrity in all aspects of life. I had an interesting experience a few years ago. I came down to general conference from Idaho. I went to purchase some merchandise at ZCMI and to cash a check. They didn't know me, and so they sent me up to the cashier. She asked for some identification. I reached into my wallet and took out some credit cards. Inadvertently, my temple recommend fell out. The cashier said, "I'll accept that."<br><br>I said, "You'll accept what?"<br><br>She said, "Your temple recommend. It's current, isn't it?"<br><br>"Yes," I said, "it's current."<br><br>"That's fine," she said.<br><br>Well, I thought about that. You know how you get an idea, and then pretty soon the idea gets you. I thought about it all the way home. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if we had a Mormon credit card, and a card-carrying Mormon could be depended on to keep his word and pay his bills--a card carrying Mormon, who, as a teacher, would teach until there was understanding (that may be a tall order); a mechanic who would honestly repair automobiles; a tradesman who would be a craftsman; one who would practice integrity in every way?" Wouldn't it be great to be a peculiar people on the basis of our honesty and not our Word of Wisdom or a former marriage practice? I think that is a stimulating challenge. I don't know how you'd like to be known as peculiar, but that's a peculiarity I'd like to see all over the world--that Mormons and integrity are synonymous.<br><br>I believe a witness for Christ would have forsaken spiritual Babylon or the wickedness of the world while in the world, striving to escape its corruption. This is a great challenge. We cannot be reliable witnesses with one foot in spiritual Babylon and the other foot inside the kingdom of God. We cannot straddle the fence. We've got to make a decision with our lives. The Lord Jesus Christ had a special attitude about those who couldn't make up their minds, recorded in the book of Revelation (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/rev/3.15-16?lang=eng#p14">Revelation 3:15‚Äì16</a>). I think we ought to ask ourselves, Are we trying to do both?<br><br>In the temple the other day, Elder Hales brought an interesting thought to our mind. He said, "There was once a time when the standards of the Church were here [indicating a fixed point] and the world was here [indicating a point some distance away]. The standards of the world are moving further away, and some of our people are confused because they believe it is necessary to keep the distance between the two points the same. So as the world continues to ripen more in iniquity, we can become confused if we try to maintain the same distance between the two." I believe it is possible to become boiled a degree at a time in the waters of Mammon. I believe we have to be careful that we don't become too open minded. As I think George Bernard Shaw said, "We better be careful we don't get caught in the draught." We need to be sure that, as the world changes, we maintain and uphold our standards.<br><br>What do you do for entertainment? The movies today and the shows on television are changing their standards. They are changing their rating system so that it will be a little more appealing. Can you depend upon the rating system today? I heard a couple of young people talking about a particular television show. They said, "Well, it wasn't too bad. It had a couple or three rough spots in it--a little adultery and murder and obscenity and brutality and quarreling and profanity and dishonesty. But other than that, it was a pretty good show." I don't know what kind of boiling system we're going through where somehow evil doesn't look like evil anymore. We can become homogenized in our judgment, in our discrimination, in our values, to the point where we can't discern between good and evil if we're not careful. It can happen gradually, like freezing to death. We can become seriously numb before we even know it.<br><br>I heard a couple of girls on the elevator in the Church Office Building the other day. One of them said, "well, I can't go (to whatever Church meeting it was). That's my night for 'Dallas.'"<br><br>I said, "Hey, maybe I didn't hear right." Is that where we are? I believe a witness for Christ can tell the difference between the standards of Babylon and the standards of Zion.<br><br>I think that a witness for Christ develops a love for the scriptures and the word of the Lord through the living oracle. I just came back from Australia, where President Dan Ludlow is presiding over a mission in Perth. I was impressed that he is teaching his missionaries to love the scriptures in Perth. I was even more impressed at the way his own children expressed a great love for the scriptures. Undoubtedly they have grown up with scripture study. To them, it wasn't a penalty. It seemed to be a great privilege to take time to discuss the scriptures, which they did beautifully.<br><br>I believe a disciple of Christ and a witness for him is one who is developing an ability for communion with the Lord through prayer. Now I didn't say just prayer. I said a<i>communion</i>. Some time ago I heard one of the Brethren say, "I believe prayer is the most singular important activity that gauges spirituality." If you think about it, when we are right with the Lord, we want to pray. We feel good about praying. We want to report to the Lord and talk with him. If our heart is not right, that is what we don't want to do. We want to stay away from the Lord. And, of course, that is the time when we need prayer the most.<br><br>Brother Marion G. Romney told us one day (and I think I'm quoting accurately) that, when he was one of the presidents of a seventies quorum in the Salt Lake Valley, they were asked to come in to have a meeting occasionally with the seven Presidents of the Seventy, during the time when Elder B.H. Roberts was one of the seven Presidents. He said that when Elder Roberts would pray, it was the most illuminating experience that he's ever had. He said, "He talked to the Lord like no other individual I've ever heard. I wanted to open my eyes several times to see if He was in the room." It is said that B.H. Roberts, who was perhaps the most prolific writer in the history of the Church, a man of great intellect, once said that he considered it was his highest achievement, after a lifelong period of association with the Lord, that he had learned how to pray. The talent of spirituality exceeds all other talents and is within the grasp of all of us.<br><h2><b>Our Individual Responsibility</b></h2><br>Now, brothers and sisters, while the invitation to come unto the Lord is extended to all mankind, we have to respond individually. Salvation is an individual experience. As we ascend the mountain of the Lord, we discover that the path is steep and rocky. We're tempted to leave the path and look for shortcuts. Such a course always proves to be a hazardous, time-consuming experience and even fatal. I'd admonish you to follow the proven path. It may be steeper; but in the end, it's certainly easier.<br><br>You've read in the Book of Mormon where Lehi and his family, just before they went into the wilderness, were given a very curious compass they called the Liahona. The interesting thing about that compass was that it didn't just tell you the direction you were going, but the direction you should go. It was controlled by the faith in God of Lehi and his family. As they grew closer to the Lord, the compass worked very well.<br><br>I think that each of us has that kind of a compass. We are given the gift of the Holy Ghost. The closer we live to the Spirit, the closer will be our adherence to the path of righteousness, and we will eliminate much error in our lives. If we live in such a way that we offend the Spirit, the Spirit withdraws itself, and we are then left to our own devices. To the extent that we honor our covenants, the Lord will sanctify our lives and will guide us unto all truth, which keeps us on the path that leads to eternal life.<br><br>If we yield to the enticing temptations of Satan, then we have to remember that Satan has no power over us that we do not give him. We first must reject the Spirit before Satan has power over us. It is this relationship with the Spirit that is so important for us to remember.<br><br>Let us not gamble with our souls. There are some who ask, "What does it matter if we indulge in a few pursuits of the flesh? We can always repent." As Matthew Arnold once said,<br><br><i>We do not what we ought;</i><br><i>What we ought not, we do;</i><br><i>And lean upon the thought</i><br><i>That chance will bring us through.</i><br>[<i>Empedocles on Etna,</i>act 1, sc. 2, 1. 237]<br><br>This is dangerous thinking! How much time do we have? The gift of repentance must not be trifled with. God will not be mocked. Do you think our Savior would pay such a heavy price to atone for the sins of those who knowingly disregard and spurn his wonderful gift?<br><br>I wish I could explain and describe my feelings for the Savior. I cannot comprehend the depth of his love. I don't understand how he could love enough to suffer as much as he has. That is beyond my comprehension. All I know is that I am grateful for the gift. I am grateful that we are members of a Church which has the knowledge and the understanding of the Lord Jesus Christ as we do. In the words of the hymn:<br><br><i>I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,</i><br><i>Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me;</i><br><i>I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,</i><br><i>That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.</i><br><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me,</i><br><i>Enough to die for me!</i><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</i><br><br><i>I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine</i><br><i>To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;</i><br><i>That he would extend his great love unto such as I,</i><br><i>Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.</i><br><br><i>I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!</i><br><i>Such mercy, such love, and devotion can I forget?</i><br><i>No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,</i><br><i>Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.</i><br><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me,</i><br><i>Enough to die for me!</i><br><i>Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</i><br>[Charles H. Gabriel, "I Stand All Amazed,"<i>Hymns</i>, no. 80]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, I hope more than anything else that tonight you have thought about you and the Christ, and that you will take the time to read the account of what he has done for us. I want you to know that, by the power of the Holy Ghost, I know that he lives. I know that he is the Messiah, that he is the Creator of this earth, that he is the Only Begotten of the Father. I know that he appeared to the great American prophet, Joseph Smith. We do not worship Joseph Smith any more than the Jews and we worship Moses for introducing Jehovah to the Israelites. But we love the Prophet because he was a witness for Jesus Christ, and he brought us so much information about Him and a powerful testimony that is a certainty in a day of doubt. We need that. I testify to you that every one of us may know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, and I testify to you from the depths of my heart; and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>J.
