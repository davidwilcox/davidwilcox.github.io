<h1>fe - Elaine L. Jack - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Just before the children of Israel crossed into the promised land, Moses, their leader, gave them a great final lecture. Their leader for forty years, Moses delivered this sermon about the essential knowledge of life, knowing full well he would not accompany his people into their new homeland. What would he have said this last time? Moses told his people the most important things to know if they were to live happily and return to their Heavenly Father.<br><br>Near the end of his message he laid out their choices very clearly. He said these significant words:<br><br><i>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</i><br><br><i>That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days.</i>[Deuteronomy 30: 19–20]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, like Moses, I stand watching you, the young adults of the Church, prepare to cross into many lands of promise. Tonight I repeat Moses' words and ask you to choose life, to understand with your heart and your head that the Lord is indeed your "life, and the length of thy days."<br><br>To "choose life" is only possible when we understand that we have the power to do it. In the book of Moses we read about Enoch's discussion with the Lord. At one point Enoch recorded,<br><br><i>The God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept....</i><br><br><i>And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i><br><br><i>And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever;</i><br><br><i>...how is it thou canst weep?</i><br><br><i>The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;</i><br><br><i>And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood.</i>[Moses 7:28–33]<br><br>The power of agency is enormous. From the beginning of men and women's journey through mortality on this earth, agency has been a critical factor. The Lord gave us agency so we might choose for ourselves. When Moses told us to "choose life," he wasn't speaking lightly. He was suggesting that when it comes right to the bottom line, each of us makes a decision to obey the commandments or not to obey them.<br><br>There are many and varied circumstances that exist in each individual's life that govern our views of the world. But agency is still there, given to all. Your ability to choose can be one of your greatest blessings, if you learn to use it well.<br><br>A young man newly out of graduate school got a new job, bought a home, and made all kinds of plans to remodel it into his dream home, complete with a gym and study. Within seven months he got engaged to a woman with three young daughters. Six months after they were married his wife was expecting a baby. Things weren't easy for this family. The young man's job was promising but not lucrative. To meet expenses he took a second job as a newspaper delivery man.<br><br>One Saturday morning, cold and early, he pulled out of his driveway listening to a blues song on the radio. He resonated to the song about love and life and the pain of trying to get ahead in a grueling world, and he sank right into the blues himself. As he drove from site to site making his deliveries, the blues deepened into what you might call the<i>blue funk.</i>Now, to be in the blue funk is to feel like two cents looking for change. It is to think hope has gone south for the winter and has forgotten to come back.<br><br>As the sun crept into a new day, he thought about his life. He mentally looked at the faces of each one in his family and walked through the halls of his home. He considered his profession, his extended family, his neighborhood, and his church responsibilities. He weighed the complexities and challenges, the satisfactions and pleasures. And into his mind came one sentence: "Life doesn't get any better than this."<br><br>He said,<br><br><i>It was a realization that arrived unbidden. It didn't mean life couldn't get any easier or that I wanted to have the blues. It simply meant I had everything I needed. And it hadn't been that way when I lived alone and roamed my house, planning the interior.</i>[Bruce Sylvester, "Making Room,"<i>Christian Science Monitor,</i>25 August 1992, p. 19]<br><br>Some years later he invited his aging parents to come live with him and his family. As he rose at 3 A.M. daily to help his mother with her needs, he often thought, "Life doesn't get any better than this." He never got his library or gym, but in the midst of his very full house, he thanked the Lord often for what was also a very full life.<br><br>In the midst of finals, a romantic crisis, or a conflict with a spouse or roommates, it's a sign of spiritual and emotional maturity to remember "life doesn't get any better than this." That's because it's your life right now, and nothing is more invigorating than living your life, which is truly the process of making your choices based on the gospel of Jesus Christ. To do so is to really live.<br><br>A woman came into my office a few months ago. She was in tears as she described the challenges of living in these days. Her husband was in school and working, but he wasn't as satisfied with his job as he thought he could be. Her children were healthy and prospering, but they didn't have all the things she wanted to give them. Her house was comfortable, but it wasn't as large as she had dreamed it would be at this point in her life. Her friends were supportive, but they didn't give her as much time and attention as she wished they would. Her in-laws loved her, but her mother-in-law couldn't help her with the children as often as this young mother thought she should.<br><br>Another woman wrote me that she had lost hope of ever finding a man she could marry. She described in detail her failed relationships and efforts to find a husband. She talked about her diminished feelings of self-worth and her questions about whether or not the Lord really loved her as she'd been taught in church all her life. She has a good job, good health, good friends, good family. Yet she spoke of life in dismal terms and referred to herself as a second-class citizen in the Church. Fully realizing that I don't walk in either woman's shoes and that each has justified concerns, I still want to give this bit of counsel: Get a life. We are sons and daughters of God. We have the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are called to rise, not wallow. Brothers and sisters, let's get a life.<br><br>At this time of year I find myself reading the story of Lehi and his family. Few stories in scripture tell more about the process of getting a life. After years in the wilderness and a lot of what he could justifiably complain about, Nephi wrote,<br><br><i>We did pitch our tents by the seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore.</i>[1 Nephi 17:6]<br><br>Difficulty is an essential element in the bedrock underlying mortality and does not preclude rejoicing. Everything doesn't have to be marvelous for us to rejoice. Earlier in the same chapter of 1 Nephi, Nephi says this about their journey:<br><br><i>And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.</i>[1 Nephi 17:2]<br><br>Nephi then adds what is almost a postscript about this experience:<br><br><i>And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them.</i>[1 Nephi 17:3]<br><br>To get a life is to build on the good bedrock of your own experiences and testimony. Nephi made his choice young. He chose life, and despite the remarkable series of trials that came into his own life, he did not waver. He knew where he was going spiritually, so he could hold on even while he was lost in a desert wilderness.<br><br>To get a life is to be strong. The two women I just referred to are leading good lives, but they've lost heart for the tasks that are theirs. President Hinckley's stirring message at the October 1992 priesthood meeting is instructive to all of us. He said, "Be strong," and he talked about how we can do that through self-discipline, standing for the right, showing mercy, simple honesty, and having personal faith. Personal faith requires strength and is a source of strength at the same time. As Nephi explained about his family's experiences in the wilderness, the Lord will nourish and strengthen us and give us the means to accomplish the thing he commands us.<br><br>Personal faith is a reality you need in your life. It's a source of strength and comfort and resolution under the happiest and most trying moments of your life. If you want to get a life, get a testimony. Yours may be a life of little or lots of money, considerable or conservative success, a married life or a single life. In every circumstance choose to be strong so, like Nephi, you can weather the thousands of circumstances that will be part of mortality.<br><br>To get a life is to rejoice in the dailiness of living. Leo Tolstoy wrote in<i>Anna Karenina</i>about Levin, a Russian landowner. One day he chose to mow hay with the peasants who worked his fields. At first all he could think of were the developing blisters on his hands and the constant aching of his bent back. The rows seemed longer and longer as he worked through them. He feared he wouldn't be able to keep up with the others. But then Tolstoy describes this, just as Levin was about to give in:<br><br><i>Another row, and yet another row, followed--long rows and short rows, with good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost all sense of time, and could not have told whether it was late or early now. A change began to come over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction. In the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing, and it came all easy to him.</i>[Leo Tolstoy,<i>Anna Karenina,</i>trans. Constance Garnett (New York: Random House, 1939), p. 301]<br><br>There's a kind of magic in getting into a task so thoroughly that you relish the process itself. Maybe that's why some of us get so much satisfaction from full jars of fruit in a storage room. Others may find it in a completed term paper or in an overhauled motorcycle or in cleaning the neighbor's garage. The tasks give us the opportunity to literally throw ourselves into work that brings us joy.<br><br>Looking at a freshly mowed lawn, a completed family group sheet, a photocopied dissertation, loaves of perfect homemade bread, a washed and polished car, a poem just written with an elegant turn of phrase, or an exam well-taken and then reflecting that it is good--these are some of the most satisfying experiences of life. Life at its best is in these moments. We're rejoicing in the harvest and reaffirming that we are indeed made in our Creator's likeness, for he, too, paused after his six days of labor, looked on everything that he had made, and saw that it was good. Rejoicing in the harvest goes hand in hand with acknowledging our Creator. One who looks at a full granary and remembers the plowing time, the planting time, the weeding time, and the gathering time must also remember the miracle beyond his own power that brought that seed to fruition.<br><br>To get a life is to be grateful. When we see most clearly, we see the Lord's hand in everything. The truly grateful, like Nephi, dwell on the goodness of life even while acknowledging that there may be more adversity than there are even words to describe it. Perhaps the biggest difference between Nephi and his elder brothers was Nephi's unwavering ability to graduate through all kinds of spiritual levels as he increased in gratitude and faith while Laman and Lemuel never progressed past murmuring, withholding, and rebellion--low-level pursuits, indeed.<br><br>Each of us only has so much energy and time in a day. Nephi put his energy into activities reflecting his faith and thanksgiving. Laman and Lemuel sowed their energies in the barren fields of discontent, disaffection, and disbelief. Their lack of gratitude led to endless mortal trouble for Nephi and endless eternal trouble for themselves.<br><br>In my experience I've learned that the people who are spiritually mature are people who are truly grateful. I've felt humbled to meet people whose very lives as well as their words express their gratitude for the blessings of life and for the blessings of truth. In the Philippines a young mother was thankful for a small, old-fashioned sewing machine that had allowed her to earn the extra money she needed for their family with eight children to travel to the Manila Temple to be sealed together. Thousands of Saints are leading a rich life, whether they are living in a mansion in Jakarta or in a home with a leaking roof. In a home with a leaking roof, a sister expressed gratitude that two of her daughters had done extremely well in final tests that qualified them to be midwives, and then explained to me that sometimes she has to "wear an umbrella" in the kitchen when it rains.<br><br>Sometimes I fear we have expectations that the good life is the life being led by someone else. The truth is that the good life is the life you have, for it's the only one you can lead. I believe Nephi understood that--with a full heart he could thank the Lord in the midst of trials that often were life threatening. To thank the Lord for his blessings to us is to understand how good life is, even when it seems unpleasant, unsuccessful, or just plain hard.<br><br>To get a life is to think about and to do for others. During 1992, Relief Society women throughout the world have joined together in service projects in their own communities. I know many of you were involved. A sister from Peru wrote that the women of her Relief Society had helped a family whose mother had died. The sister said, "We felt fellowshipped and strengthened spiritually, and we were happy to have been able to imitate our Lord, Jesus Christ, by serving our needy brothers and sisters."<br><br>Women in the Apia Samoa East Stake told us,<br><br><i>We ... decided to approach the government if it was all right for the Stake Relief Society sisters to plant some flowers around the town clock. We chose the town clock because it is right in the middle of the town, and we felt it would be just the right place to have a beautiful garden. Its flowers would bear the theme of the Relief Society, "Charity Never Faileth." The government was thrilled. ... They thanked us wholeheartedly, and then they asked us if there was any way we could paint the 20-foot clock tower as well. We told them ... we would see what we could do. ... The stake did not have money, which did not worry us a bit. We only wanted them to approve it, as we had a strong feeling and belief if it was the will of the Lord, things will work out. ... Paints and equipment were donated, professional painters offered themselves and their time, and the priesthood of our ... stake also helped out with the work. The sisters of the eight units of our stake worked in scraping the old paint off, scrubbing and cleaning the clock tower, and, of course, in planting the flowers. We will be taking turns in maintaining the gardens there for the whole year. Again, the sisters were generous and willing.</i><br><br>I love these stories and the many others that sisters have sent to Relief Society. Can you imagine the good that has been done in over a hundred nations by thousands of Relief Society sisters? Can you imagine the blessings that have come into the lives of those women? If you do not learn to do for others, yours will be a dull life.<br><br>I think the best experiences I've had in my life have all involved helping others. Maybe it was setting up a game at a family reunion or merit badge counseling. Such good times have come from working in Church callings, in directing a road show or teaching Laurels or in neighborhood projects, maybe organizing a worthy fund drive. In every case I've enjoyed situations in which I could work with others on some good cause.<br><br>The motto of Relief Society is "Charity Never Faileth." What a great thing to base an organization on the most important values of our faith.<br><br>To get a life is to remain open to new ideas. Not long ago I heard the story of a man who was leaving a long career in one industry. Still a relatively young man, he had to get another job to support his family. The transition would be rough since he had never worked anywhere other than at his first job. At the meeting of a community group of which he was a member, a subject relating to this longtime job came up. He leaned back in his chair and immediately began to tell the group how things were in that industry, all the problems currently in the marketplace, and why he was right. After a rather lengthy oration, he critiqued the ideas being proposed and basically left the group without hope that anything could be done.<br><br>When the meeting adjourned one committee member said to another, "I think our friend will have a hard time getting another job. The ability to pontificate is not very marketable these days." How true that is! It's easy to use old knowledge and experiences to shoot down current or future possibilities. It's easy to say, "Well, in my mission field it was done like this," or, "In my last job we did it like that."<br><br>It's a lot harder and a lot wiser to use what you know as the basis of creating something new and better. The Lord commanded Nephi, "Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters" (1 Nephi 17:8). Nephi responded, "Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?" (1 Nephi 17:9).<br><br>Probably Nephi had some knowledge of toolmaking and possibly of building. I doubt he knew much about ships. But he was willing to apply what he knew to a new situation. His brothers, on the other hand, had no desire to enter into this new domain--an unknown domain. Instead, they did what people often do when they're afraid, unsure, unskilled, or lazy--they criticized and demeaned Nephi. Nephi noted,<br><br><i>And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.</i><br><br><i>And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship.</i>[1 Nephi 17:17–18]<br><br>You recall that it took divine intervention before Laman and Lemuel would get to work.<br><br>Lack of belief is a convenient excuse for not undertaking new projects. New tasks can be very frightening, but they are good for us, too. They force us out of our current comfort zones. Sometimes we need to leave our spiritual comfort zone. The hard work we do spiritually will benefit us in many, many ways, just as the hard work you are currently doing intellectually and professionally will have lifelong value.<br><br>To get a life is to respect others. There are many times in our working relationships when we would do well to check our egos at the door along with our coats. Church callings are one of those times. We all serve along with others. We work in presidencies and bishoprics or as members of the corp of teachers in Sunday School or in the auxiliaries or quorums. We serve two by two as home or visiting teachers or as missionary companions. Presidents serve with counselors or advisors. All of this togetherness is for a good purpose. These working relationships teach us to work together. We have the benefit of others' ideas and spiritual insights. We join as brothers and sisters in synergistic relationships that benefit those who serve and those we serve. These working relationships may not always be easy.<br><br>In the Church we are not building a kingdom, we are building<i>the</i>kingdom. We only do this when we are unified and truly working together. An early Church leader, George Q. Cannon, remarked, "We are not the people of God when we are not united. Union is one of the fruits of the Spirit" (George Q. Cannon,<i>Gospel Truth,</i>comp. Jerreld L. Newquist [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987], p. 165). When we fail to work in unity in our Church positions, we prevent the Lord from blessing us as he could. When was the last time you asked those with whom you serve, "How can I help?" "What do you need?"<br><br>You will realize great growth in sincerely asking those questions often and then acting on the responses you get. These questions suggest humility, the ability to listen, to learn, to collect feedback from others. They help us realize that we know we are not the center of the universe but rather one important worker in the Lord's kingdom, a kingdom that is eternal in scope and significance. We are valuable, each of us; and because we are, we should treat each other with respect.<br><br>To get a life is to be kind. Few things are as healing as simple kindnesses--a gentle touch, a pat on the arm, an encouraging word, patient silence, a probing question when something is obviously wrong, a withholding of judgment until all the facts are known. If we are sincere about being followers of Christ, if we really mean it when we partake of the sacrament on Sunday or attend a temple session, we will be kind.<br><br>We are called to kindness by the scriptural definitions of charity and godlike working relationships. Paul wrote, "Charity suffereth long, and is kind" (1 Corinthians 13:4). Mormon said, "Charity suffereth long, and is kind" (Moroni 7:45). Joseph Smith penned, "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42).<br><br>We owe each other kindness. Kindness can be shown in so many small ways. The scriptures don't say that we should go on a date with someone we don't choose to be with. They only say we must be kind in saying no to the offer. The scriptures don't say we have to loan money to a brother or sister, or to a roommate. They don't tell us we have to write a paper for a boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse. They do say clearly that we must be kind about our dealings with one another. Kindness does require that we measure our own responses against a righteous standard. Sometimes kindness means we should keep quiet or leave a situation. Sometimes kindness requires us to remain and try to make things right. Ask yourself before you act or speak, "Is what I am about to do or say kind?" If it is, proceed confidently. If it isn't, frame another response.<br><br>To get a life is to love life. In Edgar Lee Masters'<i>Spoon River Anthology</i>is a wonderful poem entitled "Lucinda Matlock." In this poem, which reads almost as an epitaph, Lucinda tells of her hard life, her challenges, and joys. She concludes:<br><br><i>What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,</i><br><i>Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?</i><br><i>Degenerate sons and daughters,</i><br><i>Life is too strong for you--</i><br><i>It takes life to love Life.</i><br><br>Two friends were talking. The one was outlining her concerns about graduate school and her upcoming finals. She was also worried about her boyfriend and getting married before she graduated. She wondered if she could find work after she did get her degree. Her father wasn't very well, and she was worried about getting together enough money to go visit him. She was feeling some stress in her roommate situation, too, and wondered about trying to find another place to live. The friend listened carefully and then asked, "Which of these problems can you really do anything about right now and which are just recreational anxiety?"<br><br>The next time you consider spending some time in recreational anxiety, consider Nephi's words about our Savior:<br><br><i>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.</i>[1 Nephi 19:9]<br><br>Nephi reminds us that our Savior suffered willingly because of his love for us. There is nothing we experience that our Lord does not understand.<br><br>I know this to be true. At times when I feel overwhelmed or alone, unsure or defeated, I remember that I have a Savior who understands and loves me. His atonement was personal; it was for me. He knows. He understands.<br><br>When Moses gave the last lecture I referred to at the beginning of these remarks, he knew what he was sending his people into. He told them, "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid ... for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Deuteronomy 31:6). He knew they were not going into a new land alone. Unfailing help was with them, for the Lord was with them. Moses could, therefore, with confidence counsel that they be strong and of a good courage, for he knew there was a sure base for their strength and courage.<br><br>We go through mortality with the same promise. The Lord is with us and will not forsake us. A friend of mine tells her older children, "Pray at night, plan in the morning." What she means is that night is the time for rest for body, mind, and soul. Day is the time for action. I like the sign one of my neighbors has over her kitchen sink: "Every night I turn my worries over to God. He's going to be up all night anyway."<br><br>When the urge for recreational anxiety hits, remember courage, for the Lord knows and understands, and he loves you. Six years ago Elder Bruce R. McConkie, a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles for twelve years, lay on his deathbed. His wife, Amelia, leaned down to him and said, "Bruce, do you have a message for me?" Though weak and dying, he responded in a firm voice with his last words, "Carry on" (see Marvin J. Ashton, "Stalwart and Brave We Stand,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 36).<br><br>To carry on--what a grand message. What a way to live and love life.<br><br>The choices Moses laid out are<i>the</i>choices. You are wonderful. Get a life by choosing the Lord, "for he is thy life." I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Elaine L. Jack was the Relief Society general president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 3 January 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e Attitudes and the Happy Life - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<b>Janet:</b>Several months ago while Rex and I were attending a BYU regional conference, we sat on the stand overlooking a sea of students. My mind whirled back over the years, remembering treasured moments from my own BYU experiences. I recalled having heart-to-heart talks with my roommates, walking through gently falling snow on the way home from the library, and reading or getting ready to go out without the responsibility of house and children. I also remembered feeling the sense of accomplishment when a paper was completed or an exam behind me, falling in love, and graduation.<br><br>When the meeting was over and Rex and I were on our way home, I remarked to him how much I missed those good old days. I asked Rex, "Don't you wish you could go back and live a few of those carefree days again?" My husband, who is more realistic than I am, and very much more practical, laughed and replied, "I think you have selective memory."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Selective indeed. Of course it was nice to get those papers turned in, or to perform well on a test. But what about the hours of drudgery that went into those papers? And what about the times when the test performance left you wondering why you ever gave up your newspaper route? That probably never happened to you, my friend, but it certainly did to me. And how about the winter semester when every morning I had to leave an hour early to walk to a seven o'clock class at Page School because we couldn't afford gasoline for the car, which in any event we were sharing with my brother?<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Now wait just a minute. Time out. You had to walk to school through snow for an hour every morning to get to class? You are starting to sound like my father. I think you're the one with selective memory.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Well, I'm the only one who knows, because I'm the only one who did it. But if you want to verify my statistics, just get up some cold, snowy morning and walk from where we used to live over to Page School. You'll see. Sixty minutes. Right on the button.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Well, maybe if you had to dig a tunnel through sixteen feet of snow, but since you brought it up, your "hour-long" walks to save gas were not the only consequence of our financial circumstances. Trying to keep both of us alive on $10 a week was no small challenge.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Ten dollars?<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Well, maybe $10 plus a little change.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Whatever it was, it was no big deal. Whenever things got really tough, I would just exercise my powers as student body president and schedule another banquet.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I thought you only did that on your dish night.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Whatever. Once we got beyond the joking stage, Janet's comments brought forth to me a rich outpouring of memories and reactions. In the first place, however selective her memory, she was basically right. Those were happy days. BYU was then and is now a wonderful place to live and learn. But my initial response was also correct. Most of us do tend to be selective in the memories that we manage to lodge in our permanent inventory. And on balance, selective memories are a good thing, because they make life more pleasant.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>As I have thought more about that conversation, it has occurred to me that selectivity affects our lives in more ways than just what we remember. Today we would like to talk to you about another kind of selectivity, selective attitudes.<br><br>Positive attitudes not only determine our happiness but can also have a direct effect on many aspects of our lives, including our health. Five years ago when Rex was in the hospital suffering from cancer, I asked his doctor what role his positive attitude would play in his recovery. He was undergoing very serious chemotherapy and radiation and was receiving several antibiotics to counter infections that were rampant in his body. In answer to my question, the doctor replied, "Attitude is everything." I received a similar response from Dr. Russell M. Nelson when he performed a second open-heart surgery on my father. I wanted to know whether it was his skillful hands or my father's will that would pull him through. Humbly, the great doctor and future apostle replied, "His will to live means more than anything I can do."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>We now sustain Dr. Nelson as a prophet, seer, and revelator. He is one who understands the complete gospel plan, including our Heavenly Father's relationship to us--and therefore the role that selective attitude could be expected to play--as well as any other human being. By contrast, I have no idea whether Dr. Rosenberg had any belief in supernatural powers. Yet they both reached similar conclusions concerning the effects of attitude on something as important as life itself.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Each of us comes to this existence with a certain set of circumstances with which we deal. Some of you are smarter than the rest of us, some more healthy or witty or coordinated or artistic. Most of the differences are largely outside of our control. But we do control what we accomplish with what we have been given and, even more important, the attitude we have about the circumstances with which we came into life. At stake is nothing less significant than the difference between happiness and self-pity.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>There is a person who does this very well. His name is Jason Hall. I'm constantly amazed at what he and his wife, Collette, are able to do, but even more amazing is the attitude with which they do it. I mean, the man seems to be everywhere, and doing everything. I make my own great variety of appearances at official BYU events, and there he is. Yet at the same time he is a husband, a student, and our student body president. And most relevant of all to today's discussion, he and Collette do it in a total personal environment in which they enjoy life--indeed, love life--and from everything I can tell, extract from life everything that our mortal years have to offer. And the point is, of course, that because of that selective attitude they are happier. They are also more productive, make better progress toward the eternal life that is the objective of all of us, and in the process help not just themselves but other people as well.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Jason's experience brings to mind a book I recently read entitled<i>You Gotta Keep Dancin'.</i>It's by Tim Hansel, who several years ago experienced a near-fatal climbing accident that has left him in constant pain. His book tells how he has learned to deal with this pain by distinguishing between happiness and joy. He says,<br><br><i>There is nothing wrong with happiness, it's wonderful.</i>. . .<i>The only problem is that it is based on circumstances, and circumstances have a tendency to shift. Most people who live with chronic pain</i>[or chronic problems]<i>have a hard time being happy. That is to be expected. Although there are moments of laughter, nothing seems to stay.</i><br><br><i>Joy on the other hand is something which defies circumstances, and occurs in spite of difficult situations. Whereas happiness is a feeling, joy is an attitude.</i><br><br><b>Rex:</b>Let me tell you how these thoughts and Jason's example have helped me in a very specific way concerning a change that has come into my life over the past few months. So far, only a few people at BYU know about it, but for two reasons I have concluded that this is the time to share it with you. First, it ties so nicely to the point we are making about selective attitudes. And second, when you see me walking a little more deliberately than I used to, I don't want you to worry about it.<br><br>Starting sometime last spring, and gradually increasing since that time, I have developed what my doctors tell me is a peripheral neuropathy, which in English means a damage to some of my nerves. It does not affect my thinking or my ability to express myself, but only my legs and hands. No one is sure what caused it, but it will probably be permanent. You may have noticed--and if you haven't, you certainly will after today--that I walk more slowly and more carefully in order to maintain my equilibrium. There is also some discomfort associated with it, particularly pain in my legs and my abdomen. For some reason, which no one can explain, the pain diminishes significantly when I stand.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>We want to assure you of a couple of good news elements to this story. Extensive tests by highly competent doctors have revealed that there has been no corresponding spread of Rex's cancer, which appears to be as well under control now as it has been since first discovered. But despite this fact, sometimes we are frightened and we worry. And that is why, for both of us, selective attitude has been such a help.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>It makes all the difference in the world how we look at what our world, in fact, consists of. For me these days, walking is a rather deliberate, conscious effort. It takes me longer to get from my office to the Wilkinson Center than it did a few months ago. Moreover, from time to time I am in some pain. But I am alive. My central nervous system, as well as the state of my cancer, has been unaffected, which means that I am able to remain as your president--a position that brings me great joy, and one in which I am surrounded by supportive and understanding colleagues (administrators, faculty, and staff), by you, my fellow students, and my family members.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Rex has told you what a difference people with whom he works and lives have made for him. The same is true for every one of you. The nature of the challenges, as well as their magnitude, will vary from person to person, but there is not a person anywhere for whom selective attitude would not affect the quality of life. And it is equally true that for every one of us the job is easier if there is someone who can help us.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Most of us have roommates, we all have bishops, home teachers, or other spiritual leaders, and we all have family and friends. It is important also to remember that the street runs both ways. While you are working on your own selectivity, remember that there are opportunities to help others who are striving toward that same objective.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I was thinking about this just a few days ago. On snowy, icy days I jog with my daughters at a local indoor track. Over time I have observed the people there who routinely run, walk, limp, or even push their wheelchairs, and I have become strangely drawn to them. It has occurred to me how like the walk of life our struggle is around that track. People come with various abilities, expectations, and goals, and yet we all have one common ambition: We want to get around the track as best we can.<br><br>I like to think of this track as an analogy to life. Everything essential to a good society is present there except for one thing. We are all thinking of ourselves. We are not there to help others. Then, just as I rounded the next curve I saw them: two men walking together, slowly. One was hooked up to an oxygen tank while the other was pushing it for him. Halfway around the track each time they would stop at a resting place for the man on oxygen to regain his strength. My first impression was how wonderful it is that a man of such frail health would come to walk at the track. It takes a lot of courage and a lot of determination. Then, as I watched his companion, I realized more completely that the example of each man was equally compelling. Courage is admirable. Service is Christlike.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>And the beauty is that there will be two beneficiaries of that kind of effort, two people whose attitudes will be more selective and more healthy in every sense of that word. Indeed, I don't mind sharing with you that preparing this particular talk at this time, and doing it conjointly with Janet, has been a very good thing for me personally, and specifically with respect to my own outlook and the selectivity with which I approach it. Jason Hall's physical circumstances are not likely to improve. Frankly, neither are mine. For each of us, those matters are beyond our control. But very much within our control is how those circumstances affect us--or, better said, how we permit them to affect us. And, quite obviously, neither of us is unique in those respects. Every person within the sound of my voice, and many others who are not, are dealing with some challenge, some circumstance, some situation, large or small, not of his or her choosing that each fervently wishes would go away. Think of what your particular one is. I am sure that every one here today has at least one such circumstance. They range all the way from loneliness to not having enough money to get your car fixed to not being accepted into your chosen major to sitting home on Friday night when your roommates have dates. Admittedly, we may not be able to change the circumstance itself. What we can change is the way we choose to deal with it, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>As Rex said, we cannot control some of the circumstances that come into our lives and challenge us. What we can control is how we deal with them. President Kimball summarized this idea beautifully.<br><br><i>One time or another, we all face adversity's chilling wind. One man flees from it, and like an unresisting kite, falls to the ground. Another yields, not retreating an inch, and the wind that would destroy him lifts him as readily to the heights. We are not measured by the trials we meet, only by those we overcome. It all depends</i>[upon] . . .<i>attitudes.</i><br><br><b>Rex:</b>Attitudes. Selective attitudes. Right now I'm struggling with two inner conflicting voices. Each of them speaks to me on a regular basis. My conflict is To which of these should I listen? The first says, on a daily basis:<br><br><i>Isn't it a shame. You'll never run another marathon. To put it bluntly, you have become to the marathon what Bart Simpson is to the Benson Scholarship. You remember all those roughhouse games you used to play with your children, and how many pleasant memories you and they associate with them? How much of that can you still do? And how about that week-long hike you took with your son Tom and other Boy Scouts into the Uintas, and you'd always planned to do the same thing again with the entire family. Forget it. And what about Lake Powell? It will never be the same again. Cliff jumping and waterskiing are out of the question. So are the long hikes that include climbing on steep sandstone hills. Things are really bad.</i><br><br>The other voice, which speaks to me with equal regularity, says:<br><br><i>Things are really good. You are alive. You have a job that you love. Even better, because your central nervous system is unaffected, you can still perform that job. There are still games you can play with your grandchildren, including many of the same ones you used to play with your children. And Lake Powell? There are lots of things you can do there: you can drive the boat, you can ride on the water weenie, you can laugh and joke and play with your children and grandchildren. And, come to think of it, it isn't all that bad to be the one who stands on the bow of the boat and yells out instructions as to where to put the anchors. What you now have is a legitimate excuse to pick the cushy jobs and leave the tough ones to someone else. Moreover, you can still attend BYU plays, concerts, and musicals. Just never mind those people who'll be saying "Who's that weird guy who continues to stand in the middle of the performances?"</i><br><br><b>Janet:</b>It's easy to have a good attitude when everything is going well. On the other hand, we might find ourselves wishing that our lives would always take the direction of our choosing so that we wouldn't have to work so hard on our attitudes. I admit that if I had one wish, it would be for a miracle: that Rex would be made whole again, that he could go on six-mile runs with me, hike on the rocks at Lake Powell, and play rough games of football with the children. I can't help wishing that our back door would fly open and he would come rushing in like the wind and fly up the stairs and down the hall to retrieve a forgotten briefcase from his desk. I must admit that I haven't given up praying for that miracle. But as I do so, I realize that I do not understand all things and that an all-wise and all-knowing Heavenly Father does. If his plan is different from mine, then I pray that I will be given patience and an abundance of love that will carry me through whatever I must do. In the meantime, I am glad that Rex is here with me--glad that we can enjoy so much of life together. I must watch for the small miracles that I am given to sustain me and receive them with a grateful heart. Willa Cather said it in a slightly different, but very effective way: "Miracles rest . . . on our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>I told you a moment ago about the two inner voices that speak to me with some regularity. You know them. They speak to you, too. And yet we know how important our attitude is; we know to which of those voices we should listen. But despite the obviousness of both those issues, it is not always easy to do what we know we should in selecting the right attitude. Let us now suggest some things that have been helpful to us.<br><br>Most important is to enlist our Heavenly Father's help, both directly through prayer and also by living the kind of life that will put and keep us more in tune with the promptings of the Holy Ghost. Beyond that, we offer a few specifics:<br><br>First, selective attitude will work much better if we don't try to do it by ourselves. For most of life's really big problems there will be someone else who is willing and even anxious to shoulder part of the burden. Let them do so. It will be better for you and better for them. Indispensable for me has been the selectivity of Janet's attitude and the remarkable ways that she has generated optimism, enthusiasm, and spiritual strength in me. She is the perfect manifestation of the Savior's admonition to love other people as ourselves. And she is absolutely tireless. All the things that are now a little more difficult for me to do, she simply anticipates in advance and does them.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I could say the same thing about Rex. He came home from work late recently, looking tired. I could see pain in his eyes. But he still asked,<br><br><i>What can I do to help? Have the girls finished their homework? I know you've had a hard day. Let me do the dishes after dinner. Let's get everything done so we can watch the ten o'clock news together.</i><br><br>Or sometimes he suggests going out to dinner or to some event of my choosing even when I know he's too tired. His optimistic nature and sense of humor defy the fatigue and pain he feels. You talk about attitude--that is what keeps me going, and these are not isolated examples. They happen all the time. I guess it has to do with love --mature love. It is easier to maintain a positive attitude when we give and receive love. Love for our Heavenly Father, family, roommates, neighbors, and friends, love that is unselfish, love that is returned--all of these are the glue that holds a positive attitude together.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Another great and indispensable source of strength has come from my other family members and from my colleagues at the university. The most valuable help has come in small, subtle ways as I have picked up unmistakable signals that they genuinely care and want to help. Physically, there is little that they can do. But the obvious care that I see in their eyes and in their subtle comments and in their souls makes an enormous contribution to my own ability to select the right attitude.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Our second suggestion is to let go of past disappointments. Dwelling on them can perpetuate negative attitudes. So learn from those experiences and then move on. Or, as Elder Packer has told us, "Leave it alone."<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Paul told the Philippians, "This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before" (Philippians 3:13).<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Our third suggestion is, avoid blaming others for our circumstances. Above all, do not blame our Heavenly Father. Instead, ask whether there is something we can do that will make things better.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>In the great majority of instances, attempts to affix blame will only make things worse. And yet it is a very common reaction. One of the most memorable letters that I received about five years ago when I developed my first cancer was from a dear friend, quite religious though not a member of our church, whom we had known quite well during our days in government. After telling me how distressed she was at the news of my illness, and particularly at the fact that such a thing would happen to me, she said, "Here I find myself with my knees on the floor and my fist in the air." As an expressive metaphor, it was very good, but what it expressed was a counterproductive attitude. In short, knees on the floor, yes. Fist in the air, no.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Our next suggestion relates to how we deal vicariously with other people's successes. How do we react when good things happen to other people--a roommate gets engaged, a friend receives the only A in the class, or a neighbor comes home with a new car. Can we be happy for someone who performs well, has many talents, or gets all the breaks? During the time that each of us is going through our own challenges, inevitably there will be others around us who seem to be without burdens and who are experiencing significant successes. Our ability to maintain a selective attitude in getting through the period of our own difficulty will depend substantially on how we react to the simultaneous successes and abilities of those around us.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Let me give you a couple of personal perspectives. For about the past sixteen years, running has provided not only my principal source of exercise and relaxation, but a major social outlet as well. Some of the most memorable exchanges of ideas and aspirations that Janet and I have shared over that time have come while we have jogged. It has also become a major family event that has included our sons and daughters. And beyond our family, over the years some of my closest friendships outside my family have been with running companions. Those were wonderful experiences. They carry memories that will never fade, including thirteen marathons, one of them under three hours--not terribly impressive to our track coaches, but a pretty decent accomplishment for a guy whose principal athletic feat during high school was a basketball season scoring record that still stands. It's an all-time record for that high school: 0-for-January.<br><br>So it was at first quite difficult for me to see Janet and some of my daughters going jogging without me, and also not to be able to join the group of friends with whom I have run for many years. What I am working on right now is an attitude of joy, rather than sorrow, that they can do some of the things that I can't. For you also, your happiness will depend in substantial part on your ability to find joy rather than competitive disappointment in the accomplishments of those around you.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>Christ is our example in all things. To borrow Elder Maxwell's phrase, we must make Christ our "attitudinal Exemplar" (<i>Even As I Am</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1982], p. 99).<br><br>In Gethsemane, as well as on the cross, the message Christ left with the world was one of selective attitude. As important as it is for us to understand the meaning of the Atonement, it is also imperative that we comprehend the example of Christ's attitude as he faced his crucifixion. The scriptures tell us that just prior to the great intercessory prayer in Gethsemane, Jesus told Peter, James, and John to be of good cheer.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Try to put yourself in the Savior's place as he anticipated what he was facing: Gethsemane, Judas' betrayal, Peter's denial, the trial, which was little more than a farce, and the terrible ordeal of the Crucifixion. His attitude was not only one of instruction to his disciples, but he also taught us an unforgettable lesson when he uttered, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br><b>Janet:</b>We will never have to suffer any agony equal to that endured by Christ. As Elder Maxwell so insightfully adds:<br><br><i>Though our trials are tiny compared to</i>[the Savior's], . . .<i>Jesus was of good cheer because then current conditions did not alter His sources of ultimate joy. Are not our fundamental sources of joy the same as His?</i>. . .<br><br><i>It remains for us, therefore, to be of good cheer even when .</i>. .<i>current circumstances seem hopeless.</i>. . .<i>The unfolding of God's purposes may require the collapse of other things.</i><br><br><i>How often is it necessary for dismantling to occur in order for something better to be put in place?</i>[<i>Even As I Am,</i>pp. 100, 101]<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Just as we seek out people who have successfully met challenges similar to ours and find comfort in following their example, we need to seek and follow Christ as our example in all things. When our challenges seem overwhelming, when our choices seem to be taken away, when we don't know where to turn, the one thing we have left to do is to follow Christ's example of selective attitude. As he told us, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of<i>good cheer;</i>I have overcome the world" (John 16:33; emphasis added).<br><br><b>Janet:</b>So many times at night after long talks with a child who has had a discouraging day, I find myself saying, "Cheer up. Trust me, everything will be all right." Because I have seen more of life than my child, I believe things will work out. How infinitely more our Heavenly Father knows about us, our tomorrows, and our potential, and how eager he is for us to be of good cheer.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>Many of you may have experienced challenges greater than ours. I'm sure some of you have and could undoubtedly teach us some things. Some of you may right now be in the midst of dealing with trials that seem unfair. And others of you might be just around the corner or light years away from some of your life's greatest challenges.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>The common denominator we share is that at one time or another we will all face challenges. Our attitude in dealing with everyday obstacles prepares us for greater challenges that may lie ahead. Now I don't want to sound like the big fourth grader talking to the first grader saying, "If you think it is hard where you are, you just wait until you get where I am!" In the first place, we are all here in this life together. We all have adversity, and it's no respecter of age. The point I want to make is that life is good despite the challenges. Or perhaps I should say life gets better and better<i>because</i>of meeting life's challenges head-on.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>As our ability to meet challenges grows, so also, proportionately, does our love of life. Janet and I have no greater example of this than our four parents. They are all in their early eighties and at this point have faced most of life's obstacles. And yet they greet each day with enthusiasm, with a love of life, and with a love for the Lord.<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I know that our Heavenly Father loves us. I also know that when it seems that we have been left with limited choices, we still have one choice left--one of attitude. And when we are groping for that positive attitude, if we can hang on to faith and prayer, our love for the life our Heavenly Father has given us will know no bounds. When we feel love, our hearts are softened and we become aware of all of the small miracles around us. We then know that even when life is not perfect, it can be perfectly wonderful.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>As the Lord has told us in section 68 of the Doctrine and Covenants,<br><br><i>Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 68:5–6]<br><br><b>Janet:</b>I have a testimony that God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers, that he sent his Son to atone for our sins, that he revealed his everlasting gospel to us in these latter days that we might find our way home to him, our God, who loves us more than we can comprehend.<br><br><b>Rex:</b>I share that testimony. This is not just another church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is literally the restored kingdom of Jesus Christ and therefore has brought again to the earth the authority to administer the saving ordinances. Those ordinances can be even more beneficial if we couple them with a positive, selective attitude. Selective memories, such as the ones that occurred to Janet and me last spring, make life more pleasant. Selective attitudes--particularly when combined with the truths of the restored gospel--affect the quality of life itself. That we may effectively combine our knowledge of the Restoration with a positive view of life and what it has to offer is our prayer, which we offer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E. Lee was president of Brigham Young University when he and his wife, Janet, gave this devotional address was given on 12 January 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Anchor to the Souls of Men - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a wonderful privilege for me to be with all of the students and young adults gathered here in the Marriott Center tonight and in many other locations throughout North America. I am also aware that videotapes of these firesides will be sent to many of our international areas where English, Spanish, and French are spoken. I am thrilled that modern technology allows us to reach out to so many of you marvelous young people at a time when the Church is growing very rapidly.<br><br>The General Authorities of the Church have great confidence in you and have a genuine desire to stay in touch with you, to know of your concerns, and to offer some words of encouragement, counsel, and reassurance. My purpose tonight is to give just such encouragement and reassurance. I am delighted to be with you.<br><br>Life has a fair number of challenges in it, and that's true of life in the 1990s. Indeed, you may be feeling that you have more than your share of problems. These concerns may be very global difficulties, such as the devastating famine we see in Somalia and other places in the world, or the incessant sounds of war in Yugoslavia, or the Middle East, or India, or Ireland, or so many other locations round the world.<br><br>Unfortunately, some of these wars have religious or ethnic overtones, and that makes them even more tragic, if that is possible. These last few years we have seen our fair share of economic difficulties and recession in every nation. Sometimes these economic challenges get translated into very immediate problems for college students and those trying to earn a living, and perhaps start a family, in their early adult years.<br><br>Years ago there was a popular music group formed at BYU that went on to considerable local stardom and acclaim, a group named The Three D's. They took the name from their three singers: Duane Hiatt, Richard (Dick) Davis, and Denis Sorenson. My fear is that in the nineties, if we were to form a popular singing group among our young people, it might still be called The Three D's, but that could be for Despair, Doom, and Discouragement.<br><br>I am here tonight to tell you that Despair, Doom, and Discouragement are not an acceptable view of life for a Latter-day Saint. However high on the charts they are on the hit parade of contemporary news, we must not walk on our lower lip every time a few difficult moments happen to confront us.<br><br>I am just a couple of years older than most of you, and in those few extra months I have seen a bit more of life than you have. I want you to know that there have always been some difficulties in mortal life and there always will be. But knowing what we know, and living as we are supposed to live, there really is no place, no excuse, for pessimism and despair.<br><br>In my lifetime I have seen two world wars plus Korea plus Vietnam and all that you are currently witnessing. I have worked my way through the depression and managed to go to law school while starting a young family at the same time. I have seen stock markets and world economics go crazy and have seen a few despots and tyrants go crazy, all of which causes quite a bit of trouble around the world in the process.<br><br>So I am frank to say tonight that I hope you won't believe all the world's difficulties have been wedged into your decade, or that things have never been worse than they are for you personally, or that they will never get better. I reassure you that things have been worse and they<i>will</i>always get better. They always do--especially when we live and love the gospel of Jesus Christ and give it a chance to flourish in our lives.<br><br>Here are some actual comments that have been made and passed on to me in recent months. This comes from a fine returned missionary:<br><br><i>Why should I date and get serious with a girl? I am not sure I even want to marry and bring a family into this kind of a world. I am not very sure about my own future. How can I take the responsibility for the future of others whom I would love and care about and want to be happy?</i><br><br>Here's another from a high school student:<br><br><i>I hope I die before all these terrible things happen that people are talking about. I don't want to be on the earth when there is so much trouble.</i><br><br>And this from a recent college graduate:<br><br><i>I am doing the best I can, but I wonder if there is much reason to even plan for the future, let alone retirement. The world probably won't last that long anyway.</i><br><br>Well, isn't that a fine view of things? Sounds like we all ought to go and eat a big plate of worms.<br><br>I want to say to all within the sound of my voice tonight that you have every reason in this world to be happy and to be optimistic and to be confident. Every generation since time began has had some things to overcome and some problems to work out. Furthermore, every individual person has a particular set of challenges that sometimes seem to be earmarked for us individually. We understood that in our premortal existence.<br><br>Prophets and apostles of the Church have faced some of those personal difficulties. I acknowledge that I have faced a few, and you will undoubtedly face some of your own now and later in your life. When these experiences humble us and refine us and teach us and bless us, they can be powerful instruments in the hands of God to make us better people, to make us more grateful and more loving, to make us more considerate of other people in their own times of difficulty.<br><br>Yes, we all have difficult moments individually and collectively, but even in the most severe of times, anciently or modern, those problems and prophecies were never intended to do anything but bless the righteous and help those who are less righteous move toward repentance. God loves us and the scriptures tell us he<br><br><i>gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</i><br><br><i>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</i>[John 3:16–17]<br><br>The scriptures also indicate that there will be seasons of time when the whole world will have some difficulty. We know that in our dispensation unrighteousness will, unfortunately, be quite evident, and it will bring its inevitable difficulties and pain and punishment. God will cut short that unrighteousness in his own due time, but our task is to live fully and faithfully and not worry ourselves sick about the woes of the world or when it will end. Our task is to have the gospel in our lives and to be a bright light, a city set upon a hill that reflects the beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the joy and happiness that will always come to every people in every age who keep the commandments.<br><br>In this last dispensation there will be great tribulation (Matthew 24:21). We know that from the scriptures. We know there will be wars and rumors of wars and that the whole earth will be in commotion (D&amp;amp;C 45:26). All dispensations have had their perilous times, but our day will include genuine peril (2 Timothy 3:1). Evil men will flourish (2 Timothy 3:13), but then evil men have very often flourished. Calamities will come and iniquity will abound (D&amp;amp;C 45:27).<br><br>Inevitably, the natural result of some of these kinds of prophecies is fear, and that is not fear limited to a younger generation. It is fear shared by those of any age who don't understand what we understand.<br><br>But I want to stress that these feelings are not necessary for faithful Latter-day Saints, and they do not come from God. To ancient Israel, the great Jehovah said:<br><br><i>Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee....</i><br><br><i>And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.</i>[Deuteronomy 31:6, 8]<br><br>And to you, our marvelous generation in modern Israel, the Lord has said: "Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail. ... Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:34, 36).<br><br>Such counsel is laced throughout our modern scriptures. Listen to this wonderful reassurance:<br><br><i>Fear not, little children, for you are mine, and I have overcome the world, and you are of them that my Father hath given me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:41]<br><br><i>Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:1]<br><br>In light of such wonderful counsel, I think it is incumbent upon us to rejoice a little more and despair a little less, to give thanks for what we have and for the magnitude of God's blessings to us, and to talk a little less about what we may not have or what anxiety may accompany difficult times in this or any generation.<br><br>For Latter-day Saints this is a time of great hope and excitement--one of the greatest eras of the Restoration and therefore one of the greatest eras in any dispensation, inasmuch as ours is the greatest of all dispensations. We need to have faith and hope, two of the greatest fundamental virtues of any discipleship of Christ. We must continue to exercise confidence in God, inasmuch as that is the first principle in our code of belief. We must believe that God has all power, that he loves us, and that his work will not be stopped or frustrated in our individual lives or in the world generally. He will bless us as a people because he always has blessed us as a people. He will bless us as individuals because he always has blessed us as individuals.<br><br>Listen to this marvelous counsel given by President Joseph F. Smith nearly ninety years ago. It sounds as if young people in that day might have been a little anxious about their future as well. I quote:<br><br><i>You do not need to worry in the least, the Lord will take care of you and bless you. He will also take care of His servants, and will bless them and help them to accomplish His purposes; and all the powers of darkness combined in earth and in hell cannot prevent it. ... He has stretched forth His hand to accomplish His purposes, and the arm of flesh cannot stay it. He will cut His work short in righteousness, and will hasten His purposes in His own time. It is only necessary to try with our might to keep pace with the onward progress of the work of the Lord, then God will preserve and protect us, and will prepare the way before us, that we shall live and multiply and replenish the earth and always do His will.</i>[Joseph F. Smith,<i>CR,</i>October 1905, pp. 5–6]<br><br>More recently President Marion G. Romney counseled the Church. This was twenty-five years ago, when the world also knew some difficulty. An American president had been assassinated, communism was alive and menacing, and a war was building up in Southeast Asia. My sons were just exactly your age at that time, and they had some of the same anxieties you have about life and marriage and the future. Here's what President Romney said then:<br><br><i>Naturally, believing Christians, even those who have a mature faith in the gospel, are concerned and disturbed by the lowering clouds on the horizon. But they need not be surprised or frantic about their portent, for, as has already been said, at the very beginning of this last dispensation the Lord made it abundantly clear that through the tribulations and calamity that he foresaw and foretold and that we now see coming upon us, there would be a people who, through acceptance and obedience to the gospel, would be able to recognize and resist the powers of evil, build up the promised Zion, and prepare to meet the Christ and be with him in the blessed millennium. And we know further that it is possible for every one of us, who will, to have a place among those people. It is this assurance and this expectation that gives us understanding of the Lord's admonition, "be not troubled."</i>[Marion G. Romney,<i>CR,</i>1966, pp. 53–54]<br><br>Let me offer a third example from yet another moment of difficulty in this century. In the midst of the most devastating international conflagration the modern world has ever seen, Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Council of the Twelve counseled people who were worried. Nazism was on the march, there was war in the Pacific, nation after nation seemed to be drawn into war. Mind you this was 1942, not 1992 or 1993. This is what Brother Widtsoe said:<br><br><i>Above the roar of cannon and airplane, the maneuvers and plans of men, the Lord always determines the tide of battle. So far and no farther does He permit the evil one to go in his career to create human misery. The Lord is ever victorious; He is the Master to whose will Satan is subject. Though all hell may rage, and men may follow evil, the purposes of the Lord will not fail.</i>[John A. Widtsoe,<i>CR,</i>April 1942, p. 34]<br><br>I promise you tonight in the name of the Lord whose servant I am that God will always protect and care for his people. We will have our difficulties the way every generation and people have had difficulties. Your life as a young college student or working person in the 1990s is no different than any young person's life has been in any age of time. But with the gospel of Jesus Christ you have every hope and promise and reassurance. The Lord has power over his Saints and will always prepare places of peace, defense, and safety for his people. When we have faith in God we can hope for a better world--for us personally and for all mankind. The prophet Ether taught anciently (and he knew something about troubles):<br><br><i>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</i>[Ether 12:4]<br><br>Disciples of Christ in every generation are invited, indeed commanded, to be filled with a perfect brightness of hope (see 2 Nephi 31:20).<br><br>This faith and hope of which I speak is not a Pollyanna-like approach to significant personal and public problems. I don't believe we can wake up in the morning and simply by drawing a big "happy face" on the chalkboard believe that is going to take care of the world's difficulties. But if our faith and hope is anchored in Christ, and in his teachings, commandments, and promises, then we are able to count on something truly remarkable, genuinely miraculous, that can part the Red Sea and lead modern Israel to a place "where none shall come to hurt or make afraid" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30). Fear, which can come upon people in difficult days, is a principal weapon in the arsenal that Satan uses to make mankind unhappy. He who fears loses strength for the combat of life in the fight against evil. Therefore, the power of the evil one always tries to generate fear in human hearts. In every age and in every era fear has faced mankind.<br><br>As children of God and descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we must seek to dispel fear from among people. A timid, fearing people cannot do their work well, and they cannot do God's work at all. Latter-day Saints have a divinely assigned mission to fulfill that simply must not be dissipated in fear and anxiety.<br><br>An apostle of the Lord in an earlier day said this:<br><br><i>The key to the conquest of fear has been given through the Prophet Joseph Smith. "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear." (D&amp;amp;C 38:30) That divine message needs repeating today in every stake and ward.</i>[And, I might add, among every group of college students and young adults in the Church.] [Elder John A. Widtsoe,<i>CR,</i>April 1942, p. 33]<br><br>Are we prepared to surrender to God's commandments? Are we prepared to achieve victory over our appetites? Are we prepared to obey righteous law? If we can honestly answer yes to those questions, we can bid fear to depart from our lives. Surely the degree of fear in our hearts may well be measured by our preparation to live righteously--living that should characterize every Latter-day Saint in every age and time.<br><br>Let me close tonight with one of the greatest statements I have ever read from the Prophet Joseph Smith, who faced such immense difficulties in his life and who of course paid the ultimate price for his victory. But he<i>was</i>victorious, and he was a happy, robust, optimistic man. Those who knew him felt his strength and courage, even in the darkest of times. He did not sag in spirits or long remain in any despondency.<br><br>He said about our time--yours and mine--that ours is the moment<br><br><i>upon which prophets, priests and kings</i>[in ages past]<i>have dwelt with peculiar delight;</i>[all these ancient witnesses for God]<i>have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day; ... we are the favored people that God has</i>[chosen]<i>to bring about the Latter-day glory.</i>[<i>HC</i>4:609–10]<br><br>That is a thrilling statement to me: that the ancients whom we love and read and quote so much--Adam and Abraham, Joshua and Joseph, Isaiah and Ezekiel and Ezra, Nephi and Alma, and Mormon and Moroni--all of these ancient prophets, priests, and kings focused their prophetic vision "with peculiar delight" on our day, on our time. It is this hour to which they have looked forward "with joyful anticipation," and "fired with heavenly and joyful anticipation they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day." They saw us as "the favored people" upon whom God would shower his full and complete latter-day glory, and I testify that is our destiny. What a privilege! What an honor! What a responsibility! And what joy! We have every reason in time and eternity to rejoice and give thanks for the quality of our lives and the promises we have been given. That we may do so, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Howard W. Hunter was the President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 February 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>y of the Heart - Russell M. Nelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Lee and Sister Lee. We appreciate your limitless leadership and are grateful to acknowledge the presence of Sister Lee's parents, Brother and Sister Griffin. I thank Brother Staheli and the singers for their wonderful music--it was beautiful.<br><br>Dear fellow students and friends--beloved brothers and sisters--you look mighty good to Sister Nelson and me. We admire and respect you. Many of you attended the Sunday night fireside recently (7 February 1993) when President Howard W. Hunter spoke. We commend you for your conduct during that shocking confrontation by an adversary. Your spontaneous song of faith was inspired and effective. And you witnessed the great courage of that wonderful man whom we sustain as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. How we honor him!<br><br>The title of my message today is "Integrity of Heart." I hope you will permit me to draw on my experience as a cardiac surgeon to illustrate this important topic.<br><br>Let me begin with this picture of the mitral valve. It is one of four valves within the heart. Isn't it beautiful? This delicate and durable structure is situated between the left atrium and the left ventricle. It is a check valve, regulating the flow of freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs into the heart's powerful pump. Your own mitral valve opens and closes about 100,000 times a day--36 million times each year. It consists of soft billowing tissue, cords, and attachments below.<br><br>In a way it is like a parachute, which also consists of three important components: the flexible sail, cords, and attachments below. When in operation the parachute's sail billows to form a pocket of resistance that slows the descent of the passenger tethered to it by strong cords.<br><br>The mitral valve opens widely to let blood enter the pump, and then it snaps securely shut when blood is ejected from the heart. The work of the heart goes on day after day, year after year, with or without your awareness.<br><br>But things can go wrong with the mitral valve. If for any reason the mitral valve doesn't close completely, blood is regurgitated backwards. The high pressure exerted by the heart is then impelled directly back to the lungs. If that were to go on very long, it would result in failure of both the heart and the lungs. Let me describe one condition that can create just such a problem.<br><br>One of the mitral valve's cords may rupture spontaneously. When that occurs, stress on the adjoining cords is immediately increased. Then the neighboring cords are much more prone to rupture. And when they break, the entire mitral valve loses its competence, and the patient's life is in serious jeopardy.<br><br>That concept is familiar to anyone who has lined up a row of dominoes. When one falls, the next one goes, and so on. You ladies may have watched a similar scene, much to your dismay. It doesn't take very long for a snag to become a run in your nylons.<br><br>Cardiac surgeons speak of the heart in terms of its structural integrity. The word integrity is related to the word<i>integer,</i>which means "entire" or "whole." Integrity may be defined as "unimpaired." Integrity also means "incorruptible," a firm adherence to a code of values. Integrity denotes a state of completeness. If any component of the heart loses its integrity, the heart is impaired and a vicious cycle ensues. An anatomical flaw leads to improper function, and improper function leads to further failure. Therefore, the ultimate objective of any cardiac operation is to restore structural integrity to the heart.<br><br>Fishermen also understand the danger of sequential stress as it relates to integrity of their nets. To the untrained, a small tear may seem to be relatively insignificant. But the experienced fisherman knows about sequential stress. A broken strand in his net may allow the loss of a fish or two but, more important, it causes undue strain on adjacent strands. Before long a small hole becomes larger and larger. Eventually the entire net is worthless.<br><br>Most of you will not be cardiac surgeons or professional fishermen, so you may wonder why I use such teaching models at a devotional assembly. The reason comes from scripture. The Lord said that "all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal" (D&amp;amp;C 29:34).<br><br>He is our Creator. Thus, temporal or physical laws that relate to our divine creation often have a spiritual application. This should come as no surprise because "all [of God's] kingdoms have a law given; . . . And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions" (D&amp;amp;C 88: 36, 38).<br><br>The Lord taught that anyone "who hath seen any or the least of these [kingdoms] hath seen God moving in his majesty and power" (D&amp;amp;C 88:47). Because he is the Creator of both the physical and spiritual components of our being, examples of the importance of structural integrity can teach much about the importance of spiritual integrity.<br><br>Applying the mitral valve or parachute analogy, let us depict a model of spiritual integrity. Let the sail of integrity be tethered by cords attached to you as an individual. Let us label each cord with a spiritual quality. For example, I have chosen specific attributes of character mentioned in the thirteenth article of faith--being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, doing good, and seeking things of good report. Many other qualities of character could be listed, but these will suffice to illustrate the principle. As you study this illustration, think of someone you admire greatly--someone with spiritual integrity. His or her integrity is characterized by the strength of each of these cords of character. So this model is unimpaired; the sail, cords, and attachments are all secure.<br><br>Imagine now that one of those supporting cords is broken--the cord of honesty, for example. If that cord breaks, the law of sequential stress immediately imposes additional strain on the neighboring cords of chastity, virtue, benevolence, and so on.<br><br>In familiar scripture, we have been warned of such risk:<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; ... yea, lie a little, take the advantage of ... thy neighbor;...</i><br><br><i>Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines.</i>[2 Nephi 28:8–9]<br><br>Those teachings are dangerous because they are hazardous to your precious integrity. Yet some people are so easily tempted to lie a little, to cheat a little, to steal a little, or to bear false witness--just a little. You cannot commit a little sin without being subject to the consequences. If you tolerate a little sin today, you tolerate a little more tomorrow, and before long, a cord of integrity is broken. Sequential stress will follow, putting at risk adjacent cords of chastity, virtue, being true, and so on.<br><br>Brigham Young had strong feelings about such matters. On one occasion, he said:<br><br><i>Many want to shade a little, rather than to work hard for an honest living. Such practices must be put away, and this people must become sanctified in their affections to God, and learn to deal honestly, truly, and uprightly with one another in every respect, with all the integrity that fills the heart of an angel. They must learn to feel that they can trust all they possess with their brethren and sisters, saying, "All I have I entrust to you: keep it until I call for it."</i>. . .<i>That principle must prevail in the midst of this people: you must preserve your integrity to each other.</i>[<i>JD</i>6:47]<br><br>His statement strikes a sympathetic response in me when I reflect upon days our nine daughters enjoyed as college coeds dating their boyfriends. As a young suitor would call at our door, I might silently ask myself: "Would he one day call me 'Dad'? Would he help to care for me in my old age?" And sometimes I wondered--knowing so well the history of Jacob, son of Isaac--if any of these boyfriends would follow the biblical precedent of Jacob, who kissed Rachel on their first date. Not only that, Jacob kissed Rachel's father (see Genesis 29:11–13). I can report to you that the boys successfully resisted any such temptation--at least as far as a kiss for me was concerned.<br><br>I trusted each young man to be a man of integrity. So I echo those thoughts expressed by Brigham Young: "All I have I entrust to you: keep it until I call for it." Now, some years later, I am pleased to state that our nine sons-in-law have earned and have honored that trust we placed in them. Each one possesses integrity of heart, as do our daughters and our son, currently serving as a missionary in Russia. Integrity safeguards family love, and love makes family life rich and zestful--now and forever.<br><br>But none of us is immune to temptation, and the adversary knows it. He would deceive, connive, or contrive any means to deprive us of potential joy and exaltation. He knows that if one little cord of control can be snapped, others are likely to give later under increased strain. Then there would be no integrity. Then there would be no eternal life. Then Satan's triumph would be assured.<br><br>Isaiah warned of this. He cautioned that "a little one shall become a thousand" (Isaiah 60:22). If this domino-like deterioration causes a "run in your spiritual stocking," qualities of character are lost and your cherished integrity is gone.<br><br>The Savior warned us of the lethal wages of sin (see Romans 6:23). But he didn't limit his caution to major transgression alone. He specifically warned against breaking "one of these least commandments" (Matthew 5:19). His admonitions were meant to protect and preserve your precious integrity.<br><br>A surgeon can repair or replace a mitral valve that has lost its integrity. But no surgical procedure can be performed for loss of spiritual integrity of heart. Such break down is under individual control. Isaiah observed that "thou . . . didst debase thyself" (Isaiah 57:9).<br><br>The wise fisherman inspects his nets regularly. Should any flaw be detected, he repairs the defect, without delay.<br><br>An old saying teaches that "a stitch in time saves nine." Recorded revelation gives similar instruction. The Lord said, "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works" (Revelation 2:5).<br><br>So the wise assess personal cords of integrity on a daily basis. You are the one to identify any weakness. You are the one to repair it.<br><br>Indeed, you have an obligation to do so. Words of Isaiah, though referencing service to others, apply equally to ourselves. He said: "Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong" (Isaiah 35:3–4; see also D&amp;amp;C 81:5).<br><br>A good time for introspection is during private personal prayer. In the morning it might include a prayer for honesty, chastity, virtue, or simply being of service to others. In the evening there may be another quick checkup on all of those attributes. First, you pray for the preservation of your spiritual integrity, and then you work for it. Should any flaw be found, you will want to begin the process of prompt repair that will protect further disintegration of that threatened cord.<br><br>Self-assessment is not done as a formal "final exam," or as a major "mid term." It is done best in many little steps. For example, ask yourselves questions such as these:<br><br>What do you do when you make a mistake? (If you don't make mistakes, you must have died long ago.) Do you admit your error and apologize? Or do you deny it? Or do you blame others?<br><br>When in a group, if ideas or activities are promoted that you know to be wrong, what do you do? Do you endorse error by your silence? Or do you take a stand?<br><br>If employed to do a job, are you totally true to your employer? Or do you let yourself be less than loyal?<br><br>How do you keep the Sabbath day, obey the Word of Wisdom, honor your mother and your father?<br><br>If you have made sacred covenants in the temple, how do you react when you hear evil-speaking of the Lord's anointed? Do you honor<i>all</i>covenants made there? Or do you allow exceptions and rationalize your behavior to suit your preconceived preferences?<br><br>How do you honor your word? Can your promises be trusted? President Karl G. Maeser once said to students,<br><br><i>I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape, but stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i>[Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser: Mormon Educator</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1953), p. 71]<br><br>I agree with Brother Maeser. A promise is binding either until fulfilled or until one is released from it. Now please don't be discouraged or depressed by your shortcomings. No one is without weakness. That's part of the divine plan--to determine if you will master that weakness or let that weakness master you. Proper diagnosis is essential to proper treatment. The Lord gave us this remarkable assurance: "Because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong" (D&amp;amp;C 135:5). But wishing for strength won't make it so. It takes faith and work to shore up a weakened cord of integrity.<br><br>That process of repair you know as repentance, and, mercifully, you don't have to begin it alone. Help can be received through counsel with trusted parents and Church leaders. But their aid is more likely to be helpful if you will seek it not merely to satisfy a formality, but with "real intent" to reform yourself and to come closer to Christ. He is the Ultimate Physician. Real faith in him will provide real relief--and glorious rewards. He said, "Because thou hast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father" (Ether 12:37; see also 12:27, 2 Corinthians 12:9). Mistakes may mar our worthiest intentions. And serious sin can stain with scarlet the slate of pristine white that was once ours. As none of us may escape sin, none of us may escape suffering. Repentance may not be easy, but it is worth it. Repentance not only bleaches, it heals!<br><br>Now for some more good news: Not only can your integrity of heart be maintained, it can actually become strengthened. A testimony of the gospel is one of the most important fortifiers we know. So taught Elder Orson Pratt, who faced the burden of leadership imposed upon him. He knew that "it required a witness independent of the testimony of others" (<i>JD</i>12:85). So Brother Pratt once confided:<br><br><i>I sought for this witness. I did not receive it immediately, but when the Lord saw the integrity of my heart and the anxiety of my mind--when He saw that I was willing to travel hundreds of miles for the sake of learning the principles of the truth, He gave me a testimony for myself, which conferred upon me the most perfect knowledge that Joseph Smith was a true prophet, and that this book, called the Book of Mormon, was in reality a Divine revelation, and that God had once more, in reality, spoken to the human family. What joy this knowledge gave me! No language that I am acquainted with could describe the sensations I experienced when I received a knowledge from Heaven of the truth of this work.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:85]<br><br>Just as Orson Pratt's unshakable testimony fortified him for great trials ahead, your personal testimony will strengthen you for challenges that are yet to come.<br><br>Challenges face a heart surgeon every day. From many years of experience I learned that the integrity of my team's performance was absolutely essential to the success of an operative procedure. Any serious misstep, even though unintentional, could nullify the fervent prayers of a patient even when fortified by great faith of family and friends. I learned that desired blessings come only when all necessary laws are obeyed. Hence, the demands of obedience can be painful. Sanctification is neither simple nor quick. Speaking of his Saints in the latter days, the Lord said that "they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son. For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified" (D&amp;amp;C 101:4–5).<br><br>Repentance, strengthening, and sanctification are part of that cherished prize--integrity of heart. If President Brigham Young were here speaking to you now, he might counsel you as he did those of his day. These are his words:<br><br><i>In all your business transactions, words, and communications, if you commit</i>[a wrong]<i>act, repent of that immediately, and call upon God to deliver you from evil and give you the light of His spirit. Never do a thing that your conscience, and the light within you, tell you is wrong. Never do a wrong, but do all the good you possibly can. Never do a thing to mar the peaceable influence of the Holy Spirit in you; then whatever you are engaged in--whether in business, in the dance, or in the pulpit-- you are ready to officiate at any time in any of the ordinances of the House of God. If I commit an overt act, the Lord knows the integrity of my heart, and, through sincere repentance, He forgives me.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:103]<br><br>Please note that President Young linked the integrity of his heart to forgiveness from the Lord. And that can be earned only through full repentance. Truly, the miracle of forgiveness finalizes the healing of ruptured cords of spiritual integrity.<br><br>Your personal integrity will be protected by prior commitments. Job secured his commitment to integrity<i>before</i>facing a challenge. He wrote, "All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. . . . till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me" (Job 27:3–5). Job knew he would face his Maker one day in judgment. He recorded this hope: "Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity" (Job 31:6). Shakespeare gives reason for a strong prior commitment to integrity in lines he penned for his character Tarquinius in the poem<i>The Rape of Lucrece.</i>As Tarquinius contemplates the conquest of a woman in lust, he argues against himself:<br><br><i>What win I if I gain the thing I seek?</i><br><i>A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.</i><br><i>Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?</i><br><i>Or sells eternity to get a toy?</i><br><i>For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?</i><br>[<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>(1594), lines 211–15]<br><br>Commitments to integrity are learned from parents. The Lord said to Solomon, "Walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and. . . keep my statutes and my judgments" (1 Kings 9:4).<br><br>A proverb teaches that "the just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him" (Proverbs 20:7). Speaking of parents, permit me to share a personal experience. On President Spencer W. Kimball's eighty-fifth birthday, a large dinner party was given for him. Sister Nelson and I were privileged to attend with my parents. When President Kimball walked toward the head table, he saw us. After greeting Sister Nelson and me, he put his arms around my mother and gave her a big kiss. He said, "Thank you for being the mother of the surgeon who saved my life." Then he embraced my father and gave him a kiss. President Kimball said, "Thank you for teaching your son to be a man of integrity."<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith appreciated the integrity of his faithful brother Hyrum. So did the Lord, who said: "Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me" (D&amp;amp;C 124:15). The Prophet Joseph then added:<br><br><i>Blessed of the Lord is my brother Hyrum for the integrity of his heart; he shall be girt about with strength, truth and faithfulness shall be the strength of his loins. From generation to generation he shall be a shaft in the hand of his God</i>. [<i>Teachings,</i>p. 40]<br><br>That prophecy has been fulfilled. Direct descendants of Hyrum Smith stand as strong leaders of the Church today. Likewise, integrity you develop now will be a model for your own children. Generations yet unborn will be influenced by your integrity of heart.<br><br>The board of trustees of BYU subsidizes this school with sacred tithing funds of the Church. So each of us must be concerned with institutional integrity--our commitment to academic and spiritual excellence. That integrity can only be safeguarded as each teacher and each student remains individually strong. The integrity of this institution can never be stronger than that of its representatives.<br><br>Dear brothers and sisters, if I could have the fondest wish of my heart granted, it would be that you could know who you really are--that you were from premortal realms,<br><br><i>also among the noble and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God.</i><br><br><i>Even before</i>[you]<i>were born,</i>[you],<i>with many others, received</i>[your]<i>first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 138:55–56; see also Abraham 3:22]<br><br>Your precious identity deserves your precious integrity! Guard it as the priceless prize that it is. To you I would give such counsel as the Prophet Joseph Smith gave his friends:<br><br><i>Seek to know God in your closets, call upon him in the fields. Follow the directions of the Book of Mormon, and pray over, and for your families,</i>. . .<i>and all things that you possess; ask the blessing of God upon all your labors, and everything that you engage in. Be virtuous and pure; be men</i>[and women]<i>of integrity and truth; keep the commandments of God; and then you will be able more perfectly to understand the difference between right and wrong--between the things of God and the things of men; and your path will be like that of the just, which shineth brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.</i>[<i>Teachings,</i>p. 247]<br><br>God bless you that you may achieve the full measure of your creation--to maintain, to strengthen, and to cherish your integrity of heart--I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 23 February 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>That Have Helped Me - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I haven't been known too much for being nervous when I have to be in front of people. I remember the first time I was going to speak in general conference and was loading the car in Provo, getting ready to go up there, and my daughter-in-law said, "You may not be nervous, but it would be interesting to write a book on how to pack to speak in conference." I had several tubes of lipstick and two or three pairs of earrings and a couple of pairs of shoes, and all of the things that you might need just in case you had an emergency.<br><br>I reached in my pocket today and noticed that I have a parking sticker for the ZCMI parking plaza. I think I must have everything I need now, so I guess I'm ready for this talk.<br><br>It would be difficult for me to put into words how much I love Brigham Young University. This academic year is my anniversary, since I was a BYU freshman in 1952–53. When I graduated from Spanish Fork High School, I received a scholarship to BYU for $25. That was tuition for one quarter. My problem at that time was that I didn't have any money to go with the $25 to pay my other expenses. I'd had part-time work in high school, and that had provided for new sweaters and new shoes, but no savings account. So I reluctantly turned over the scholarship to the alternate and committed myself to a full-time job. I found in a short time that even though I was making more money, more sweaters and shoes didn't satisfy. It was a bleak day for me when many of my friends left for college that fall. I thought my life was over, and I was only eighteen. The following year I had saved enough money to get myself started in college. I will always be aware that choices for learning and growth, and those kinds of opportunities, seem as natural as our desire to eat. I have always been appreciative of that experience that happened here and the doors that it opened for me.<br><br>I've heard a great deal about the outstanding student body at this university now. I know about your credentials, and I could very well be intimidated by those lofty credentials, but I am reminded of a student who said of her first semester, "I was so overwhelmed at being here. I wondered how I ever got in. By the second semester, I wondered how my roommates got in."<br><br>You probably wouldn't realize how much I think of you as I walk around here and as I interact at athletic and cultural events, and especially when I try to find a parking place. That wasn't a problem in my day.<br><br>I live very near BYU, and when I served in the state legislature, the BYU campus was part of my legislative district. So I've had a chance to listen to you, and I've had a chance to represent you. As I look out at you, I know that some of you must be concerned about rent money. And some of you must be worried about whether or not you will get a summer job. Will your scholarship be renewed? Will you get into graduate school? Is my major really what I want, or is it what my parents want? Will I ever really fall in love?<br><br>Since becoming a Church leader, the most common question I am asked is, "Is it harder for young people today?"<br><br>Is it harder? Is it harder for you than it was for me? I don't know the answer to that, but I do have faith in a living prophet who has said that you young people were prepared before you were born for a sacred and glorious purpose. I know you were prepared for this time. The prophet has also warned, however, that the world shouts louder than the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. Have you noticed any worldly messages? Can they be distracting?<br><br>As I have considered my assignment for today, I have thought about your challenges. I have wished that my talk with you could be in my kitchen. Often young people say to me that their greatest challenge is the media. I want to say, "Why don't you just turn it off?" But I know young people don't like to be told what to do. Then I think of what I might say, and I think today I'd like to talk to you as if we were speaking in my kitchen.<br><br>I remember a conversation I had in the kitchen with my own daughter when she was making a decision about marriage and about graduate school. I said, "Jane, I have such confidence in your ability to figure out the future because your future will be different from mine. Let me tell you some of the things that have helped me and let me tell you some of the things that haven't."<br><br>The greatest advantage that a parent or teacher has is the perspective of time. I might add that it's the only advantage--every other advantage is yours. It helps me to see what has happened in people's lives because of the decisions they've made and the choices they've made. That's one of the ways we get spiritual insights from the scriptures. We have so many stories in the scriptures of what has happened in people's lives according to the choices they have made.<br><br>I'd like to share today some of the lessons that have helped me in making decisions and honoring commitments. The first two lessons that I'm going to speak about have to do with the work effort.<br><br><i>The first lesson is the value of work as service, not just as a means of earning money or gaining power.</i>I learned this particular lesson very young. As a young girl I often went with friends to pick cherries in the summer for a local farmer. I remember one very hot day in July when we had eaten our sack lunches under a tree. We were very weary, and we decided not to go back to work in the afternoon but instead to strike for higher wages. (Labor unions were big in the news those days.) We felt a sudden power and adulthood as we sat in the shade on our overturned buckets. I was so eager to report to my family later in the day about our mature negotiations with the farmer. My mother was normally a very gentle person, and it surprised me that she expressed great disappointment in me. She was so upset that we had inconvenienced that farmer when he had a crop in need of picking. I never did learn whether I was worth more than three cents a pound, but it was a permanent lesson to me that in our family we valued service and the needs of others more than power and money.<br><br>Today is my mother's eighty-ninth birthday. I'd like to wish her happy birthday in public and thank her for the many lessons that she has taught me. It was nice to learn that you could feel a little bit noble in the top of a cherry tree.<br><br>Since that time it has been reassuring for me to learn that many great people I know work for much less money than they are worth because service is a greater value to them than money. Whatever career or profession you pursue, consider the value of service.<br><br>The second lesson also has to do with work.<i>The second lesson that has helped me is learning the value of work as a continual preparation, not just as a job or a destination.</i>It's a process of preparation. I remember one day in a Sunday School class I was teaching. We were talking about success in a gospel setting--the kind of success that leads to spiritual maturity. LaVell Edwards was a member of my class. I remember LaVell saying, "I hear many people talk about the<i>will to win.</i>In describing a great athlete, occasionally we hear the words, 'He just has the will to win.'" LaVell said, "To tell you the truth, I don't know exactly what that means, but there is one characteristic that I look for above all others, and that attribute is the<i>will to prepare."</i><br><br>Those who have a will to prepare probably have as many reasons to quit and give up as those who keep going, but the difference shows itself in commitment and a willingness to work. My father-in-law, Wayne B. Hales, was a physics professor here at this university--his name is over one of the doors in the science building. (My love for him is another connecting link to this university.) May I read a few lines about his work and continued preparation from his journal. This would have been about 1916–1920.<br><br><i>During my sophomore year at BYU, I took two courses under Professor A. B. Christensen ... who became the president of Ricks College. I must have pleased him as a student because two years later he came to BYU and employed me as a teacher of physics and mathematics at a salary of $1,000 for the eight or nine months of teaching. ... One of the bad features about being a school teacher is that you are only employed and paid for half of your time. A teacher is employed for 180 days a year. ... This first year school was cut short because the Board of Trustees or the Church ran out of money. We closed school in early April and my salary was cut proportionally. I went to work in Sugar City, ten miles</i>[away]<i>tearing down old sugar factory bins.</i>[A job in the coal mines in Eureka]<i>kept us solvent until school started again in late September.</i><br><br><i>Our second year we saw our way clear for me to attempt some graduate study during the spring and summer quarter. I applied for admission in Graduate School at Chicago University where two Nobel Prize winners in Physics were full professors. They were Andrew A. Mickelson and Robert A. Millikan.</i>[My husband, by the way, was named after Robert Millikan the physicist.]<br><br><i>I secured a room for $40 per quarter and I often lived, believe it or not, on</i>47<i>cents per day.</i><br><br>A few years later, as Dad Hales was serving as president of Snow College, he decided to take his wife, four little children, and their very small savings and go to California to pursue a Ph.D.<br><br>Although the economic situation now seems amusing to us, the value of work as continual preparation can be equally important today. That desire for learning and growth is real. Don't let the world or challenges distract you from that.<br><br>I remember a great violin teacher who said he was often asked about natural talent, gifts, and innate ability. He said, "It is my experience that most people just quit too soon."<br><br>Isn't it easy to say when we see someone excel, "Isn't she gifted?" or "Wouldn't it be wonderful to be as talented as he is?" But most of the time, it just means that person has continued to prepare. You are all gifted, but you must continue to work to develop the gifts.<br><br>I remember listening to Sandra Day O'Connor speak at a graduation at Stanford University. She reported that after her graduation from law school, the only job she could get was as a clerk. What did she do? Talk about discrimination? No. She took the job. She continued to work. She continued to prepare. She could not have known at that time that she would one day be serving in the United States Supreme Court, but her readiness resulted from her continued work and preparation.<br><br><i>The third lesson I would like to mention is the value of developing character rather than seeking popularity or fame.</i>My husband practiced medicine, and whenever he was asked to write a letter of recommendation for a student applying to medical school, he told them this experience that he had with one of his classmates.<br><br>As you know, it isn't easy to get into medical school, and as you would guess, freshman students are not only enthusiastic but are committed to very hard work. My husband said he still remembers going to his first examination at the University of Utah. The honor system was in place. As the professor passed out the examination and left the room, he said some classmates started to pull out little cheat papers from pockets and from under their books. He said, "My heart began to pound, and I realized how difficult it is to compete with cheaters." It appeared that this was a practice that must have been common in some settings in the past. About then a tall, thin student stood up in the back of the room and said, "I left my hometown and put my wife and three little children in an upstairs apartment to go to medical school, and I'll turn in the first one of you who cheats and YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!" They believed it. My husband said he looked like Abraham Lincoln. There were many sheepish expressions, and those cheat papers started to disappear as fast as they had appeared. It's interesting that that class graduated the largest graduating class in the history of the school. That young man set a standard of hard work and cooperation instead of dishonesty. That man cared more about character than popularity. When I heard the name of J. Ballard Washburn to be sustained as a member of the Quorum of Seventy, I remembered that he was that medical student. Whether or not J. B. had been called to be a General Authority, I realized his name would have been known for good wherever he was. He developed character!<br><br>After relating this experience as he remembered it, my husband would say to the student, "If you will work to develop that kind of character, I will write the letter of recommendation for you."<br><br>I remember a civics teacher in eighth grade who taught me about character. This teacher had been giving us lessons on government and citizenship. One day he paused, took a long look out at the class, and said,<br><br><i>Let me tell you about one of the greatest men I have ever met. He lives in Provo, Utah. He walks to work each day. He owns his own business and provides employment for others. He is honest in his dealings with his fellowmen. He provides a living for his wife and children whom he loves and cares for. He serves others in church and community. He and his family go to church each Sunday and are honest in their commitments to their Heavenly Father.</i><br><br>I remember feeling almost a little bit bored as the list went on and on, and I thought to myself, "What's so great about that? Doesn't everyone do that?" It seemed so normal. Is it normal? Could we make the world a better place by developing that kind of character? It's that kind of character that sustains families, communities, and nations. It doesn't get any better than that.<br><br><i>The fourth lesson I have learned is the lesson of the great value of stable and caring relationships, the kind of relationships that provide an atmosphere of trust and support where growth can take place.</i>The day after I received my call to be the Young Women president, I received a call from my freshman English teacher. She introduced herself on the phone and said, "You probably don't remember me." I quickly added, "I surely do." We visited and I said, "Do you know what I remember about you?" She was curious. I told her that I knew college was supposed to be hard, but I had breezed through some early exams on grammar and then turned in a couple of fairly flimsy essays. One day when I walked into class my teacher said, "Miss Callister, why do you get B's?" I wanted to say, "Well, you graded my paper." But then she added, "You are an A student, you know!"<br><br>Then my teacher said, "Well, do you know what I remember about you?" I was curious. She told me that I had defended my use of a comma (commas were really important in those days). Then she said, "You convinced me with your reasoning, and I always taught it that way after that."<br><br>What a great value are stable and caring adults, those who cause you to stretch and respond to a higher potential, those who never forget. We need family and friends and teachers who don't forget.<br><br>I received another call from my landlady when I was a newlywed and my husband was in medical school. Do you know what I remembered about her? She had lowered our rent when we had our first baby. When my husband later owned apartments in Provo, I reminded him often of that landlady, especially when he rented to young marrieds. Work to develop stable and caring relationships.<br><br>You might start with your roommates; they will never forget. When I was a sophomore at BYU, eight of us knelt together for prayer each morning at 6:30 and then had breakfast together in our old apartment on Second East. That was preparation for eight stable and caring families. This is a time when you rehearse the characteristics and attributes that will prepare you for marriage and family.<br><br>I feel concerned when I hear of roommates who never even speak to each other, let alone eat together. But they feel they will be prepared for wonderful and lasting marriages. Lasting relationships take the kind of support that requires commitment and doing things together.<br><br>On Valentine's Day I read an article on happy marriages. It said if you have to choose between love and commitment, choose commitment. Isn't that interesting? This is the time to develop attributes that build stable and caring relationships. Don't forget to value those who nurture you.<br><br>In recent years I have been very impressed and have an increased testimony of how much our Heavenly Father loves all of his children. I have felt that love through those who serve him, and I have felt that love through those who need him.<br><br>I've thought of the things I have learned since serving in the Young Women presidency. When I was called to be a counselor to Sister Ardeth Kapp, she was going on a trip to the Northwest (Eugene, Oregon) to do some leadership training. She said, "Why don't you go along with me? You can just get a feel for what we do when we go out and do leadership training. You won't have to do anything." She reassured me not to worry. We had that plane ride, made a transfer in Portland, and then, after we had landed in Eugene and gotten off the plane, she said, "Now, there will be four firesides. You take twenty-five minutes and I'll take twenty-five minutes." Then she told me we'd divide the time in sacrament meeting, that I could speak to one of the Young Women's groups, and the list went on.<br><br>I remember the first time I stood up at the pulpit with Sister Kapp sitting there behind me. I looked back at that big smile on her face and I thought, "Why am I not nervous?" Then I realized why I should be. She had told me to get a new set of scriptures because we never check luggage. I stood up at the pulpit not very well prepared, and as I turned to the scriptures I found all of my pages were glued together.<br><br>There I was, trying to get my pages unglued, and then there was Ardeth Kapp with her scriptures that had little fans and ribbons and lights--they just did all of these wonderful things. I looked at her and thought she would have gladly given me those scriptures, but how much better that she would trust and respect me enough to know that I could get those pages unglued and I could get myself prepared.<br><br>I've thought about that so often, and I've thought about little children. As toddlers learn to walk and they fall down and they get back up we smile--we know that it's normal to stumble. We give hugs and reassurance and encouragement, and then the growth process continues. That's the wonderful thing about caring environments, the affection and encouragement that allows us to try, to start over, to do again, and to even correct mistakes when we need to. Stable and caring relationships help make it happen.<br><br><i>The last and the most important lesson I have learned throughout my life is the value of faith, not just intellectual discovery.</i>It's easy to sell yourself short if you don't understand your own divine potential. I love the words of Elder Neal Maxwell when he said, "Trust in the Lord as he leads you along. He has things in mind for you that you can't know right now, but will unfold to you as you continue to prepare."<br><br>Things of the Spirit are understood by the Spirit. It is sometimes easy to reason away truth with our logical minds, but how thankful I have been for caring adults and teachers who have taught me and have shown me by their lives their commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I have thought a good deal about the lessons learned from Korihor, whose story is told in the thirtieth chapter of the book of Alma. Korihor is described in the heading as an antichrist, but I'm not sure that he started out that way. Have you ever thought that possibly Korihor started out as a college student with lots of questions? Although his questioning may have begun honestly, he made two really bad mistakes. First, he denied his faith. He denied the Light of Christ that had been given to him. Second, he started to preach false doctrine to others. Alma, his leader, bore his testimony to Korihor, and then Korihor made another mistake. Rather than listening to his leader and listening and relying on the Spirit, he defended his position with logic and became more argumentative. He demanded that he be given a sign. Korihor was given a sign. He was struck dumb. He didn't perhaps intend for the sign to have such an effect on him personally, but often the consequences of our mistakes do affect us personally.<br><br>Verses 52 and 53 of chapter 30 are most important, I believe. Korihor acknowledges, "I always knew that there was a God. But behold, the devil hath deceived me" (Alma 30:52–53). Isn't that interesting? "I always knew." He had the Light of Christ in him, but Satan deceived him. It is sad to read about what happened to him in his later life as he wandered about as a beggar.<br><br>In verse 60 we read, "Thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell" (Alma 30:60). Satan does not support those who follow him. He can't! It is the Lord who sustains; the Spirit sustains; righteousness sustains. That sustenance is not Satan's to give.<br><br>One of the greatest lessons we can learn is how the Spirit sustains those who try to live by faith. When adversity comes, and it does come, the Spirit seems stronger. I bear testimony of the love of our Savior Jesus Christ, not because of my worthiness, but because of his promise to those who believe on his name.<br><br>When I was called to be a counselor to Sister Kapp, I was called to the office of the First Presidency. I had said many times before that day that I have never been very much impressed by position, except those positions that have eternal consequence like mother and father, daughter and son. But that day, as I sat in the office of the First Presidency and President Monson took President Benson by the arm to lead him toward my chair to give me a blessing, I realized the prophet of God was going to have his hands on my head.<br><br>Following that beautiful blessing, as I stood and turned to face President Benson, I realized that for the year or two previously I had been relating in conversation to his physical health. We had often talked about whether or not President Benson would be able to be at conference, or whether or not he would be well enough to speak.<br><br>Because of that, as I turned in that close setting and spoke with him briefly, I was quite unprepared for the magnificence of his spirit. I realized that as our bodies age and grow old and wear out, our spirits continue to grow, and I believe I have a stronger testimony than I ever had before that time that this time is the time to prepare to meet our Heavenly Father. This life is the time to prepare for that above all other things.<br><br>How wonderful it would be if we could feel as worthy as our prophet when we stand before our Heavenly Father to account for the choices we have made in this life.<br><br>As I recognize the need for the atonement of Jesus Christ in my life, I value more each day the opportunities we each have to love and serve one another. That's what he asks of us!<br><br>This is your time to prepare, to develop character, to increase your faith. I have great confidence in you and your ability to figure out the future.<br><br>I normally resist telling people what they should do, but if I were to tell you anything, I would say, "Keep the commandments." Then, as you move forward, making and carrying out your plans, may you feel the blessings and the direction of the Spirit that are promised to those who keep his commandments. This would be my prayer for you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janette C.

<h1>with the Spirit and with the Understanding” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My wife and I, brothers and sisters, are very grateful to be here this evening. We are honored–especially honored to have a goodly number of our family here. It is a wonderful thing in life when children begin to eclipse their parents, and we sure feel that way about our children.<br><br>Before we came here tonight we had a reception with a number of the men and women who serve as leaders in your stakes here at BYU. I was touched by their quality and goodness, and I hope you realize that there are a few things that older men and women know that younger men and women can learn from them. I certainly commend these people and their teachings to you.<br><br>This morning I looked over my talk that I prepared some days ago. It really looked like a rather ordinary collection of words in some ways, and I realized that there is really only one thing that can breathe life into those words–that's the Spirit of the Lord, which I pray for tonight as I share with you these very humble thoughts. I've entitled my talk "Loving with the Spirit and with the Understanding."<br><br>Of all the opportunities for service that have come with my calling as a General Authority in the Church, none exceeds in my estimation the privilege of performing a sealing ceremony in one of the Lord's temples. Whenever I am in the setting of a beautifully appointed sealing room, facing a wholesome and anxious young couple about to make the most sacred of vows with God and with each other, I have a feeling that nothing I might say on that occasion will really do justice to the significance of it in their lives.<br><br>At such times I frequently remember my own wedding day nearly twenty-six years ago and the strong feelings of love that I had for my wife, Kathy. I also remember our high expectations for the future. I am sure that we had an ideal in mind that wasn't necessarily peculiar to us, and yet we (or at least I) thought Kathy and I were about to begin a companionship together that would be unparalleled in the romantic history of Western civilization!<br><br>Nevertheless, despite our best intentions and efforts, the "ideal" began to collide with reality shortly after our brief honeymoon in Salt Lake City at the then existing equivalent of a Motel 6. I cannot speak for Kathy but, on my part, I soon began to feel some small sense of disillusionment–a feeling that there was something more to be had in and from marriage than I, at least, seemed capable of producing.<br><br>There began to be a gradual descent from the lofty level of our wedding day to a somewhat lower plateau where we seemed destined to live out our lives well beneath our privileges. One small example from among many will illustrate the type of memories that Kathy and I were accumulating together about that time.<br><br>We were living in Salt Lake City, where I was attending law school and Kathy was teaching first grade. The stress of both of us being new to the city, to our schools, and to each other became a little heavy and our relationship a bit testy. One night about dinnertime we had a quarrel that convinced me there was no hope for nourishment at home. So I left our modest apartment and walked to the nearest fast food restaurant a block away. As I entered the north door of this establishment, I looked to my right and, much to my surprise, saw Kathy entering through the south door! We exchanged angry glances and advanced to opposing cash registers to place our orders. We continued to ignore each other as we sat alone on opposite ends of the restaurant sullenly eating our evening meal. We then left as we had entered, taking separate routes home, finally ending this utterly ridiculous episode by reconciling and laughing together about how infantile we had both been.<br><br>I realize now that such little tiffs are not uncommon in the early stages of most marriages. However, I also know that my rather lighthearted introduction to the main idea I would like to share with you tonight does not really express the deep feelings I had then and have now about the tremendous potential for fulfillment and happiness that exists in an eternal marriage–potential that can often go unrealized.<br><br>Perhaps I can best express my feelings by reminding all of us that as the restoration of the gospel unfolded, the doctrine of eternal marriage apparently was not taught by the Prophet Joseph until several years after the organization of the Church. When he began to teach it, he did so selectively. Elder Parley P. Pratt, who had been married civilly about thirteen years earlier, first heard about the concept of eternal marriage from Joseph Smith in Philadelphia in 1839. His reaction, as recorded in his autobiography, may be difficult for those of us to understand who have grown up with the anticipation that we would be married in a temple for time and all eternity. This concept was completely new to Elder Pratt, and he was overwhelmed by it.<br><br>I will let him speak for himself as he describes his meetings at that time with the Prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>During these interviews he taught me many great and glorious principles concerning God and the heavenly order of eternity. It was at this time that I received from him the first idea of eternal family organization, and the eternal union of the sexes in those inexpressibly endearing relationships which none but the highly intellectual, the refined and pure in heart, know how to prize, and which are at the very foundation of everything worthy to be called happiness.</i><br><br><i>Till then I had learned to esteem kindred affections and sympathies as appertaining solely to this transitory state, as something from which the heart must be entirely weaned, in order to be fitted for its heavenly state.</i><br><br><i>It was Joseph Smith who taught me how to prize the endearing relationships of father and mother, husband and wife; of brother and sister, son and daughter.</i><br><br><i>It was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and all eternity; and that the refined sympathies and affections which endeared us to each other emanated from the fountain of divine eternal love. It was from him that I learned that we might cultivate these affections, and grow and increase in the same to all eternity; while the result of our endless union would be an offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, or the sands of the sea shore.</i><br><br><i>It was from him that I learned the true dignity and destiny of a son of God, clothed with an eternal priesthood, as the patriarch and sovereign of his countless offspring. It was from him that I learned that the highest dignity of womanhood was, to stand as a queen and priestess to her husband, and to reign for ever and ever as the queen mother of her numerous and still increasing offspring.</i><br><br><i>I had loved before, but I knew not why. But now I loved–with a pureness–an intensity of elevated, exalted feeling, which would lift my soul from the transitory things of this grovelling sphere and expand it as the ocean. I felt that God was my heavenly Father indeed; that Jesus was my brother, and that the wife of my bosom was an immortal, eternal companion; a kind ministering angel, given to me as a comfort, and a crown of glory for ever and ever. In short, I could now love with the spirit and with the understanding also.</i>[<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1985), pp. 259–60]<br><br>In all of Latter-day Saint literature, I know of no more beautiful or powerful statement than this concerning the potential for fulfillment and happiness we have in marriages created and lived in the Lord's way. Think of the implications of being able to love "with the spirit and with the understanding also." Consider the power of the idea that of all of the people on earth, we Latter-day Saints, because of revealed truth, know the most about genuine romantic love and have the greatest opportunity to have truly happy and enduring marriages. Will it not be a memorable day when as a people we are best known not just for our large families–and, I might add parenthetically, our Suburbans–but for our truly exceptional marriages? Maybe you are a generation that will help bring that to pass.<br><br>What are the gospel truths that permit us to court one another and eventually establish marriages that are happy, fulfilling, and enduring? I will discuss a few that I feel are most vital. All of them are closely related to the Savior, his teachings, and the central role that he plays in the gospel plan.<br><br><i>Developing Our Capacity to Love.</i>First, I want to mention that the teachings of Christ suggest that we should begin our search for an eternal companion with greater concern about our ability to give love than about our need to receive it. Of the Savior, John wrote, "We love him, because he first loved us" (1 John 4:19).<br><br>Indeed, it may be our own capacity to give love that makes us most lovable. The greater our own substance as a person, the deeper our own mental, emotional, and spiritual reserves, the greater will be our capacity to nurture and love others, especially our companion. In a talk on the welfare program some years ago, President Marion G. Romney posed a question that puts our ability to genuinely care about others in perspective:<br><br><i>How can we give if there is nothing there? Food for the hungry cannot come from empty shelves. Money to assist the needy cannot come from an empty purse. Support and understanding cannot come from the emotionally starved. Teaching cannot come from the unlearned. And most important of all, spiritual guidance cannot come from the spiritually weak.</i>["The Celestial Nature of Self-Reliance,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1982, p. 93]<br><br>May I also add that very little love can come from one who is not at peace with himself and his God. As Enos learned and shared, no one can be concerned about the welfare of someone else and give love to another until he has taken care of his own soul. Thus, our preparation for an eternal marriage must include repenting, learning, acquiring faith, and developing the security that comes with a vision of our potential as children of God.<br><br><i>Virtue Loveth Virtue.</i>There is a very natural and wonderful consequence of becoming a person capable of great love. It is described in this passage from the Doctrine and Covenants: "For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light" (D&amp;amp;C 88:40).<br><br>Here is recorded a gospel truth well worth remembering during the dating and courtship years: Our personal development and spiritual growth will not only give us greater capacity to love, but if we pursue the goal of an eternal marriage with purity and with both our hearts and minds, I believe in most cases we will eventually be rewarded with a companion who is at least our spiritual equal and who will cleave unto intelligence and light as we do; who will receive wisdom as we receive it; who will embrace truth as we embrace it; and who will love virtue as we love it. To spend the eternities with a companion who shares the most important of fundamental values with us and who will discuss them, live them, and join in teaching them to one's children is among the most soul-satisfying experiences of true romantic love. To know that there really is someone "out there" who is walking a parallel path of goodness and growth and who yearns for the same eternal values and happiness we yearn for is of great comfort.<br><br>I witnessed a powerful example of this principle recently as I sealed a stately young couple in the Salt Lake Temple. After I had performed the sealing ceremony and they had exchanged rings and embraces, I asked them to share their feelings with those who were present. The new bride spoke first. Her brief remarks reflected both gratitude and emotion as she told how from her very youngest years she had desired to keep herself virtuous and had hoped to find a companion who shared her values and righteous aspirations. She confirmed the goodness of her new husband by witnessing that he was all she had hoped for and more.<br><br>Then the young man spoke. He, too, was tearful as he shared how at age fourteen he had inexplicably begun to pray to the Lord, asking that the wife of his future, whoever she might be, would be protected and would keep herself virtuous while preparing for an eternal marriage. He also told how he had committed himself again and again over those years to that same path. Then he expressed his great joy at having met this wife of his prayers and at his high hopes for a truly exceptional marriage. I am not a believer in predestined love, but I do believe that truly good people in due time will usually find other truly good people to marry. I also believe such people are worth waiting for. Virtue loveth virtue! Truth embraceth truth!<br><br><i>Bridling Passions.</i>Although it can only be accorded its fullest expression in marriage, the seeds of fulfilling romantic love are planted during courtship. It is during this time that we should be mindful and appreciative of the truth and level of understanding reflected in Alma's timeless counsel to his son Shiblon: "And also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love" (Alma 38:12).<br><br>Those of you who have grown up around horses, saddles, and bridles will perceive that Alma was not suggesting to Shiblon that he eradicate his passions, but rather that he control or channel them for the very worthwhile purpose of being filled with love. During courtship this control will result in a deferral of the physical gratification that is related to romantic love and to a beautiful blossoming of that love in marriage. But during marriage there will also be restraint and moderation, for the gospel teaches that "unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions" (D&amp;amp;C 88:38).<br><br>Married Latter-day Saints must remember that not everything the world condones and even encourages in the name of expressing romantic love has place in an eternal marriage. In the words of Elder Boyd K. Packer:<br><br><i>The greatest deception foisted upon the human race in our day is that overemphasis of physical gratification as it is related to romantic love. It is merely a repetition of the same delusion that has been impressed on every generation in ages past. When we learn that physical gratification is only incident to, and not the compelling force of love itself, we have made a supreme discovery.</i>[<i>Eternal Love,</i>adapted from an address given to students at Brigham Young University (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1973), p. 15]<br><br>As a righteous couple grows and matures in their love, they will come to know that it is a fine blending of the spiritual and physical dimensions of their relationship that forms a solid foundation for their eternal union.<br><br><i>Marriage as a Priority.</i>Because the restored gospel reveals that eternal life with our Heavenly Father will be lived in family units, the ultimate and preeminent goal of all of us ought to be to achieve a rewarding marriage and to become effective fathers and mothers as part of that marriage relationship. This truth places a priority and importance on marriage that we cannot afford to ignore. All of the prophets in recent years have made powerful statements about this truth, but the lives of many of us continue to show how lightly we regard their counsel. In a gospel sense there can be only one magnificent obsession–the attainment of an eternal marriage and the development of an eternal family unit.<br><br>Nevertheless, Satan will seek to have us do otherwise, and enticing voices will speak to us of worldly achievements and acquisitions that will lead us on dangerous detours from which we can return only with great effort. Small, seemingly insignificant choices along the way will have large consequences and will determine our eventual destiny.<br><br>One of these for Kathy and me came early in our marriage when I was struggling as a first-year law student and she was overwhelmed by her first teaching position. We barely met in all of our individual comings and goings, and our relationship with each other was suffering noticeably. Even Sundays were burdensome as we tried to fulfill our Church callings and catch up on our studies and school preparation. Finally we sat down one evening and decided if our marriage was the most important part of our lives, we had better start acting like it was. We agreed to completely honor the Sabbath by refraining from work, including our studies, and by devoting ourselves to the building of a stronger marriage. There was an immediate surge in our feelings toward each other and noticeable improvement in other areas, including my grades and Kathy's teaching. Twenty-six years later we are still faced with many similar choices and issues. I hope and pray we are still resolving them in favor of the things that matter most.<br><br><i>Perfection Is Gradual.</i>Another gospel truth that definitely impacts marriage is the one contained in verse 13 of section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants which describes the process by which our Savior became perfect: "And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness."<br><br>A recognition that the Savior's perfection came gradually is comforting to two imperfect beings trying to make their marriage resemble the one described in the Laurel lesson manual! In my own case, I recently ventured to ask my wife: "How am I doing?" This was a very risky question to ask, and I suppose I should not have been surprised at her answer.<br><br>"Well," she said, "I think you are nicer than you used to be!" You may not think that response is anything to get excited about, but I do.<br><br>It also leads me to believe that those of you who are walking around with a checklist of desirable attributes in a prospective companion may come off empty-handed. Most of those attributes will be only in embryo when you are courting and will take most of a lifetime to perfect. J. Golden Kimball's wry wit perhaps says it best: "I have often wondered what would happen if a perfect man married a perfect woman. I'll bet he would shoot her inside of a week if she didn't poison him first" (Claude Richards,<i>J. Golden Kimball: The Story of a Unique Personality</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966], pp. 99–100).<br><br><i>Commitment.</i>There is another gospel principle that significantly contributes to an understanding and realization of an eternal marriage at the level we are discussing. It has to do with the absolute commitment we are to have toward each other in marriage as described in this scripture: "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else" (D&amp;amp;C 42:22).<br><br>This obviously means just as completely that "Thou shalt love thy husband with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto him and none else." The giving of ourselves to one another that occurs in an eternal marriage is an unconditional giving of the whole person for the whole journey. None of us knows at the time we marry what life will bring in terms of health challenges, financial setbacks, or even transgressions.<br><br>Recently I attended a viewing where a widower, supported by several handsome and stalwart sons, stood bravely at the side of his wife's casket. This man and his wife had been married for fifty-three years, and during the last six of those she had been seriously ill with a terminal kidney disease. She should probably have been placed in a rest home, but he would not hear of it and had provided the twenty-four-hour care she had required until his health, too, was in jeopardy.<br><br>As I passed through the receiving line, I expressed my admiration for him and the great love and care he had given his wife. I then felt compelled to ask: "How did you do it? How did you do it?"<br><br>"Oh, that's easy," he replied. "Fifty-three years ago in the Salt Lake Temple I knelt at an altar and made a little deal with her and the Lord, and I wanted to keep it."<br><br>In an eternal marriage the thought of ending what has begun with a covenant with God and with each other simply has little place. When challenges come and our individual weaknesses are revealed, the remedy is to repent, to change, to improve, and to apologize, not to separate or divorce. When we make our own "little deal" with the Lord and our eternal companion, we should do everything within our power to honor its terms.<br><br><i>Loving Kindness.</i>A final gospel truth that will contribute to our understanding and the quality of our marriages relates to the degree we involve the Savior in our relationships as husbands and wives. Marriage, as designed by our Heavenly Father, contemplates our first entering into a covenant relationship with Christ and then with each other. He and his teachings must be the focal point of our togetherness. As we become more like him and grow closer to him, we will naturally become more loving and grow closer to each other.<br><br>I have personally felt the mellowing influence of Christ's example and teachings in my own marriage. I can vividly recall how easy it was to be accusing and judgmental and to find fault in the early years of our marriage. When I came home in the evenings having set the whole world in order, I would often wonder why Kathy was struggling with her few square feet in the kitchen! Then one day a wise teacher shared with me this touching description of the Savior given us by Nephi:<br><br><i>And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.</i>[1 Nephi 19:9]<br><br>I suppose "loving kindness" is a synonym for charity or the pure love of Christ. I know that it is an absolutely essential ingredient in an eternal marriage and that romantic love cannot be separated from it nor can it flourish without it. "Loving kindness" is a common thread in all exceptional marriages with which I am personally acquainted.<br><br>I know also that "loving kindness" is the remedy for almost all marital problems.<br><br>As I near the end of my remarks tonight, I have the distinct feeling that I have only scratched the surface of my chosen topic. How can one ever adequately do justice to doctrines and truths that, if followed, will enable us as husbands and wives to "pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to [our] exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon [our] heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19)?<br><br>I also feel I have left much unsaid. I have not spoken of unselfishness, of work, of sacrifice, of forgiveness, of agency, of priesthood, or even of children–all of which, along with many other things, are vital elements in the attainment of the type of marriage we have discussed. However, this much I know: If we will continue to strive to love with understanding, the Spirit of the Lord will "show unto [us] all things what [we] should do" to achieve an eternal marriage pleasing to the Lord (2 Nephi 32:5). Under the influence of his spirit our sympathies and love for our eternal companion will deepen, and we will come to know a happiness and contentment in marriage that the world will never know.<br><br>I know, too, that this is possible for each one of us. No matter what our background or the quality of marriage our grandparents or parents enjoyed, we can in time and with the Lord's help achieve the ideal. If our heritage is one of a spiritually strong family with healthy marriages and close family relationships, we will be able to build and even improve upon the foundation that has been laid. If we are not so fortunate, we can resolve that this condition will change with our generation and that our children will receive such a legacy.<br><br>Above all, I hope we will vow never to be satisfied with a mediocre marriage. Not long ago a friend told me one of his young children had asked: "Do you think Grandpa ever kisses Grandma?" I certainly hope Kathy and I are sufficiently in love and demonstrative enough about it that our grandchildren will never have to wonder. We cannot afford to let our relationships become merely mutual toleration or accommodation. The Lord has intended for us to have much more than that. Eternal marriage is godlike marriage. It is a description of a quality or type of marriage, not of its duration. What type of marriage would our God have? That is a question worthy of our contemplation.<br><br>I recently read about the "Rose Street Women" of World War II Germany. These were German women married to Jewish men. These men enjoyed a privileged status for a time as laborers, but they were eventually ordered into a Jewish community center in Berlin on Rose Street pending deportation to Auschwitz, the notorious camp in Poland. Some two dozen women heard rumors that their husbands were being held on Rose Street and went there to protest.<br><br>A crowd began to gather, eventually reaching 1,000 people in size. "Give us back our men!" the women shouted. "We want to see our men." The women refused orders to leave and remained for several days. Then machine gun nests were set up by SS troops who ordered the streets cleared. The women remained.<br><br>Six days after the protest began, Joseph Goebbels ordered the release of 1,500 prisoners inside the center. Twenty-five men already bound for Auschwitz–their concentration-camp numbers freshly tattooed–were returned to their wives.<br><br>While it is unclear why the Nazis buckled to the Rose Street women, their strong and enduring love for their men may offer the best explanation.<br><br>If such good people without the understanding and spirit that the gospel provides can love so fully, so courageously, think of the potential we have. I pray that we will love purely, and with the Spirit and the understanding, always and forever. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marlin K.

<h1>Small Things Proceedeth That Which Is Great” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I really appreciate so many of my friends and family and loved ones being here. I'm really touched by you being here. I have known for about two months that I would be giving this talk. I have to admit that that is about two months too long. I have always been in favor of having the periods of terror in my life be as short as possible. In reality, however, these two months have allowed me to think about who might be in this audience and what I could possibly say that would be of benefit. I've thought of you, the young adult students with so much of the road of life before you; I've thought of you less-traditional students, those who have returned after time away from formal education; and I've thought of us, the faculty, staff, and other adults who have traveled a little farther down the road. And I've thought about what we could learn together. I ask you now for your prayers in my behalf and your own behalf that what I say will be of value.<br><br>As President Lee mentioned, I grew up the youngest of ten children. Being youngest in any family has both its advantages and its disadvantages, as I very quickly found out. One advantage is that you're spoiled, and your parents think you're a darling. One disadvantage is that you're spoiled, and the rest of the world (including your siblings) think you're anything but a darling. Another advantage is that less is generally expected of you because you are younger than everyone else in the household. Another<i>dis</i>advantage is that less is generally expected of you because you are younger than everyone else in the household. I distinctly remember thinking when I was quite young, before I was eight, that there was a real possibility that the idea of growing up was a fiction--something like the Easter bunny or the tooth fairy, something that adults told children that wasn't really real. I remember thinking about growing up and noticing, even though people told me I was getting bigger, that there never seemed to be a closing of the gap. I never seemed to gain on anyone--my brothers and sisters were ever bigger than I was and always more capable. Just as I would finally be able to do something, they were able to do even more and greater things. I was always too young or too little to do the things that they were doing. It seemed that I would never be able to do anything important, anything significant.<br><br>And I remember that I wanted to do something important, something significant. I wanted to do something that would make a difference. I knew very soon that there were people who had made a difference in the world. As I grew, I read books, including almost all the juvenile biographies our public library had to offer, and I found inspiration from the stories of George Washington, Florence Nightingale, Abraham Lincoln, Clara Barton, etc. I went to movies and thrilled as Joan of Arc or Robin Hood or even one of the cowboy heroes fought against odds for high and noble causes.<br><br>I listened to teachers in church, and I knew that it made a difference that David was not afraid to face Goliath while King Saul and the hosts of Israel cowered in their tents, trying to figure out what to do. I knew that it mattered that Esther put her life on the line in order to reveal the treachery of Haman and make it possible for the Jews to defend themselves against the total destruction Haman had planned. And I knew that it made a great deal of difference that one fourteen-year-old boy went into the woods by himself on a lovely spring morning and, in faith, asked an honest question, and then spent the rest of his life being true to the answer he received. I knew that I wanted to make a difference, too.<br><br>I mention these things neither to ridicule nor to glorify my childhood dreams, but because I think they were normal. I suspect and hope that many, if not all of you, have had such dreams or desires at some point in your lives, and that you also have wanted to do something important, something significant, something that would really make a difference. I think such desires are natural in all of us who are children of God, and I pray today that such desires have not left even though they may now take a more adult form. I hope they have not left, because I want to talk about really making a difference, really doing something significant. As I have grown up and gone about my adult life, I have come to some new understandings about this issue. It's what I wish to talk about today so that maybe some can learn sooner or faster or better than I have, so that maybe we can all be reminded of the sweetness and the rightness and hope that comes from good dreams, and so that we can maybe reflect one more time and appreciate the great difference the Savior made through his life and atonement. I also hope that we can recognize that, through his atonement, he has made it possible for each one of us, too, to make a significant difference.<br><br>I wish to base my talk about doing something great on a scripture found in D&amp;amp;C 64:33. It reads: "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great." I'd like to begin my discussion of this scripture by asking you to consider if it really is true that things which are great proceed out of small things. I think, if we think about it, we will recognize that, in many ways, this idea is in contradiction to what the world thinks or teaches. The world expects great things to proceed out of<i>great</i>things. People must rant and rave and shout to cause change. Wars must be fought, arms assembled, summit meetings held. And certainly the media must record it for the world to see.<br><br>The Lord, however, works quietly, behind the scenes, through unfailing laws of truth. Individuals come, one by one, to the support of what is right. Small economic pressures or forces of nature or minor events come to bear, and something "great" occurs--and people wonder how things came to be. They chip away and carry pieces of the Berlin Wall home, but they somehow know that it was not their hammers or chisels that made the wall fall. Something great has proceeded out of many small things that the media could not or did not record.<br><br>I have three other examples that have struck me and have taught me very forcefully that great things come out of small things. One of the examples is used fairly commonly these days. It is the Salt Lake Temple. A month or so ago, I visited the exhibit on the temple at the Church History Museum in Salt Lake. Like many of you, I marveled at the perseverance and ingenuity of those who engaged in the building of the temple, but I know that one of the things that most struck me about the temple building was not the construction itself. I couldn't help but notice the Salt Lake City that surrounded the work of the temple--I noticed the little houses, the businesses, the streets, the general smallness and the bareness.<br><br>I thought of the lives of the people who were building this temple--the farmers with horse-drawn ploughs (if they were lucky enough to have a horse) clearing off sagebrush lands, starting to make them productive. I thought of housewives in adobe houses doing their washes, tending their children, feeding and clothing their families. I thought of businessmen trying to conduct business far from financial and industrial centers.<br><br>I read what the press said when the temple was done. Yes, the newspapers recognized that indeed something great had been accomplished, and they marveled about it. They didn't mention cracked blocks that had to be replaced, broken axles on oxcarts moving the granite blocks, tools dulled and sharpened again and again, canals built and abandoned, individual homes whose building was delayed--and, yet, it was out of these small things that the great thing that they praised had proceeded.<br><br>A few years ago I had another experience that helped me recognize my own blindness to what small things had produced. For one of my research projects I had to go down to Colonia Juarez, one of several communities built in the last century by Latter-day Saints in northern Mexico. A friend of mine from Colonia Juarez picked me up in El Paso, Texas, and drove me to her community. During the drive we crossed a lot of desert area of the kind that would almost seem a caricature for west Texas and northern Mexico--sand, dirt, cactus, an occasional little pueblo with adobe buildings, broken-down-looking cars, and only one paved road, which was the highway we were on. Everything seemed hot and dirty. After about four hours the road started to descend and curve a little more, and, as we came around a bend, suddenly, there was Colonia Juarez. I was stunned. There were beautiful fruit orchards, brick homes with lovely yards, water running in ditches by the side of the streets, plenty of shade trees. If I had not known where I was, I would have sworn that I was in one of many small towns I was familiar with in Utah. Everything looked like it. And then I realized that the small towns and big cities in Utah were as much a surprise and a wonder, not because of their smallness or quaintness (as some of you more sophisticated types may think) but because they, just like Colonia Juarez, had been wrested out of the desert. Something great had proceeded out of the small, forward-looking acts of many--a true miracle had been produced.<br><br>My final story of great things which proceeded out of small things is a personal story out of Chile. I served a mission in Chile twenty-five years ago. This past July I had the opportunity to return to Chile for about six months on a Fulbright grant. It was fun for me to see the economic growth and strength that the country had gained. But it was phenomenal to be able to observe firsthand the growth of the Church. When I left Chile the first time, there were zero stakes. When I left this time, there were more than fifty-five. When I arrived in Chile the first time, there were about 16,000 members. When I arrived this time, there were well over 100,000 members.<br><br>But the thing that struck me most personally was not the quantitative growth, but the qualitative growth that I observed. I had a chance to look up some of the people I had known in Chile twenty-five years before. I visited people we had taught who had never been baptized. I visited people who were baptized and had fallen away. I visited people who were baptized and had come and gone in their activity. And I visited people who were baptized and had stayed active, filling missions themselves or, if older, sending their children on missions, marrying in the temple, serving where they were called. And I saw the difference. It was as if I had been given the opportunity to observe the results of a longitudinal experiment with four treatment groups where I could see what a difference a certain treatment makes, what a difference small things, small variables make. I saw the personal peace and depth of character and happiness of the always active members. I saw the strength of their families and the advantages that had come to their children because of it. I saw their magnified capacities and how these capacities had blessed them in their church work and also in their employment. I saw how they had risen temporally, intellectually, and spiritually. I literally saw the fruits of the gospel in their lives, the great things that had proceeded out of small things--all out of the decision to be baptized, out of the decision or decisions to stay active, out of following the counsel of leaders, out of serving. I saw the great things that resulted: greatness in character, peace, and happiness here. And I believe that even greater things are to come in the hereafter. I know from them that small things make a difference.<br><br>And now I'd like to discuss<i>what</i>small things we all might work with in order to make a difference in our lives and in significant matters. One of them has been well illustrated by what I found in Chile. It is the small decision to trust and believe the Lord.<br><br>A few years back I had a very bright former student who was struggling with her testimony. She somehow felt that she had never received an overwhelming answer to her prayers about the Church. As I talked with her, trying to help her, she said something that has struck me over and over since then with its simplicity and truth. She said something like, "Yes, there are many logical reasons to think that the Church is good, but eventually everyone who believes it is true does it on faith; he or she has to choose to believe."<br><br>What she said is true; sooner or later everyone has to choose to believe or not. We have to choose to recognize the sweetness of the Spirit that comes when we think about the Church being true. We have to acknowledge, when we pray and ask the Lord if the Church and the Book of Mormon are true, that the thought that we already know that they are comes from the Being who knows our thoughts. We have to admit that, indeed, we do know they are true.<br><br>But the decision to believe does not have to be done without plenty of evidence either. After my former student said what she did, I examined my life to see why I believed. I found numberless occasions of real joy and happiness associated with following the teachings of the Church. I realized that, even if I had not had a great confirmation of peace from the Spirit about the truthfulness of the Church, I would still choose to believe and follow simply because it makes me happy. I also recognized that I had never met anyone who had derived real happiness and peace out of wrong choices. I had known several who had tried, many of whom had claimed to be happy. Several of them had later confessed in tears--as they dealt with the consequences of their choices--that they had lied in their claims, that they had been fooled by the father of lies himself. I know that the decision to believe in the Church and the gospel is a small thing out of which great things proceed and that the choice or choices not to believe bring sorrow.<br><br>But I think there is more than just the decision to believe in the Church and the gospel that we must make if great things are to proceed. We must also choose to trust what the Lord says and understand that it applies to us. I had an experience growing up that I have recounted in other places and that I am going to repeat here because it illustrates what I am trying to say.<br><br>About as soon as I learned to read, I remember encountering on the bedroom door of my brother, who was about ten years older than I, a sign that read, "Keep out! This means you." I remember that I found the sign puzzling. Who could my brother possibly be trying to keep out of his bedroom? The bedroom was in the farthest corner of the basement, and none of the neighbor kids ever seemed to go down there. I could not think, as I went in and out of my brother's bedroom whenever I pleased, who he could possibly mean. It wasn't until many years later, when I myself was in my teens and saw the sign again, that it suddenly dawned on me for whom it was intended. The sign had done absolutely no good in my case because I did not realize that it was intended precisely for me.<br><br>Many of us are like that with the teachings of the gospel. We know the gospel is true, but we don't think individual teachings apply directly to us or our circumstances. For example, we don't trust that the Lord will "open [us] the windows of heaven, and pour [us] out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it," and that he "will rebuke the devourer for [our] sakes" (Malachi 3:10–11) if we honestly pay our tithing. We think that promise is for people who are not having financial troubles as we are.<br><br>Or we don't believe that honestly keeping the Sabbath has anything to do with things that "please the eye," "gladden the heart," "strengthen the body," and "enliven the soul" (see D&amp;amp;C 59:18–19)--and, yet, these things are promised along with the ability to keep ourselves "unspotted from the world" (see D&amp;amp;C 59:9). We think that keeping the Sabbath applies only for the length of the three-hour meeting block or to people who don't have as much to do as we do. We don't choose to take the Lord at his word.<br><br>I love the story that Parley P. Pratt tells in his autobiography of how he took the Lord at his word. Parley went through the Bible picking out all of the blessings that the Lord had promised to those who followed him. Parley wrote the blessings, each on a piece of paper, put them in a box, and carried them with him, calling them his "treasure," because he counted the blessings the same as already given. He was absolutely sure they would follow. Parley did this before he heard of the Restoration. Later, he trusted the blessings that the Restoration offered and chose to be baptized and to follow--a small decision that was the key to big blessings for him. The decision to believe the gospel and to trust the word of the Lord in all things is a small thing for us, but it, too, will be the key to big blessings for us.<br><br>Another small thing, another particular decision to trust the Lord, that I would like to talk about is the decision to repent. We need to be careful not to hide our sins without taking care of them, not to ignore the repentance process. I have found that one of the biggest obstacles I have to overcome in order to repent is my own pride. It really does demand humility to recognize that we have need to repent. Yet the scriptures tell us, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). We sometimes have a tendency to think that what we have done is not very bad. We pile our shortcomings up and measure them against what we see as the shortcomings and faults of our neighbors, our roommates, our husbands and wives, our fellow ward members, and we think we look pretty good. But, if we are really honest with ourselves and look at what the Lord sees, we recognize that we are "weighed in the balance ... and found wanting" (Daniel 5:27). Our path to perfection must lie through a series of "small" repentances, but we never get on that path unless we are willing to admit that we have done less than right or good, that we have done wrong. So it is a small but significant thing to seek honestly to see our sins and overcome them.<br><br>I know from my own experience that the Holy Ghost can help immensely in this process. If we ask, he will reveal to us our sins--not in one big lump so that we are completely overwhelmed and discouraged by our faults, but one by one at the right moments and in the right proportions as we are able to deal with them. He will help us from where we are to where we need to go. Here, once again, the matter of trust enters in. We need to trust that our baptism is an everlasting covenant and that, at the point we recognize and repent of our sins, we will be cleansed.<br><br>The sacrament is given to us every week--a small thing to keep us reminded of the baptismal covenant and its eternal nature and to help us in the repentance process. Out of this small thing can come very good things for our growth. I would like to pass on to you something that I was taught in my youth by a very good seminary teacher, Brother Boyd Beagley. It's a small application of the sacrament that has blessed my life repeatedly and immeasurably.<br><br>Brother Beagley suggested that rather than thinking each week as the sacrament is passed, "I'm sorry for all the bad things I've done and I'll try to do better," we should seriously examine ourselves and think of specific things we have done during the past week that might be a cause of grief to the Lord who spilled his blood for us. We should evaluate not only actions, but also thoughts and attitudes since the last time we took the sacrament.<br><br>If we are truly humble and seek his help, the Holy Ghost will help us in selecting from among our shortcomings or faults the one thing we most need to work on during the coming week. We may move on to something new each week, or we may find that we will keep working on the same thing for several weeks in a row. On other occasions we will find ourselves circling back to recurring faults and our greatest weaknesses. Whatever the Spirit reveals to us as the thing that is most displeasing to the Lord, we should commit ourselves to working on. We then should think of possible times and circumstances that may arise in the coming week that may lead us into temptation in the area, and plan ahead for ways to avoid or overcome the temptation. Then we take the sacrament, reaffirming our part of the covenant and asking that we may always have the Lord's spirit to be with us. During the week we do the very best we can; we make our best efforts in the selected area of weakness. When we come to the sacrament table the next week, we reexamine ourselves. Here again the Spirit tells us what we need to work on. He also allows us to feel forgiven when we have honestly overcome. Once again, we must choose to trust the Lord. We need to remember that he has said, "He who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). We do not need to drag our burdens around with us, never forgiving ourselves, thinking we are no good, too weak for the Lord to love and forgive. We should remember that the Lord blesses not necessarily because we are good and totally worthy, but because he is good and totally worthy. This whole process is really a small thing, but I testify from my own life that it makes a real difference. I sincerely advocate these two small things: really trusting in the Lord and honestly repenting every week.<br><br>And now I come to the final question I would like to address: What great things proceed out of these two small things? I believe that literally they can take a natural man or woman and change him or her into a man or woman of Christ. It is no small thing to turn a regular person into something godly. Our work may never be written up in the media; the world may never put what we have done on any of its "Top Ten" lists. But we have much better evidence that what we are doing is significant: This is the work in which he who is the greatest of all, who understands the real worth of all things, who could be engaged in any work he desires, this is the very work in which he is engaged. "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). We can let lesser causes lure us away from this significant work or we can do this larger work in the Lord's specified quiet ways and know that it does make a difference, eternities without end.<br><br>Several years ago I read a newspaper article about a famous movie director. The article had a quote from the director in it that I believe and that has stayed in my mind even though I cannot remember who the director was (although many people to whom I have recited the quote tell me that it was probably Frank Capra). The director said, "Character is destiny." I believe that. I believe that what we are will "out," that eventually our fatal flaws or quietly developed strengths will have consequences, that our final destiny will depend not just on what we have done, noticed or not, but on what we have become, who we have become. And I believe that it is by small things that we become something or someone great.<br><br>I also think that doing these small things makes a difference in what happens in our<br><br>larger society. I think it makes a difference in what gets passed down to our children. If we do these small but righteous things, we will be giving them a better world and a broader view of truth and eternity. It honestly does make a difference for society, now and in the future, if we personally do the small things that help raise language from the gutter; that allow our neighborhoods to be safe without lock and key; that stop abuses of all kinds from being passed on to new generations--if we make kindness, sensitivity, and sacrificing love the norms.<br><br>I believe that the small things I have been talking about can eventually lead to something really great for all of us, something long foretold and wished for by prophets and saints of all dispensations. I sincerely believe that we can establish Zion, the city of the pure in heart, the city of those who have washed their sins in the blood of the Lamb, person by person, sin by sin.<br><br>My last visit to Chile allowed me to see something else besides just the individual results that had come into the lives of people. It allowed me to see how society changes when individuals change. For example, I could see the kind of growth and society that existed in areas where the Church had now been for several decades. It was a different society than it was even when I was there twenty-five years ago. Things were better; expectations were higher. In the areas where the Church had not been, I saw how society still operated the unkindnesses, the pettinesses, the blatant dishonesty. And then I returned here--a place that has grown up with the influence of the Church and its teachings for several generations. As I look around us here, I recognize that we have not arrived yet, but we are nearer than we were at the beginning of the Church. The speed with which we arrive at Zion depends on each of us.<br><br>I return to our childhood dreams. Do we really want to do something important? Do we really want to do something significant? Do we really want to do something that will make a difference? The chance is ours. And when we are ready, Christ will come.<br><br>And so I repeat the scripture I began with. Maybe, like Parley P. Pratt, we could write it on a piece of paper and carry it with us always to remind us of the Lord's sure promises: "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>May we each commit ourselves to understand the Lord's purposes for us and to do those small things that will make it possible for him to bring forth that which is great among us. I know that he will do it if we will do it. I pray that we will. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Cheryl Brown was an associate professor of linguistics and associate dean of the College of Humanities at Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 11 May 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am pleased to be with you this evening. I express my gratitude for the beautiful music that has been performed and for the prayers offered in our behalf. I am glad that this telecast is being transmitted by satellite to many locations. I love these occasions when the future leaders and mothers and fathers of the Church gather for worship and learning.<br><br>This evening I will speak about a subject of immense importance. Because of my earlier responsibilities, I have given many talks from this pulpit at BYU. Yet I have no hesitancy in saying that this message is the most important I have ever given here.<br><br>I speak to you as one of that small group who have been very close to President Ezra Taft Benson during all of the seven and one-half years he has served as our prophet/president. I have been part of virtually every occasion when he and his counselors have met with the Council of the Twelve Apostles, and I have been present on every occasion when he has instructed the General Authorities. I have read all of the books he has written and studied the written text of all of the talks he has given as President of the Church.<br><br>From that vantage point I will speak about what all of us understand to be his central message as President of the Church. I refer to why we are encouraged to study and restudy the Book of Mormon.<br><h2><b>I</b></h2><br>President Benson's administration as President of the Church has been punctuated by his repeated and fervent pleas for all of us to study the Book of Mormon on a daily basis for the rest of our lives. For example, in his conference address to the members of the Church in the solemn assembly where he was sustained as President of the Church, he said:<br><br><i>The Lord inspired His servant Lorenzo Snow to reemphasize the principle of tithing to redeem the Church from financial bondage.</i>. . .<br><br><i>Now, in our day, the Lord has revealed the need to reemphasize the Book of Mormon to get the Church and all the children of Zion out from under condemnation--the scourge and judgment. (See D&amp;amp;C 84:54–58.) This message must be carried to the members of the Church throughout the world.</i>["A Sacred Responsibility,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 78] (Almost all of President Benson's words quoted herein are also found in his book<i>A Witness and a Warning</i>[Deseret Book Company, 1988].)<br><br>President Benson has often referred to the condemnation that section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants describes as being imposed on the Saints for neglect of the Book of Mormon. This revelation was given to the Church in September 1832, just two and one-half years after the Church was organized. In verses 43–44, the Lord declared:<br><br><i>And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.</i><br><br>Verses 45 through 47 affirm the truth of the word of the Lord, the enlightenment given to all by the Spirit, and the fact that all who hearken to the Spirit come unto God the Father. Verse 48 then refers to the gospel covenant:<br><br><i>And the Father teacheth him of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole world.</i><br><br>Verses 49 through 53 describe the sin and darkness of those who do not come to God and hearken to his voice.<br><br>The succeeding verses, 54–58, describe the circumstances of some early members of the Church.<br><br><i>And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received--</i><br><br><i>Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.</i><br><br><i>And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.</i><br><br><i>And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written--</i><br><br><i>That they may bring forth fruit meet for their Father's kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion.</i><br><br>Along with other General Authorities, I have a clear recollection of the General Authority temple meeting on March 5, 1987. For a year President Benson had been stressing the reading of the Book of Mormon. Repeatedly he had quoted these verses from the Doctrine and Covenants, including the Lord's statement that the Saints' conduct had "brought the whole church under condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 84:55).<br><br>In that temple meeting, President Benson reread those statements and declared, "This condemnation has not been lifted, nor will it be until we repent" (remarks by President Ezra Taft Benson, General Authority Temple Meeting, Thursday, 5 March 1987). He also repeated his declaration of a year earlier that, in our day, the Lord has inspired his servant to reemphasize the Book of Mormon to get the Church out from under condemnation (see<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 78).<br><br>Along with others, I felt the impact of this declaration of condemnation. As I studied the subject, I was relieved to find that the serious consequences of this condemnation need not be permanent. The use of this term elsewhere in modern revelation suggests that it refers to a punishment or a penalty, not to a permanent banishment (e.g., D&amp;amp;C 82:3). In fact, the words President Benson quoted invite the Saints to repent of their deficiencies so the condemnation can be removed.<br><h2><b>II</b></h2><br>To understand why President Benson has exhorted us to reemphasize the Book of Mormon and why this is necessary to remove us from condemnation, we need to remember the major theme of that book.<br><br>In his many messages about the Book of Mormon, President Benson has taught us that the major significance of the Book of Mormon is its witness of Jesus Christ as the Only Begotten Son of God the Eternal Father, who redeems and saves us from death and sin. Of related and equal importance is its explanation of our Savior's atonement, which is the most fundamental doctrine of our faith.<br><br>In his conference address in October 1981, President Benson emphasized that the "major purpose" of the record that became the Book of Mormon "is to convince a later generation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God" ("Joseph Smith: Prophet to Our Generation,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1981, p. 61). Two years after he became President of the Church, he repeated that characterization in a marvelous talk titled "Come unto Christ." There he declared that "the major mission of the Book of Mormon. . . is 'to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ'" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 83).<br><br>In the General Authority meeting I mentioned earlier, President Benson distributed some materials to assist us in carrying his Book of Mormon message throughout the world. Included in that distribution were copies of the talk he gave in the 1975 April conference, titled "The Book of Mormon Is the Word of God." I underlined these words from that important talk:<br><br><i>Now, we have not been using the Book of Mormon as we should. Our homes are not as strong unless we are using it to bring our children to Christ. ... Social, ethical, cultural, or educational converts will not survive under the heat of the day unless their taproots go down to the fulness of the gospel which the Book of Mormon contains.</i>["The Book of Mormon Is the Word of God ,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1975, p. 65]<br><br>President Benson has frequently reminded us of the Prophet Joseph Smith's declaration that the Book of Mormon is "the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book" (<i>HC</i>4:461). In a landmark address during the first year of his service as President of the Church, President Benson explained these two ways in which the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion.<br><br><i>The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. ... Its testimony of the Master is clear, undiluted, and full of power. ...</i><br><br><i>The Book of Mormon is also the keystone of the doctrine of the Resurrection.</i>["The Book of Mormon--Keystone of Our Religion,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, pp. 5–6]<br><br>Note that both of these ways in which the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion focus on our relationship to Christ--our witness of him and our testimony of his atonement and resurrection.<br><br>In addition, President Benson has often reminded us of the Lord's declarations through the Prophet Joseph Smith that the Book of Mormon is "the most correct of any book on earth" (<i>HC</i>4:461) and that it "contains ... the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ" (D&amp;amp;C 20:9). This does not mean that the Book of Mormon contains a full explanation of every principle of the gospel. What it means, President Benson has explained, is that "in the Book of Mormon we will find the fulness of those doctrines required for our salvation" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 6). Most significantly, he notes, "It also provides the most complete explanation of the doctrine of the Atonement" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 5).<br><h2><b>III</b></h2><br>Having reminded ourselves of the major theme and purpose of the Book of Mormon, we can proceed to consider why we have been directed to intensify our study of it at this time.<br><br>I have carefully considered all of the reasons President Benson has given for studying the Book of Mormon, including many reasons why it is uniquely important in our day. From this perspective and from my frequent opportunities to listen to him in our council meetings, I will give you my clear impressions of why he has pleaded with us to repent of our neglect of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>One reason stands out above all the rest. Expressly and by implication, President Benson has affirmed that this subject is the most important of all. I believe that it was the neglect--the "treating lightly"--of this subject that brought the early Church under condemnation. I believe it is the neglect of this subject that has continued the condemnation in our own day. Though supremely important, this subject is so simple that it is easy for us to neglect it in favor of other things.<br><br>The subject I believe we have neglected is the Book of Mormon's witness of the divinity and mission of Jesus Christ and our covenant relationship to him.<br><br>In the opening session of the October 1986 conference, President Benson read the verses from the Doctrine and Covenants about the whole Church being under condemnation and remaining so "until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 4; quoting D&amp;amp;C 84:57). In speaking of this, he likened the word<i>covenant</i>to<i>testament,</i>as in the "New Testament." He reminded us that the Book of Mormon "is indeed another testament or witness of Jesus," adding that this was "one of the reasons why we have recently added the words 'Another Testament of Jesus Christ' to the title of the Book of Mormon" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 4).<br><br>Later in that same message, President Benson repeated these words he had given in an earlier talk. Note the point of emphasis:<br><br><i>"Do eternal consequences rest upon our response to this book? Yes, either to our blessing or our condemnation.</i><br><br><i>"Every Latter-day Saint should make the study of this book a lifetime pursuit. Otherwise he is placing his soul in jeopardy and neglecting that which could give spiritual and intellectual unity to his whole life. There is a difference between a convert who is built on the rock of Christ through the Book of Mormon and stays hold of that iron rod, and one who is not."</i>["The Book of Mormon--Keystone of Our Religion,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 7]<br><br>That is the key: to use the Book of Mormon to become "built on the rock of Christ"! This book is a testament of Jesus Christ. It explains the significance of his atonement and the content of our covenant relationship with him.<br><br>President Benson has stressed this key point again and again in his messages as President of the Church. All of the following are quoted from his words:<br><br><i>What is the major purpose of the Book of Mormon? To bring men to Christ and to be reconciled to him.</i>["A New Witness for Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1984, p. 6]<br><br><i>The Book of Mormon brings men to Christ. ... It tells in a plain manner of Christ and His gospel. It testifies of His divinity and of the necessity for a Redeemer and the need of our putting trust in Him.</i>["The Book of Mormon Is the Word of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>January 1988, p. 3]<br><br><i>The Book of Mormon is the great standard we are to use. ... It contains the words of Christ, and its great mission is to bring men to Christ, and all other things are secondary. The golden question of the Book of Mormon is, "Do you want to learn more of Christ?"</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>January 1988, p. 4]<br><br><i>No one adequately and properly knows why he needs Christ until he understands and accepts the doctrine of the Fall and its effect upon all mankind. And no other book in the world explains this vital doctrine nearly as well as the Book of Mormon.</i>["The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1987, p. 85]<br><br><i>Do we understand and are we effective in teaching and preaching the Atonement? What personal meaning does the Lord's suffering in Gethsemane and on Calvary have for each of us? ...</i><br><br><i>Now, what should be the source for teaching the great plan of the Eternal God? The scriptures, of course--particularly the Book of Mormon.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>May 1987, p. 85]<br><br><i>Let us read the Book of Mormon and be convinced that Jesus is the Christ. Let us continually reread the Book of Mormon so that we might more fully come to Christ, be committed to Him, centered in Him, and consumed in Him.</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 85]<br><br>We can clearly see the harmony in all of this. The Book of Mormon is Christ-centered. That is its essential feature, and that is the reason we are commanded to study it continually. We must use the Book of Mormon to bring us to Christ. President Benson has tried to drum that message into our consciousness and into our conduct during his entire tenure as President of the Church.<br><br>We are not directed to read the Book of Mormon primarily to learn history or geography or politics or ethics or culture or social or educational policy, though it contains valuable teachings on all of those subjects. President Benson has teachings on many of those subjects, but he has stressed one vital idea above all others: "All truths are not of the same value," he said. "The saving truths of salvation are of greatest worth" ("Worthy Fathers, Worthy Sons,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1985, p. 36). He also said:<br><br><i>The Book of Mormon was written for us today. ...</i><br><br><i>The purpose of the Book of Mormon is stated on the title page. It is "to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God."</i>[<i>Ensign,</i>January 1988, p. 3]<br><h2><b>IV</b></h2><br>We can see why President Benson has emphasized the Book of Mormon's witness of Christ if we note carefully what is said to the Church in the verses from section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants that President Benson has quoted so frequently.<br><br>In the verses preceding the quote, the Lord commanded the early Saints to heed the words of eternal life and to live by every word that proceeded forth from the mouth of God. He told them that those who came unto God would be taught "of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, ... for the sake of the whole world" (D&amp;amp;C 84:48). Then he explained that their minds had been "darkened because of unbelief, and because [they had] treated lightly the things [they had] received" (D&amp;amp;C 84:54). The Lord explained that this had "brought the whole Church under condemnation" (D&amp;amp;C 84:55). Then, in the quoted verse, he declared:<br><br><i>And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:57]<br><br>This revelation states that the condemnation can be removed by repenting and remembering "the new covenant." What is this "new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them" (D&amp;amp;C 84:57)? It is obviously inseparable from the Book of Mormon, as has frequently been said, but it also includes "the former commandments" that the Lord had given his people.<br><br>I believe this "new covenant" mentioned in verse 57 is the same as "the covenant" described in verse 48, which the Father teaches and "has renewed and confirmed upon" those who come unto him, all "for the sake of the whole world." Under this interpretation, the "new covenant," whose neglect the Lord condemned, was the covenant<i>contained in</i>the Book of Mormon and in the "former commandments" the Lord had now renewed and confirmed upon the early Saints. These former commandments must have been the Lord's prior revelations, as contained in the Bible (the Old and New Testaments) and in those modern revelations already given to the Saints (see<i>HC</i>1:318, 320).<br><br>The fundamental doctrinal nature of this new covenant the Saints had "treated lightly" is suggested by the two other revelations that mention the new covenant. Both of these refer to Jesus Christ as "the mediator of the new covenant" (D&amp;amp;C 76:69; 107:19; also see Hebrews 12:24).<br><br>This new covenant is frequently mentioned in the scriptures, ancient and modern. Jeremiah prophesied a "new covenant with the house of Israel" (Jeremiah 31:31; also see Hebrews 8:8). The New Testament teaches that Christ was "the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises" (Hebrews 8:6). The Prophet Joseph Smith declared that this covenant was not put in force at the time of Christ's mortal ministry because Israel rejected him (<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 14–15). In a revelation given the same month the restored Church was organized, the Lord declared, "I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing; and this is a new and an everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning" (D&amp;amp;C 22:1).<br><br>The covenant described in these scriptures, made new by its renewal and confirmation in these latter-days, is our covenant relationship with Jesus Christ. It incorporates the fullness of the gospel (see D&amp;amp;C 66:2, 132:6), which President Joseph Fielding Smith described as "the sum total of all gospel covenants and obligations" (<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954], 1:156).<br><br>From the foregoing it is evident that the "new covenant" contained in the Book of Mormon and the former commandments is that central promise of the gospel, rooted in the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which gives us the assurance of immortality and the opportunity for eternal life if we will repent of our sins and make and keep the gospel covenant with our Savior. By this means, and through his grace, we can realize the fulfillment of the great promise "that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel" (Articles of Faith 1:3).<br><br>Thus, the new covenant, the "new and everlasting covenant" the early Saints had received and treated lightly by the time the quoted revelation was given, included all of the commandments and ordinances of the gospel, which are explained most clearly (but not exclusively) in the Book of Mormon. As President Benson has said, "when used together, the Bible and the Book of Mormon confound false doctrines"<i>(Ensign,</i>November 1984, p. 8). The Book of Mormon is "Another Testament of Jesus Christ." Its title page identifies its purpose, to explain "the covenants of the Lord" and to convince Jew and Gentile "that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD."<br><br>In declaring how the Saints could be relieved of condemnation for unbelief and for treating this new covenant lightly, the Lord emphasized that the new covenant requires positive action, not just passive commitment. In an inspired statement about temple covenants, Elder John A. Widtsoe explained that a covenant<br><br><i>is merely a promise to give life to knowledge by making knowledge useful and helpful in man's daily progress. ... The covenant gives life to truth and makes possible the blessings that reward all those who use knowledge properly.</i>[Assembly Hall Lecture, 1920, quoted in "Temple Worship," CES Temple Media Kit (Corporation of the President, 1986), p. 6]<br><br>This explains why the revelation requires us to "repent and remember the new covenant, ... not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written" (D&amp;amp;C 84:57). In short, in order to escape condemnation, we must come unto Christ and enter into the gospel covenant, not only "to say" but also "to do according to that which [the Lord has] written." We must "give diligent heed to the words of eternal life" and "live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God" (D&amp;amp;C 84:43–44).<br><h2><b>V</b></h2><br>We can easily see things in our own day that could cause the Lord to call us to "repent and remember the new covenant" and cause his prophet to declare that the Lord's condemnation has not yet been lifted.<br><br>In our own time we are seeing a great increase in the visibility and influence of those who deny or doubt the divinity of Jesus Christ and the need for his atonement. Noting this trend over twenty years ago, President Harold B. Lee declared:<br><br><i>Now, ... our greatest responsibility and anxiety is to defend the divine mission of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, for all about us, even among those who claim to be professors of the Christian faith, are those not willing to stand squarely in defense of the great truth that our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, was indeed the Son of God. So tonight it would seem to me that the most important thing I could say to you is to try to strengthen your faith and increase your courage and your understanding of the place of the Master in the great Plan of Salvation.</i>[Quoted in Robert J. Matthews, "What the Book of Mormon Tells Us About Jesus Christ," in<i>The Book of Mormon: The Keystone Scripture,</i>ed. Paul R. Cheesman, from the First Annual Book of Mormon Symposium (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1988), p. 23]<br><br>In my opinion, one of the principal reasons our Heavenly Father had his prophet direct us into a more intensive study of the Book of Mormon is to help us counteract this modern tendency to try to diminish the divinity and mission of our Savior.<br><br>Are we as Latter-day Saints doing what we should to counteract this modern trend? Are we aware that our knowledge and testimony of the literal divinity, resurrection, and atonement of Jesus Christ are more distinctive and more needed with each passing year?<br><br>I suggest that many Latter-day Saints are not yet aware of our unique position and our special responsibilities to testify of Christ. I suggest that we are not yet doing all we should. I believe this is a sufficient explanation for the condemnation President Benson described and the call to repentance he issued. Here are some illustrations.<br><br>A few years ago I received a letter from a man who said he had attended an LDS testimony meeting and listened to seventeen testimonies without hearing the Savior mentioned or referred to in any way. He also wrote that the following Sunday he listened to a priesthood lesson, a Gospel Doctrine lesson, and seven sacrament meeting speakers without hearing any reference to Jesus Christ (see "Witnesses of Christ,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1990, p. 30). Some may have considered that report an exaggeration or an extreme case. The similar accounts I have received in subsequent letters persuade me that this was not an isolated experience. In too many of our classes, in too many of our worship services, we are not teaching of Christ and testifying of Christ in the way we should. This is one way we are failing to "remember the new covenant."<br><br>To cite another example, I believe that for a time and until recently our public talks and our literature were deficient in the frequency and depth with which they explained and rejoiced in those doctrinal subjects most closely related to the atonement of the Savior. A prominent gospel scholar saw this deficiency in our church periodicals published in a twenty-three year period ending in 1983 (Daniel H. Ludlow observation, cited in Bruce C. Hafen,<i>The Broken Heart</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1989], pp. 3–4). I saw this same deficiency when I reviewed the subjects of general conference addresses during the decade ending in the mid-1980s.<br><br>Another illustration is provided by some Latter-day Saint funerals. I attend some funerals and hear reports of many others. Worthy tributes to the deceased are appropriate and so are family memories. But such matters must not dominate an LDS funeral service to the exclusion or neglect of those gospel truths that review the purpose of life and testify of our Creator and Redeemer. At a funeral service--of all places--we must not neglect to testify of him whose gospel gives meaning and purpose to life and whose resurrection and atonement give hope for the deceased and comfort to the bereaved. Yet I know of some LDS funerals in which there was no mention of the Resurrection and no mention of the Savior. Isn't this an example of "treat[ing] lightly the things [we] have received"? Isn't this another cause for some of us to "repent and remember the new covenant"?<br><br>Isn't it possible that we also neglect "the new covenant" and treat the gospel lightly in the daily activities of our lives? Consider this application to campus life. Do some teachers and students create the impression or acquiesce in the impression that salvation is unimportant or that salvation is to be found in academic disciplines? Salvation is in Christ, not in most of the things we do on the BYU campus or anywhere else. In view of that reality, isn't it appropriate to ask how LDS students and teachers conduct themselves toward the sacred name of Jesus Christ, or his servants, or the scriptures, or his Church, or his commandments when their necessary day-to-day activities interface with those subjects?<br><br>All of our important and interesting debates about politics, academic subjects, and educational policy are insignificant by comparison with this. All of our efforts at ethical improvement, desirable as they are, are not sufficient for the salvation that is exaltation.<br><br>Have we "treated lightly the things [we] have received" (D&amp;amp;C 84:54)? If we have, I say in soberness that we have need to "repent and remember the new covenant" (D&amp;amp;C 84:57), putting the Savior uppermost in our minds and hearts and showing a higher level of concern for his gospel, his commandments, his Sabbath, his work.<br><h2><b>VI</b></h2><br>Fortunately, we are doing better. For more than a decade we have more consciously and more effectively presented ourselves in our true light as followers and servants of Jesus Christ.<br><br>In 1982, the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve reminded us on the title page of the Book of Mormon that this great book is "Another Testament of Jesus Christ."<br><br>The First Presidency has requested that we not refer to ourselves as the "Mormon Church," but by the name the Lord gave his Church by revelation: "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" (D&amp;amp;C 115:4).<br><br>Our Young Women theme uses a familiar Book of Mormon scripture to pledge that daughters of our Heavenly Father will "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9).<br><br>Recent LDS gospel scholarship clearly shows a greatly increased emphasis on the Savior and his atonement. Elder Bruce R. McConkie's multivolume work on the Messiah and his earlier three-volume<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</i>are landmarks in this effort. We have all benefited immeasurably from the BYU Religious Studies Center's annual Book of Mormon Symposia, which have placed appropriate emphasis on this scripture's preeminent position as a witness of Christ. Individual Latter-day Saint scholars, principally in religious instruction at BYU, have published brilliant and inspired books that have made important additions to our literature on the Savior and his atonement (e.g., Stephen E. Robinson,<i>Believing Christ</i>[Deseret Book Company, 1992]; Robert L. Millet,<i>Life in Christ</i>[Bookcraft, 1990]; Bruce C. Hafen,<i>The Broken Heart</i>[Deseret Book Company, 1989]). I hope such books are read and pondered, not just purchased and possessed.<br><br>President Benson's emphasis on reading and rereading the Book of Mormon is a heaven-sent refining of emphasis in the lives and gospel study of individual members of the Church. His challenge has been accepted by multitudes of Latter-day Saints and is blessing lives everywhere.<br><br>Following the prophet, our General Authorities and auxiliary officers and local leaders have given more frequent and more in-depth attention to our sacred mission of testifying of Christ and explaining the doctrines of his atonement. President Benson and his counselors have set the example in this, and many have followed. Our fine seminary and institute teachers have likewise been inspired to more effective teaching and witnessing of the Savior.<br><br>As a result of President Benson's teachings, all Latter-day Saints are more conscious of the vital importance of the Book of Mormon in this effort. We are more aware of our duty and privilege to use this book to testify of Christ and to explain the new covenant, the principles and covenants of his gospel.<br><br>Our Church leaders and scholars have identified important facts we can use in this effort. For example, the word<i>atonement</i>appears only once in the entire New Testament, but twenty-eight times in the text of the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is clearly the most profound treatment of this supremely important subject found anywhere (see Boyd K. Packer, "Atonement, Agency, Accountability,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1988, pp. 69–70). The Book of Mormon has nearly one hundred names for the Savior, each expressing some nuance of meaning that enriches our understanding of his divine nature and his mission (see Matthews, "What the Book of Mormon Tells Us," pp. 32–33). Finally, as President Benson noted in one of his conference talks, "Over one-half of all the verses in the Book of Mormon refer to our Lord. Some form of Christ's name is mentioned more frequently per verse in the Book of Mormon than even in the New Testament" (<i>Ensign,</i>November 1987, p. 83; also see Matthews, "What the Book of Mormon Tells Us," p. 33).<br><br>Fortunately, there are still many God-fearing Christians who join us in testifying of the divinity and mission of Jesus Christ. For some years I have enjoyed sharing one such testimony. In many ways it is a model for each of us who has a duty to testify of Christ. These are the words of the late Malcolm Muggeridge, British author, journalist, and television commentator:<br><br><i>I may, I suppose, regard myself, or pass for being, a relatively successful man. People occasionally stare at me in the streets--that's fame. I can fairly easily earn enough to qualify for admission to the higher slopes of the Internal Revenue--that's success. Furnished with money and a little fame even the elderly, if they care to, may partake of trendy diversions--that's pleasure. It might happen once in a while that something I said or wrote was sufficiently heeded for me to persuade myself that it represented a serious impact on our time--that's fulfillment. Yet I say to you--and I beg you to believe me--multiply these tiny triumphs by a million, add them all together, and they are nothing--less than nothing, a positive impediment--measured against one draught of that living water Christ offers to the spiritually thirsty, irrespective of who or what they are.</i>[Sally S. Wright, "The Pilgrimage of Malcolm Muggeridge,"<i>Chronicles,</i>December 1992, p. 29, quoting from Muggeridge's<i>Jesus Rediscovered</i>]<br><br>Men and women unquestionably have impressive powers and can bring to pass great things. But after all our obedience and good works, we cannot be saved from death or the effects of our individual sins without the grace extended by the atonement of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon makes this clear. It teaches that "salvation doth not come by the law alone" (Mosiah 13:28). In other words, salvation does not come simply by keeping the commandments. "By the law no flesh is justified" (2 Nephi 2:5). Even those who try to obey and serve God with all their heart, might, mind, and strength are unprofitable servants (see Mosiah 2:21). Man cannot earn his own salvation. He cannot be cleansed by personal suffering for his own sins.<br><br>The Book of Mormon teaches: "Since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself" (Alma 22:14). "There can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world" (Alma 34:12; see also 2 Nephi 9:7; Alma 34:8–16). "Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah. ... He offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law" (2 Nephi 2:6–7). Consequently, "there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" (2 Nephi 2:8). And so we "rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, ... that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins" (2 Nephi 25:26).<br><br>These teachings obviously stand in opposition to the belief or assumption of some mortals (perhaps even some members of our Church) that they have no need of Christ because they can save themselves by their own works.<br><br>As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we testify with the Book of Mormon prophet-king Benjamin that<br><br><i>there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</i><br><br><i>For behold . . . salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ.</i>[Mosiah 3:17–18]<br><br>And so we say to all, in the words the prophet Moroni wrote as a conclusion to the Book of Mormon:<br><br><i>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ;</i>. . .<br><br><i>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</i>[Moroni 10:32–33]<br><br>This is the new covenant, as explained in the Book of Mormon. May we follow the commandment to give diligent heed to these words of eternal life; may we follow our prophet's challenge to remove the condemnation that comes from treating this new covenant lightly; may we be true to our sacred responsibilities, I pray, even as I testify to the truth of these things, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 June 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ing and We’ll Shout”: A Mantic Celebration of the Holy Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I begin this morning just as Elder J. Golden Kimball began his general conference address in October 1932. He said, in his inimitable fashion, "I take it that we will all be relieved when I get through this morning."<sup>1</sup>So it is today; and President Rex Lee, sitting nervously and vicariously in the stead of President Heber J. Grant, responds grimly, "Amen!"<br><h2><b>I. Introduction</b></h2><br>I'd like to begin my invasion of your souls this morning by wrenching a bit Elder William W. Phelps' lyrics of the hymn we just sang, written at the dawning of the Restoration as the Spirit of God had just begun "to come forth" with latter-day, brand-new dispensational intensity:<br><br><i>The Spirit of God like a fire is burning!<br>His latter-day glory pours everywhere forth;<br>His Spirit and blessings are manifest daily,<br>And angels commune with his children on earth.</i><br><br>I wish to celebrate this morning the reality of the often ignored and too little heralded but very real outpouring of the Spirit of God upon the believing inhabitants of earth--right now, this morning, in the early evening of the last dispensation. I hope that when I get through this morning we might all leave this meeting with our eternal perspective refurbished and revitalized, and sharing the jubilation of Elder Phelps' chorus,<br><br><i>We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven,<br>Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!<sup>2</sup></i><br><h2><b>II. The Example of Sister Olsen</b></h2><br>Many of you know what I am talking about when I talk of "hosanna moments," those transcendent moments in our lives when, without warning, we are overwhelmed by a close encounter with eternity, a surprise of the spirit--those moments when, while engaged in the temporal rhythms of our daily and earth- encrusted lives, comfortably duped by familiar routines, we are suddenly brought face-to-face with the holy, swept by the Spirit of God into a transcendent reality, overwhelmed by undeniable evidence of a literal Father in Heaven who knows you and knows me and is somehow interested and involved in our lives. The "We'll-Sing-and-We'll-Shout" moment is that moment when our God, Brother-of-Jared-ing us, reaches his hand through the veil to startle our sensibilities, to reassure, to comfort, to guide, to prod, to change our course. Then our spirits soar, our souls are renewed, and we can never really be the same again.<br><br>It is my experience that, in one way or another, these glimpses of eternity come to most of us. Nudging us toward our destiny, his welcome and too-infrequent interventions shout to our souls that our Heavenly Father lives! That his purpose is to bring to pass our "immortality and eternal life" (Moses 1:39); that we "live our lives in the eye of God, and not at the periphery but at the center of His vision" ;<sup>3</sup>and that our God "is everywhere present," as Brigham Young told us, "by the power of His Spirit--His minister the Holy Ghost" (<i>JD</i>11:41).<br><br>The surprise of the Spirit that quickened the life of a young Swedish woman more than twenty years ago illustrates and exemplifies the pattern I am fumbling to describe. Naming her story for you makes it resonate once more in my soul, for it is pure and simple truth.<br><br>Sister Ingrid Olsen (not her real name) was a recently divorced mother of a young son and was almost as recently a convert to the Church. The divorce had alienated Ingrid from part of her family, and her conversion to Mormonism had alienated her from her friends. The resulting personal anguish had dampened her initial joy in joining the Church. She felt alone and abandoned and overwhelmed before an uncertain future. In the midst of such turmoil, her prayers seemed futile, and what had initially been a time of spiritual refreshing had become a season of despair.<br><br>Bewildered by it all, she welcomed one afternoon the opportunity to visit a cousin in a neighboring village, nearly ninety minutes away by bicycle. She planned to devote the trip to prayer, hoping to receive some indication that her Heavenly Father understood her plight and would give her some needed direction and solace. As she rode her bicycle toward her destination, she was miserably aware that the darkening day and threatening clouds matched her own darkened spirits, and she felt that her prayers were rebounding, unheard and unanswered, from the leaden heavens.<br><br>In this state of mind, Ingrid at length reached the distant village and made her visit. Starting on her return trip, she rode her bicycle up a long incline in the face of an increasingly strong wind before which she could hardly make progress. Seeing in her difficulty an opportunity to test the reality of the Lord, she went into a grove of trees and prayed that the Father would manifest his presence in a simple way: He would stop the wind. And she would know that he heard her prayers and knew her predicament. Mustering her faith, she resumed her journey--in the face of an ever-increasing head wind. She rode, hard, into that wind, becoming more disillusioned and bitter with each kilometer, for it seemed apparent that God, if after all there was really such a Being, had neither heard nor answered her heartfelt pleas. Arriving at last at the hill above her village, a bitter Sister Olsen dismounted before coasting down the hill toward her home. Looking to the lowering heavens, she uttered a sardonic, "Thanks, Lord; now I know."<br><br>Then it happened, the surprise of the Spirit. Suddenly Ingrid Olsen was filled with an intense, powerful, commanding voice that sounded through her being and thrilled her with the words, "I did not still the wind; instead, I gave you strength to overcome." Then stillness, and that was all! But God had changed her life.<br><br>She was stunned by the reality of what she had just experienced. Her whole soul reverberated with the Hosanna Shout, and she stood all amazed at this tangible answer to her prayers. Wondering about the meaning of the words, she glanced at her watch and was surprised to realize that she had made the ninety-minute return trip, in the face of the heaviest wind she had ever encountered, in less than sixty minutes. She knew immediately the truth of the words of the Holy Spirit--he had not stilled the wind; he had instead given her strength to overcome. She knew, as well, that this revelation described his pattern in dealing with all of his mortal children, and it becomes a revelation to all of us who listen with spiritually attuned ears: God will not diminish the adversity or the obstacles of our lives--there must need be such; that is the nature of our probation. However, he will be with us "alway, even unto the end of the world" to guide and direct and give succor, through his minister, the Holy Spirit (see Matthew 28:20).<br><br>The chorus to this Hosanna Shout is a happy one. Moved by this striking manifestation of God in her life, Ingrid Olsen rode immediately to the office of her branch president and related all that had occurred. Sensing his role as an instrument in effecting God's will, the president responded by making arrangements and securing financial assistance for her and her boy to journey to Rexburg, Idaho, where Ingrid would attend Ricks College. Strengthened by the Lord, as he had promised, she came to the United States, overcame all obstacles, and triumphed. Finding early in her schooling here a latent artistic talent, she transferred to BYU and became a sculptor, learning the craft right here in this building (HFAC). Eventually completing advanced training at BYU, she returned to Sweden, established a studio, became an accomplished and successful sculptor--even fulfilling commissions for the king of Sweden. She later married a Mormon widower and former bishop and is now a grandmother and a renowned artist and faithful Latter-day Saint in her native land. That little boy is now a returned missionary, a BYU graduate, and a father. (You'll be interested in a footnote: One of her early pieces of sculpting, now gracing the home of two BYU faculty members, is a polished metal abstract sculpted to portray stones shaped by eons of wind blasting and polishing their raw surface. The name of the sculpture is "Opposition II." "Opposition I" is, of course, Ingrid's own adamant self, which the Lord shaped by adversity into what will become her finest work of art.)<br><h2><b>III. A Believing and a Mantic People</b></h2><br>Now, on hearing this account, sophic souls, those who limit their perception of reality to the five finite senses, will scoff; comment on Sister Olsen's temporary insanity, wild imaginative powers, and complex psychology; and dismiss the whole matter as foolish self-delusion. You see, it is constitutionally impossible for the earthbound sophic to understand the things of the Spirit, which appear as foolishness to them.<br>On hearing this same account, sophic Mormons, those torn between the faith that sparked their own spirits in simpler times and the skepticism and doubt born of their worldly training--which teaches them to ground all truth in empirical evidence--will emit the groan of Goethe's Faust, "Two souls alas! are dwelling in my breast,"<sup>4</sup>and reach for a spiritual antacid. Then they will go on wearing out their lives attempting to balance the spiritual and the worldly, which are two "fundamentally antithetical ways of perceiving the world."<sup>5</sup><br><br>Most Latter-day Saints, however, on hearing this account, will generally feel, depending on their spiritual equilibrium at the moment, the familiar thrill of spiritual recognition (you know what I mean--the shiver through the body, the cold chill across the back, the flash across the spirit, and, yes, the burning in the bosom), and he will nod his head affirmingly, or she will smile her knowing smile, and, adding Sister Olsen's testimony to their store of such testimonies, they will ask if you have a moment to listen to an experience that just recently occurred in their lives--and, behold, we're enjoying an impromptu testimony meeting.<br><br>For the Latter-day Saint, Ingrid Olsen's experience is part and parcel of the nature of human life, something inherent in the warp and woof of mortality. The world will never understand these characteristics of the Mormon people, or of this university, but they are engraved in the souls of every Latter-day Saint. Despite having been raised, as Paul says, "in bondage under the elements of the world" (Galatians 4:3) and in thrall to materialism, the Latter-day Saints are a<i>believing people</i>who affirm President David O. McKay's assertion that, "After all, the spiritual life is the true life of man."<sup>6</sup><br><br>Rejecting the limited<i>sophic</i>view of the world, the Latter-day Saints are also a<i>mantic</i>people, which means they live their daily lives in conscious and constant awareness of the very real, infinite world beyond this shadow world of finite earth. Living in this world, but believing in the mantic world, the Latter-day Saints are, if you'll allow it, a<i>cockeyed</i>people--with one eye cocked to the ultimate reality of infinity, the "out there," while the other eye is cocked to the immediate daily realities of life, the here and now.<br><br>The Holy Spirit is the link between the two worlds, because the Latter-day Saints are also a<i>charismatic</i>people--those who consciously seek and cultivate the presence of the divine in their lives; who seek to "elevate the place of the Holy Spirit" in their lives,<sup>7</sup>to center their lives in a dynamic theology of expectation of the divine; that is, the charismatic Mormons live their lives in confidence that the Father and his Son<i>can</i>and<i>may</i>and<i>do</i>intervene in human lives--and may do so at any moment, in order to assist us mortals in our individual and collective courses.<br><h2><b>IV. Individual Ministrations of the Holy Spirit</b></h2><br>But while we are also a<i>covenant</i>people and are accountable for our ministries among the Saints, we will be judged, saved, and exalted, at last, as<i>individual</i>spirits. At the center of the plan of salvation is the reality that God's children, momentarily adrift in mortality, are "entitled to the Spirit of God," as Brigham Young said, entitled "to the power of the Holy Ghost, to lead [them] in [their] individual duties" (<i>JD</i>10:296). In fact, it is our individual enjoyment of "the gift of the Holy Ghost," the Prophet Joseph told President Martin Van Buren, that differentiates us as a people from other believers.<sup>8</sup>And when Joseph appeared to Brigham Young in a dream some time after his death, his counsel was to the individual Latter-day Saint: "Tell the people to be humble and faithful," he said, "and be sure to keep the spirit of the Lord and it will lead them right. Be careful and not turn away the small still voice; it will teach them what to do and where to go. ... It will lead them just right."<sup>9</sup><br><br>In the plan of God, then, it is the Holy Spirit who unrolls the string that we pilgrims, wanderers, and strangers on earth follow hopefully through the long and hazardous journey back to God, who is our home. This innate longing for home is implanted in our souls by a wise Father; and it is recalled into our consciousness by the Spirit of God as a kind of homing signal that prompts each of us, at various points amidst our journeying, to look up, point to the distant stars, among which revolves Kolob, and cry out, like the homesick E.T., a fellow extraterrestrial, "Home!" Our souls resonate to the truths expressed by Eliza R. Snow:<br><br><i>For a wise and glorious purpose<br>Thou hast placed me here on earth<br>And withheld the recollection<br>Of my former friends and birth;<br>Yet ofttimes a secret something<br>Whispered, "You're a stranger here,"<br>And I felt that I had wandered<br>From a more exalted sphere.</i><sup>10</sup><br><h2><b>V. Micromanaging by the Spirit</b></h2><br>One evening last week, while attending a local wedding reception, my wife, Janice, and I exchanged greetings with Elder and Sister Neal A. Maxwell. On being apprised that I would be addressing you today, he asked after the topic. To my statement that I would be talking to you about the reality and presence of the Spirit in our lives, he responded instantly, and as only Elder Maxwell can, with, "The Lord does a good job of micromanagement through the Holy Spirit, doesn't he!"<br><br>Although we don't claim that the Latter-day Saints have a corner on the Spirit of the Lord, it is a given among us that our Heavenly Father intervenes to "micromanage" our pilgrimages through mortality, all within the framework of our agency. Each surprise of the Spirit fulfills the Father's promise to "impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy" (D&amp;amp;C11:13), which shall, at last, bring us safely home. For it seems to me, on reflection, that our Heavenly Father's micromanagement serves, in one way or another, to aid us in understanding the human predicament, to recall us to the eternal perspective, to keep us on course, and to point out our individual roles in his plan of salvation and exaltation.<br><br>Consider his micromanagement in the life of a dear friend of ours in St. Gallen, Switzerland. Despairing, lonely, and purposeless, she knelt in her room one spring afternoon in 1988 and cried out in anguish to her God that unless he showed her some reason and purpose for living, gave some indication that he heard her prayers, she saw no reason to live any longer and would take her own life. You mantics can guess the rest, for it is a classic instance of divine micromanagement that is repeated many times daily among the children of men. Scarcely twenty minutes later, Elders Albright and Gubler were at her door. Though they were weary after tracting for several hours without success, something in Sister Annalore's face sparked that ineffable something called the Holy Spirit and led the elders to scuttle their standard door approach. Instead, Elder Albright said, "The Lord has sent us to tell you why you're here on earth." Stunned, Sister Annalore had just heard the very words of her prayer repeated in American accents. She invited the elders in and received all they taught her as a direct message from God. Startled into new awareness by the Holy Spirit, which rolled over her in waves of light, she caught in an instant the vision of the plan of God and of her role in the plan. It was as if she had always known these truths but had misplaced them momentarily. Instantly transformed, she was baptized the following week. She is currently a temple-going Young Women president in her ward, intent on keeping vital the presence of the Spirit in her life.<br><br>Because of the dramatic changes that the Lord's micromanagement effects in the lives of converts to the Church, the mission field has always been the front line in the battle for the human soul, a wonderful showcase for the "strange acts" of the Holy Spirit. Like many of your journals, my missionary journals as a young man and as a mission president read like a rough providence primer and thrill me more with each reading. For example, on March 11, 1958, I concluded a two-page description of a rich and productive day in the ministry with, "It has been quite a day, and the Lord has really blessed us exceedingly. ... I have felt much, much inspiration and that 'still, small voice' bore witness to me once again of the truth of the work and the message. What a joy it was, riding [home] along the [snowy] country road singing 'O My Father.' Such contentment and peace as I have never felt--that is the gospel."<sup>11</sup>Yes, that is the work of the ministry; that is the Holy Spirit micromanaging a young elder's life.<br><br>On other pages of that same journal are many entries describing our meetings with Karl Lederhilger, the leader at that time of the Seventh-Day Adventist congregations in upper Austria. On our first meeting, after an hour of futile scripture-bashing about the Sabbath, that good man stopped midsentence and said, "We're getting nowhere with this discussion; do you have anything you want to tell us?" Filled with the Spirit, I ventured to teach him the plan of salvation, a discussion usually reserved until much later. I watched how the Holy Spirit began visibly to micromanage this gentle, kind, and knowledgeable man. At each point I would ask him to supply scriptures in support of the principle, and he enthusiastically repeated, from memory, a host of scriptures in support of Mormon claims. The Spirit of God filled the room. And when I broached the question as to how those who have died can receive the vital saving ordinances, I was startled when Karl suddenly rose to his feet, tears springing to his eyes, and recited 1 Corinthians 15:29: "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead. ..."<br><br>" I have studied for years," he cried to us, his wife, his children, the ceiling, "to learn the meaning of this scripture; and now these two young men have made it all crystal clear."<br><br>" This message is from God, Mutti," he said to his wife from the depths of his soul. "These young men have brought us the truth." The chill up the spine, the cold sweat on the forehead, the trembling in the soul--only shared this time by everyone in the room. The family was baptized a few weeks later. I didn't hear it, but I'm sure the Heavenly Tabernacle Choir was sounding majestic hosannas through the whole event. My journal certainly was.<br><br>My mission president's journal of 1986–1989 describes the same pattern, repeated again and again, with only a few variations: The sisters in Solothurn were prompted by the Spirit to go home from church via the town square, some distance out of their way, just at the moment a young father, a devout Pentecostal leader, crossed the same square. From Yugoslavia, very ill, and seeking a blessing of health, he had been told by the Holy Spirit to go to the town square at noon and he would find someone who could heal him. They met in the square--" by chance," of course. He told them his need; the sisters led him back to the bishop's office of the Solothurn chapel, where he received his promised blessing. They went to the man's home on the following day to inquire after his health and learned that he had been instantly healed. They taught him and his wife and his family, who all joined the Church and later moved back to Yugoslavia- just in time to host the first LDS missionaries sent to open the country to missionary work. And a host of people shouted, "Hosanna!"<br><br>The journal recounts how Rocco, the rock musician in St. Gallen hastening to perform a gig with his rock group, was forced by a blowout on his bicycle to walk through the crowded St. Gallen square, a route he would never have taken except on foot, a route that took him right by Sister Chambers and Sister Baumann's exhibit. They spotted him, took him to a nearby park bench to talk, and the Holy Spirit managed to make him late for his concert. Just over a year later Rocco accepted a mission call to Vienna, Austria, where he served with distinction, a finesser for the Lord in micromanaging the course of many souls into the kingdom of God. Hosanna!<br><br>As a mission president, I monitored the weekly reports of 125 missionaries, all written in German, which I corrected and edited with my professorial red pen. But those reports were far more than German exercises; I learned to consider that weekly stack of reports as "The Acts of the Holy Ghost in German-Switzerland, Southern Germany, and Austria." The excitement in reading such reports came in watching the none-too-subtle changes that were occurring week after week in the souls of those missionaries, testimonials to the Father's moving in mysterious ways to micromanage the destinies of his sons and daughters. Sandwiched among the daily, often nit-picking concerns of these young ministers of God were those startling hosanna moments that testified--sometimes in awe and wonder, and sometimes in the most matter-of-fact fashion--how God had touched their lives or the lives of their investigators and brought about yet another life-course change that will affect eternity.<br><br>After a year or two of reading these modern scriptures-in-the-rough, I started in amazement on hearing a venerable Swiss member proclaim that the Spirit was not as evident in the Church as it had been formerly. I gently took issue with him, bore testimony, and then took a little, unscientific survey of my missionaries. Defining in our mission newsletter what I meant by a spiritual experience, I asked the missionaries to report in our next interview the number and nature of specific interventions by the Lord in their lives or the lives of their investigators during the previous week. I established no margin for error in the results, since mission presidents (at least Swiss mission presidents) never make any errors; but my findings were telling. During my missionwide interviews that next week, I found that each missionary had experienced and recorded in their journals an average of<i>six</i>hosanna moments. Even in the arithmetic of an English professor, that amounts, in the small Swiss-Zurich Mission, to a projected average of 650 spiritual experiences per week, or 33,800 per year, or, during the three-year term of a mission president, that means the Holy Ghost has made his presence felt some 101,400 times--and the mission president routinely gets to read about many of them in the weekly reports! I don't want to argue for my scientific method, but these approximations suggest why some of us mission presidents are loathe to leave these uncommon Zions; and why missionaries who have basked in the inexpressible and ineffable for eighteen or twenty-four months must settle for the cliché "These were the best two years of my life." Of course they were.<br><br>O that I were an angel and could make a record of the acts of the Holy Ghost among the Latter-day Saints and the children of men. O that every child of God were commanded to dial an 800 number and record at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City each surprise of the Spirit in our lives; then, as John said, "I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written" (John 21:25).<br><h2><b>VI. Other Hosanna Moments</b></h2><br>Not all of the Lord's micromanagement is to be found in the mission field, of course. The Spirit of the Lord is at the ready. And if we build a spiritual edifice, he will come. As President McKay testified, spiritual manifestations seemed to come to him, as they do to most of us, "as a natural sequence to the performance of duty."<sup>12</sup>If we place ourselves in the way of the Spirit and are wholeheartedly engaged in the service of our fellow beings, they will turn to us in times of spiritual need, and inevitably we will experience his closeness.<br><br>Your present church calling, devotedly performed, will give you your surest access to the Holy Spirit--though I am not confident that the position of ward eraser cleaner affords quite the same chance as elders quorum president, Relief Society visiting teacher, or home teacher. I do know that if we fill our callings with an "eye single to the glory of God," the Father will match every "Father-may-I" step we take toward him with a giant step toward us. He will open sacred doors and answer heartfelt prayers in marvelous ways, and we will find ourselves shouting hosanna once again.<br><br>One never knows when such hosanna moments will occur. Some weeks ago I was called out of a Thursday evening meeting at the Missionary Training Center, where I serve as a branch president, by an elder with a toothache that hurt so bad that he was crying in pain and with a jaw so swollen that he had not been able to eat all day. Unable to get into a dentist until the next day, he asked if I would bless the pain away. "Do you think it can be done?" I asked, trying to put down my own inner<i>Schweinhund</i>that sees toothache as abscesses in need of repair and wondering how I could arrange to get him some painkiller pills at that time of night. Then I heard him say, his voice charged with faith, "I know the Lord can do it, and I don't see any useful lesson to be gained by this pain when I can't concentrate on Japanese or anything but this pain; and I see a whole lot to be gained if the Lord will simply stop the pain." We talked until I felt the Spirit whisper, "Now," and flood my mind with what I should say. Then I laid on hands and blessed the young man. On feeling those impulses that I know as the promptings of the Spirit, I clambered out on a swaying branch I had trodden before and promised him that he would be healed at once. I concluded the blessing, spoke a few words of instruction about how to pray after a blessing, and we returned to the branch meeting. Otherwise engaged with missionaries, I did not see him again that evening, but I prayed hard on Friday and Saturday that the Lord would have already granted the young man the blessing he sought--and more. On Sunday morning he was at my office door, bright-eyed and radiant, to tell me that a miracle had indeed occurred. Before he had taken his seat in the meeting to which we returned on Thursday, the pain had stopped; by the end of the meeting the throbbing was gone; by the time he was back in his room the swelling had left and he was able to eat. He did not keep his appointment with the dentist the next afternoon--he said he couldn't afford the time away from Japanese. He bore testimony to me that his joy in the reality of the Holy Spirit in his life exceeded the relief he experienced with the cessation of pain. This testimony had come to a spiritually insecure young man who needed at that time, in that place, and in that way, some unambiguous support from his wise Heavenly Father. As the door closed behind him, I said aloud, "Thanks, Lord," and experienced that familiar flood of warmth and comfort--something akin, I suppose, to being perched in the hollow of his hand.<br><br>Fathers and mothers and children give each other much occasion for hosanna moments, and grow up together. I was a humbled participant in such a moment late one evening several years ago after our young daughter fell and struck her head a terrible blow. I rushed into the room and was stunned to find my wife kneeling over an apparently lifeless girl. As I knelt across from my wife, thinking about first aid and paramedics, she looked up, pointed her finger at my chest, and said, with a power I knew flowed from the purest spring, "Heal her ... now!" Obedient, I immediately laid my hands on Jennifer's head and spoke the keys: "In the name of Jesus Christ and by the power of his priesthood, I command that you be healed this instant. Amen." As I lifted my hands, Jennifer's chest began to heave, her breathing recommenced, and her eyes focused. Looking up into the anxious faces of two frightened parents, she said the sweetest words we'd ever heard, "What's wrong?" "Nothing," we responded. "Everything's fine, now." Driving home from the hospital that night, my wife and I were in a state of hosanna. Our Father had once more spanned the gap with his immortal finger, had managed another surprise of the Spirit. We had already believed that he knows each sparrow's fall. But this was<i>our</i>little sparrow whose life he had intervened to preserve.<br><h2><b>VII. Conclusions</b></h2><br>I find I could go on relating such instances, the Holy Spirit permitting (and he does not always permit), from now until the Cougars win their next Holiday Bowl--a terrible fate for you kind listeners, especially when addressed by one who, regardless of his desires to be led by the Spirit, can never find his car in the Marriott Center parking lot after a ball game.<br><br>When I step back from the routines and dailinesses of my life and sift and winnow my experiences, I stand all amazed at the number of hosanna moments I have experienced or of which I have learned through the witness of others. It is clear to me that we are surrounded by the holy; that our God is indeed on hand and on duty, through his minister, the Holy Spirit; that the Spirit is with all of us in our mortal journey exactly as it was with the early missionaries of this dispensation: "I will go before your face," the Lord promised. "I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C84:88). In the Lord's micromanagement of our lives, we witness, wrote C. S. Lewis, "a retelling in small letters of the very same story which is written across the whole world in letters too large for some of us to see."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Let us then be born of that Holy Spirit that we may always be borne<i>by</i>the Spirit. Let us shatter the earth crust that accrues to our souls and live, as Brigham Young urged the Saints, "so as to have the Spirit every day, every hour of the day, every minute of the day" (<i>JD</i>10:296). Let us conscientiously opt for spirituality, which means cultivating "the near-constant companionship of the Lord's Spirit" (<i>MD,</i>p. 760). Let us opt to see the world "Mormonly," to look through eyes "single to the glory of God," constantly refocusing, in the give and take of life, the eternal perspective, and ever seeing the present life for the parenthesis in eternity it is. And, soaking our spiritual contact lenses in that expansive, mantic view, let us be able to say, as C. S. Lewis said about Christianity, "I believe in [Mormonism] as I believe that the Sun has risen, not only because I see it,<i>but because by it I see everything else.</i>"<sup>14</sup><br><br>The Holy Spirit shall come to you--this afternoon, tomorrow, or the day after. And when he comes, be grateful, honor his presence, heed his admonitions, and he shall abide with you. And then "shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, ... forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C121:45–46).<br><br><i>The Spirit of God like a fire is burning!<br>His latter-day glory flows everywhere forth,<br>His Spirit and blessings are manifest daily,<br>And Angels commune with his children on earth.</i><br><br><i>We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven,<br>Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!<br>Let glory to them in the highest be given,<br>Henceforth and forever,</i><br><br>... in the name of Jesus Christ.

<br>
The phrase "Return with Honor" is a very clear description of the purpose of life here in our mortal probation. In our premortal state in heaven, we lived in the presence of God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ.<br><br>Our goal in coming to this mortal probation is to "return with honor" back into the presence of God the Father and his son Jesus Christ eternally. This is called eternal life. Eternal life is our goal at the end of our sojourn on earth.<br><br>After birth one of the most significant events in our life is baptism. The prophet Nephi describes baptism as a gate that we enter, after the gift of faith and repentance, to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. After entering the gate of baptism , we begin traveling a straight and narrow path that we remain on through our obedience, and that, if we endure to the end, leads us to eternal life (2Nephi 31:17–21).<br><br>Today I'd like to discuss the role of the gifts of the Spirit that will help each of us achieve our goal of eternal life.<br><h2><b>What Are Gifts of the Spirit?</b></h2><br>These gifts of the Spirit are encompassed by the gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is the third member of the eternal Godhead and is identified as the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit is a gift from God to help us make the decisions that will allow us to find and meet our destiny. These gifts were part of the ministry of the early prophets and were well known by the apostles of the New Testament. Paul writes in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (12:4–10):<br><br><i> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</i><br><br><i> And there are differences of administrations, butthe same Lord.</i><br><br><i> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</i><br><br><i> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</i><br><br><i> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of ­wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</i><br><br><i> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</i><br><br><i> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another </i><i>divers kinds of tongues; to another the ­interpretation of tongues.</i><br><br>In<b> </b>these latter days, an understanding of the gifts of the Spirit has been given to us by revelation as recorded in section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 46 identifies specific gifts of the Spirit as follows:<br><br><i> For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God. </i>[v. 11]<br><br>We are clearly instructed that each of us is given a gift or gifts. Do we know what gift we have been given? Are we seeking to find our gifts?<br><br><i> To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby. </i>[v. 12]<br><br>The phrase "that all may be profited thereby" isa very important concept to understand about the gifts of the Spirit. The gifts given to each individual are given not only for the one who receives, but also for those who can benefit when the gift is shared with others.<br><br>For example, you may be given the gift of faith and never question the existence of God, our Heavenly Father, and his son Jesus Christ.<br><br><i> To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world. </i>[v. 13]<br><br><i> To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful. </i>[v. 14]<br><br>With the gift of faith, you may be given the gift of prophesy or testimony.<br><br>In<b> </b>addition, you may be given the gift that others would believe on your words that they might have eternal life if they continue faithful. Many of you, as missionaries for the Church, have experienced all that I have just outlined. Or you may have brought a friend or neighbor into the Church by the way you have lived your life or through your testimony.<br><br>Other examples of the gifts that you have participated in are from the verses 19 and 20:<br><br><i> And again, to some it is given to have faith to behealed; </i>[v. 19]<br><br><i> And to others it is given to have faith to heal. </i>[v.20]<br><br>There have been times when I have laid hands upon one who was ill and felt their spirit and their faith so strongly that they would be healed that I felt a surge of the power of their faith.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the faith to be healed is one of the greatest gifts an individual can have.<br><br>On the other hand, I have seen the faith of parents when fathers and mothers desired their children to be healed. Through great faith, their children have been blessed.<br><br><i> And again, it is given to some to speak with tongues; </i>[v. 24]<br><br><i> And to another is given the interpretation of tongues. </i>[v. 25]<br><br>Many of you who have gone to foreign lands have been given the gift to speak with tongues and to translate, or have the interpretation of tongues.<br><br><i> And all these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God. </i>[v. 26]<br><br>We are told by prophets in this dispensation that revelation for the direction of the Church will not be given through the gift of tongues. The reason for this is that it is very easy for Lucifer to falsely duplicate the gift of tongues and confuse the members of the Church.<br><br>Satan has the power to trick us as it pertains to some of the gifts of the Spirit. One in which he is the most deceptive is the gift of tongues. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young explained the need to be cautious when considering the gift of tongues.<br><br><i>You may speak in tongues for your own comfort, but Ilay this down for a rule, that if anything is taught by the gift of tongues, it is not to be received for doctrine.</i> [<i>Teachings, </i>p. 229]<br><br><i>Speak not in the gift of tongues without understanding it, or without interpretation. The devil can speak in tongues.</i> [<i>Teachings, </i>p. 162]<br><br><i>The gift of tongues is not . </i>. . <i>empowered to dictate .</i>. . <i>the church. All gifts and endowments given of the Lord to members of His church are not given to control the church; but they are under the control and guidance of the priesthood, and are judged of byit. </i>[<i>JD</i> 11: 136]<br><br>The gift of tongues is used by missionaries to teach the gospel to the nations of the world.<br><br>The gifts identified in section 46 give rise to other gifts, such as:<br><ul><br> 	<li>The gift to ponder; looking to God for direction.</li><br> 	<li>The gift to hear and respond to the still, small voice.</li><br> 	<li>The gift to be calm, which includes the ability to curb anger and to be temperate, rather than contentious.</li><br> 	<li>The gift to study and to listen.</li><br> 	<li>And, perhaps the greatest gift of all, <i>tohave charity.</i></li><br></ul><br>There are many gifts. Bruce R. McConkie wrote, "Spiritual gifts are endless in number and infinite in variety" (<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith </i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985], p. 371).<br><br>Of the sacred gifts of the Spirit, one I believe has impact on each of our lives is the gift of prophecy or revelation. This gift is different from the priesthood office of prophet. The gift of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus.<br><br>The Apostle Paul taught that Christians should "desire spiritual gifts, but rather that yemay prophesy [meaning to testify of the Savior]" (1 Corinthians 14:1).<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith taught, "Allmembers of the Church should seek for thegift of prophecy for their own guidance" (<i>Church History and Modern Revelation, </i>vol. 1 [Salt Lake City: Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, c.1946–49], p. 184).<br><br>Every Church member, if faithful, has theright to receive revelation for his or her ­personal blessing.<br><h2><b>How Do We Recognize the Gifts of the Spirit?</b></h2><br>One might ask, What are the spiritual ­manifestations of the gifts of the Spirit? The scriptures are clear with regard to the feelings one has within when touched by the Spirit.<br><br>"For guidance"--perhaps the following words to Oliver Cowdery represent a primary manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit:<br><br><i> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:14]<br><br>Many of you may wonder why you have come at this time to Brigham Young University and why you have the opportunity to be taught in this unique institution sponsored by and paid for from the tithing of the Church. My personal feeling is that you are not here by chance. I hope you understand the opportunity that is yours to learn while you are here and prepare yourselves for the rest of your sojourn in mortality.<br><br><i> Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth. </i>[v. 15]<br><br>It is very important for us to pray and to fast and to be close to our Heavenly Father so when that light is brought to our mind, we will recognize it.<br><br><i> Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart</i>. [v. 16]<br><br><i> I tell thee these things as a witness unto thee--that the words or the work which thou hast been writing are true. </i>[v. 17]<br><br>The Lord reminded Oliver of the night he prayed to "know concerning the truth of these things." He helped Oliver remember by saying, "Did I not speak peace to your mind . . . ? What greater witness can you have than from God?" (D&amp;amp;C 6:22–23). Oliver had to learn to recognize influences of the Spirit, as you and I must learn.<br><h2><b>The Gift of Translation</b></h2><br>The gift of translation was something that Oliver took for granted. Consider Oliver Cowdery's desire to translate and the instruction given him by the Lord, as recorded in section 9 of the Doctrine and Covenants. This scripture describes the process he must follow and then describes how the Lord responds.<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8]<br><br>It is important that as we read the sections given to Oliver Cowdery (D&amp;amp;C 6 and 9), we understand how they apply to us.<br><h2><b>How to Receive Gifts of the Spirit</b></h2><br>Access to the gifts of the Holy Ghost is guaranteed only when we live our lives in harmony with the principles of the gospel. There was a period of time following the Savior's earthly ministry when these gifts were not active in the lives of God's children. The loss of these gifts resulted from a turning away from heavenly thoughts or acts and an acceptance of earthly gods.<br><br>Listen to Orson Pratt discussing John Wesley's insightful words from the mid-1700s (<i>Sermon 94</i>) as he wrote about the Dark Ages:<br><br><i>The real cause why the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were no longer to be found in the christian church, was, because the christians were turned heathens again. </i>. . . <i>If then, the "whole of christendom," without one exception, have been "buried in the most abominable idolatry for upwards of eight hundred years," </i>. . . <i>because they are destitute of the gifts, are not even now christians, but heathens .</i>.., <i>we ask where the authority was during this eight hundred years, and where is it now? Surely God would not recognise "the most abominable idolaters," as holding authority. </i>[Orson Pratt, <i>Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon, </i>no. 2 (1850), paragraph 12]<br><br>Through the faith and instrumentality of Joseph Smith, the gifts of the Holy Ghost were restored with the restoration of the priesthood.<br><br>The sixth and seventh articles of faith state:<br><br><i> We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth. </i>[Articles ofFaith 1:6]<br><br><i> We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth. </i>[Articles of Faith 1:7]<br><br>Following our baptism, each of us had those holding the Melchizedek Priesthood lay hands on our heads for us to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. If we are faithful, we can have his influence with us. Through him, we each can be blessed with certain spiritual powers called gifts of the Spirit. These gifts are given tothose who are faithful to Christ. They will help us know and teach the truths of the gospel. They will help us bless others. They will guide us back to our Heavenly Father.<br><br>While the Holy Ghost can influence all mankind, the gift of the Holy Ghost functions when<br><ul><br> 	<li>an individual has been baptized and confirmed by one having the priesthood and has been given the gift of the Spirit,</li><br> 	<li>an individual continues to act under the ­principles of righteousness,</li><br> 	<li>the recipient is striving to be virtuous and pure,</li><br> 	<li>the recipient acts with integrity and truth and keeps the commandments of God.</li><br></ul><br>Ponder this message from President George Q. Cannon as he served as first counselor in the First Presidency:<br><br><i>If any of us are imperfect, it is our duty to pray for the gift that will make us perfect. </i>. . . <i>No man ought to say, "Oh, I cannot help this; it is my nature." Heis not justified in it, for the reason that God has promised to give strength to correct these things, and to give gifts that will eradicate them. If a man lack wisdom, it is his duty to ask God for wisdom. The same with everything else. That is the design of God concerning His Church. He wants His Saints to be perfected in the truth. For this purpose He gives these gifts, and bestows them upon those who seek after them, in order that they may be a perfect people upon the face of the earth.</i> [<i>Millennial Star, </i>April 1894, p. 260]<br><br>So, as we consider each of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, remember the counsel of heaven isto<br><br><i>seek . </i>. . <i>earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;</i><br><br><i> For verily I say unto you, they are given</i><br><br><i>for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:8–9]<br><br>A prerequisite for seeking after the gifts may require that we find out which gifts we have been given. The scriptures further record,<br><br><i> And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given untothe church.</i><br><br><i> For all have not every gift given unto them;</i><br><br><i>for there are many gifts, and to every man is given agift by the Spirit of God. </i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:10, 11]<br><br>To find the gifts we have been given, we must pray and fast. Often patriarchal blessings tell us the gifts we have received and declare the promise of gifts we can receive if we seek after them. Iurge you each to discover your gifts and to seek after those that will bring direction to your life's work and that will ­further the work of heaven.<br><br>During our time here on earth, we have been charged to develop the natural gifts and capabilities Heavenly Father has blessed us with. Then it will be our opportunity to use these gifts to become teachers and leaders of God's children wherever they may be found onearth. To exercise these gifts, we must develop a purity of heart.<br><br>If you choose to attend this university, observe the code of honor and apply it in your life with integrity.<br><br>It is interesting to watch cattle as they graze. Even when they have hundreds of acres on which to feed, some push up against the fence, straining to nibble on tufts of pasture grass on the other side of the fence. Know and work within your parameters. Students who come to this university give their word to live by its Honor Code. Keep that promise with integrity, wholeheartedly--not like the cows that hover at the fence, always reaching for that which is just out of the limits.<br><br>Don't push against the boundaries of the Honor Code. Realize it is a guide for your life.<br><br>As you date, keeping the laws of chastity, you are preparing to live the law of fidelity in marriage. The world needs people who can keep their word, who have a code of honor, andwho can finish a task and endure to the end. While you are here, concentrate on getting an education, growing spiritually, and graduating.<br><br>I testify to you that you are among the <i>very </i>noble on earth. You are the future leaders of our society and the Church. You need not look like the world. You need not entertain like the world. Your personal habits should be different. Your recreation should be different. Your concern for family will be different. As you establish this distinctiveness firmly in your life's pattern, the blessings of heaven await to assist you.<br><br>How can we accomplish this goal? I know there is a loving Heavenly Father who wishes to help. He has made available sacred gifts--even the gifts of the Spirit. As we exercise and magnify these gifts, we will be able to accomplish the callings and responsibilities that will come into our lives.<br><br>We can have the gift of discerning of spirits. George Q. Cannon has called the gift of discerning of spirits "a gift that is of exceeding value and one that should be enjoyed by every Latter-day Saint. . . . No Latter-day Saint should be without this gift, because there is such a variety of spirits in the world which seek to deceive and lead astray" (<i>Gospel Truth, </i>comp. Jerreld L. Newquist [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987], pp. 156–57).<br><br>Some may mean well but are listening to the wrong influence. Some people operate in a spirit of contention--clever with words from much practice, but not focused on correcting their own imperfections. They focus on the imperfections of others.<br><br>The spirit of the Lord withdraws from them with their fault finding and contentions. Unless they change, they rarely endure to the end but fall away in time. The Lord and the prophets of this day have set the course we should follow.<br><br>How can I question without losing the Spirit? This is a question often asked of me by young people. All of us have questions at times in our lives on policies, procedures, or even principles. The best way to find the answers we seek is to search out the solution for ourselves.<br><br>How do we go about it?<br><br>First and foremost, it is our attitude, or how we ask the question, that is very, very important. If it is a demand, one loses the opportunity for an answer.<br><br>Second, if we have strong feelings about the way something should be and are unwilling to listen, we may lose the opportunity to get an answer.<br><br>One only has to remember when Joseph Smith wanted to show pages of the Book of Mormon to an associate and let him take them home. He prayed to the Lord a number of times to finally be allowed to do it. The Lord knew that the pages would be lost. But sometimes we want something so much and keep praying about it that the Lord lets us do it for our learning experience.<br><br>Sometimes we are drawn into seeking and giving answers that bring recognition or ­notoriety to "our" thinking and to "our" opinion. Don't look for signs or answers that build you up. Humility and submissiveness to God will always be fundamental in receiving direction from him.<br><br>Others operate in a spirit of gratitude to the Lord for the gospel and concentrate on correcting their own imperfections. We can develop the ability to discern what spirit is influencing others and ourselves. We should seek and pray for this gift lest we be deceived.<br><br>The gift of discernment is like the rod of iron; it will keep us on the path toward the tree of life, which means eternal life.<br><br>This gift is of significant value in determining personal direction and in ministering in God's service. In<b> </b>1 John 4:1–3, we read:<br><br><i> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</i><br><br><i> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</i><br><br><i> And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</i><br><br>How does one distinguish between manifestations of the Spirit and counterfeits? One might ask these questions:<br><br>Is it edifying? Spiritual gifts are not given tosatisfy one's lusts or curiosities, but are given as a blessing and benefit to those who love God and keep his commandments.<br><br><b> </b>In<b> </b>acts of healing, does the healer follow the divinely established procedures? That is, does he do it in the manner in which Jesus did, seeking faith and purity of heart and then anointing with oil?<br><br>Has the worker of miracles received the gift of the Holy Ghost himself through the prescribed ordinances? One cannot invoke the blessings of heaven without having received the gifts and the right or authority to act in his name.<br><br>May I take a moment to talk of some cautions taught me by experiences that I have observed regarding the gifts of the Spirit.<br><br>Too often people feel that answers to their prayers and their pleading for guidance and direction will be given in dramatic manifestations or through a direct voice giving specific directions from a heavenly host. My personal experience and my observation of the Brethren as they guide and direct the Church and solve problems has taught me that the answers come oftentimes over an extended period of time with almost a natural solution whereby people take actions on the feelings of their hearts--which bring them peace and comfort--rather than through dramatic revelation.<br><br>Let me give you an example of how I learned this lesson. As a regional representative, I was traveling with President Romney toa stake conference for the selection of a new stake president. We had been driving in a car for more than an hour discussing the Church and priesthood administration. For some reason, I asked a question that, at the moment Iasked it, I realized was inappropriate.<br><br>The question I asked President Romney was "What is the most spiritual experience youhave had as an apostle of the Lord?" There wasa pause. It seemed like an eternity. Then hesaid, "I believe what Joseph Smith and Brigham Young taught, that if we would keep our spiritual experiences to ourselves, many more spiritual experiences could be shared with us."<br><br>It seemed like there was a long period of silence after that remark, and then he said to me,"I owe you a better answer." Then he gave me great counsel. He said the greatest spiritual experiences of his life had been when he had been on assignment from the president of the Church or the president of the Quorum of the Twelve, as we were that day. He said, "We will interview twenty-five or thirty priesthood brethren, and there will be more than one who will be qualified to be the stake president. But after we have done all we can do, we will get on our knees and pray to our Heavenly Father. We will tell him of our feelings of who the new stake president ought to be and the reasons why. We will tell him of the needs of the stake at this time. Then he will give us a confirmation."<br><br>It was interesting that he said "us," because it was true on that occasion that as we knelt and prayed, we both were able to receive a confirmation.<br><br>This is one of the best examples that I have had of what the gifts of the Spirit are and how they are manifest in our life's work. Apply the principles taught by President Romney to understand that you can have discernment and confirmation of the concerns that confront you, such as choosing a companion or choosing a career that is best for you.<br><br>Isn't it interesting that President Romney was sent to interview twenty-five or thirty mento choose one stake president rather than being told directly who it should be before his arrival. This is what the Lord means when he tells us to study it out in our own minds. Too often we want to be given answers to questions and problems that, if they were given in the manner we ask for them, would take away our free agency and the blessings that come from reaching out to the Lord for answers and ­direction.<br><br>Some think it would be nice to have "spiritual fortune cookies" we could open to find the answers to life's challenges. Wouldn't it be nice to have a labeled jar we could reach into for our answers? But that is not the way it is meant to be.<br><br>I would like to publicly express my love formy companion. I would not be here today without her. I love her dearly. She has gifts of the Spirit. We study the scriptures together, and many of the concepts I teach have come because we have had companion study and prayer. That is why I am who I am today, and Imust publicly acknowledge that.<br><br>Many of you are in the process of choosing a companion, and you must go through a long process before you make your decision. You have spent years thinking about what qualities or attributes you would like your companion to have. But at the same time you must be working very hard to make yourself the type ofperson who will attract the companion you desire.<br><br>As you go through your dating and courting relationships, I would hope that, during thedating and courting process, you will assess the spiritual inclinations of the individuals you're getting to know better. How do they treat their parents? How do they treat their brothers and sisters? Do they respect authority? What plans do they have for their lives?<br><br>It isn't enough if they are handsome or beautiful, if they are rich or poor, what kind of car they drive, what kind of clothes they wear, what kind of athletic ability they have, or what kind of intellect they are. You should be seeking to understand the gifts they have that will be eternal in nature.<br><h2><b>Use and Develop the Gifts</b></h2><br>You must work together to use and develop those gifts. President Benson said: "God loves you as He loves each and every one of His children, and His desire and purpose and glory is to have you return to Him pure and undefiled, having proven yourselves worthy of an eternity of joy in His presence" ("A Message to the Rising Generation," <i>Ensign, </i>November 1977, p.30).<br><br>Satan is mindful of each of us. He is committed to our destruction. He hopes we will failto keep the covenants we have made to our Heavenly Father at baptism and in the temple. That is the only joy and satisfaction he and his disciples will ever have--when one of us falls. Think about it.<br><br>Lehi records that an angel of God had fallen from heaven, and he became a devil, having sought that which was evil before God.<br><br><i> And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. </i>[2 Nephi 2:18]<br><br><i> Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh thatall men might be miserable like unto himself. </i>[2Nephi 2:27]<br><br>I remember one time President Kimball saying to me as we were traveling together, "Do you know the devil can never laugh, can never smile, can never enjoy himself?" I've always thought about that, how the only way he gets satisfaction is when we fail to endure to the end.<br><br>This time in school is a time of preparation. It is also a time of training. Your training is in preparation for the challenges and tests of this mortal probation. You are not only preparing your minds for the day when you can contribute to your occupation of choice and provide for your family, but you are also working on your spiritual capabilities.<br><h2><b>The Gift of Charity</b></h2><br>There is one gift I would like to spend just a moment on--the gift of charity, when we think of others. Use charity, which is the ability to love unconditionally, and give service for the right reasons. Charity is the ability to make life more meaningful for others. It is the theme of the Relief Society for a reason.<br><br><i> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</i><br><br><i> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</i><br><br><i> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</i><br><br><i> Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffedup.</i><br><br><i> Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not herown, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil. </i>[1Corinthians 13:1–5]<br><br>If we have these gifts and do not give of them to lift and to strengthen those around us in a caring way, this scripture tells us that "it profiteth [us] nothing." My wife has taught us in our home a simple phrase: "Thee lift me and I'll lift thee, and we'll ascend together." There are times when we need to be lifted. There are times when we need to be strengthened. Be that kind of friend and that kind of person. Never make someone have to choose between your ways and the Lord's ways. And always make sure that you're making it easier to live God's commandments for those who are by your side and who are your friends. Then you will understand whether you have charity.<br><br>Remember that the reason we want to have the stability and strength of the gifts of the Spirit is that we want to weather the storms when they come. We will be tried in this mortal probation. We don't want to decide to learn how to swim when the boat is already sinking. When a severe disability or problem comes to afamily or an individual, a high percentage of families and individuals break up, disintegrate, because they are overwhelmed and unprepared. That is why we are faithful, and that is why we remain strong and have those spiritual gifts.<br><br>Through his knowledge and obedience, when Jesus was in pain and upon the cross, he thought about taking care of his mother and spoke to John the Beloved about it. In<b> </b>all of the pain we must go through, we have to remember the pain that is in others.<br><br>The gifts of the Spirit can guide and enrich our lives. They can strengthen us spiritually and temporally. They can help us bless the lives of others. Most important, they can bring us comfort in times of trial. They can help us magnify our callings. They can help guide us in our relationships. They can help us avoid being deceived.<br><br>I bear testimony that God has given us the gifts of the Spirit to allow us to be drawn more closely into his circle of love. He desires that we should receive these gifts of the Spirit and magnify them and have them grow within us. We have to teach one another how to seek after them. As we do, our faith in him will increase and our true destiny will be fulfilled, ultimately to return to his presence as his valiant sons and daughters. May we seek after and obtain these gifts, I humbly pray.<br><br><b> </b>In<b> </b>conclusion, I would like to share how King Solomon taught about the learning process you're going through, as outlined in the book of Proverbs. Read it. It is marvelous teaching.<br><br>Each one of us is given a basic intelligence ­quotient. Intelligence is God-given. It is nothing tobe proud of. We're blessed with it.<br><br>We add to our intelligence knowledge, with facts, and we add experience, if we learn from it. And then we develop into a stage that Solomon calls wisdom.<br><br>Wisdom plus the gifts of the Spirit give us spirituality and an understanding in our hearts, which cause us to act in a righteous manner and follow the commandments of the Lord. It is the difference between knowing and doing.<br><br>It is for this reason you have come to this institution--to learn how to take this intelligence, knowledge, and experience to gain wisdom and learn understanding in your hearts in order to help you keep the commandments.<br><br>King Solomon said it in this manner:<br><br><i> For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. </i>[Proverbs 2:6]<br><br><i> Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i> [3:5]<br><br><i> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</i> [3:13]<br><br><i> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all of thy getting get understanding.</i> [4:7]<br><br><i> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding.</i> [5:1]<br><br><i> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</i> [3:31]<br><br><i> My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction.</i> [3:11]<br><br><i> For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. </i>[3: 12]<br><br><i> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</i> [3:13]<br><br>I give you my testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ. I give a testimony of the Holy Ghost and the gifts we can have if we will stay close to that Spirit. Please, be a good friend. Never make someone choose between your way and the Lord's way. And always make sure that it is easier for those who are near you to live that which we should live in terms of returning back to our Heavenly Father. May the Lord's choicest blessings be with you, I pray, and I give you my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Robert D.

<h1>g Spiritual Knowledge - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2></h2><br>Can you sense the excitement in the air as we begin another marvel called BYU Campus Education Week? There is nothing quite like it in scope or quality in all the world. Over 180 of the world's best and brightest have spent long hours preparing their presentations to provide more than 1,100 classes ranging from deep doctrine to folk dancing, from family and marriage to the healing wings of music. Over 33,000 righteous, inquiring individuals like you have traveled near and far, many at great sacrifice, with the sincere desire to learn more and be better prepared to serve. We meet on this extraordinary campus where singularly worthy students gain knowledge from an intensely devoted faculty in a spiritually centered environment.<br><br>I thank President Rex Lee, Education Week director E. Mack Palmer, and the others who organized this remarkable activity for wisely selecting the inspiring theme: "Education, Guided by the Light." Fundamental principles undergird that theme. As one ponders the significance of the focus the theme provides, many appropriate applications become evident across the broad spectrum of meaningful education. I have chosen to concentrate on the subject "acquiring spiritual knowledge," although the thoughts expressed have relevance to the acquisition of all worthy knowledge.<br><br>One may ask, "Why center on spiritual knowledge?" President Kimball gave this answer:<br><br><i>Spiritual learning takes precedence. The secular without the foundation of the spiritual is but like the foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow.</i><br><br><i>Do not be deceived! One need not choose between the two .</i>. .<i>for there is opportunity to get both simultaneously;</i>. . .<br><br><i>Secular knowledge, important as it may be, can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom nor create a world nor make a man a god, but it can be most helpful to that man who, placing first things first, has found the way to eternal life and who can now bring into play all knowledge to be his tool and servant.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 390]<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark observed:<br><br><i>There is spiritual learning just as there is material learning, and the one without the other is not complete; yet, speaking for myself, if I could have only one sort of learning, that which I would take would be the learning of the spirit, because in the hereafter I shall have opportunity in the eternities which are to come to get the other, and without spiritual learning here my handicaps in the hereafter would be all but overwhelming.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1934, p. 94]<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>This restored gospel brings not only spiritual strength, but also intellectual curiosity and growth. Truth is truth. There is no clearly defined line of demarcation between the spiritual and the intellectual when the intellectual is cultivated and pursued in balance with the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and strength.</i><br><br><i>The Lord Almighty, through revelation, has laid a mandate upon this people in these words:</i><br><br><i>"Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118).</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 1986, p. 63; also, "Come and Partake,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 48]<br><br>Your presence here indicates that you understand and follow that admonition of the Lord.<br><br>Finally, the Savior emphasized: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33).<br><br>Before I proceed, may I particularly commend you mothers in attendance. I know your presence indicates great sacrifice on your part as well as the cooperation of family and others who temporarily care for the children upon whom you concentrate the cream of your effort to train them "in the way of the Lord." We thank you for such devotion. You are following this admonition of Sister Camilla Kimball:<br><br><i>I have always had an inquiring mind. I am not satisfied just to accept things. I like to follow through and study things out. I learned early to put aside those gospel questions that I could not answer. I had a shelf of things I did not understand, but as I have grown older and studied and prayed and thought about each problem, one by one I have been able to understand them better.</i><br><br><i>A woman, to be well rounded in her personality, needs many experiences in and out of the home.</i>. . .<i>She needs to keep growing, to keep aware of the world in which her children are growing. In order to do this, she should be interested in educational advancement.</i>[Caroline Eyring Miner and Edward L. Kimball,<i>Camilla</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1980), pp. 126–27]<br><br>I commend you for having the interest in educational advancement.<br><br>My message is centered in a statement of principle that is then illustrated by examples from the scriptures, the lives of prophets, and the crucible of personal experience.<br><br>That statement of principle is:<br><br><i>To acquire spiritual knowledge and to use it</i><br><br><i>with wisdom, one must:</i><br><br><i>In humility, seek divine light.</i><br><br><i>Exercise faith in Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Strive diligently to keep his commandments.</i><br><br>As knowledge unfolds it must be understood, valued, used, remembered, and expanded.<br><br>The balance of this message will center on explaining what is meant by that statement in the hope that the suggestions given will help you in your quest for truth throughout your life. Then, in time, you and I may accomplish this objective given by President Joseph F. Smith:<br><br><i>The greatest achievement mankind can make in this world is to familiarize themselves with divine truth, so thoroughly, so perfectly, that the example or conduct of no creature living in the world can ever turn them away from the knowledge that they have obtained. "In the footsteps of the Master"</i>. . .<i>is the safest and surest course to pursue.</i>. . .<i>We can absorb the precepts, the doctrines and the divine word of the Master, without any fear that the exemplar will fail of carrying</i>[them]<i>out.</i>. . .<br><br><i>From my boyhood I have desired to learn the principles of the gospel in such a way and to such an extent that it would matter not to me who might fall from the truth,</i>. . .<i>who might fail to continue to follow the example of the Master, my foundation would be sure and certain in the truths that I have learned.</i>. . .<br><br><i>I know of but One in all the world who can be taken as the first and only perfect standard for us to follow, and he is the Only Begotten Son of God.</i>[<i>GD,</i>pp. 3–4]<br><br>Why seek divine light? These scriptures answer that question.<br><br><i>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</i>[Psalms 119:105]<br><br><i>The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</i>[Psalms 119:130]<br><br><i>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</i>[Psalms 27:1]<br><br><i>I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words.</i>[2 Nephi 10:14]<br><br><i>For, behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the light which shineth in darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee.</i><br><br><i>And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good--yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and this is my Spirit.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;</i><br><br><i>And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith believing in me that you shall receive.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 11:11–14]<br><br><i>And I now give unto you a commandment</i>. . .<i>to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.</i><br><br><i>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And everyone that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:43–47]<br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i>. . .<br><br>. . .<i>I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:36, 40]<br><br>Analogies with physical light help us understand the power of spiritual light. A bulb illuminated in a dark room overpowers darkness. Yet if the darkness is too intense, it can overpower light, as with a bulb plunged into a bucket of black printer's ink. Spiritual light overcomes the darkness of ignorance and disbelief. When transgression severely clouds a life, the focused spiritual truths of repentance cut the blackness as a laser penetrates the darkest ink.<br><br>Why must one, in humility, earnestly seek divine light? Does it really require that much effort? Elder Henry B. Eyring, Commissioner of Education, learned a treasured lesson that has served him well from his father, Henry Eyring. We remember that father as a world-renowned scientist and educator whose brilliance left a heritage of fundamental scientific principles that remain prized today. At a time when his son was at a pinnacle of formal education, having received his master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard and serving as a professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Business and as a Visiting Sloan Faculty Fellow at MIT, the father said:<br><br><i>Hal, you have a problem. You are confused. You think education is where you have been. It is not. It is what you do, not where you go to do it. You can get an education anywhere if you work hard enough at it. You can go into the desert with a good book and blackboard, and with diligent work you can become educated.</i><br><br>Brigham Young paid the price of learning by carefully listening to the Prophet Joseph Smith and striving to understand in context everything that was taught by word, example, or the Spirit. The resulting tutoring has blessed generations. It conditioned Brigham Young to learn additional truths and to share far more than he had received personally from Joseph Smith.<br><br>In my judgment, so much effort and personal investment is required to gain and use worthwhile knowledge that one cannot sample from every fascinating area of life but must select carefully the few vital areas where focused energy can be applied to bless our lives and those we serve. My personal experience confirms that to gain knowledge of great worth requires extraordinary effort through personal involvement. This is particularly true when our desire is to gain spiritual knowledge. President Kimball said it this way:<br><br><i>The treasures of both secular and spiritual knowledge are hidden ones--but hidden from those who do not properly search and strive to find them.</i>. . .<i>Spiritual knowledge is not available merely for the asking; even prayers are not enough. It takes persistence and dedication of one's life. The knowledge of things in secular life are of time and are limited; the knowledge of the infinite truths are of time and eternity.</i><br><br><i>Of all treasures of knowledge, the most vital is the knowledge of God: his existence, powers, love, and promises.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>pp. 389–90]<br><br>Why is humility essential to the acquiring of spiritual knowledge? Humility permits us to be taught from on high through the Spirit, or to be taught from sources whose origin was inspiration from the Lord, such as the scriptures. The seeds of personal understanding and growth germinate and flourish in the fertile soil of humility. Their fruit is spiritual knowledge to guide us here and in the hereafter. A proud individual cannot know the things of the Spirit. Paul taught this truth, saying:<br><br><i>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</i>. . .<br><br><i>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</i>[1 Corinthians 2:11, 14]<br><br>What do I mean by this statement: "As knowledge unfolds it must be understood, valued, used, remembered, and expanded"? I'll explain each concept.<br><br><b>Understood:</b>As each element of truth is encountered, it should be carefully examined in the light of prior knowledge to determine where it fits. It needs to be twisted, turned inside out, and studied from every vantage point to discover any hidden meaning. It must be viewed in perspective to confirm that you have not jumped to false conclusions. Prayerful pondering engenders further understanding. Such evaluation is particularly important when the truth comes as an impression from the Spirit.<br><br><b>Valued:</b>The Lord said: "And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more" (D&amp;amp;C 78:19). To value knowledge is to show appreciation for it, especially in heartfelt prayers of gratitude.<br><br><b>Used:</b>Application of truth is the surest way of making it eternally ours. It is the use of knowledge that causes it to bear fruit in our lives. One of the best examples of the use of knowledge gained is expressed in these familiar words of President Kimball:<br><br><i>We hope that the leaders and the members of the Church who have attended and listened to the conference have been inspired and uplifted. We hope you have made copious notes of the thoughts that have come to your mind as the Brethren have addressed you. Many suggestions have been given that will help you as leaders in the perfection of your work. Many helpful thoughts have been given for the perfection of our own lives, and that, of course, is the basic reason for our coming.</i>[Now you're going to have a similar experience here at Education Week. You'll take copious notes, you'll be inspired, you'll record those impressions that come to you. Afterwards, we should follow President Kimball's example.]<br><br><i>While sitting here, I have made up my mind that when I go home from this conference this night there are many, many areas in my life that I can perfect. I have made a mental list of them, and I expect to go to work as soon as we get through with conference.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1975, p. 164; also,<i>Ensign,</i>November 1975, p. 111]<br><br>And then the real learning begins!<br><br><b>Remembered:</b>Brigham Young declared, "If you love the truth you can remember it" (<i>JD</i>3:358). Knowledge carefully recorded is knowledge available in time of need. Spiritually sensitive information should be kept in a sacred place that communicates to the Lord how it is treasured. That practice enhances the likelihood of receiving further light.<br><br>Powerful spiritual direction in our lives can be overcome or be forced into the background unless we provide a way to remember it. Joseph Smith taught the Twelve the importance of recording spiritual direction with these words:<br><br><i>If you assemble from time to time, and proceed to discuss important questions, and pass decisions upon the same, and fail to note them down, by and by you will be driven to straits from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves, because you may be in a situation not to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired information; or, perhaps, for neglecting to write these things when God had revealed them, not esteeming them of sufficient worth, the Spirit may withdraw and God may be angry; and there is, or was, a vast knowledge, of infinite importance, which is now lost.</i>[From minutes of instruction to the Council of the Twelve, February 27, 1835;<i>HC</i>2:198–99]<br><br>That advice is meticulously followed in the presiding councils of the church. Each of us will be blessed as we heed it in our own private life.<br><br><b>Expanded:</b>This thought refers to the rich benefits that result as we diligently strive to enlarge, extend, and increase our understanding of truth. Productive resources for expanding our knowledge are the scriptures and the declarations of the prophets. President Benson counseled that we should make daily study of the scriptures a lifetime pursuit.<br><br><i>I</i>. . .<i>say to you that one of the most important things you can do</i>. . .<i>is to immerse yourselves in the scriptures. Search them diligently. Feast upon the words of Christ. Learn the doctrine. Master the principles that are found therein.</i>. . .<i>Few other efforts .</i>. .<i>will bring greater dividends to</i>[you.]<i>Few other ways</i>[will result in]<i>greater inspiration.</i>. . .<br><br><i>You must .</i>. .<i>see that studying and searching the scriptures is not a burden laid upon</i>[us]<i>by the Lord, but a marvelous blessing and opportunity.</i>["The Power of the Word,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, p. 81]<br><br>When one understands that acquiring and using knowledge with wisdom takes substantial commitment, that person will avoid the tragedy that can occur when teaching and learning become mechanical. Taken to an extreme, there results a process Elder Maxwell characterizes as transferring the professor's notes to the student's notebook without passing through either's mind. You who have made the sacrifice to be present realize that education can begin by listening to an array of qualified experts where their stimulating presentations spark our imaginations and motivate us to learn more. The process can start there, but for us to acquire useful knowledge it must be understood, valued, remembered, used, and expanded.<br><br>The need to exercise faith in Jesus Christ is understood by each of us. That is a fundamental requisite of the plan of salvation. When that exercise of faith is coupled with urgent need, the personal growth and blessings that flow are transcendent. I'd like to read Elder Faust's words when he expressed his feelings regarding such experiences at a conference. As I read them, think of how his struggling brought knowledge and growth.<br><br><i>During the years of my life, and often in my present calling, and especially during a recent Gethsemane, I have gone to my knees with a humble spirit to the only place I could for help. I often went in agony of spirit, earnestly pleading with God to sustain me in the work I have come to appreciate more than life itself. I have, on occasion, felt the terrible aloneness of the wounds of the heart, of the sweet agony, the buffetings of Satan, and the encircling warm comfort of the Spirit of the Master.</i><br><br><i>I have also felt the crushing burden, the self-doubts of inadequacy and unworthiness, the fleeting feeling of being forsaken, then of being reinforced an hundredfold. I have climbed a spiritual Mount Sinai dozens of times seeking to communicate and to receive instructions. It has been as though I have struggled up an almost real Mount of Transfiguration and upon occasion felt great strength and power in the presence of the Divine. A special sacred feeling has been a sustaining influence and often a close companion.</i><br><br>I'm sure many of you have had similar experiences as you have paid the price to learn them.<br><br>The role of obedience in gaining spiritual knowledge is crucial, as this comment of President Joseph Fielding Smith demonstrates:<br><br><i>Now the Lord would give us gifts. He will quicken our minds. He will give us knowledge that will clear up all difficulties, and put us in harmony with the commandments that he has given us, and with a knowledge that will be so deeply rooted in our souls that the knowledge can never be rooted out, if we will just seek for the light and the truth and the understanding which is promised to us, and which we can receive if we will only be true and faithful to every covenant and obligation pertaining to the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1958, p. 22]<br><br>To keep the commandments, we must know them. The best single source for learning them is the scriptures. Regarding such a search for light, President Joseph Fielding Smith gave this admonition:<br><br><i>Today we are troubled by evil-designing persons who are endeavoring with all their power to destroy the testimonies of members of the Church, and many members of the Church are in danger because of lack of understanding and because they have not sought the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord. Every baptized member of the Church receives the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands. This, however, will not save them unless they continue in the spirit of light and truth. Therefore it is a commandment from the Lord that members of the Church should be diligent in their activities and study of the fundamental truths of the gospel as it has been revealed. The Spirit of the Lord will not continue to strive with the indifferent, with the wayward and the rebellious who fail to live within the light of divine truth. It is the privilege of every baptized person to have an abiding testimony of the restoration of the gospel, but this testimony will grow dim and eventually disappear unless we are constantly receiving spiritual good through study, obedience, and diligent seeking to know and understand the truth.</i>[<i>CR,</i>October 1963, p. 22]<br><br>Profound spiritual knowledge cannot be poured from one mind and heart into another. It takes faith, trust, and diligent effort. Precious knowledge comes a small piece at a time with great exertion and at times with wrenching struggles. The Lord intends that it be that way so that we can grow, mature, and progress. We are asked to do all we are capable of doing first before asking for divine assistance. In explaining that truth, President Harold B. Lee gave this insightful instruction:<br><br><i>When we</i>. . .<i>cannot get anything to help ourselves, then we may call upon the Lord and His servants who can do all. But it is our duty to do what we can within our own power.</i><br><br><i>That is a tremendous principle. In order to teach young people how to approach the Lord and how to prepare to receive what the Lord has promised for those who are faithful, we must teach them these fundamental steps. After Moroni had read</i>[the]<i>great experience of the brother of Jared, he added: "Wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6).</i><br><br><i>The grandson of Lehi illustrates this principle also. Enos went out in the mountains to pray and to ask forgiveness for his sins. He closed his brief record about this experience by saying: "And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens" (Enos 4).</i><br><br><i>I once read that scripture to a woman who laughed and said, "Imagine anybody praying all night and all day." I replied, "My dear sister, I hope you never have to come to a time where you have a problem so great that you have to so humble yourself. I have; I have prayed all day and all night and all the next day and all the next night, not always on my knees but praying constantly for a blessing that I needed most."</i><br><br><i>Enos continued: "While I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments" (Enos 10).</i><br><br>Now President Lee gives a marvelous conclusion:<br><br><i>The Savior's blood, His atonement, will save us, but only after we have done all we can to save ourselves by keeping His commandments. All of the principles of the gospel are principles of promise by which the plans of the Almighty are unfolded to us.</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1976), p. 245–46]<br><br>As you seek spiritual knowledge, search for principles. Carefully separate them from the detail used to communicate or explain them. Principles are encapsulated knowledge, packaged to be applicable to a wide variety of circumstances. It is worth great labor to reduce information we gather to succinct statements of principle.<br><br>While there is much of value to be learned, there is only one arena of study where we may learn absolute truth--and that is centered in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The following personal experience integrates several of the points I have attempted to emphasize today. Every time I contemplate this event, I am moved by how kind the Lord is in answering our pleas for help. It occurred some time ago when I had responsibilities in Mexico and Central America that were far beyond my personal capacity to fulfil. I spent much sincere effort in seeking guidance and understanding from the Lord in study, prayer, fasting, and anxious service. Help came unexpectedly one Sunday as I attended a meeting where a humble, unschooled, Mexican priesthood leader struggled to communicate truths of the gospel identified in his lesson manual. It was obvious they had touched his life profoundly. I felt his intense desire to communicate those principles because they would be of great worth to his brethren. In his manner there was evidence of a pure love of the Savior and love for those he taught.<br><br>That love, sincerity, and purity of intent permitted a spirit to envelop the room. I was so touched that in addition to receiving again a witness of the truths he presented, I began to receive some personal impressions as an extension of those principles taught by the humble instructor. These impressions, intended for me personally, were related to my assignments in the area. They came in answer to my prolonged efforts to learn.<br><br>As each impression came, I wrote it down. I was given precious truths needed for me to be more effective. The specific counsel began with this impression: "Continue to build the Church on the foundation of true principles, but with increased expression of love and appreciation for the great Lamanite people." There followed matters of great benefit to me.<br><br>Next I visited the Sunday School class, where a well-educated individual presented his lesson. That experience was a striking contrast to that of the priesthood meeting. It seemed as though the instructor had purposely chosen obscure references and unusual examples to illustrate the principles in the lesson. I will confess that I had the distinct impression that he was using the teaching opportunity to impress the class with his vast store of knowledge. He did not seem as intent on communicating truth as the humble priesthood leader had been.<br><br>This experience also created an environment where strong impressions flowed. I wrote them down. One paragraph began, "Testify to instruct, edify, and lead others to full obedience, not to demonstrate anything of self. All who are puffed up shall be cut off." Another signaled, "You are nothing in and of yourself, Richard." That was followed with some specific counsel on how to be a better servant. The impressions became so personal that I felt it inappropriate to record them in the midst of a Sunday School class. I sought a more private location. There I continued to write the feelings that flooded into my mind and heart as accurately and as faithfully as possible. After each powerful impression was recorded, I meditated upon it and pondered the feelings I had received to determine if I had accurately interpreted them. Then I studied their meaning and application in my own personal life.<br><br>Subsequently I prayed, expressing to the Lord what I thought I had felt. There came a feeling of peace and serenity when it was confirmed. I asked if there was yet more that I should be given to understand. There came further impressions, and the process was repeated until I received the most precious, specific direction for which I will ever be grateful.<br><br>This event embodies several principles I feel are true regarding communication from the Lord to his children here on earth. I believe that we often do not learn the truths the Lord would freely share because we do not in humility earnestly seek light. We also can leave the most precious personal direction of the Spirit unheard because we do not strive to understand, value, use, remember, and expand the first promptings that come to us when we are in need or when impressions come in response to earnest, intense prayer.<br><br>You can see the things that I have been teaching you are not theory. I have learned them in the crucible of personal experience. I am sorry I cannot communicate them more clearly, but I know how you can also receive that kind of direction: Ask the Lord, seek the light, have faith in the Savior, strive to obey his commandments. He will bless you with light to lead you as you walk through this treacherous world in which we live.<br><br>I know he lives. I certify he lives. He knows each of us personally. Your efforts to learn of him, to learn truth, to be better prepared are appreciated by the Redeemer. As you continue faithfully, he will bless your efforts and inspire you and lead you to greater knowledge and capability. I testify that he guides this church, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Richard G.

I welcome the BYU community to the beginning of a new school year. Today is a day for candor, and I seek a particular interest in your prayers. That viola and piano piece by Johannes Brahms, just now exquisitely performed by Clyn Barrus and Mack Wilberg, was movingly beautiful. It occurs to me that this music also introduces my central theme. Shortly before he died, Brahms granted an intimate interview about his life and his work--on the condition that it not be published until 50 years after his death. Among many other revealing statements, Brahms described there the place of heavenly inspiration in his composing. He ascribed much of his gift to direct impressions from "the great Nazarene," even though he had little use for the established churches of his day. He also predicted that no atheist would ever compose great and lasting music, for lack of the essential divine spark. But then he added that even inspired melodies would never amount to great music unless they were crafted and developed with what he called intellectual "structure." I am thinking today of what inspiration and structure can do for each other.<br><br>As our new Joseph Smith Memorial Building was nearing completion a few years ago, it needed some kind of artistic capstone that captured and conveyed the crucial place of religious education at BYU. We invited Franz Johansen of our art faculty to propose possible designs for a large relief sculpture near the building's entrance. Franz brought in several beautiful sketches of Joseph the Prophet, but something was missing: the connection between Joseph Smith and the mission of BYU. Then a prayerful search found the answer in the Lord's revelation to Joseph: "I give unto you a<i>commandment</i>that you shall<i>teach one another</i>the doctrine of the kingdom.<i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 88:77–78; emphasis added). Even more significant than this text is its larger context, to which I will return later.<br><br>We "teach one another" through both teaching and scholarship. Thus the phrase "teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you" captures BYU's complete mission, combining the relentless pursuit of intellectual diligence with unwavering faith in the gospel and grace of Jesus Christ. Last year we reaffirmed these twin commitments in discussions among BYU faculty and administrators who sought to define the central message the university should communicate to all its publics--trustees, the BYU community, Church members, the academic community, and the general public. With Clayne Pope as our draftsman, we determined that:<br><br><i>Institutional compromise on either aspect of this ideal is unacceptable. Both the life of the mind and the life of the soul are valued and desirable. Neither is to be depreciated in a misguided attempt to elevate the other. Intellectual achievement does not excuse moral culpabilities. Moral rectitude does not eliminate the responsibility for intellectual effort.</i><br><br>This combining of spiritual and intellectual excellence tells the world, as Commissioner Henry Eyring put it, that our belief in scripture and living prophets has shown us<i>a better way</i>to teach and learn--in the Lord's words, we know a way to teach "more perfectly."<br><br>Last winter I tried to articulate this two-part message in answering a question from a higher education writer from a major American newspaper, who was here doing an article on academic freedom issues at BYU. I told him of our deep commitment to intellectual inquiry, analytical rigor, and intense involvement in the national issues of the day. Then I began describing how seriously we also take our spiritual commitments--commitments not just to generic religion, but to the Restoration.<br><br>He interrupted me and said, "Look--I understand what you're talking about. In fact, if I didn't believe that BYU is deadly serious about its devotion both to academic excellence<i>and</i>to Mormon religious values, I wouldn't be here. There would be no story. It's the combination that makes you unique. I hope you succeed, but it won't be easy." He then compared BYU to another well-known university that has religious tradition, noting that the other school has evidently decided to follow a typical pattern by emphasizing academic values over its religious values. By contrast, he noted a number of lesser-known religious colleges that relegate academic pursuits to a second-class status. In this context, BYU's approach is both distinctive and needed.<br><br>This reporter's reaction is typical of the way others are coming to see both BYU and the Church. They take this university very seriously. Their interest in academic freedom and related current issues here is a sign of our strength, not of our weakness. I cite the following examples of that interest not to imply that external attention matters more than substance, but to illustrate my view that recent controversies on the campus really are the growing pains of an institution that is gathering momentum along a sustained and significant growth path. Consider a few headline-style examples, first regarding the Church--of which BYU is such a visible part.<br><br>The Church is now the seventh-largest religious body in America. Its population exceeds that of most nations in the world. The<i>New York Times</i>recently ran a respectful front-page article on the Church's growth.<i>Time</i>magazine reported last year that Utah has the nation's youngest, best-educated, and most productive work force.<i>Forbes</i>and<i>Fortune</i>magazines regard the Wasatch Front as the nation's new Silicon Valley. A new book from Yale University Press,<i>Heaven</i>:<i>A History</i>, calls the teachings of the LDS Church the most fully developed modern theology on the life after death, thus responding to a national hunger for heaven as a place where loved ones may reunite and be with God. And a recent national survey asked 5,000 Book-of-the-Month Club readers what book had influenced their lives the most. The Bible was number one--and the Book of Mormon was number seven. Only a few years ago, the Book of Mormon would never have been on such a list.<br><br>As for the university, I believe BYU is emerging as a major university of genuine national stature. Just a few examples: In its number of National Merit scholars, BYU ranks among the nation's top 15 universities. Several of our academic and professional programs are ranked as national leaders. Our faculty's output of scholarly books and articles has grown enormously, influencing thought in many disciplines.<i>U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report</i>tells us that the center of foreign language studying in the U.S. is no longer Cambridge or Berkeley, but Provo. National publications on computer-assisted language translation regard Provo as a world center. A family law scholar from Tokyo, Japan, just made a special trip to BYU on his first visit to the U.S. because he had found in reading the scholarship emanating from this place such a refreshing contrast to the corrosive individualism of modern American thought that he referred to BYU as "an oasis of hope in the land of the apocalypse."<br><br>I repeat what the visiting reporter was saying about this context: In a day when religious universities are a vanishing breed, our impressive combination of clear academic strength and genuine religiosity is an important story. The<i>Chronicle of Higher Education's</i>article on our recent tenure cases reflects this impression:<br><br><i>Brigham Young is facing the same kinds of . . . tensions that have become common at other research universities. It isn't unusual for scholars doing work in new areas to clash with more tradition-minded colleagues--particularly in the humanities. At the same time, academic standards have been rising</i>[at BYU].<i>The debate is further complicated by BYU's religious identity.</i><br><br>These observers understand not only our nature as a university, but also the venerable place of religious universities in American history.<br><br>BYU's growing academic strength is attracting very able students, faculty, and visitors, some of whom may not have come here in the days when the Church's membership was less diverse and our programs were not as strong. As is often needed when a small, homogeneous group expands in both size and diversity, our new friends are entitled to know our traditional policy framework. We have thus made our customs explicit not because we're slowing our academic growth, but precisely because we're moving on with it.<br><br>Academic freedom is only one of many important and challenging issues we are clarifying as BYU moves toward the 21st century in an environment of complexity and public attention. These matters include our policies on admissions, the student honor code and student ecclesiastical endorsements, helping more students graduate--and helping them graduate sooner--the nature of our allegiance to the Church and its values, continuing status and promotion standards, and the balance we should strike between teaching and scholarship in our commitment to academic excellence. In so clarifying, we move together in strength, building on those twin commitments to the life of the mind and the life of the soul.<br><br>In complex organizations, periods of transition toward greater growth are often marked with the discomfort of growing pains. BYU is now moving through such a period. It is a time when the clarification of our commitments, drawing upon open campus dialogues, will empower and move our community toward the next stage in fulfilling BYU's destiny. I have just described how I believe observers external to the campus accurately perceive the growth dimension of our growing pains. Meanwhile, because some of us internally are still working through the pain dimension of our growth, we must listen to each other carefully enough to avoid distortions that compound the pain.<br><br>The contemporary world has become increasingly complicated and combative. For instance, the Church always had its critics, but now local news stories routinely raise Church or BYU-related controversies. In many respects increased media interest compliments us. We have high standards, our success is attracting ever more attention, and--as I will discuss shortly--our sometimes paradoxical identity as a Church university in a secularized, pluralistic society makes what happens here very interesting.<br><br>In this environment, we must all consider the implications of conducting BYU's business before a public audience. Sometimes our participation may unwittingly draw us into a media context that pursues agendas well beyond our own. Moreover, the public can't always hear the whole story, especially when a story is complex or has confidential elements. And, unfortunately, too many people still assume that if a story is in the newspaper, it must be not only true but important. Yet we still see stories in which unbalanced and unverified accounts on opposing sides of campus issues fuel uninformed emotions.<br><br>These factors can combine with the sheer size of the university to place our sense of community at risk, impairing our mutual communication and our mutual levels of trust. In these complicated times, some hammer others in intolerant self-righteousness, and that doesn't help us. Some try to go public when they feel unlistened to, and that doesn't help us. Still others remain silent, when they need to reach out in loving and private willingness to offer suggestions--after understanding another's point of view. In these complicated times may we be as candid yet as kind as Moroni and Pahoran. Even when some think others are sitting "upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless stupor" (Alma 60:7), may we have Pahoran's empathy and charity: "In your epistle you have censured me, but I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart" (Alma 61:9). In that willing spirit, I pledge the administration's renewed desire to be accessible and to listen.<br><br>Meanwhile the BYU community is engaged in a large, diverse, and incredibly successful educational enterprise; and a new school year is a good time to get on with that enterprise. To that end, I offer a simple model intended to give some perspective both to recent events and to our more fundamental tasks of teaching, learning, and scholarship. The university's dual heritage gives us membership in and allegiance to two different worlds--the world of higher education and the world of the Church.<br><br>Imagine two circles, side by side, representing those two worlds. Color the higher education circle red, and color the Church circle blue. Bring the two circles toward each other until they overlap somewhat. Color the overlap area purple, the color resulting from mixing blue and red. BYU belongs in the purple overlap area with its dual nature--it is genuinely part of the Church, yet genuinely also part of the American higher education, inevitably affected by what happens in either world. In this unique domain we have found a "more perfect" way to teach and learn.<br><br>Yet some people in the red world of education look at a purple BYU and say, "Hey, you're not red like us, you strange duck!" And some people in the blue world of the Church say, "Hey, you're not blue like us, you strange duck!" This can give BYU people feelings of tension, if not an identity crisis--despite being part of the great purple tradition of religious higher education. But that tension and our unique identity are the source of our greatest contributions to both the red and blue worlds--and our ability to contribute is improved every time someone in either of those worlds better understands how our purple nature can bless them in ways that a simple blue or a simple red entity never could. Consider some illustrations of how belonging to each world affects us.<br><br>When I refer to the world of education, I mean the ideal of traditional higher education that has made American colleges and universities the world's finest. Not everything about U.S. higher education today is healthy, and BYU's membership in the community of universities does not mean we uncritically accept every new academic trend or value. But in the simplest, most general sense, BYU is clearly a player on the field of higher education. It thus differs in certain respects from other agencies sponsored by the Church, which explains our direct reporting line to a distinct board of trustees. Our sponsorship and our educational mission do make us accountable first of all to the Church, and if we ever have a truly irreconcilable conflict between higher education and the Church, we will choose the Church.<br><br>But we are also accountable in very serious ways to accrediting bodies, government agencies, the academic disciplines, the professions, and the larger academic community. Each of us at BYU is also accountable to the public. The day the Church created BYU as a serious university, it made a substantial contribution to<i>the public interest</i>. We are obliged to prepare our students to function successfully in that public world as well as in their private worlds of family and Church. BYU will never be "<i>of</i>the [public] world," but it is unavoidably and wholeheartedly<i>in</i>that world.<br><br>In this spirit, I salute--and cheer for--the growing numbers of BYU faculty and administrators who are major contributors to their academic and professional fields. Our scholars, artists, and researchers are making a difference in a society that sorely needs their inspired and creative genius. In ways that also breathe quality and excitement into our basic teaching mission, BYU faculty are making scientific and theoretical breakthroughs, discovering social insights, and exquisitely performing creative works--often at world-class levels. Our membership in the community of universities gives us not only the opportunity but the obligation to keep doing this. As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, "It is required of us that we share the action and the passion of our time, at the peril of being judged not to have lived." In this demanding sense, BYU must be judged to have lived.<br><br>In addition, because of our ties to this red educational world, we must be cautious about the way we integrate our academic disciplines with the gospel. As I discussed a year ago, the sacred map of the universe is large enough to encompass the secular map, but the secular map is too small to include the sacred map. This perspective encourages us to have a sacred, as opposed to a profane, perspective on the whole of life. But his does not mean we<i>exclude</i>secular maps--we just see them in perspective. This understanding can also inform us when some value-laden premise from the red world is simply wrong. But that red world still offers much that is "lovely, of good report, and praiseworthy."<br><br>Time precludes our exploring all the implications of our membership in the world of higher education, but we must at least note one more: BYU is unavoidably affected by--and must therefore come to terms with--developments in the academic disciplines. I note especially the newly radicalized disciplines with which all major universities are now concerned. For example, the critical legal studies movement in the law schools, which partakes of several postmodernist elements, has challenged the very foundations of not only legal education and law practice, but the very idea of a system of law. This movement asserts that law has no objective legitimacy and is simply a euphemism for power. Similar claims in the humanities and elsewhere challenge every discipline they touch.<br><br>Many of these arguments have value, forcing us to rethink prevailing paradigms and helping to unmask remaining pockets of discrimination and unfairness. But while some radical advocates have staked claims to new theoretical constructs, they also convey anti-intellectual overtones when they rely on simplistic conspiracy theories urged by "true believers" who refuse to deal rationally with the arguments against their positions. Some of these radicals are waging war against American universities, uprooting established disciplines and turning departments on many campuses into what one writer called "islands of repression in a sea of freedom."<br><br>Some proponents of change put power-oriented "activism" ahead of rational discourse in their teaching and scholarship, a step that raises troubling questions for those who thought universities were designed to liberate us from making decisions in the streets. And, as NYU's Joseph Salemi wrote, "Academic freedom [to some of these people] means [their] freedom to be hired and tenured without the inconvenience of competition or the necessity of producing real scholarly work."<br><br>The new movements are asking large and searching questions, and we must not dismiss them out of hand. We must maintain open minds and a willingness to debate the issues honestly, that we may be among the good universities that thoughtfully distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate arguments in this area. We must also struggle conscientiously to understand the place of activist teaching and scholarship that arguably rejects established disciplines and methodologies. Debate on such questions is terribly important in a free society. The question for<i>universities</i>is<i>how</i>this debate should occur in an academic journal or in the captive audience of a classroom, as distinguished from how it occurs in forums outside the academy. Our judgments about that question will affect our future understanding of what a university is.<br><br>As we encounter this trend, we must help our friends in the blue world of the Church to understand that not everything about the trend is bad. Moreover, the noisy debates the trend fosters can, if conducted civilly, be a sign of educational health, not a sign that BYU is falling apart. Yet we also belong to that Church world; therefore, our faculty who accept activist premises must not take lightly our need for the understanding and support of mainstream Church members.<br><br>Consider now some implications of BYU's belonging to the blue world. First, let it be clear that we do not dilute everything blue with a dose of red. The doctrines of the Restoration inform and shape us in utterly undiluted ways. In that sense and in other ways, my three-colored metaphor, like most metaphors, is obviously subject to important qualifications.<br><br>As we add organizational factors to doctrinal ones, our Church sponsorship is still the source of our greatest strength, even if it seems from a red-world perspective our greatest vulnerability. To be bluntly practical about it, compare BYU's circumstances with those at other universities. I recently heard a professor from the University of Virginia report his findings from a survey of leaders in a large sample of American universities. As I share their five greatest worries, in order of importance, ask yourself how worried we are at BYU about these issues: (1) financing university operations, (2) attracting enough students to maintain enrollments, (3) financial support for facilities and technology, (4) financial support to maintain educational quality, and (5) strengthening the curriculum. Of course BYU has challenges, including some financial ones. But the Church's support for BYU is almost unbelievable by higher education standards. Our basic operations are so well funded and we have so many students wanting to enroll that we can hardly relate to most current worries at other universities.<br><br>At the same time, our blue background gives our educational mission a distinctive hue. As President Kimball said in his celebrated Second Century address, "This university is not of the world any more than the Church is of the world, and it must not be made over in the image of the world." He said, "I hope none will presume on the prerogatives of the prophets of God to set the basic direction for this university." Yet he also urged BYU to "tower above other universities," because<i>the First Presidency "expect</i>[s]<i>(we do not simply hope) that [BYU] will 'become a leader among the great universities of the world.'"</i>A few among those who watch us may find that even this pattern is too blue to suit them. But we have yet to see their reservations impose costs on BYU that even approach the benefits of our Church sponsorship--especially because those benefits are so much more than merely financial benefits.<br><br>Happily, as President Kimball's language suggests, our board of trustees is deeply committed to our basic educational and scholarly interests. We may occasionally see an exceptional case in which the disproportionate visibility of a BYU person who appears to challenge board direction causes discomfort. But I find over and over again that our board enthusiastically supports and even admires our faculty, our staff, and our students. As President Hinckley said last fall, "Never in the history of this institution has there been a faculty better qualified professionally nor one more loyal and dedicated to the standards of its sponsoring institution. . . . This is a world-class university, a great temple of learning." We should read that talk often, because it came from President Hinckley's heart, and I believe it speaks for the entire board of trustees.<br><br>Our belonging to the Church world liberates rather than confines us in our multitude of campus activities. In nearly all matters of hiring, curriculum, academic programs, research projects and methods, organizational matters, and social activities, authorized faculty or staff personnel have enormous personal discretion. We must always strive for mature professionalism, but because of the religious worldview held by virtually all BYU people, Church values obviously shape our discretionary judgments in appropriate ways--not because we<i>have</i>to follow Church values, but because we<i>get</i>to follow them. Sometimes the blue world defines us in ways that people in the red world can't understand, but those limits do what the Lord's discipline always does--it enables<i>greater</i>, not lesser, educational perfection than the red world knows.<br><br>In an educational world that thrives on rationality, it helps us that we subscribe to what Elder John A. Widtsoe called "a rational theology." But we live also by faith, at times accepting the counsel of the Lord and his servants without a complete rationale. For instance, we have recently lived through a fascinating culture change on the social acceptability of tobacco smoke. I have wondered why the Lord didn't just tell us in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants about the risks of lung cancer. He just gave his conclusions and a promise--no more rationale than that tobacco "is not good for man."<br><br>Thus has the Lord always worked. There is an entire theology explaining why it is better for our spiritual development when we freely choose to "be believing" rather than waiting until we are compelled--even by scientific evidence--to believe. That's not easy for us university types who were trained in rational skepticism. But our experience in the blue world constantly verifies, like the tobacco example, why the Lord warned the Saints in the very next section:<br><br><i>And all they who receive the oracles of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains descend, and beat upon their house.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 90:5]<br><br>A BYU friend of mine believes that now that the world has discovered how reasonable it is to avoid smoking, the Lord will find some test other than the Word of Wisdom to let us show that our allegiance to him is grounded in faith, not merely in threats that are obvious to everyone. (Another friend said, on hearing this, "I hope it isn't ice cream! That would<i>really</i>test this people.")<br><br>Another effect of our belonging to the Church world is that students, parents, and other Church members understandably link what happens at BYU to the Church's sponsorship. This linkage is not always easy to apply at a strong university in a free society because we seek to provide a rich educational experience that exposes our students to a wide array of ideas and approaches. Nonetheless, Church members and leaders are entitled to expect that our classes, programs, and performances are consistent with Church aspirations. As with any organization whose sponsorship implies some level of support, BYU is thus appropriately concerned with the "fit" between the university's distinctive mission and those who occupy our platforms.<br><br>As we work through the overlaps between the Church world and the educational world, Henry B. Eyring, our commissioner of education, and Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who now chairs the executive committee of our board, have blessed us immeasurably in helping to secure effective zones of governance between the board and the university. We have now adopted, for example, a jurisdictional understanding that defines the separate functions of ecclesiastical and educational channels consistently with our academic freedom statement so that issues arising only because of one's BYU personnel status will be handled by the university. We have also adopted on the campus a new student/faculty grievance policy that directs concerned students first to faculty members, then department chairs, deans, and the administration. When student concerns go outside this process, we should channel them back to it.<br><br>So at BYU we live in two worlds--the red world of higher education and the blue world of the Church. I realize that some people see red when they think BYU looks blue, and other people turn blue when they think BYU looks red. I also realize that, as this model reveals, BYU personnel are the only people in the world who can be equally vilified by their Mormon and non-Mormon relatives at the same family reunion. Still, I plead with those who see mostly one or the other of these worlds to experience the other world more fully. We all work within a complex sphere, even though some departments naturally deal more with one color than another. It hurts us and drives the Lord's spirit from our midst when some who think mostly in either red or blue terms sit in harsh judgment on those who think mostly in terms of the other color.<br><br>Against the background of this incomplete sketch of BYU's exciting life in the land of the purple overlap, I wish to mention briefly three specific topics: the general quality of our work, the recent three-year reviews, and the matter of gender and feminism.<br><br>First, I plead for excellence and quality in all we do here. Our involvement in two worlds gives us twice as many reasons to do our best. For example, knowing that BYU's work is part of God's kingdom lets us view whatever we do as a religious offering, whether that work is done by BYU cooks, custodians, carpenters, or clerks. As C.S. Lewis said, whether work is done by a Beethoven or a bootblack, it becomes holy on the same condition: whether it is done for the glory of God. I am struck by the learning that the fathers of both President McKay and President Kimball taught them as young boys to give the best of their harvest to the Lord when paying their tithing in kind. For the McKays, this mean their best crop of hay. For the Kimballs, the best and largest eggs were the "tithing eggs."<br><br>Could we thus think of our daily labor, whether in staff support, teaching, or scholarship, as a consecration of our best personal harvest? Knowing that the world regards our work as representing BYU and its sponsoring Church should bring out the very best that is in us. When it does, as Paul Cox put it, the gospel is<br><br><i>not a filter, but a catalyst that requires me to act on my knowledge to confront directly the issues and problems that affect all of mankind. Rising violence, serious disease, widespread poverty, and worldwide environmental degradation are moral and spiritual issues that I, as a follower of Christ, am required to face. Rather than aspire to higher position, each of us should aspire to higher performance.</i><br><br>We must also insist on both rigorous analysis and impeccable judgment in doing work that integrates the gospel with academic disciplines. When such work is poorly done, it can turn on the Church either because it just isn't very careful work, or because it may appear to judge the Church by the limited lights of the academic discipline alone. Let us not stretch unwisely, therefore, to include Church issues in our work. But let us also avoid the extreme of believing that being independent of or critical of the Church is the best evidence of educational quality. Our dual commitment asks for mutually reinforcing, not mutually exclusive, forms of excellence.<br><br>One other matter under the heading of quality: In his message this morning, President Lee will discuss a range of issues relating to the subject of time-to-graduation. I wish to add my voice to his as we emphasize educational quality rather than mere efficiency in whatever we do. I welcome the prospect of reexamining every academic course requirement we impose on students because I believe the discipline required to do this will, if we insist on it, greatly increase our analytical rigor. In the same way that poetic or other artistic forms force clarified thought and focused expression, the challenge of designing a leaner curriculum can force us to clarify and focus our thinking about how and why we teach what we do.<br><br>Second, a word of perspective on the recent third-year reviews. Since some appeals from those cases are still pending, my comments will be limited. Some have wondered if the administration has stated the "real reasons" why five of this year's 50 applicants for continuing status were not initially granted candidacy. The university did not publicize these cases, because they involve confidential faculty personnel issues and because publicity may inhibit the candor required in future evaluations. Most universities still regard their files as so private that they don't even show them to tenure candidates. One dean at the University of California said this policy is necessary to protect the academic freedom of the faculty who conduct the reviews.<br><br>For these reasons, we are not free to discuss the details of the current cases, even though most people on campus have been talking about them--without the benefit of adequate information. In responding publicly to questions, the university has stated that the initial decisions were based on the professional judgment of established<i>faculty</i>committees in the same peer review process that characterizes any good university. The administration upheld the judgment of the university-level Faculty Council on Rank and Status in all five cases and sent each candidate the rationale reported by that council. That council has reached its bottom-line decisions following very careful reviews of the candidates' teaching, their scholarship, and their university citizenship.<br><br>Third, regarding feminism and gender at BYU, let us distinguish at the outset between two very different forms of feminism that are frequently confused today. There is a broad spectrum of feminist thought. At one end of the spectrum, "equity feminism" represents the very general goal of fairness and equal dignity for both genders. BYU, the Church, and most Americans have shared this goal for many years. In pursuit of this goal we maintain a superb equal opportunity staff; for years we have carefully monitored university hiring, compensation, and promotion patterns to ensure gender equality; we have recently created a Women's Resources and Service office, and we have adopted a very complete sexual harassment policy, which is now available on the electronic handbook; and for over three years members of the President's Council have received very thoughtful advice in an ongoing dialogue on gender issues with a committee of able women headed by Kate Kirkham of the Marriott School of Management faculty. Professor Kirkham is a nationally known expert on race and gender issues.<br><br>At the other end of the spectrum of feminist thought is the "radical feminist critique." In between equity feminism and the radical critique is a large variety of feminist ideas and approaches, many of which are emerging in the academic disciplines. Many forms of academic feminism along this spectrum emphasize the unique dimensions of women's experiences and perspectives. They also seek to broaden society's governing paradigms to include such female values as nurturing, cooperation, and personal relationships. These aspirations have great merit. Only by including women's perceptions with those of men can our social institutions reflect and foster meaningful interdependence. In addition, as Cheryl Preston has shown, greater awareness of women's unique experiences can help men to see how their own failures to model the attributes of godliness can undermine the ability of women to develop a correct perception of God.<br><br>However, the radical critique at the extreme end of the feminist spectrum goes on to hypothesize that all Western institutions were designed by men to perpetuate male power over women and that the male paradigm of meaning not only pervades but controls these institutions. Some radical feminist writers thus argue that Western institutions and ideas on every subject from marriage and family life to literature and the legal system are so contaminated with male bias that we must discard all prevailing assumptions and revolutionize the culture. For instance, as Mary Stovall Richards has found, the radical critique regards "the family as an institution of repression for women." This challenge can prod us to discover insights about ourselves that we might otherwise miss. But, as we have recently learned about Marxism, any single-issue explanation of human history must be examined with healthy skepticism. My biggest concern about the radical feminist critique is its potential to undermine religious faith when it rejects hierarchical and patriarchal institutions to the point of rejecting scripture, priesthood authority, and prophets. My biggest problem with the radical critique, then, is not that it favors women, but that it can disfavor divine revelation.<br><br>When we confuse equity feminism with radical feminism, not even seeing the broad spectrum between those two points, those who fear the destructive potential of radical feminism may unwittingly undermine our commitment to equal treatment, dignity, and fairness for women. We must clearly distinguish between these two opposite ends of the feminist spectrum. Let us also constantly reaffirm the value of educating--and educated--women. In 1975, then President Dallin H. Oaks issued a "Statement on the Education of Women at BYU" that deserves frequent repetition. He stressed that the "primary orientation toward motherhood" of LDS young women is "not inconsistent with their diligent pursuit of an education," including their efforts in vocational studies. Thus, BYU makes "no distinction between young men and young women in our conviction about the importance of an education and in our commitment to providing that education."<br><br>Among the educated people I value most are the highly competent women who serve this campus as faculty, staff, and administrators. Some of our most significant personnel appointments in recent years include a number of very fine women faculty. They also include Addie Fuhriman, Carolyn Lloyd, Maren Mouritsen, and Margaret Smoot, who now occupy some of the university's most responsible and sensitive administrative positions in the areas of Graduate Studies, Human Resources, Student Life, and Public Communications. I also express both personal and institutional appreciation to Carol Lee Hawkins, who has served the last five years with great distinction and sensitivity in a part-time employment and committee role, chairing the committee that plans the annual Women's Conference sponsored jointly by BYU and the general Relief Society. That conference has given, and continues to give, BYU people an extraordinary opportunity to serve the interests of Latter-day Saint women.<br><br>Given the obvious support of our board of trustees for the education and the professional advancement of women at BYU, it is simply wrong for anyone on this campus to sit in judgment--or to allow students to sit in judgment--on any other person's marital status, family circumstances, or other personal dimension. Our professional women at BYU deserve both our appreciation and our respect.<br><br>I return now to the Doctrine and Covenants for a final perspective. We are approaching the 21st century. The Church will grow so rapidly in the coming years that we must rethink why BYU exists. During earlier times, our model was the Church academies--colleges that educated all the youth of Zion who chose to attend. But in the approaching new century, when the Church can have only one university, the academy model may no longer fit as well. BYU must somehow become a university that serves the international Church while enrolling only a small fraction of its members. What kind of place must this be to help build the worldwide Zion? The most obvious answer to that question is that this must be a truly excellent university, as President Kimball told us the First Presidency so fully expects. Mediocrity will not advance the reputation and the cause of Zion across the globe.<br><br>The 88th section, first given to guide the Saints who were building Zion in 1832, is still the best perspective on building Zion with a "more perfect" form of excellence. It speaks first of the light of Christ, which enlightens every person and fills every space. That light, said Parley P. Pratt, is the source of instinct in animals, reason in man, and vision in prophets. It is the light of human conscience and of natural laws in the universe. If we live in the light, we may grow in the light. Those who leave the light will become without feeling or conscience, for they "seeketh to become a law unto [themselves], and willeth to abide in sin" (88:35).<br><br>But for those who live in the light, section 88 unfolds an amazing pattern of personal progression. As we grow in understanding and obedience, we receive more light. This includes the promptings of the Holy Ghost, then comes the Gift of the Holy Ghost, then ratification by the Holy Spirit of Promise (see 88:3). As the light increases, section 88 speaks of making our calling and election sure (88:4), which prepares us, said Joseph Smith, to receive in this life the Second Comforter--the presence of Christ. And finally comes glorious sanctification in the Father's holy presence. So it is that "he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day" (D&amp;amp;C 50:24).<br><br>We at BYU have chosen education. We love to learn. We seek to<i>comprehend</i>the mysteries of life. Then what more stirring promise could fill our ears than 88:67-68, which describes the culmination of the fullness of light:<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.</i><br><br>Now consider the verses that follow this promise. The Lord speaks of a solemn assembly where the laborers for Zion may purify themselves so that he by his atoning power may make them clean. He testifies of that cleansing power and asks the laborers to fast and pray. It is from<i>this</i>stirring train of thought that these words then flow:<br><br><i>And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, . . . in doctrine, . . .</i><br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, . . . things which have been, things which are. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:77–79, 118]<br><br>These words and those that surround them are the most celebrated words in all scripture on the subject of teaching and learning--the most quoted at BYU gatherings. Now, what are these verses doing in section 88, mixed with the promises of sanctification and being filled with light? Could if possibly be that if our teaching is diligent enough and if our eyes really are single to God's glory, the grace of the holy atonement would attend us? What is the connection between "comprehending" and learning and receiving more light? What is "an eye single to the glory of God?" What must we do to invite this understanding into our lives and the lives of our students? Given such a vision, what more promising life could there be than being a teacher and a learner at BYU?<br><br>Seeking the answers to these questions is the quest of a lifetime. Franz Johansen lifts my eyes to look for the answers with the powerful lines of grace and light that he carved streaming from heaven in the new relief sculpture at the Joseph Smith Building. Richard Cracroft lifted my heart to feel some of the answers when he so gently reminded us at this summer's devotional how the Lord stretches forth his finger to touch and change our lives in a multitude of ineffable but undeniable interventions of the spirit. Richard spoke much of "Hosannah moments" in the mission field, but he also moved me to remember that that same spirit fills this campus, too. Every day here, many, many times, unknown to the newspapers, that spirit "shall enlighten our mind, [and] fill your soul with joy" (D&amp;amp;C 11:13). We all knew what Richard was talking about. We have felt it. We must feel it often and--someday--always. It is the spirit of section 88, seeking to grow brighter and brighter until the perfect day. By that light and by our diligence, we have found a better way to teach and learn.<br><br>They who seek to build Zion have always known about the growing pains and the cloudy days that may briefly hide the light. But the builders of Zion always keep moving and growing, guided by the spirit of section 88, which flows freshly from the heavens, flooding our earth every day with its clear light. That light shines nowhere more brightly than it does on these precious acres we call the BYU campus. May we lift our eyes to the light, cleanse ourselves, and teach with all diligence, and the Lord's grace will attend us.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>Diversity, Academic Freedom, Graduation Time - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I express personal appreciation to each of you for your presence here this morning. In many ways, this is our most important meeting of the year, and it is almost certainly the most important talk that I give. It is my one opportunity to share with our entire university professional family--staff, faculty, and administrators--my thoughts about the kind of university we are and ought to be, what we have done, and how we can do it better. I have been disappointed--even frustrated--over the fact that it is literally impossible to have continuing interaction with the some 4,400 people who carry out the day-to-day tasks necessary to the fulfillment of our educational mission. I found those relationships both pleasing and valuable when I worked with smaller groups of colleagues at the Law School or in government. I wish I could have closer and more frequent contacts with all who make up our BYU family. But these annual conferences provide us at least one opportunity--the best one I have each year--to visit with all of you.<br><br>Because of the frequent inquiries I receive, I want to give you a report concerning my health. In a sentence, I feel as optimistic about both the near term and also the long term as I have at any time in the last three and a half years. I have appreciated your concerns and your prayers in my behalf, and those prayers have had their intended effect. The cause of my absence from graduation in April was a series of blood clots that had broken loose and lodged in my lung. Those pulmonary embolisms, as they are called, can be life threatening, but because of the equipment that was installed in my body, I am probably a lesser blood-clot risk than most people seated in this audience. The other potentially life-threatening condition of which you are all aware is the cancer that I have had for several years and will have as long as I live. I can summarize that one best by saying that my cancer is probably better under control than at any time since we first discovered its existence. I have not been taking any medication for 15 months. During my most recent visit to my principal oncologist in July, the word that he used to describe his reaction was "ecstatic."<br><br>My other health concern is the one that poses no threat either to my life nor to any cognitive or other ability relevant to the performance of my presidential duties, but has affected me in some less important, though aggravating ways. It is a damage to the peripheral nerves in my legs and arms, and is therefore called peripheral neuropathy. The principal symptom, and one that you have probably noted, is that I have to walk with some deliberateness. My marathoning days are a thing of the past--and just at the time when I was considering challenging Ed Eyestone and training for the Olympics.<br><br>An Associated Press story of about two months ago, reporting that this neuropathy affected my cranial and central nervous system, is 180 degrees wrong. The cranial and central nervous systems are completely separate from the peripheral system and are therefore unaffected. As my neurologist told me, "The good news is there are no peripheral nerves in the brain." Any cerebral deficiencies that you note, therefore, are attributable to something other than the ailment that has ended my career as a long-distance runner.<br><br>The year 1992–93 had several highlights of historic proportion, including the adoption by our board of trustees, following months of faculty discussion, of several organic documents recommended by faculty committees that clarify and make explicit understandings that underlie our relationships with our university and our sponsoring Church. I am confident that we will benefit from the good-faith administration of these documents' governing principles, including jurisdictional distinctions that are now in place marking the boundaries between, on the one hand, matters appropriate for ecclesiastical attention and, on the other, those that should be handled through academic channels. The year has also seen some other important milestones. I will mention just three: (1) the completion of our new art museum, which will be a cultural gemstone not only for our university, but also for a much broader community. It will be dedicated this fall in time for its first exhibit consisting of the Vatican's Etruscan collection. (I find it deliciously ironic that the Vatican collection will be on display in our art museum at the very moment that, less than a half mile away, we are playing Notre Dame); (2) the board of trustees' approval of our testing the feasibility of a capital campaign that, if ultimately approved, would be the largest such campaign in our history; and (3) the beginnings of a major initiative that will enable our students to shorten their time to graduation--an initiative that I will discuss more fully later.<br><h2><b>Visions And Aspirations</b></h2><br>One of my most important opportunities at these annual university conferences is to share with you my vision of Brigham Young University, what we are, what we can become, and what we ought to be doing to take us there. Toward that end, I offer the following three thoughts:<br><br>1. First and foremost, we are committed to the ideal of the Church university--a place that combines faith in God with the pursuit of the highest in academic achievement. Those two, faith and academic achievement, are integral, inseparable parts of a single whole. Our integration of the two constitutes our unique contribution to the restored kingdom, and also our unique contribution to American higher education.<br><br>The theme of this fall conference, taken from section 11 of the Doctrine and Covenants, is instructive in this regard: "I will impart unto you of my<i>Spirit</i>, which shall enlighten your<i>mind</i>" (verse 13; emphasis added). The spirit and the mind: The two go together, inextricably linked, as confirmed by scripture and by more than a century of experience at this university.<br><br>I recognize that the almost universal experience of religious universities has been that, over time, they will abandon their spiritual component and concentrate solely on the academic. This reality serves only to strengthen our resolve that the same will not happen here.<br><br>The two structural protections that will best preserve our capacity to maintain our uniqueness in this respect are (a) a board of trustees composed of principally prophets, seers, and revelators and (b) a faculty composed dominantly of deeply committed members of the LDS Church. Our non-LDS faculty members add richness to our program and greater appreciation of its very uniqueness. We are grateful that they are our colleagues. But the overwhelming majority of our faculty always have been, are now, and always will be drawn from persons of unshakable faith in the reality of the Restoration and a desire and commitment to integrate that faith into our total university learning experience.<br><br>These two structural mainstays--a board of trustees composed principally of prophets, seers, and revelators, and a faculty composed principally of believing, practicing, devoted Church members--are key not only to our uniqueness, but also to our capacity to make unique contributions to the restored kingdom and to higher education. Departing from either of them would be the greatest mistake we could possibly make, and is something we will never do.<br><br>From time to time we hear statements to the effect, "BYU is going to have to decide what it really wants to be, a university or a seminary." Such a statement is borderline nonsense. The implication is that we must choose between the life of the mind and the life of the spirit, between faith and intellect, between what we can reason out for ourselves and what the Holy Ghost assures us is true.<br><br>That suggested dichotomy is not only a false one, but its underlying premise would deprive us of our uniqueness and our great strength. Our business is the business of learning. To paraphrase our commissioner, we have found a better way to do it, because of the companion processes by which learning can occur. And learning occurs most effectively when, to use Elder Maxwell's phrase, the scholarship of the spirit and the scholarship of the mind operate in tandem. It follows that when we emphasize the importance of solid, mainstream scholarship, both as a means of improving our teaching and also for other purposes, or when we stress the importance of building testimonies as part of our classroom efforts, neither should be taken as a signal that the other is unimportant, because for us, the mind and the spirit are integral, inseparable parts of a single whole, mutually supportive and indeed synergistic. It is wrong, therefore, to think that an emphasis on one de-emphasizes the other. They are part of the same reservoir, and adding more water raises the level of the entire lake, regardless of whether it enters from the north shore or the south shore. BYU is and will remain firmly committed to excellence in both scholarship and faith. We will neither offer, nor will we accept, trade-offs or apologies.<br><br>Over the past year, and particularly over this summer, there have been several comments about diversity at BYU. Beyond question, our diversity is not the same as other people's diversity. I am grateful to John Tanner for his insights concerning the relevance to our university of the phrase that appears on the great seal of the United States, and also on some of our coins, E Pluribus Unum. Literally, it means "out of the many, one." In several ways, that phrase describes us well. It is, if you will, the coin of our BYU realm. We are many, and yet out of our pluralness we are one in important respects, some of which are unique to us. We are one in the same sense that the Savior urged his disciples to be one on the eve of his crucifixion. We are one in our devotion to the Restoration and its positive effects on individual lives and to the need to understand and incorporate its principles as part of our total learning experience. Corollaries necessarily include acceptance of the importance of prophets, prophetic statements, and priesthood authority and a recognition that these have been restored. Beyond those common, shared, and accepted values, we are many and we are diverse: in our views about politics and government; in our academic and other professional backgrounds, training, and interests; in the ways we set about to achieve our shared views; and indeed in every way except those that tie back to restored truth. Viewed from the broader perspective of American higher education as a whole, the very fact that we are different from other schools in our common acceptance of religious values makes an important and unique contribution to the entirety of America's colleges and universities. And precisely because we are part of it, American higher education is more diverse. Ultimately, the cause of diversity is scarcely served by insisting that our diversity be the same as everyone else's diversity.<br><br>2. The fact that we are not just another university, but a unique one that focuses on the integration of the sacred and the secular, must always support and enhance our seriousness about academic excellence, reflected both in our teaching and also in our scholarship. Just as faith and study are, for us, inseparably linked, there is a similar tie between teaching and scholarship or creative work. The fact that we are very serious about the quality of our teaching and scholarship, and the interrelationships between the two, is reflected, among other things, by our new rank and promotion document and the work of our Faculty Council on Rank and Status. The charge given to us by President Kimball some 17 years ago to become an "educational Mount Everest" is our standard. It is a challenging and useful metaphor. An educational Mount Everest: It means that we must not simply set our sights high, but the highest. We must be not merely good, but the very best of which we are capable: the best scholars, the best teachers, the best citizens, and the best integrators of spiritual and intellectual scholarship.<br><br>Over the 21 years since I came to BYU as a full-time faculty member in 1972, we have made remarkable progress in scaling the heights implied by President Kimball's metaphor. Clearly we are not there yet. Our continuing progress as an institution consists of the combined efforts of each of us, and I am disappointed when I see evidence of effort that falls short of the capability of any individual or department or college. This is neither the place nor the time for anyone to put his or her productivity transmission into neutral and be content to coast or to attempt to read into anything that has been said or done by our board or our administration as any kind of a retreat from the standard stated by our beloved 12th prophet of this dispensation--to be not just good, but the best.<br><br>3. We are an integral part of our sponsoring Church, and our very reason for being is that as a high-quality university we can contribute to the building of the kingdom in ways that no other entity within the Church can do quite as well as we do. The most prominent example is our training of members and future leaders of the Church in an atmosphere of demanding academic requirements and great faith. But there are also more specific examples. Today I will mention just one, our opportunity to be part of the increasing internationalization of the Church. To date I believe we have only begun to scratch the surface of our opportunities in this respect. Examples of these opportunities abound. They include (a) merging the experience of our returned missionaries with our university language expertise, (b) training future missionaries and mission leaders, (c) developing the potential for Church leadership by having students from around the world obtain part of their education here and then return to their native countries, and (d) advancing the great variety of special projects that can best be provided by a university and that would be useful to the Church and useful to countries in which the Church is present.<br><br>Our opportunities to make a contribution beyond the shores of the United States and Canada constitute one of our great built-in comparative advantages. To date we have only begun to avail ourselves of that advantage. An important challenge is that many of our efforts in this respect will require significant additional funding. One of the seven priorities identified in our capital campaign is the furtherance of BYU's international mission. Should the board of trustees during the coming year authorize our proceeding with that campaign, which to date they have authorized us only to test, our ability to do more in capitalizing on a significant comparative advantage should be aided. But regardless of what happens with the capital campaign, we should pursue our international opportunities.<br><h2><b>Academic Freedom</b></h2><br>I said last year that members of our faculty enjoy a greater measure of academic freedom than they would at any other university. Because of several comments that have been made since that time, I would like to explain, briefly, why that is true.<br><br>It is important to note that the statement is necessarily built on the unassailable premise that people who come here do so conscious of our devotion to integrating our various academic disciplines with the principles of restored truth. For some people the opportunity to work, teach, research, and publish in that kind of environment is a positive attraction; for others it is not. For the great majority of us who are in fact here--indeed, theoretically for all--it is a plus. Otherwise, we would not have come.<br><br>Building on that premise, let me give you four hypothetical cases that bear out my conclusion that BYU faculty members enjoy a greater measure of academic freedom here than they would at any other university.<br><br><i>Hypothetical Case #1.</i>Professor Sandra Day Justice teaches constitutional law. She wants to incorporate into both her scholarly work and also her teaching her belief that the United States Constitution did not come into existence by pure chance--that God himself played a deliberate role in its establishment. This conviction is rooted in modern-day scripture, in which she believes. Both in her scholarly work and in her teaching, she wants to explore some of the objective indicia, scriptural and nonscriptural, that she believes support this view of divine constitutional origins and also some of its theoretical and practical consequences.<br><br><i>Hypothetical Case #2.</i>Professor Zoe Ology's teaching and research specialty is human anatomy. She is convinced that the human body is a divine creation and that many of its functions and characteristics can be better understood and appreciated once one accepts that premise. Indeed, without that premise there are some human physical characteristics that cannot be explained. She wants to build both her scholarship and also her teaching on the foundation of that belief.<br><br><i>Hypothetical Case #3.</i>Professor Cy Cology came to BYU with an already established reputation as one of the nation's finest social scientists. While here he developed and published concerning the effect that spirituality and communication with God have on human conduct. His thesis is that human behavior cannot be fully understood unless this spiritual component is taken into account. His work has resulted in several prominent national awards. He wants to be free to continue to incorporate this thesis into his teaching, his research, his publications, and his discussions with colleagues.<br><br><i>Hypothetical Case #4.</i>Professor Skelly Skeptic is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has reached the conclusion that the Book of Mormon is one of the most remarkable pieces of literature written in the 19th century, but that it is nothing more than remarkable literature. He is so convinced of the correctness of his position that he feels compelled so to instruct his students and to build his scholarly efforts around it.<br><br>Now, who has academic freedom and who does not? Two points to note. First, at least so far as the classroom is concerned, if the professor in either of the first two hypothetical cases were to teach what they want to teach at a state university, they would be in violation of federal and state law, including constitutional law. And even at private institutions all of the first three hypothetical professors would find the total academic environment ranging from hostility to ridicule to effective prohibition. Indeed, the third of our hypothetical professors has expressed the view that at any place other than BYU, he would have found it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue the work that has been so widely recognized by professional societies and others. As BYU professors, however, all three would be understood and encouraged, and if they do it well, according to our demanding standards, their work products, both in and out of the classroom, will be rewarded.<br><br>Our fourth hypothetical professor, by contrast, would not be allowed to pursue his interest as a BYU faculty member, and if he did so would be asked to leave.<br><br>Quite obviously, given their interests, the first three enjoy more academic freedom at BYU than at any other university. And their assumed interests are not unusual for our faculty. Across virtually all departments, examples can be found of people who want to explore, either through their teaching or their scholarship or both, the intersections and interrelationships that exist between their faith and their discipline. Here we are free to do that. Elsewhere we would not be. To be sure, the fourth hypothetical teacher-scholar is less free to pursue his interests here than he would be at any other institution. But there is a far greater likelihood that people who come here in the first place will bring with them interests more similar to the first three hypothetical cases than to the fourth.<br><br>And that brings me to my second point concerning academic freedom, as illustrated by these four hypothetical cases. The view held by our fourth example--the one who wants to teach and publish his view that the Book of Mormon is nothing more than 19th-century literature--can be developed virtually anywhere except at an institution sponsored by the LDS Church. For him, other universities provide an alternative forum where his view can be offered in the marketplace of ideas. Not so with the other three. BYU, with its two campuses, is the only university where they would be truly free to pursue their academic interest. Absent at BYU, there is no comparable forum for them. And this necessarily means that they would be less free.<br><br>I read with interest a recent letter to the<i>Daily Universe</i>editor from an English professor at Fort Hays State University in Kansas. She writes:<br><br><i>As a Mormon, I find it frustrating that I am unable to incorporate overtly the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ into literature and discussions within my classroom. My personal political stance, as well, must be kept confined to outside interest and involvement, and I have absolutely no doubt that if I were to place myself in a position of opposition to the environment in which I am employed, I would be terminated forthwith.</i><br><br><i>I suppose the grass truly does always seem greener on the other side of the hill. From where I stand, it's pretty green at BYU.</i>[August 11, 1993, p. 4]<br><br>An important element of our freedom as academics is the opportunity for candid discussion among ourselves. I have appreciated and learned from such discussions with you over the past year, some of them one-on-one and others in small or not-so-small groups. Almost without exception, these opportunities have helped to shape my thinking, and in some instances have effected changes not only in how I think, but also in what I advocate with others.<br><br>I will mention just one example. We need to be sensitive in our dealings with each other. Racially based or gender-based slurs, harassment, or discrimination of any kind are practices for whose eradication we must constantly and diligently strive. In our attitudes, in our speech, and in our conduct--whether related to hiring and promotion or the way we treat each other in and out of the classroom or the common courtesies required by decency, civility, and common sense--our efforts must be unflagging. The second great commandment, I submit, requires nothing less. I would hope that our Faculty Center--which has been so effective in so many respects--can help in this effort. Our Human Resources and academic vice presidents' offices can also play significant roles. But ultimately the responsibility is an individual one and must be individually assumed and addressed.<br><br>I would hope that our efforts would extend not only to ourselves and our colleagues but to our students as well. It is, I submit, part of their education and ours to learn to view all people--regardless of such invidious and irrelevant categorizations as race and sex--as our brothers and sisters. My experience teaches that the underlying stereotypes, ranging all the way from jokes to conduct, do not die easily. But I invite each of you to join with me in diligent effort to secure their demise.<br><br>It is not the place of any of us to question the decision of any other among us to enter the workforce. Those decisions are very personal, and the relevant considerations and circumstances will necessarily differ, often substantially, from person to person. Our responsibility, therefore, is to assume that once the decision has been made, it has taken into account all relevant considerations, including advice from the Brethren, and is not ours to second-guess.<br><h2><b>Improving our Graduation Time</b></h2><br>I am excited about the coming school year and would like to discuss with you next our efforts to shorten our matriculation time leading to graduation. I consider it our number one priority--at least for the coming year, and perhaps beyond. If our efforts are successful, the rewards will include the improved quality of our total undergraduate program; significant financial and other benefits to our students as we move up the time they enter their chosen professions and settle into permanent, lifetime circumstances; and an increase in the number of students who can profit from a BYU education without changing our 27,000-student enrollment limit. I can think of no other initiative that, if successful, can do quite as much good for as many people, all of whom are very important to us.<br><br>To date we have identified slightly over a dozen ideas and specific proposals for change. A few of them focus on changes in what our students do, but the substantial majority must be implemented by us, because most of the impediments to timely graduation are of our making, and not of our students'.<br><br>I will not at this time detail all of our proposals and ideas, but let me briefly review some of the most prominent:<br><br>1. An associate degree from a feeder school with whom we have a consortium agreement will satisfy lower-division general education requirements, with the exception of the math/language and advanced writing composition requirements. We have now had enough experience with this issue that we believe we can achieve our quality objectives by carefully working out the consortium agreements. This reform is already in place at Ricks College and will be soon in other two-year colleges.<br><br>2. Mandatory advisement concerning graduation, including the filing of graduation plans, will be required at several key points for all students--particularly for students with excessive hours or students not making satisfactory progress toward graduation in either general education or major requirements.<br><br>3. The curriculum committee and our new dean of General and Honors Education will be reexamining our general education requirements.<br><br>4. We need to increase the sections offered in bottleneck courses--especially during the spring and summer terms. Advanced composition and freshman English are examples, but there are others.<br><br>5. We are asking every academic program to limit its major requirement to 60 hours or bear the heavy burden of showing that there is a compelling reason for an exception. We will not discourage--indeed we will applaud--reductions in those that presently require fewer than 60 hours, so long as those reductions can be accomplished consistent with maintaining quality. We fully realize these decisions will be painful and difficult, and in those instances where a truly compelling case can be made for major requirements in excess of 60 hours, some exceptions may be allowed. And in some of those cases (of which I anticipate there will be few), we will have to give serious consideration to designating them officially as five-year programs and get us out of the business of fraud. But I repeat: Our objective is not to create more five-year programs, nor to find exceptions. Accordingly, the case to be made for majors that continue to require in excess of 60 hours will have to be truly compelling.<br><br>We must not, and will not, sacrifice legitimate quality considerations on the altar of efficiency. We are not trying to create a cheaper degree--only a more efficient one that will better serve the interests of our students and the university. I hope we will not make automatic assumptions that requirements now in place necessarily have quality implications simply because they are now in place. Indeed, the major requirements in many of our strongest departments are far short of the 60-hour benchmark.<br><br>There is a general growing national awareness that length of time in school is not synonymous with high quality. Among the criteria taken into account by those who rank universities are the length of time required to graduate and the percentage of entering students who ultimately obtain degrees. Both of those will be affected by our total hourly requirements. Some of the schools whose graduation times are the shortest are those frequently regarded as among the best. Indeed, Gerhard Casper, the new president of Stanford, has even gone so far as to call for consideration of a possible three-year baccalaureate program. We do not anticipate going that far; for the near term, I would like to shorten the distance between what we call a four-year degree and the six years it takes to get that degree. Martin Kramer, editor in chief of<i>New Directions for Higher Education,</i>is very blunt on this issue. He says, "Lengthening of time-to-degree is, in short, an indicator of unresponsiveness as well as inefficiency."<br><br>The principal beneficiaries of this reform will be our students, both those we now serve and the increased numbers we will be able to serve. Mr. Kramer further observes that "the opportunity costs of going to college are increased alarmingly by a lengthening of time-to-degree" because of the reduced earning capacity for every year that entry into the adult labor market is postponed and because of reduction in the number of years of peak earnings later in life. I also believe that the quality of our students' experience during their four undergraduate years will be enhanced because of increased opportunity to take courses outside their major. Regrettably, in some majors we have virtually eliminated any meaningful opportunity for our students to take elective courses.<br><br>Necessarily unacceptable will be the simple assertion that our course requirements must expand because the body of available knowledge has also expanded. I use as my example in this respect the study of constitutional law. Over the 30 years since I graduated from law school, the United States Supreme Court's activity in deciding constitutional cases has greatly exceeded that of any comparable preceding period in its history. As a consequence, the presently existing body of constitutional law is at least 10 times as large as when I was in law school; yet our law schools very properly devote about the same number of teaching hours to that subject today as they did 30 years ago. Most of you are aware of comparable circumstances in your own fields. If we simply expanded what we teach commensurate with our expanded body of knowledge, in some disciplines people would never graduate.<br><br>Please do not put off, even until next month, the examination of your major requirements under the guidelines outlined. It would be very easy for every department to assume that critical examination of major hour requirements is important for other people. A few of you have already heard my story of my grandfather, to whom I was very close. Though he lacked education beyond high school, his understanding of economics was rather sophisticated, and he was a staunch advocate of free trade. We were in the sawmill business, and he stated with great eloquence why the United States should abandon tariffs on everything except those on lumber from Canada and Mexico. We simply cannot ask our students to make the hard choices I will review in a moment if we are not also willing to make similarly hard choices.<br><br>Let me share with you why this is such an urgent matter and why we have no option other than to deal with it decisively and without delay. Our graduation rates over the past seven years have experienced a slight but rather consistent increase. And yet, over that same period, the number of new entering students, freshmen and transfers, has also seen a slight but steady decline. How can this be? If more are leaving, shouldn't we be able to admit more? The answer is found in the increasing number of continuing students. There are two basic reasons for this increase in our continuing student population. First, more students, especially women, are persisting to graduation, rather than discontinuing their education prior to obtaining a degree. Obviously, that is a trend we do not want to change. Indeed, given the caliber of students now entering BYU, we anticipate that the numbers who stay the course until graduation will continue to increase. But the other factor influencing the number of continuing students is the one we have been discussing; those who are persisting to graduation are taking an average of 11.9 semesters, or almost six years to obtain what we euphemistically refer to as a four-year degree.<br><br>According to our best projections, unless we take some positive action to change these circumstances, the total number of new students admitted will continue to decrease at least until the fall of 1997. Moreover, the fall of 1997 is about the time that our probable admission applicant pool will reach an all-time high, with an increase of around 30 percent over that population as it stands today. Obviously, something has to be done. The prospect of further substantial reductions in our entering students in the face of greatly increasing numbers of highly qualified applicants is, to put it bluntly, unacceptable. We have no choice but to face this one head-on. It is not something that would just be nice to do. It is something we must do. It is a task that we all share. Each must make a contribution.<br><br>6. Over the coming year, we will give serious consideration to the general principle that the number of fall and winter semesters that each student is entitled to consume at our highly subsidized tuition levels may be limited--probably to 10 semesters, but perhaps to some other fixed number. Once that ceiling is reached, the tuition for future fall and winter semesters would increase--perhaps significantly. Tuition for courses taken during the spring and summer would not be affected. We obviously need to explore together and with our students over the coming school year the ramifications of this general principle before defining and adopting it. Among them are: By how much should the subsidy be reduced, once the 10 fall-and-winter–semester level has been reached? How should it be prorated for students admitted prior to implementation of the subsidy cap? Should there be any exceptions? And, if so, what kinds of procedures should be in place to deal with the exceptions? What should be the rule for the true five-year programs? In the coming months we will seek your counsel and that of our students in response to these and related questions. The general principle is a sound one, we believe, and is worth our serious consideration.<br><br>7. Beginning with the 1994–95 school year, we have also proposed a substantially lower tuition for spring and summer than for fall or winter. You will note a common thread running through several of these proposals: it is an effort to shift more registrations from fall and winter to spring and summer. The tuition differential that we anticipate would be rather substantial, in order to provide a real incentive. Once again, there are details to be resolved over the coming year, most prominent of which is how large the differential should be.<br><br>Another benefit I see emerging from this time-to-graduate initiative--and a very important one--is that the process of dealing with these issues will have a unifying effect as we combine our efforts toward a common goal that holds so much promise of benefit for our students, for those who would like to be our students, and for the quality of our educational offering.<br><br>There are also other things that unify us. Probably the most important is the love that we have for our university. It is, in the words of our school song, "the college that we love." Just yesterday I received a response to our annual giving campaign from a man who had enclosed a $15 check and written on the card: "92 years of age--budget low. But love my BYU." I have sensed this love among all of you. And I share it. I love what BYU did for me as a student. I love the freedom I enjoy here to think, to say, to write, and to act consistently with my conviction of the reality of the Restoration, with my professional interests, and with the relationships that exist between the two. I love my association with valued colleagues and the strength I draw--including physical strength--from you prayers, your encouragement, and your support. Over the past year perhaps more than at any other time I have understood and appreciated that while we are many, we are also one. E pluribus unum. De los muchos, somos uno. Across all languages, from Latin to English to Spanish to anything else, the meaning is the same. And because of our manyness and our oneness, we can do it. We can make it work. We<i>will</i>make it work. We have found a better way to do the business of a university. Here on these 640 acres, faith and intellect will work together, not just as partners, but as integral, inseparable parts of single whole. The two are one.<br><br>In conclusion, I return briefly to our theme scripture, one of whose central focuses is on light, as Bruce Hafen has reminded us with his insightful thoughts developed from the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Many scriptures refer to light, and in several contexts. Our theme scripture emphasizes the unifying effect that light can have on the spirit and the mind. Paul used the metaphor of a light on a hill. One of my favorite lines from a song sung by our Young Ambassadors seems appropriate here: "Can you feel us shine on a distant hill?" may we, in our oneness, continue to shine; may we truly be a light on a hill. And may we make it not so distant. That we may so shine and that it may be not just a hill, but a Mount Everest, is my prayer n the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Rex E.

<h1>ng Toward Excellence - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to briefly address one separate important matter: our Code of Honor and our Dress and Grooming Standards. As an increasingly smaller percentage of Church members get the opportunity to study at BYU, there seems to be ever less justification for students to come here who violate basic principles of honesty or who deliberately break agreements they have made to gain admission. I am pleased with recent reports that serious Honor Code violations by freshmen seem to be diminishing. But casual observation would not make me quite so optimistic about dress standards. I do not wish to equate the two in seriousness, but I am concerned that students willingly sign their names to a document and then casually break their word. Evidence strongly suggests that faculty exercise a very powerful influence in assisting students to recognize their responsibility in these areas. I urge you to make known your support of our policies.<br><br>One year ago I talked with you about some of the matters that I considered most important for the continuing development of excellence at BYU. I mentioned, among other things, the increasing challenges we have in admissions, in library development, and in scholarship allocation. I also discussed some of our many advantages--a solid, dependable financial base, an increasingly capable student body, a high level of faculty scholarship and teaching, and a well-kept physical plant. I ended with a list of wishes that I had for the institution.<br><br>Today I would like to continue that discussion and give my evaluation of certain aspects of our current situation. I will refer on occasion to last year's wish list as I try to give you some sense of my perspective on the university.<br><br>You have already heard reports on some of our programs. I commend those who are working on the challenges of admissions and the freshman year, and I agree with Dean Fuhriman and Gary Hooper on the importance of excellence in our graduate programs and in our scholarly and creative efforts.<br><br>As I begin my remarks, I would like to make one or two general comments about the matter of quality in university education. A number of years ago, while serving as a dean, I wrote a talk that I called "Living Without Models" (by this I meant external models). I argued there that, although we have a great deal to learn from other institutions of higher education, there is no single university that provides us a very good example of what we should be striving to become. I still believe that this is the case. In addition to the obvious, critical, and fundamental relationship that we have with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we differ from other institutions in many other respects. We are very large, we have excellent internal research and library support, we are becoming very selective in our admissions, our faculty have been educated in the finest universities, we have a national (even international) student body, our faculty publication record is very good and in some instances excellent or superior, some of our programs are recognized as leaders in the nation or the world, and we offer education in a vast range of areas. At the same time, unlike most major universities, we have an overwhelmingly undergraduate enrollment--some 28,000 of our 27,000 students are undergraduates--and of our postbaccalaureate students, a large percentage are in professional programs. Our level of external research support (though growing) is modest, and our student-faculty ratio is quite high. What I am saying is that we are unique. If we are going to be excellent, it will have to be in terms that account for what we are striving to be--not necessarily according to measures that apply to all others.<br><br>I have been thinking about this issue in relation to the criteria that are listed in the most widely cited published ranking of American colleges and universities--that of<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>. If one looks at this magazine's criteria for evaluating undergraduate universities, it becomes immediately apparent that there are areas in which BYU will never look particularly good. For example, the financial criteria are so constructed that funding used for supporting programs other than undergraduate studies really gets entered into the mix. And for this rating scheme, the more that is spent per student, the better. Likewise, we are not likely to ever have as low a student-faculty ratio as those institutions that can include large numbers of research specialists in their overall faculty count. On the other hand, our entering student ACT scores and grades look very good, as do other measures. I mention these specific ranking elements only because I wish to show that it is very difficult to find external measurements that are particularly helpful when applied to us in some generic fashion. Even graduation rates, which I do find rather instructive, must be evaluated within that context of our particular situation. We know, for example, that marriage is a much larger factor in our time-to-graduation and graduation rates than at other institutions.<br><br>Thus I would like to propose using our own criteria as we think of the excellence that we would try to achieve. These, of course, are partly implicit in our history and our relationship with the Church. If we do not follow our mission statement in bringing our students to stronger testimonies of Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, we are clearly missing an essential aspect of the excellence that we seek. Likewise, if we were to abandon our long-standing commitment to strong general or university education, we would be leaving the firm foundation built by our dedicated predecessors.<br><br>But still other criteria of excellence need to be established or reinforced through discussion and mutual understanding. Thus the measures of excellence that I will now propose are incomplete and personal; they are meant primarily to continue our discussion. However, because we need some scales against which to compare our day-to-day actions and activities, they are guides to me as we continue to refine our vision of the BYU of the future.<br><br>The first general criterion of excellence that I would propose, but one that is notoriously difficult to measure, is the value that we add to our students' education. Because we are admitting students with extraordinary abilities, we will no doubt graduate many who will win major fellowships, gain admission to outstanding graduate schools, and eventually make many important contributions. What we need to assure is that we have built significantly upon the natural capacities with which these students are endowed. Our accrediting association is focusing on so-called "outcomes assessment," and as we prepare for reaccreditation, we will certainly need to learn how to more accurately measure what we have added in knowledge, skills, attitudes, and awareness. But for now I simply propose that for us to become more excellent we need to concentrate many of our efforts on making sure that students bear away profound growth as a result of their time here. As I discuss some of our present initiatives, I will mention several efforts that are focused on increasing the value that we add.<br><br>A second general criterion of excellence that I would propose is a faculty who have demonstrable intellectual capacities, who have a profound understanding of the scholarly process, who have strong faith, and who are deeply involved in and committed to the business--especially the academic substance--of the university.<br><br>One of our colleagues once used the term "lunch pail" faculty to describe those with a complacent attitude toward the academic enterprise. These are those who think of the university as a job: they come to work, do the minimum in the classroom and office, and leave as soon as the whistle blows. What this criterion of excellence would describe is faculty members who go to the laboratory or library not because that is their assignment, but because they are so intrigued with the matter they are studying that they would find it difficult to stay away. These teachers don't have to be reminded to keep office hours because they are so concerned about their students' learning that they would be disappointed if many were not at their doors asking for further insight and guidance. Their committee work is exceptional because they do not question the importance of the matters they have been asked to study or of the problems that they are asked to solve.<br><br>A third general criterion by which I would measure our quality is the level of financial and material commitment that the university makes toward enhancing the academic programs and environment of the institution. This criterion would include ongoing support of the libraries and laboratories, travel funding and supplies, upkeep and enhancement of the physical plant, computer and technological support, provision of research time and assistants, development of faculty and administrators, evaluation and support of innovative teaching, funding and development of teaching and lab assistants, etc.<br><br>An excellent BYU must be looking for ways to effectively employ its resources in support of superior work in scholarly activity and in the classroom. (As I mentioned a year ago, there are certainly areas in which we need additional resources, but when I see the situation at our fellow institutions, I become increasingly grateful for the careful but substantial way in which we are growing while others are cutting back, sometimes drastically.) What I consider a mark of excellence is<i>how</i>our resources are employed. And because our resources come overwhelmingly from the tithes of the Church, there is another subcriterion that I would mention--that we use the resources dedicated to students to educate as many of them as possible.<br><br>Before I discuss a few issues that relate to these three general academic criteria, I would acknowledge that there are many others. Moreover, criteria of excellence exist in the areas of student life, advancement, and administration, and the institution cannot be genuinely good if these are not developed. I am aware that to separate these areas from the academic is very arbitrary. Students who do not receive superior emotional and social support will also struggle in the classroom. Much of our hope for improvement in specific areas, including especially the library, depends on the efforts of our colleagues in development. And housing, building, purchasing, and financial services are absolutely critical to our enterprise. But because our assignments are in the academic area, I will concentrate the remainder of my remarks on our steps toward excellence in the areas I have mentioned.<br><br>First to several matters relating to our students and the value we are adding to their lives. As Larry Wimmer has mentioned, early data indicate that fewer new freshmen are getting into academic difficulty than before, but the number is still too high. Moreover, it appears that part of the delay in students' graduation can be attributed to the fact that much credit earned in the freshman year is either repeated or does not contribute toward filling requirements. Under the direction of Student Life and the college advisement centers, among others, we have been doing an increasingly good job with freshman orientation. As Alan Keele has just reported, we are undertaking serious efforts to improve many aspects of our students' initial contact with the university. As the committee on the freshman year continues its efforts and as programs like SHINE are developed, we will bring a number of proposals to your deans, the Faculty Advisory Council, and elsewhere for discussion. My first wish last year was that we could find ways to help freshmen and other struggling students. We have a good distance to go, but I think that we have made some fine progress in this area.<br><br>I mentioned that the<i>U.S. News</i>ranking criterion on graduation rates cannot be used without qualification at BYU. No other university needs to add in time for missions for most of its men students and an increasingly high number of women students. But even when we account for missionary service, our graduation rates do not compare favorably with those of the universities who are rated high on that list. Among the<i>U.S. News</i>top 25, the average institution graduates 85 percent of its entering freshmen within five years. The rates that we have recently published for student information, even when accounting for missionary service and when extended to six years, reach only 48 percent.<br><br>I believe that we must make it a goal to help a much larger number of our excellent students achieve graduation. In order to do this, of course, a number of things must change. Most important will be a clearly articulated understanding between the university and its students that those who enter here come with the intention of graduating from excellent programs.<br><br>President Lee has summarized a number of our efforts to increase the speed (and percentage) of graduation. I repeat a few of them. We have confronted both student-and university-caused delays. For the students, we have provided spring and summer scholarships that are aimed specifically at helping students graduate sooner. (We have also offered a richer spring and summer curriculum than has been available in the past.) We have also changed the number of hours required to keep scholarships from 12 to 14. We have adjusted the priority registration system to assure that advanced students are able to get into courses they need to graduate. We have instituted mandatory advisement for students with excessive hours who have not applied for graduation. As President Lee mentioned, we are also considering financial incentives to increase average credit-hour enrollment, including the reinstitution of some kind of advanced-standing tuition. We want to be especially careful not to increase the burdens of those students who have to work while they are in school, but we feel that we can find some way to deal with the tendency of some students to take extremely light loads. We have also provided new pie charts in the BYU General Catalog so that students can more clearly evaluate the majors they are considering.<br><br>Many of you have been involved in the reviews undertaken by the curriculum committee of those majors that exceed our university limit by five credit hours or more. A good deal of passion has been aroused by these reviews, so I do not expect that I can persuade the unconverted in a couple of minutes. It is clear that as President Kimball said in his Second Century Address: "We do not want BYU ever to become an educational factory." Graduating more students from poorer programs would be a travesty. But more is not necessarily better when it comes to requirements in major programs. A random but careful review of many programs at other excellent universities has convinced me that it is not necessary to teach everything to offer a very fine bachelor's degree.<br><br>Dean William Evenson has written what I consider to be a very persuasive memo to his department chairs on this matter. I wish that I could share it with you in its entirety, but I would like to at least list his four main points:<br><br>1. The principles upon which we must organize our curricula are<i>coherence, economy</i>, and<i>currency</i>.<br><br>2. Our undergraduate degrees must all be honest four-year degrees.<br><br>3. Our level of expectation in individual courses and our credit-hour assignments must be honestly consistent with the university guideline: "The expectation for undergraduate courses is three hours of work per week per credit hour for the average student who is appropriately prepared."<br><br>4. It is essential that each department engage in broad discussion of what really matters in the undergraduate curriculum.<br><br>To me these points seem convincing. They argue that we strengthen, not weaken, our undergraduate degree programs by making them lean and carefully organized.<br><br>We have also asked the Council on the Baccalaureate to look at our limited-enrollment majors. There are, as you know, a number or reasons why enrollment needs to be controlled in certain programs--limited facilities, licensing requirements, etc. But unilateral or arbitrary limitations can cause unplanned shifts of university resources and increase delays in graduation for students.<br><br>One of the figures that we look at when we are trying to evaluate resource allocation is the total cost per student credit hour in any department or program. This figure, like all others, is not dependable by itself. It is arrived at by dividing the department's total budget by the number of student credit hours that are produced by that unit. Because some departments teach lab courses whereas others use student instructors, no one-to-one comparison is entirely helpful. But we are able to make some general comparisons, and one thing is very clear: with extremely few exceptions, those programs with limited enrollments are the most costly in the university.<br><br>It is easy to understand why: Limits are often set low enough that the department's or program's faculty teach fewer students than the average faculty member at the university. (It is also noteworthy that few of the limited-enrollment programs teach many service or general education courses.) Thus a department keeps a greater portion of university resources than it would earn if they were distributed simply on a per-student-credit-hour basis. Additionally, many students delay graduation for several semesters while they attempt to gain admission into limited-enrollment majors.<br><br>As I mentioned, we have no intention of eliminating all such programs. But it is important for us to have a rational basis on which to decide which programs need to be limited, where the limits are best set, and whether the means of limitation--grades, prerequisites, etc.--are the best that we can find. Someone pays when programs limit the number of students they teach, and we want to know that our resources are being used the best way possible.<br><br>We are also undertaking several other reviews that relate to time-to-graduation. These include our transfer policies, university and general education requirements, and even the total number of hours that are required for a degree. We hope that at the end of this process more students will receive better degrees in less time. This would result in an increase in quality both in terms of value added for the students and in terms of excellent management of university resources.<br><br>Of all the university resources that we have (I'm shifting criteria here), none is remotely as valuable (or as costly) as faculty capacity and faculty time. During the past months we have analyzed faculty effort in teaching and research, and several excellent reports on these matters have been produced. I would like to share a bit of this information with you.<br><br>We have made a very careful study of faculty teaching assignments. The data from this study can be compared reasonably accurately with those from other institutions, although reporting of faculty time use is notoriously fanciful. In 1992 the average teaching assignment for BYU teachers was 7.1 credit hours per semester, This figure includes those who have administrative and other assignments and is for that reason somewhat lower than if we didn't include deans, chairs, etc. Teaching assignment averages vary from department to department; some departments are considerably higher than average, and some are a bit lower. Recently our average assignment has been quite stable, although it has fallen slightly during the past five years. The decline of hours taught is quite dramatic when compared to earlier times.<br><br>Our figures show that our assignments are quite similar to those at other institutions. Professors at research universities teach somewhat less than we do, as do those at private doctoral institutions. Public doctoral universities, comprehensive universities, and liberal arts colleges have higher teaching assignments than we do. On average, we think that our teaching assignments are about right. This is especially the case when we consider the fact that because of larger class sizes and other factors, student credit hours produced by the faculty have remained quite consistent over the past two decades.<br><br>As mentioned, the figure that I gave is an average. Clearly, some departments and some individuals need to teach less, and some likely need to teach more. But the average faculty member, though clearly busy, should have sufficient time for excellent preparation, good consultation, fine scholarly development, and conscientious participation in university matters.<br><br>I would like to repeat one matter about faculty resources: We do have a rather high student-faculty ratio, and we hope to improve this where possible. But teaching assignments, internal research and technology support, facilities, travel funding, and other measures of support are very good. There is no reason that we should not expect excellent performance at all levels. We can support excellent faculty and should expect no less.<br><br>It is also important for you to know that the university is working on a set of new methods for controlling and evaluating external research funding, as well as of using indirect cost support. We have worked very hard to think of ways to provide more accurate measures in these matters. We believe that you will be pleased with the results of these efforts. They should help us keep our excellent scholarly work moving forward while helping us to strengthen our teaching.<br><br>Before I proceed with other resource matters, I would like to briefly mention one related item. Recently BYU joined with a number of other institutions in a major national study that evaluated the efficiency of a large variety of support functions at these universities. The results of this study are enormously pleasing. We are national leaders in so many areas that it is safe to claim that few, if any, universities are as efficient and effective in their support systems.<br><br>I mentioned earlier that in most support resources we are well served. I am pleased that we have been able to increase internal research support each year and that this year we were able to redistribute several hundred thousand dollars to help with additional sections of oversubscribed classes, adding teaching assistants and readers for large general education courses and offering additional spring and summer courses.<br><br>One of the areas that has received continuous high-level support during several administrations is our libraries. The support of the Lee Library's collection development program has brought us to the point of needing to expand the current building. After the Benson Science Building is completed and we have renovated the Eyring Science Center, we hope to break ground for an underground library addition to be located north of the current structure. The new facility will add up to 300,000 square feet to the 430,000 now in service, and we will simultaneously expand the Clark Law Library. The university has committed to make the library additions the top priority in its development plans until all necessary funds are in place.<br><br>During the last year the library administration and staff have worked with faculty units across campus to evaluate and rank in order of importance the collection of professional journals and other relevant serials. In every case the faculty has participated willingly and energetically, and we are pleased to announce that the original target of reducing our serials budget by $200,000 has been met. During spring and summer terms the library staff has conducted cross-disciplinary reviews of journals that have been targeted for cancellation to ensure that no faculty member will be deprived of a journal that is essential to her or his research or teaching assignment. Unfortunately, inflation in prices of journals and books far outstrips increases in the Consumer Price Index and in allocated monies for the library. The $200,000 savings will probably be consumed within the next year or two simply because of these increases. This circumstance requires that we think seriously about how to manage our collections, how to share materials with other institutions, and even how we will need to rethink our avenues of scholarly communication in the future.<br><br>Although most people recognize that an excellent university relies on an outstanding library, many are not aware of the immense investment required just to maintain current levels of service. This situation is not unique to BYU; all major university libraries across the country are facing severe crises that may affect the way knowledge is being stored and shared in this country. We are proud of the fact that during the last 10 years the BYU libraries have enjoyed general financial support. Increases in appropriated funds have generally kept pace with the Consumer Price Index, and supplemental funding has helped compensate for the escalating costs in serials and monographs. Still, we worry that such a large percentage of the library's collection development budget must be supported through supplemental funding and are concerned about the impact on the library's programs should the supplemental funds not be available, even for one year. An ad hoc committee composed of the library director and representatives from the faculty and administration is meeting to find solutions to some of these long-term challenges.<br><br>We are excited about the new databases and other technologies now available in our library that help to make student and faculty research more thorough. At the same time, we are aware that many faculty members and students do not understand how to take advantage of these resources, nor do they fully comprehend their relationship to the card catalog. Additionally, a recent survey conducted by the Faculty Library Council showed that most departments on campus feel their majors need instruction in library use and research methodology beyond what they receive in GE courses; yet a few departments have programs in place to provide the necessary instruction. We strongly encourage departments to meet with their library subject specialist to determine ways to make sure that students of every discipline understand how to take advantage of our growing library collection and how to apply those materials to their studies. We encourage all faculty to take advantage of the superb resources our libraries provide them and their students.<br><br>As we consider the fact that only a tiny portion of Church members can study here, we have been asking ourselves how we might expand our influence without diminishing the excellence that we seek. During the past two years, a university committee has studied the use of telecommunications to extend the educational reach of BYU by teaching members of the Church who do not have access to the university. The idea is to apply modern communications technology--the satellite, the video disc, audio or videocassettes or CDs, electronic mail, computer and modem, or other media--to teach learners at a distance from our Provo campus.<br><br>Within the last few months, the committee issued a report that surveyed technology, considered possible courses, and assessed needs of learners. One of these options, instruction in English as a second language [for nonnative speakers of English] and the teaching of English as a second language [for teachers of English for speakers of other languages], is now under development by the Linguistics Department as a service to Church members who do not speak English. Our hope is to reach out to Church members within and beyond the United States in ways that increase their participation in and sense of community with the Church and to help them build a base for future educational growth.<br><br>We approach this and similar projects with great excitement and great caution. We want to expand the university's reach where such efforts are clearly the university's business. But because these endeavors are costly and can divert university resources and attention from our central mission, we will engage in them only when we and others will be strengthened by the effort.<br><br>Last year I expressed the wish that we would take seriously our responsibility to prepare teachers for the schools. I mentioned that we needed to think of this preparation as a duty that extends far beyond the College of Education. If the efforts of which I have been informed are any indication, we have made real beginnings toward fruitful cooperation during the past months. I have been especially pleased with cooperative efforts in the preparation of science teachers that involve members of several departments in at least three colleges. Such cooperation raises the hope that we will give up some of the territorial claims that sometimes plague us and think about how we can provide the nation with a corps of teachers who master both their subject matter and the methods of conveying it. Such a group of teachers, it seems to me, can extend the strengths of this university as well as anything else we can do. Although the job market for teachers appears to be temporarily depressed, there will never be a time when the need for quality educators will diminish. I hope that we can continue in our efforts to make preparing excellent teachers a task for the whole university.<br><br>Another area in which I believe we must continue to develop excellence, one mentioned by President Lee, is in the contributions we make in the international realm. Here our efforts may well be very diverse. In addition to such obvious areas of language study, international relations, development studies, and international business, to name but a few, we can expect that experts in almost all disciplines might participate in international meetings, assist scholars in other nations, consult with governmental officials, etc. Some guidelines for BYU participation in Church international efforts are currently being developed. At least two principles seem evident even at this early point: first, that the contributions that we can make will be directly proportionate to the excellence of our faculty and programs, and second, that the university should be involved only when that involvement strengthens us as an institution. Within these and other guidelines, however, I believe that we will play an increasingly important role in the international arena.<br><br>I hope that I have conveyed my strong general sense of optimism about the university becoming a more excellent place. Both in comparison to the criteria with which I would measure excellence and to the wishes that I expressed last year, we have continued to improve. But there is one area that disturbs me considerably, and this is how we treat another. Both President Lee and Provost Hafen have expressed their desire that our women colleagues could have more sensitive response from us and our students, and I agree with them. Too often even those of us whose will is good do not understand when we injure or offend.<br><br>But my concern extends even further: I am troubled how far a few of us have drifted from even the most fundamental ideals of comity and civility that were traditionally thought to form the basis of any intellectual community. Too often during the past year we have seen instances where individuals have been the objects of the most personal and malicious attacks. And these attacks have not come from those on only one side of issues. Some of the most judgmental and abusive remarks have come from some who feel that they are defending the university or the Church. But neither have our critics felt any compulsion to stay with issues. Bitter, personal assaults have become too common an occurrence.<br><br>Such behavior is particularly painful at this university, where we would hope that shared Christian ideals would help us deal even with difficult topics and impassioned disagreements in an attitude of mutual respect and concern. But this has been too little the case.<br><br>I realize that comments such as these usually have very small effect. When I was first dean of humanities I made a similar statement to colleagues there. Later that same day, I received a call that commended me on my appeal for Christian behavior and then went on to attack a number of colleagues for not being true Christians. It was clear that the point was missed entirely. Nonetheless, I repeat my entreaty: Please let our speech be guided by the highest concern for each other.<br><br>Another variation of this concern is my hope that we can learn to be disagreed with. We need to comprehend that those who hold contrary opinions not only may be sincere but may actually be right. And even when we continue in the view that our perceptions are correct, we should be able to deal graciously with the views of others. It is always pathetic when losers in elections feel obligated to try to subvert what clearly is the best judgment of the majority. For some reason it has become popular for those whose ideals do not dominate to complain that others are not listening to them. I will readily admit that lack of listening is a problem, but quite often the term<i>listening</i>is substituted for the word<i>agreeing</i>. It seems hard for us to comprehend that someone could actually listen to us without accepting our view. But it does happen. Sometimes bright, honest, caring people just don't agree with us, and we need to learn to accept that possibility.<br><br>I have been troubled about how to communicate in conditions where disagreement is difficult. It is very hard to express any opinion when perceptions distort what has been said. Let me attempt to give an example: During the past year, two graduate students provided us with a very careful study of senior faculty members, produced under the direction of a specialist in organizational culture. It was clear that many of these faculty, most of whom were responsible for building BYU into a major university, feel that we have somehow lost track of the institution they were building--one that placed almost exclusive emphasis on teaching--and that we instead have slipped into the pattern of the research university, a pattern that in the views of many of them has been thoroughly and accurately discredited by innumerable studies and exposés in recent years.<br><br>But equally strong are the feelings of others who worry that the present administration is backing away from a vision of greatness that was most clearly summarized in President Kimball's metaphor of an educational Mount Everest. These highly creative faculty often wonder what is implied when we use the terms<i>undergraduate institution</i>or<i>teaching university</i>.<br><br>Both of these groups feel deeply about their perceptions, and among them, many will discuss their views with care. But if the climate of our discourse moves to a point where honest agreement is no longer possible, straightforward discussion is terribly difficult. If we call for excellent faculty learning and scholarship, some hear, "Don't worry about teaching." If we talk about more careful measurement of teaching in reviews and evaluations, some hear, "Scholarship is being abandoned." When we talk of spiritual values, the image of a big seminary is evoked for some, and when we talk of academic excellence, some feel that we've forsaken our religious roots.<br><br>Such a situation undermines statements of values. Nonetheless, I will hazard some: We should provide our students with excellent teaching and strong programs. To do this, and to fulfill our obligation to the world of ideas, we should expect learning, creativity, and scholarship from all faculty. We need to strengthen our ties to the gospel of Jesus Christ while we improve the university by every legitimate academic measure.<br><br>What I am trying to say is this: We need to become better in every area that defines a great Church or university; but to do so we cannot continue to have some who insist that every variation from their own views is a capitulation to the forces of mediocrity, elitism, or the devil. We need to face disagreement with civility and goodwill.<br><br>I would like to end by affirming my love for Brigham Young University and for those of you who make it what it is. After wandering the campus for many autumns--starting when I was at BY Training School--I still feel a great deal of excitement when I see these outstanding students return to us. I feel certain now, more than ever, that this university has important missions, some of which are greater than we can possibly imagine. I pray that we can be prepared for them and worthy of the Lord's care and blessings.<br><br><i>Todd A.

<h1>e and Keep a Mentor - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Such a fall faculty meeting as this brings back pleasant memories of the excitement, laced with a little apprehension, of being a fresh faculty recruit. My heart goes out to the nearly 100 newcomers, with some sympathy for your mild anxiety, but far more with an enthusiastic welcome. We are delighted by your choice to join us.<br><br>This university has a formal system to assure that you will have at least one mentor. But if you reflect on your lifetime in education, those mentors with the greatest impact on your growth seemed more to have been in that relationship with you by choice than by assignment. And, at least for most of us, there is a feeling of warmth that comes from simply remembering the experience of being guided by such a master. I don't have the data to test it, but my hunch is that those of us who have chosen a university faculty career have had more in quality and quantity of those relationships than our classmates--even those equally gifted--who did not choose this vocation.<br><br>If I could use only one process to illustrate what goes on in academic life, from the time of Plato until now and beyond, I would pick mentoring. And my practical reason for talking about it today is that I believe the influence of informal mentors and mentoring may be more important to the future of the individual faculty member, and thus to this university, than any administrative thing we may do. So, my hope is that by sharing what I know about that process I might make it work better. Even if I don't, I will at least have put my lever on the right fulcrum.<br><br>I realize that more than a few of the newcomers, as well as the veterans, may see little need for a mentor. You may even feel that you have had mentors enough, that now is the time to break free from the obligations you felt such relationships placed upon you as a graduate student or perhaps as a junior faculty member. Let me urge you to reconsider for at least two reasons.<br><br>In the first place, it seems to me that almost all of us have mentors, whether we recognize it or not, as long as we are growing intellectually. As we move along in our careers, they may not be near us, or they may not even be available to us in the flesh, but there seems to be a natural need to reach out to someone as a trusted counselor, even if only from memory or from a book. To me the question is not whether we will have mentors but which ones we will choose. In the second place, then, if I am right that we seem bound to have a mentor or mentors, why not make the choice consciously and well?<br><br>I can make my suggestions best by telling of one day in my life. I have chosen it as an example not because it is representative, but because it has been instructive to me, teaching me something about how to choose a mentor and what it takes to keep one. And, as is so often the case, what went wrong is as least as illuminating as what went right.<br><br>The memory is of an afternoon in an office at the RAND Corporation. It must have been in the afternoon. I remember facing the west window. The man sitting before me had his back to it. As the talk went on, he came more into silhouette against the sun setting into the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>Just the other day I looked up at that window from the pier in Santa Monica. I thought of repeated rhythms in our lives because I was walking along the cliffs and then to the pier with my son, Henry, who had flown in that morning from Tokyo. He'd scheduled his flights so that we might connect for a few hours to talk about his life and his work. How like him I was in the interview at RAND so long ago.<br><br>I had been a professor for a year. My efforts to move some research to publication had stalled as I met the challenge of my first year of teaching. But RAND gathered people that summer to work on problems like the ones I was studying. And so I was invited. Even with my full attention during the summer, the work not only was slow but seemed to me confused, to lack direction. I began to doubt that my research question was even phrased in a way that could lead me to anything that would matter to anybody.<br><br>And so a kind department head offered me the chance to talk with Herbert Simon. Professor Simon was another of the people there that summer. You would have had to have worked in that field in that faraway time to know what such an invitation meant. No one had done more than he had to change the way all of us thought about how decisions are shaped in organizations. He had not yet won the Nobel Prize in economics. In fact, I'm not sure there was such a prize yet. But I knew what an opportunity I was being offered. I could scarcely believe my good fortune.<br><br>I prepared hard for that meeting. I struggled to assemble all of my work, to make some order, some sense out of it. I knew that the chance to have such priceless counsel might come only once.<br><br>And yet I hoped for more, something that would last longer. So, I thought deeply about what questions to ask, what counsel to seek. I had no idea whether he would give me more than a few minutes, whether he would even read what I would send to him, or why he had agreed to see me. I wish I had known then what I know now about why such an interview occurs and why we sometimes win and keep a mentor.<br><br>I went to that meeting having decided that I would take his counsel. Had you seen into my heart, you might have called me credulous. But I had been humbled by my experiences. And I believed that he knew more about my problem than I did, perhaps more than anyone else in the world. And so I went trusting, ready to take counsel.<br><br>I found that he had read my work, carefully and critically. It was clear at the outset that he had been pondering my problem. The few questions he asked cut deep, revealing the weaknesses in what I had done. He obviously felt that helping me with my problem was going to be more important than making me comfortable. He seemed to assume that I cared more about my work than my ego.<br><br>And yet, forthright and candid as he was, he was not my adversary nor my rival. He listened with great kindness, with what felt almost like sympathy. He listened with complete absorption. It was as if there were no other person alive but me and no ideas in the world but mine. It is not too extreme, at least for me, to say that only my mother, my wife, and my other mentors have ever listened to me with such compassion. After what seemed an hour, he began to do the talking, quietly. I recognized the continuity, the steadiness in his counsel because it reflected what I had read of his publications. But he talked about my work, not his. He corrected not so much by pointing out mistakes as by showing me where to find opportunities to add value to my work.<br><br>He had obviously no intention of doing the work for me, or even telling me how to do it. He instead described where it might lead and what value it might have. He spent hours with me. And, at the end, he said words that gave the impression to me that he would continue to care about me and my work.<br><br>But we never met again. In fact, I doubt that he would remember that we met once. He and I were there through the summer and, on occasions, later. When I returned to Stanford I had a number of faculty colleagues who had worked with him at Carnegie Tech. All the conditions seemed present, as I look back, to extend that afternoon to a lasting relationship that could have been of great worth to me and to my work.<br><br>Let me piece together what I have learned about why I was right to choose to try to win such a mentor and yet why I did not. I'd boil down what to look for in identifying a great potential mentor to three characteristics. And he had them all. First, and surely most important, he had understanding about the world I was trying to navigate. He didn't just know facts about it; he had understanding about the world I was trying to navigate. He didn't just know facts about it; he had a map, and a good one. And I know now what kind of a map matters most--it's one that will show you where value will lie in the future. He didn't just know decision theory and organizational theory; he had a sense of where the combination was going and what would be of most worth to the people working on that combination as we went. He had the capacity to say, "This contribution or that contribution will make the most difference."<br><br>Now, you may object this way: "But all that I want in a mentor is someone who can tell me how to make continuing status at BYU or whether to accept this committee assignment or whether to keep my bike in my office." But if that is your objection, then we agree: those are judgments about the future, and they have imbedded in them judgments about value. If those are the questions you want to ask a mentor, the future you care about is immediate and the benefits personal. But the principle is the same: a good mentor will guide you reliably toward future value for somebody. And for the future and the values I cared about then, Herb Simon would have been tough to beat.<br><br>Two other characteristics of a great mentor, which I could only know he had when I got into the interview, are common to all great mentors I have known: integrity and generosity. Those traits are not especially easy to find, nor are they often combined in the same person. You will meet people so tough-minded that the truth, justice, and probity matter more than what you want or even what they want. I've known a few such flinty people. But only rarely have I found those who have combined such integrity smoothly with a feeling toward you so generous that what is good for you will be good for them, almost as if your victories and your happiness were their own.<br><br>Now I don't want too seem too pessimistic about finding such people, for I have known enough of them to fill a lifetime. But I sensed then, and you will be wise to recognize now, what a prize such a mentor can be.<br><br>Your own experience, with a little reflection, will tell you what I know about why such relationships endure--and why they do not. One word probably captures it: trust. You give it and you get it. The value a mentor has to you comes from your trust. Because I had such confidence in Professor Simon's understanding, and because of his integrity and generosity so evident in that afternoon's chat, I trusted him enough to subordinate myself to him. I conferred authority on him because I trusted him. I did not ask to be his peer. I was prepared to let his vision guide my hard work toward where he pointed to potential value. And giving him that trust was my choice to make.<br><br>Now, the mentor makes a choice, too. Herb Simon only had so many afternoons that summer. He gave me something of great value to him and to others. Everyone there wanted to see him, and he had work of his own to do. Given his generous nature, he was going to help people that summer, but he had to make choices about whom to help. He trusted me and my work enough to invest an afternoon. The return he hoped for was likely some combination of good in my life and perhaps some tiny boost to his own work. He must have seen in me some evidence that I would take his counsel, that I would work hard, and that something of value might come out of it.<br><br>Without being too modest, let me guess that he decided that his trust was better placed elsewhere. He must have seen the working papers I produced, albeit a little slowly, once they were circulated. He would have noticed that I began following his vision but later went in other directions. And as I look back over the years, his judgment has proven right: My work produced less value than that of those who searched where he pointed. I made my choices, they made their choices, and he made his choices.<br><br>All of this illustrates the great freedom in your relationship to a good mentor, at least as I have experienced it. You decide to grant the mentor authority by your trust. You choose to try to prolong the relationship. And you hold the power to end it. There are several ways to bring it to a close. It's a good idea to recognize when you are doing it. Listing a few of the ways might help.<br><br>They all stem from your losing your trust in the mentor. You can make that obvious by following the mentor's vision. Another way, and one you may not even notice yourself doing, is to show your waning trust by the way you confront the mentor. It's not a clear line, but there is a region of challenge where you are choosing to end the relationship. Mentors are generous, and they like to help creative people. So they are used to some "pushing back" from those whom they counsel. But I will tell you one way to know when you have made a choice that is likely irreversible. It is a simple one: When you move from asking penetrating questions and suggesting tentative ideas to trying to change the mentor's map, you have chosen to end the relationship. That may not be a tragedy in your view, but it is better to make it a conscious choice than to have it come as a surprise.<br><br>I did nothing so rash in that summer at RAND. The drift in my work away from his vision was gradual. But my guess is that the greater problem was that I was too cautious, too slow in sharing results. I polished and repolished my work before letting anyone see it.<br><br>If you want praise more than instruction, you may get neither. The mentors of most worth that I have known have a feeling of urgency in their own work that makes slow response from you seem a sign of disinterest. And this lack of interest looks a lot like lack of trust. So, if the mentor says he or she would be willing to talk about your work on Tuesday, my hard-won advice is to deliver something less than perfect early Monday. You will have suggestions back by Monday night, and you'll carry with you another version, much improved, by Tuesday morning. Of course you won't sleep much on those Monday nights, but you won't have enough of such days and nights in a lifetime anyway. An you will have gone a long way toward keeping a mentor.<br><br>Now, all of this will explain both my appreciation for the mentoring that has gone on at this university and my optimism about its future. Mentoring goes best and makes the most difference when people realize that there are lots of questions about future value to be answered when they trust. Let me tell you, then, why I am so confident about how much your mentoring will matter here and how well it will be done.<br><br>Two happy circumstances have allowed me to do the homework that is the basis of my optimism. The first was the invitation to return, after a long absence, to be commissioner of the Church Educational System. The other opportunity was the gracious permission of President Lee to explore across this campus.<br><br>My return to the CES taught me again that it is easy to talk about exponential rates of change, but it is something else to navigate them. When I was first president of Ricks College, we worried about recruiting to get enough growth in student admissions to justify the faculty we had hired the year before. Six years later, when I came to the commissioner's office, we were giving serious attention to the enrollment pressures at BYU and some thought to the day when Ricks College might face the same pressure. When I returned to the commissioner's office from the Presiding Bishopric, I found that Ricks College had rejected as large a number of freshman applications as had BYU.<br><br>For years I had taught and talked about the prophecy in Daniel. I knew that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the stone cut out of the mountain without hands. I knew that it would roll forth. And I knew that it would fill the earth. But the rumble had not been real enough to motivate action before it was upon me.<br><br>Just as the effects of the rate of growth were surprising, so was the accelerating geographic reach of the Church. Again, I knew we would go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. But I had not thought carefully enough to prepare for the effects: When I left to serve in the Bishopric, the Church was in slightly more than 70 nations. When I returned to education, seven years later, the Church was in more than 140 nations.<br><br>I cannot trace out all of the implications of these accelerating changes for the Church Educational System. But some are evident. I never go to a stake conference and President Lee never meets an alumni group without answering the question: What are we to do now that we can not reasonably expect that our children will attend a Church campus?" It is not asked out of curiosity. There is emotion, deep emotion. That emotion grows in intensity when you tell them that the campuses will not be expanded and that new campuses will not be added. The emotion is even higher when a mother calls to describe her daughter who has labored for years to qualify but has been denied admission. And often there seems to have been a neighbor child admitted, in the eyes of the mother, less qualified and certainly less devoted to the Church. Stake presidents tell me that where once five or six came here from their stakes, now only one or two come, and often not the ones they consider the most faithful. A father who graduated from BYU writes a polite letter describing the sorrow of his prepared son who cannot attend and asking us to please stop sending alumni correspondence to his home.<br><br>More and more of the letters pleading for admission will come from foreign lands where education is even less available. They are new members of the Church, full of faith, but with not enough income to pay for education there, let alone here, and without the resources to get adequate preparation. The gross national product per person in this country is 10 times what it is in the nations to which we will now go. Their tithes are small but cut even more deeply into their necessities than do ours. And yet almost none of them will ever see this campus--supported by the tithes of all the faithful--except in colored pictures.<br><br>We can already discern the path of the responses within the Church Educational System. In each case it is to seek answers to the question "As this resource we have been given charge for grows scarcer in relation to an exponentially growing demand, how is it prepared to give even greater value?" Here are some early answers.<br><br>Institutes of religion are located next to more than 2,000 campuses all across the world. The populations at some of those institutes are so large, with student stakes, that the religious and social experience for Latter-day Saint youth can equal the best that is found on our campuses. But some, too many, are small. I visited one near a major university in the western United States in the last few weeks where fewer than 10 Latter-day Saint freshmen will enroll in the school. When I talked with a mother whose daughter will attend, I was grateful I could describe the enhancement of institutes that is beginning.<br><br>We will expand the opportunities for studying the gospel, for meeting more young people, and for greater participation in Church units. The buildings and the dedicated institute faculty are in place because of the foresight of the Church Board of Education. And the certain growth of the Church will accelerate the enhancement of their power to bless. That vision cheers my heart as I visit faculty members working alone with small bands of students in institutes across the country who may have thought they'd never see the promised land of teaching unless they got transferred to Logan or Salt Lake. Now the promise is running in their direction.<br><br>Ricks College will respond to the admissions pressures caused by the growth of the Church and their enrollment limit in a way also made possible by its roots. Through years of change, from a tiny academy to a normal school to a four-year college and then back to its two-year program, there have been some constants. One has been in attitudes of the faculty. The faculty drawn there have, with only rare exceptions, put their whole hearts into the proposition that what a student has done in the past is no limit on the future. The open admissions character of Ricks College was not in the admission criteria nearly so much as it was in the hearts of the faculty. It is hard to see just how they will do it, but even as a smaller and smaller fraction of the Church can attend Ricks College, it will find a way to admit students in whom other faculties might not see the potential.<br><br>BYU–Hawaii was founded on visions of its future. Some of you know the accounts better than I, but I have felt their effects. President McKay foresaw students from many cultures and countries drawn together in love and learning. There they were to discover how to study and live in unity, as the Lord's people will be doing when he comes again. Some of you have served there. You have felt the direction and seen where it is leading. So have I, each time I have walked and listened and taught there. The reality is not yet what President McKay saw, but it will be. And its realization will add great value to its students, to the Church, and to all of education in an expanding Church that will become more unified and in a shrinking world that seems to be splintering.<br><br>Now, let me tell you why my visits across this campus with you have given me such confidence that BYU will find its way to contribute to the lives of people across the world who cannot come but whose affection we must not lose. I found three pleasant surprises. They will not surprise those who know the whole campus, but they may be less obvious to our newcomers and to those who must rely on second- or third- hand reports and newspapers.<br><br>The first surprise was to discover the brilliance, the good judgment, and the understanding of the faculty. Gifted and devoted scholars have chosen to come here in increasing numbers. As I visit with them, I am struck by the depth of their discernment about what is happening in their disciplines, in the Church, and in the world.<br><br>And the second surprise for me was the rate at which their fields are changing and the degree to which, with all the demands on their time, they contributed to that development. You have to visit with professors from nursing, physics, and then linguistics to be struck by the diversity of scholarly approaches and methods--but there is one prominent commonality: change is occurring so rapidly in disciplines that the edges are blurring and the very value assumptions on which they rest are being reexamined.<br><br>The great educational questions have always been more about value than facts. "Shall we require Latin for final honors?" "What about requiring plane geometry?" "What must the educated person read and why?" We are used to asking such questions about relative value and taking our time to answer them. But they are being raised in every field, with greater frequency and with emotional intensity and deep divisions. That rate of change creates great opportunities for growth when we have mentors with reliable maps of future value--and we have them here.<br><br>My third surprise was the widespread agreement we share on what future values will matter most and to whom. One illustration of that trust is the reaction to the proposition that our greatest value will be contributed by putting primary emphasis on undergraduate education. Now that is not an altogether obvious choice for a faculty charged to forge a great university. Whether people really trust such an assertion about the future is better measured by what they risk than by what they say. Across the university I have found world-class scholars who have put undergraduates first, and that is to me a remarkable proof of shared trust in a vision of value.<br><br>One anecdote involved two undergraduates I've met. One of our professors allowed them to present to a meeting the research in which they participated. A professor from another university asked, "Where did you get those post-docs?"<br><br>"They aren't post-docs."<br><br>"Well, then, where did you get such graduate students?"<br><br>I won't finish to the punch line. That level of trust in the primacy of undergraduate education being a path to a great university, not an impediment, reaches into departments across the campus.<br><br>More evidence of that was the success of our undergraduates in the national Putnam Mathematics Competition. Of 2,400 who competed, one BYU student was 98th, one 102nd, one 122nd, one 234th, and one 351st. By coincidence, both Cal Tech and Berkeley matched that record. Nevertheless, that our students did so well is not coincidental but rather a result of distinguished scholars caring enough about teaching undergraduates to do it very well. What surprised me about this, and other evidence I found, was how enthusiastically the majority of us are working toward shared visions of what matters. Even where we differ, and I found sharp differences, the differences are more often about means and timing than about ends. Those differences are serious, but few universities even hope for the breadth of consensus we have about what will ultimately matter and to whom.<br><br>Now you can see why I am so sure that mentoring will work here, and work well. There are gifted mentors aplenty. There are clear and shared maps of where future value will lie. And there is widespread trust in mentoring.<br><br>Those who have taught here have always had unique mentors. Dr. Maeser had at least one we know about: a prophet named Brigham Young. Other teachers have followed and other prophets, widely different in background and personality and serving amidst vastly different conditions. Yet with all that change, there is constancy, a steadiness, in the map they have shared of future value.<br><br>You remember some of the words. First, those of John Taylor: "You will see the day that Zion will be as far ahead of the outside world in everything pertaining to learning of every kind as we are today in regard to religious matters" (<i>The Gospel Kingdom</i>, p. 275).<br><br>Then, of David O. McKay:<br><br><i>In making religion its paramount objective, the university touches the very heart of all true progress. By so doing I declare with Ruskin that "Anything that makes religion a second object makes it no object. He who offers to God a second place offers Him no place." It believes that "by living according to the rules of religion a man becomes the wisest, the best, and the happiest creature that he is capable of being."</i>[<i>The Church University</i>, October 1937]<br><br>And, then, of Spencer W. Kimball:<br><br><i>As previous First Presidencies have said, and we say again to you, we expect (we do not simply hope) that Brigham Young University will "become a leader among the great universities of the world." To that expectation I would add, "Become a unique university in all of the world!"</i>["The Second Century of Brigham Young University" (10 October 1975), in<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1975), pp. 256-257]<br><br>One way in which this university is unique is in its power for wise mentoring. I would say to a the new faculty: Take responsibility for your futures here with confidence. There are more mentors available to you here who have understanding of where real value will lie and who blend integrity and generosity without diluting either than you will find elsewhere in any one place. You know how to identify them. You know how to win their trust, and you know how to keep it. Because of that, I have confidence in your future and in that of the university.<br><br>Now, the map of the future will only become perfectly clear as we work our way into the territory it describes. But one crucial part is clear to me: In some not very distant time you and I will the Savior, at a place where he employs no servant. I cannot picture the details, but you will feel as if you are alone with him, and you will have his full attention. You will then know what you could know now, that he has reached out to you, directly and through servants, some who were volunteers and some called, but all of whom you chose or rejected as your trusted counselors. You will find that he knew the way and wanted to share it with you. And you will have confirmed to you that he was the perfect example in mentoring, as he is in all service that brings real value.<br><br>This is how one who knew him described him, and the relationship we could have with him, if we choose it: "Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works" (Jacob 4:10).<br><br>I testify that this university is one of this works--and that he counsels over it--in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Henry B. Eyring was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this address was delivered at the BYU Annual University Conference on 26 August 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>he Best Faculty - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for this privilege, especially after enduring me last night. May I begin by expressing not only my personal gratitude for your present service, but also my additional appreciation for all the efforts expended by you earlier in your lives to prepare for you faculty service here. I share the confidence President Hinckley expressed some months ago, saying: "I am confident that never in the history of this institution has there been a faculty better qualified professionally nor one more loyal and dedicated to the standards of its sponsoring institution" ("<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley_trust-accountability/">Trust and Accountability</a>" [13 October 1992],<i>BYU 1992–93 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo: Brigham Young University, 1993], p. 22).<br><br>One of your number made a presentation to the board of trustees at its recent August meeting. His presentation on his BYU duties and research was brief but powerful. Those present were visibly touched by the combination of world-class scholarship and world-class testimony. This episode illustrates the often not-fully-appreciated strength in this faculty.<br><br>There will always be a need for civility and trust throughout the large BYU family, harnessed as we are together. John Taylor observed,<br><br><i>Many of us are tried and tempted, and we get harsh and hard feelings against one another. And it reminds me of your teams when going down hill with a heavy load. When the load begins to crowd on to the horses, you will frequently see one snap at his mate, and the other will prick up his ears and snap back again. And why? A little while before, perhaps, and they were playing with each other. Because the load crowds on them. Well, when the load begins to crowd, do not snap at your brethren, but let them feel that you are their friends, and pull together.</i>[John Taylor,<i>Journal of Discourses</i>21:214-15]<br><br>Lead horses are especially snapped and nipped at, even though they are pulling more than their share of the load. Very few of the faculty need the several reminders to follow.<br><br>For instance, to remind of the linkage between the Church and this university is unnecessary for almost all. It is why most of you came here in the first place! To remind, as well, of the need for the enlivening of personal scholarship is unneeded by most. Likewise, to remind of how many other worthy projects could use the millions and millions of dollars of tithing that support BYU would be redundant for the truly appreciative, who make up nearly all of this audience. To remind of how precious the students are who come here and how deserving of both the time and example of the faculty is certainly not needed for the vast majority. To remind that there is no contradiction--only benefaction--between genuine testimony and genuine scholarship is to speak of a given--for most. As Richard Bushman said recently, if religion and scholarship "cannot be brought together, how can we justify a Latter-day Saint university at all?" ("The Millennial University," BYU Honors Faculty Seminar, June 1993, p. 1). There is not reason for the tithe payers of the Church to fund another secular university since, as taxpayers, they are already helping to fund useful systems of public higher education.<br><br>Likewise important, however: Only an excellent university can really help the Church much. Mediocrity won't do either academically or spiritually. A unique Church deserves a unique university!<br><br>Twenty years ago, when President Oaks presided, a group of deans, administrators, and their partners heard my expression of faith in the future of this special university. Similar and specific things were also said 13 years ago at the inaugural of President Holland, including how "The greatest gift a [university or college] president can give his students is the example of his life" (Elder Neal A. Maxwell quoting Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh [president of the University of Notre Dame], speaking at the 59th Annual Meeting of the American Council on Education, New Orleans, Louisiana, 7 October 1976, p. 15).<br><br>President Rex Lee is certainly giving that precious gift to BYU, and likewise so are many others here. This is as it should be, since producing student credit hours without giving the accompanying gift of faculty exemplification is not enough at BYU! To seek and to maintain a consecrated, bilingual faculty--who speak both the language of scholarship and also of faith--requires retaining and recruiting those with inarguably good scholarship and also with testimonies born of the Spirit. Such individuals need never look anxiously over either shoulder. Therefore, teaching wisdom "out of the best books" assumes an educational process that emerges "out of the best faculty"! (See D&amp;amp;C 88:118.)<br><br>Thirteen years ago I also noted how many once church-related institutions have long since become indistinguishable from other universities and colleges, keeping the ceremonial robes without the theology, the pomp without the purpose. My conviction was, and is, that such a change will not happen here, since both BYU's trustees and faculty are at home with John Henry Cardinal Newman's observation that the sponsoring church "steadies" the university in the performance of its tasks pertaining to true education (<i>The Idea of a University</i>[Garden City, New York: Image Book, 1959], Preface).<br><br>James Burtchaell's recent writings about "The Decline and Fall of the Christian College" lament how<br><br><i>Ambitious but improvident leaders had suppressed their schools' Christian immune systems and since the virus of secularization would not seek out these now-defenseless institutions until the professional personnel could be replaced by scholars predominantly of no faith or a hostile faith or an intimidated faith, the reformers had no way of understanding how much farther their actions would carry beyond what they intended.</i>[James Tunstead Burtchaell, "The Decline and Fall of the Christian College,"<i>First Things</i>, April 1991, no. 12, p. 29]<br><br>Avoiding the outcome described by Burtchaell is not something that can be achieved only by a few trustees, administrators, and faculty. Only a deep and widely shared commitment by the faculty will insure that such a decline will not happen here.<br><br>Occasionally, BYU's trustees will do more than show up at commencements periodically and appropriate money regularly. Nevertheless, we understand and support the necessity that BYU's day-to-day life will be largely what the administration, faculty, and students make of it.<br><br>Likewise noted 13 years ago was the special role that universities should play as "providers of perspective." A real university does not oscillate in response to all the political, social, and educational trends and fashions of a particular time. Six decades ago, thought there were a few notable exceptions, German universities failed as providers of perspective. They were too concerned with becoming "politically correct." Just after World War II, one commentator wrote of Hitler's rise and of the decline of Germany's universities, bemoaning that<br><br><i>Nothing occurred in 1933 in the way of spiritual upheaval, and examples of weakness and corruption were abundant. . . . The invention of "German" mathematics and other forms of intellectual prostitution, as well as the numerous "somersaults" of scholars and writers, one can only recall with shame. It is also undoubtedly true that many trends in German academic life had paved the way for an excessive nationalism and an "anarchy of values" upon which the brutality of Nazi dictatorship . . . could thrive</i>. [Hans Rothfels,<i>The German Opposition to Hitler</i>(Hinsdale, Illinois: Henry Regnery Company, 1948), pp. 34-35]<br><br>In our period of human history, traditional values are being challenged, and some are even being inverted. In so many ways, just as prophesied, "all things [are] in commotion" (D&amp;amp;C 88:91). While functioning in such a setting, so far as this university is concerned, "the only way to go is<i>through</i>; there isn't any<i>around"!</i><br><br>My expectations for this institution continue to include not only teaching "out of the best books," but also having its faculty and graduate<i>write</i>some of the best books! Likewise, not only are BYU's students to be helped to appreciate and to enjoy great music, but they and some of the faculty and graduates are to<i>compose</i>some of it! For these and like things to be achieved, the gospel provides an ordering context with perspective and proportion to shape what will come out of the best faculty!<br><br>Important things are in process. Presently the trustees, administration, and faculty are joined, as seldom before, in giving serious consideration to a series of important matters, some of which President Lee and Provost Hafen spoke of yesterday. These major matters have come forward representing work carefully done by faculty groups in concert with the administration. Whatever the occasional frustrations may be in that process, the task is surely worth it, as BYU so positions itself that its academic quality will be further enhanced and its uniqueness further underscored.<br><br>One pressing reason for this planning is that there is no way the Lord can hasten his work in the global building of his kingdom without that hastening's also having an exciting but challenging impact upon this university. Hence the university will continue to do all the things a good university would do anyway, but there are extra chores to be done. The variety and significance of these additional chores will increase with that hastening.<br><br>Certain dimensions of BYU's academic programs can probably create beyond-the-campus benefits for the whole Church. In seeking to spread BYU's wingspan, however, we seek a particular plumage. How can this task be approached? My view, shared recently with your Faculty Planning Committee, is that the faculty and administration should first work through, winnow, and then recommend what these special contributions might be that would contribute directly to the mission of the Church, thus giving added value to the entire Church. The process of peer and administration review enhances the likelihood that understandings can be established that facilitate funding based on shared expectations. Such recommendations would come forward in the now well-established process of making regular and substantive presentations to and through the commissioner, the executive committee, and then to the trustees. Having so assured you as to my trust in this process, it is too direct to say that the board of trustees--while genuinely solicitous of your advice and insights--prefers to hear from you through proper channels rather than on television channels?<br><br>As we plan for this institution's future, what of those young Church members who can never be privileged to be enrolled here? The Church's institute program will be enhanced, just as Elder Eyring has indicated. Meanwhile, the tens of thousands of qualified students who will not be able to come here, and their parents, should at least be entitled to feel the place at BYU--for which they might have qualified--is filled by a student who is academically capable and spiritually worthy.<br><br>Doing all the extra chores associated with BYU's institutional uniqueness will require not only reciprocated trust in the whole family, but more "mentoring" of the faculty--especially by other faculty--and more mentoring of students to help them maximize their time on this campus, such as in time-to-graduation.<br><br>In all human situations, on occasion, mentoring involves corrective counsel, as in this mode of communication--which, alas, is a path "least traveled by." "Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother" (Matthew 18:15)<br><br>The same process might help those very few who have unrealistic expectations for this university. By way of a non-BYU illustration, I feel sorry for the few who seek to redefine the Book of Mormon in order to believe in it. But we do not invite these few to rewrite the Church's curriculum. Likewise, with those few who would redefine BYU's role.<br><br>The better BYU's initial recruiting, whether of faculty or students, the less need for corrective mentoring later concerning better teaching, better scholarship, or better citizenship in the university and the Church.<br><br>What could be more exciting than to serve at a special university that offers so much needed by so many? What could be more exciting than being part of charting the future course of this university, soon to go into the 21st century?<br><br>Whatever and however important our particular BYU chores are, these are temporary. We should all be seeking, daily, to become ever more the men and women of Christ. One day, if we are spiritually successful, whatever our mortal titles have been, in the light of eternity these will be seen as having been far too provincial. Jesus, the creating Lord of the Universe, was mistakenly known by some merely as "the carpenter's son," or, provincially, as Jesus of Nazareth.<br><br>One day all our temporary designations, locations, and vocations will shrink in their significance when bathed in the candlepower of Kolob's brighter and perfect day. Meanwhile, however, spiritual perspective is precious. So is meekness.<br><br>We are all impressed when we encounter sheer genius in a man or woman. We especially rejoice, however, when that genius is harnessed to righteous purposes. I remind us all of Jesus' supernal meekness. The Savior--the brightest individual ever to walk this planet--never sought to "prosper" or to "conquer" "according to his genius" and "strength"! (See Alma 30:17.)<br><br>President Abraham Lincoln, a serious student of human nature, experienced firsthand the interplay of intellect, ambition, power, and purpose. He wrote of the strivings for power and for glory among the talented:<br><br><i>This field of glory is harvested, and the crop is already appropriated. But new reapers will arise, and they, too, will seek a field. It is to deny, what the history of the world tells us is true, to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us. . . . Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story, upon the monuments of fame, erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and, if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves, or enslaving freemen.</i>[Don E. Fehrenbacher, ed.,<i>Abraham Lincoln: A Documentary Portrait Through His Speeches and Writings</i>(New York: The New American Library, 1964), p. 41]<br><br>In contrast, isn't it marvelous how Jesus deflected credit from himself? Even after his excruciating atonement, he meekly said, "Glory be to the Father"! (See D&amp;amp;C 19:19.) In the miraculous healings during his mortal messiahship, his encouraging phrase often was, "Thy faith hath made thee whole," almost as if he had not been involved. The genius that matters most, therefore, is safely enclosed in meekness and is anchored in righteous purposes. Unanchored brilliance merely adds to the turbulence, when "all things shall be in commotion."<br><br>Jacob's marvelous phrases about reality--"things as they really are" and "things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13)--serve to remind us of who we really are and what we are really supposed to be doing. These perspectives are needed by us all, given the intensity evoked by our immediate assignments, our periodic frustrations, and our contemporary concerns! Looking through the lens of gospel perspective, we see more clearly what life is really all about. In considering, for instance, the great reconciliation of Jacob and Esau with their caravans in the desert, none of us would be much interested in reviewing the invoices of the gifts offered or exchanged. It was their reconciliation that mattered!<br><br>This Church's greatest scientist, at least to date, is very probably Henry Eyring, the father of Commissioner Eyring. In the closing moments of his life, Dean Eyring's thoughts turned to his many and gifted students. Through them, the spiritual as well as intellectual contribution of Professor Henry Eyring will live much longer than his remarkable and world-prize-winning scientific work.<br><br>In the two or three weeks preceding this gathering, my gentle and good 91-year-old father humbly sought release and was buried Monday. The encompassing perspective helped me amid my few Martha-like concerns! It has actually been a happy time. Tender, humorous, appreciative, and spiritual things were said by him in one-liners and in little wisps of conversation.<br><br>Dad's only recent Church assignment has been to send birthday cards to the high priests and their wives. Nevertheless, he wondered how that chore would now get done and worried over who might be missed in any transition. Dad had already written his obituary. When we reported that we couldn't find it, in the midst of his exhaustion, he said he'd have to write another one--which would be the inspired version!<br><br>As breathing became more difficult for him, his coughing increased. One of his granddaughters, recently back from a mission to Korea, said, "Grandpa, can I help you cough?"<br><br>Dad said, "What language will you cough in?"<br><br>Michelle said, "In Korean."<br><br>Dad replied, "I'm sorry, I can only cough in English!"<br><br>He lived well and he died well, as another of the meek and lowly overcame the world.<br><br>What finally matters, brothers and sisters, is what we have become. There will be no puffed vitas circulating in the next world. They stay here--in the files. What we will take with us--to the degree we have developed them--will be the cardinal qualities that Jesus has perfected; these are eternal and portable.<br><br>In the same quest for perspective, suppose each of us were to take a last stroll across this beautiful campus at the foot of the everlasting hills--just before our crossing of the great divide? Perhaps this would be best done in early morning or at eventide--"far from the madding crowd." We might hear faint echoes of earlier footsteps, and then strain with thirsty ear to hear the voices of those who had walked this campus, some when it was so much smaller. All who truly care about this university would understandably yearn to hear the respected voices of the past--in my case, Martin Hickman has come repeatedly to mind--to hear such voices as voices of approval concerning what happened during our own watches at BYU!<br><br>Meanwhile, however, we are all pulling in that shared harness. In closing, ponder the perspective of him whose name this university bears. Brigham said,<br><br><i>We talk about our trials and troubles here in this life: but suppose that you could see yourselves thousands and millions of years after you have proved faithful to your religion during the few short years in this time, and have obtained eternal salvation and a crown of glory in the presence of God; then look back upon your lives here, and see the losses, crosses, and disappointments, the sorrows . . . , you would be constrained to exclaim, "But what of all that? Those things were but for a moment, and we are now here."</i>[Brigham Young,<i>Journal of Discourses</i>7:275]<br><br>Our watches are, indeed, "but for a small moment." Nevertheless, may we prove faithful and effective during that "small moment."<br><br>I love you. I trust you. I hope you sense that. God bless you. God bless the Brigham Young University for all that it now does and for all that will yet emerge "out of the best faculty," I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Neal A. Maxwell was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this address was delivered at the Thursday second faculty general session of the BYU Annual University Conference on 26 August 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e of the Spirit - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to be with all of you special young people this evening. I feel deeply my responsibility to teach you sacred things. I appreciate the fact that as I teach you, I am standing on holy ground. I am well aware that the world in which you live will be vastly different from the one I have known. Values have changed. Basic decency and respect for good things are eroding. A moral blackness is settling in. You are in many ways the hope of the future, and I remind you that valuable diamonds shine better against a dark background.<br><br>For you outstanding young men and women there is a scriptural text found in the Doctrine and Covenants: "Give ear to the voice of the living God" (D&amp;amp;C 50:1). The voice of the Spirit is universally available to all. The Lord said, "The Spirit enlighteneth every man [and every woman] ... that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit" (D&amp;amp;C 84:46). He further says that "everyone that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 84:47). Some people are seeking to find the abundant life. Paul made it clear that it is "the Spirit [that] giveth life" (2 Corinthians 3:6). Indeed, the Savior said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life" (John 6:63).<br><br>You may ask, then, What are the fruits of the Spirit? Paul answered this by saying they are "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance" (Galatians 5:22–23). The joy we seek is not a temporary emotional high, but a habitual inner joy learned from long experience and trust in God. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Rectitude is a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy, but by serenity, which is joy fixed or habitual" ("Character,"<i>Essays: Second Series</i>[1844]).<br><br>Lehi's teaching to his firstborn son in the wilderness, Jacob, declares: "Men are, that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). To achieve this great objective, we must "give ear to the voice of the living God" (D&amp;amp;C 50:1).<br><br>I wish to testify as a living witness that joy comes through listening to the Spirit, for I have experienced it. Those who live the gospel learn to live "after the manner of happiness," as did the Nephites (see 2 Nephi 5:27). All over the world, in the many countries where the Church is established, members could add their testimonies to mine. Abundant evidence verifies the promise of peace, hope, love, and joy as gifts of the Spirit. Our voices join in a united petition for all of God's children to partake of these gifts also.<br><br>But we hear other voices. Paul said, "There are ... so many kinds of voices in the world" (1 Corinthians 14:10) that compete with the voice of the Spirit. We have come here to hear just one voice. I have humbly prayed that I will speak by the power of the Holy Ghost so that my message may be carried into your hearts by that same power (see 2 Nephi 33:1). Imagine, however, what would happen if all of a sudden a heckler in the back of this hall started to yell obscenities; another on my left began to contend with him; another on my right began to debate with his neighbor; someone in the center turned on a recording of some loud music. Soon a chorus of raucous, rival voices would smother my voice, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to deliver a spiritual message to you.<br><br>Such is the situation in the world. The Spirit's voice is ever present, but it is calm. Said Isaiah, "And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever" (Isaiah 32:17). The adversary tries to smother this voice with a multitude of loud, persistent, persuasive, and appealing voices:<br><br>Murmuring voices that conjure up perceived injustices.<br><br>Whining voices that abhor challenge and work.<br><br>Seductive voices offering sensual enticements.<br><br>Soothing voices that lull us into carnal security.<br><br>Intellectual voices that profess sophistication and superiority.<br><br>Proud voices that rely on the arm of flesh.<br><br>Flattering voices that puff us up with pride.<br><br>Cynical voices that destroy hope.<br><br>Entertaining voices that promote pleasure seeking.<br><br>Commercial voices that tempt us to "spend money for that which is of no worth" and/or "labor for that which cannot satisfy" (2 Nephi 9:51).<br><br>Delirious voices that spawn the desire for a "high." I refer not to a drug- or alcohol-induced high, but to the pursuit of dangerous, death-defying experiences for nothing more than a thrill.<br><br>Life, even our own, is so precious that we are accountable to the Lord for it, and we should not trifle with it. Once gone, it cannot be called back. There are so many manifestations of this that I will not enumerate them for fear of giving someone an idea. "The knowledge of sin tempteth to its commission" (see<i>GD,</i>p. 373).<br><br>In your generation you will be barraged by multitudes of voices telling you how to live, how to gratify your passions, how to have it all. You will have up to five hundred television channels at your fingertips. There will be all sorts of software, interactive computer modems, databases, and bulletin boards; there will be desktop publishing, satellite receivers, and communications networks that will suffocate you with information. Local cable news networks will cover only local news. Everyone will be under more scrutiny. There will be fewer places of refuge and serenity. You will be bombarded with evil and wickedness like no other generation. As I contemplate this prospect, I am reminded of T. S. Eliot's words, "Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?" (<i>The Rock</i>[1934], I).<br><br>Without question some will be deceived and will endure lives of heartbreak and sadness. Others will enjoy the promise recorded by Jeremiah, "I will put my law in their inward parts" (Jeremiah 31:33). In some ways it will be harder to be faithful in your day, perhaps in some ways even more challenging than pulling a handcart across the plains. When someone died in the wilderness of frontier America, their physical remains were buried and the handcarts continued west, but the mourning survivors had hope for their loved one's eternal soul. However, when someone dies spiritually in the wilderness of sin, hope may be replaced by dread and fear for the loved one's eternal welfare.<br><br>Many in your generation have been conditioned by the world to want it all and to want it now. Many do not want to save or work. Such self-centered, impatient desires make you susceptible to temptation. The Book of Mormon identifies four categories of enticements that Satan appeals to (see 1 Nephi 22:23):<br><br>Gain<br>Power of the flesh<br>Popularity<br>Seeking the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world<br>Satan's tactic is to "turn their hearts away from the truth, that they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for them" (D&amp;amp;C 78:10). He creates a smoke screen that obscures our vision and diverts our attention.<br><br>President Heber J. Grant stated:<br><br><i>If we are faithful in keeping the commandments of God His promises will be fulfilled to the very letter. ... The trouble is, the adversary of men's souls blinds their minds. He throws dust, so to speak, in their eyes, and they are blinded with the things of this world.</i>[<i>GS,</i>pp. 44–45]<br><br>How are you possibly going to select what voices you will listen to and believe? The implications for you as individuals are staggering. To survive, you must:<br><br>First, exercise your moral agency wisely. Omni tells us how we can make the proper channel selections. "There is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord: and that which is evil cometh from the devil" (Omni 1:25). Every moment demands that we choose, over and over again, between that which comes from the Lord and that which comes from the devil. As tiny drops of water shape a landscape, so our minute-by-minute choices shape our character. Living the eternal gospel every day may be harder than dying for the Church and the Lord.<br><br>Moroni also compares those things that "inviteth and enticeth to sin" and those that "inviteth and enticeth to do good continually" (Moroni 7:12–13). He gives the key for judging:<br><br><i>Seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; ...</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.</i>[Moroni 7:18–19]<br><br>You will not be able to travel through life on borrowed light. The light of life must be part of your very being. The voice you must learn to heed is the voice of the Spirit.<br><br>Second, you must have a purpose. Last December when we were in Israel with the Tabernacle Choir, the leaders of the choir, together with Brother Truman Madsen and I, were honored to have an interview with Mr. Shimon Peres, foreign secretary of Israel and former prime minister. He told us a story I shall never forget. He said that as a young boy he rode in a car from Tel Aviv to Haifa in the Holy Land with David Ben Gurion, the George Washington of the state of Israel. On the way up, without any explanation, Prime Minister Ben Gurion said, "Trotsky was no leader." He was referring to Leon Trotsky, one of the architects of the Russian Revolution. A little while later he added, "Trotsky was brilliant, but he was no leader because he had no purpose."<br><br>Everyone in life needs to have a purpose. As members of Christ's church, we are to consider the end of our salvation (see D&amp;amp;C 46:7). Someone has said, "You must stand up for something or you will fall for everything ."<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67]<br><br><i>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</i>[James 1:8]<br><br><i>Let the mind be concentrated, and it possesses almighty power. It is the agent of the Almighty clothed with mortal tabernacles, and we must learn to discipline it, and bring it to bear on one point.</i>[Orson Hyde,<i>JD</i>7:153]<br><br>The more righteous part of the Nephites had to learn to focus attention in order to hear the voice.<br><br><i>They heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.</i>[3 Nephi 11:3]<br><br>They heard the voice a second time; "they understood it not." When they heard the voice the third time, they "did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came" (3 Nephi 11:4–5). If we are to hearken to the voice of the Spirit, we too must open our ears, turn the eye of faith to the source of the voice, and look steadfastly towards heaven.<br><br>Be aware that there are invisible hosts watching over you even as they did Elisha of old. The king of Syria sent hosts of warriors with chariots and horses to capture the prophet Elisha. They came by night and surrounded the city. Elisha's servant, seeing the great hosts, became very frightened and said to Elisha,<br><br><i>Alas, my master! how shall we do?</i><br><br><i>And</i>[Elisha]<i>answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</i><br><br><i>And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</i>[2 Kings 6: 15–17]<br><br>My dear young friends, I believe that unseen spiritual hosts tend you as you seek to do the will of the Lord. Remember the words of Elisha: "They that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:16).<br><br>Third, strengthen your testimony. Everyone in life needs to have spiritual goals. One way to learn of our life's purpose is to have our patriarchal blessings. A choice young man recently received his patriarchal blessing. He was told in his blessing that many of his forebears who paid a terrible price for the gospel were present as the blessing was given. Your patriarchal blessing is one important way to learn of your life's purpose.<br><br>If I were to ask you young people, "How is your testimony?" I suppose that many of you would say, "I don't know." But if I asked you some specific questions, the result would be different. For instance, if I asked you, "Do you believe that God lives and we are his children?" I think most of you would answer this question quickly and affirmatively.<br><br>And if I asked, "Do you believe and have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer?" I think most of you would hasten to say yes.<br><br>And if I then asked, "Do you believe that Joseph Smith was the prophet of the Restoration?" I think most of you have a belief concerning this. Some of you would already be familiar with section 135 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which states that "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it" (verse 3).<br><br>If I were to ask you, "Do you believe the Book of Mormon is the word of God?" I think many of you already have acquired a testimony concerning the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.<br><br>Lastly, if I were to ask you, "Do you believe that President Benson and his counselors and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are the prophets, seers, and revelators of our day?" I think most of you have formed a respect for the leaders of this Church.<br><br>Having answered these five questions in the affirmative, you already have a foundation of a testimony. As you acquire knowledge of the plan of salvation and learn why you are here and where you are going, your testimony will be strengthened. In addition, as you walk by faith you will have confirmed in your young hearts spiritual experiences that will strengthen your faith and testimony. You of this generation are a chosen generation.<br><br>You young women have a great destiny. As part of this destiny, you have a precious work to do. President Spencer W. Kimball has written: "It is a great blessing to be a woman in the Church today. The opposition against righteousness has never been greater, but the opportunities for fulfilling our highest potential have also never been greater" (G. Homer Durham, "Woman's Responsibility to Learn,"<i>Woman</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979], p. 33). Women are so richly endowed with the spiritual gifts about which Paul spoke: faith, hope, and charity (see 1 Corinthians 13:13). Thus part of your destiny is to set the example of the sublime womanly virtues, as the nurturers, teachers, and the refining influence so important for our families and the Church. Women are the enriching adornment of the race.<br><br>Learn and gain a testimony of the plan of salvation. "God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil" (Alma 12:32). Learn of your relationship to God. As you walk by faith you will have confirmed in your young hearts spiritual experiences that will strengthen your faith and testimony.<br><br>Fourth, search the scriptures, which are "the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation" (D&amp;amp;C 68:4). The Lord also said of his word, as found in the scriptures, "For it is my voice which speaketh them unto you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by my power you can read them one to another; ... Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard my voice, and know my words" (D&amp;amp;C 18:35–36).<br><br>Fifth, gain a conviction of the divine calling of the Brethren and be willing to follow their counsel, such as the following.<br><br>Honor the priesthood. You of this generation are a chosen generation. You young men are part of a royal priesthood. You young men and women were, no doubt, chosen before the world was and reserved to come forward in this time. We love you. We have confidence in you. We know that you will be equal to the challenges that are placed before you to carry forward the work of the Lord as your parents and grandparents and forebears have done. We know it is hard. You live in a morally desensitizing environment, but you must always remember that someone is listening and watching. If you support and sustain the priesthood, it will be a great stabilizing influence in your lives.<br><br>Stay morally clean. You must believe that it is worth it in the end to be true and faithful. Worldly pleasures do not match up to heavenly joy. It may not be "cool" to avoid certain things, or it might be "rad" to do other things, but it is better to be alone and to be right than to be eternally wrong. We counsel you to associate with those who can help you maintain your standards rather than tear them down. You must learn to be your own person and to live by your own standards. Even though you may have become somewhat desensitized or made some mistakes, you must not let Satan reduce your self-esteem to the point that you become discouraged. We urge you to carry and frequently read your "For the Strength of Youth" booklet and to listen to your parents and your leaders. As a chosen generation there is not a problem that you cannot handle with the help of the Lord. We counsel you not to grow up too fast. Do not miss the joy of being a righteous young adult. Enjoy your dating years. Have many friends. Have confidence in yourselves and in your future. You must learn to labor and you must learn to wait.<br><br>I warn you of a pervasive false doctrine. For want of a better name, I call it "premeditated repentance," by which I mean consciously sinning with the forethought that afterwards repentance will permit the enjoyment of the full blessings of the gospel, such as temple marriage or a mission. In an increasingly wicked society, it is harder to toy with evil without becoming contaminated. This foolish doctrine was foreseen by Nephi.<br><br><i>And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i>[2 Nephi 28:8]<br><br>Of all those who teach this doctrine, the Lord says, "The blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them" (2 Nephi 28:10).<br><br>Lastly, I do not know how the Lord will discipline your generation because of the general callousness and hardness of the hearts of so many in society. In biblical times the Lord sent fiery, flying serpents among the people. After they were bitten, the Lord prepared a way for them to be healed. As commanded by the Lord, Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole. To be healed, those who were bitten had only to look upon the brass serpent (see Numbers 21:8–9). This was too simple for many, and "because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished" (l Nephi 17:41).<br><br>I have suggested a simple solution for selecting the channel to which you will attune yourselves: Listen to and follow the voice of the Spirit. This is an ancient solution, even eternal, and may not be popular in a society that is always looking for something new.<br><br>This solution requires patience in a world that demands instant gratification.<br><br>This solution is quiet, peaceful, and subtle in a world enamored by that which is loud, incessant, fast paced, garish, and crude.<br><br>This solution requires you to be contemplative while your peers seek physical titillation.<br><br>This solution requires the prophets to "put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth" (2 Peter 1:12). This may seem foolish in a time when it is not worth remembering much of the trivial tripe to which we are exposed.<br><br>This solution is one unified, consistent, age-old message in a world that quickly becomes bored in the absence of intensity, variety, and novelty.<br><br>This solution requires you to walk by faith in a world governed by sight (see 2 Corinthians 4:18, 5:7). You must see with the eye of faith eternal, unseen, spiritual verities, whereas the masses of mankind depend solely on temporal things, which can be known only through the physical senses.<br><br>In short, this solution may not be popular, it may not get you gain, or worldly power. But "our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory" (2 Corinthians 4:17).<br><br>Learn to ponder the things of the Spirit and to respond to its promptings; filter out the static generated by Satan. As you become attuned to the Spirit, "thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it" (Isaiah 30:21).<br><br>Hearkening to the "voice of the living God" will give you "peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come" (see D&amp;amp;C 50:1; 59:23). These are the greatest of all the gifts of God (see D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>I pray with Paul "unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ... That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man [and woman]; That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May ... know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God" (Ephesians 3:14–19).<br><br>I believe and testify that your spirits are special spirits and were reserved until this generation to stand strong against the evil winds that blow, and to stand straight and upright with the heavy burdens that will be placed upon you. I am confident you will be faithful and true to the great trust that is ahead of you. I say this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>James E. Faust was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 5 September 1993.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1> How Can I Visualize It? - Janet G. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The last time I spoke on the same program with our son Michael was at his missionary farewell. And I was equally proud that day as I am today. But he has not always been so wise. He has grown in wisdom and judgment. After such a serious talk, I cannot help but tell a story on him.<br><br>Shortly before Michael went on his mission, his brother-in-law Tom Jacobson made him an offer. If Michael would let Tom break three raw eggs on Michael's head, Tom would give him twenty dollars. It sounded like a good deal. The degradation would last only a short time, could be removed by putting his clothes through the washing machine and jumping into the shower, and he could always use an extra twenty dollars. Picture him, if you will, sitting in our kitchen with a towel wrapped around his shoulders as the first egg was cracked on his head. Picture also his brother-in-law gleefully and ceremoniously rubbing the contents into Michael's hair. Then came the second egg. The streams of intermixed deep yellow and clear liquid began inching down his cheeks, into his ears, nose, and eyes, and into the corners of his mouth. But not to worry, just one more egg and the twenty dollars would be his. So he waited. And waited. And then waited some more. And then he heard Tom say, "Naw, it's not worth it."<br><br>As Michael demonstrated, some of our experiences in life could prove successful, and sometimes we could end up with egg on our face, which leads me right into my talk.<br><br>I love the cool brightness of September mornings with their contrasts of harvests and new beginnings. For me, the start of each school year is something of a contrast as well. My years as a student and then as a teacher stir mixed memories in me. To this day when I enter a place of learning, the smells of old books and new pencils awaken visions of expectations as well as fears. There is the excitement of starting anew, but there is also the trepidation of failure.<br><br>This campus is filled with potential. I am aware of your abilities, your worthiness, and your desire to learn. I feel humble in your presence. I also wonder if you, too, feel somewhat overwhelmed by each other's brilliance. Do you ever fear whether or not you will succeed? I want you to know that each night when Rex and I kneel in prayer, we plead for your success. I'm sure as you study and prepare your assignments, you pray, too. So if you work hard and ask for divine help, will you be successful? Yes, you will. But let me tell you a secret: Much of our success will depend on how we handle an occasional failure. Will we be defeated or will we learn from our mistakes? It is about facing failure, learning from our mistakes, and thus experiencing success that I would like to speak.<br><br>I remember vividly a distant September morning from my past. I had just instructed my first-grade students to write their names on the top of a paper after folding it in half. There was a bit of a scurry as everyone completed this two-part task rather quickly. Everyone, that is, except John and Bart. John's paper was wadded tightly in his hand and his head was on his desk. Bart stared blankly at me with wide, inquisitive eyes. I could feel their inner cries for help and moved quickly to render aid. John's distress seemed more demanding, so I asked Bart to begin on a picture. John had tried to fold his paper but had done it wrong and was frustrated by his mistake. No attempt to show him how could jar him into action. "You do it for me," he finally cried.<br><br>By the time I got to Bart, the class was getting restless, and my first inclination was to fold his paper for him and get on with things. He could learn another day. "No," he stopped me. "Show me how." Then I noticed his name wasn't on his paper. "Show me how to write my name, too," he pleaded. I knelt beside him and said softly, "Okay, make a 'B'." His eyes grew wider. "How do you make a 'B'?" he asked, unashamed.<br><br>I was a new teacher and that was a long first week. During the first three months of school those two boys needed more help than the other children, but there was a major difference in the way each responded to his mistakes. John continued to feel diminished by every error and could concentrate only on his failures. By staring at the stack of wadded-up paper on his desk, he could not visualize success. Bart, on the other hand, thrived on learning from each mistake and even taped the best printing of his name on his desk each week so he could mark his progress.<br><br>It's interesting to note that at first the ability of both boys was similar, but by the end of the school year, Bart was surprising everyone. Both John and Bart began the school year a bit less able than the other children, at least in their most measurable preparation. Yet one boy was able to see beyond his inadequacies and move forward while the other was not.<br><br>Like my two students, we often feel in adequate, especially with the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. It is not out of the ordinary to feel this way when we are reaching up and stretching to climb higher. It is reassuring, however, that we are all afraid of failure. It is a common denominator among us. Our true test is how we embrace that fear. I like Emerson's approach: "They can conquer who believe they can. . . . He has not learned the lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear" ("Courage,"<i>Society and Solitude,</i>1870).<br><br>Yet what of our attempts that are not successful? How do we view them? Albert Einstein has said: "I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right." He may have been a genius, but the theory of relativity didn't just pop into his mind one night at Hogi Yogi. Nor did Marie and Pierre Curie unlock the secret of radium isolation while watching reruns of<i>Star Trek.</i><br><br>As Elder Neal A. Maxwell states, "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, he will increase our capability!" ("It's Service, Not Status, That Counts,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1975, p. 7).<br><br>Does this mean, however, that a willing heart guarantees immediate success? Usually the road to victory involves encountering a great many mistakes. The Lord wants us to learn from our mistakes because that is how we become strong. He does not expect us to be perfect, just to keep trying. Hasn't he told us, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; . . . for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27).<br><br>This is why every twenty-four hours our Father in Heaven gives us a brand-new day--a chance to correct yesterday's mistakes. It is somewhat parallel to the<i>Groundhog-Day</i>theory: We just get another chance to keep on trying. When we attempt anything new, it is easy to feel discouraged. No one is alone in that regard. Initial failure, or a less-than-desirable result, is the price we pay for learning anything new. Sometimes we compare ourselves with others who are more experienced or whom we perceive as being more gifted. At such times we want to give up, forgetting the process of progress and the road to perfection. As we read in Joshua, "Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed" (Joshua 1:9).<br><br>Margaret Mitchell, author of<i>Gone With the Wind,</i>spoke the following concerning her frame of mind during the writing of her famous novel:<br><br><i>It was going along pretty well until somebody sent me a new book called</i>John Brown's Body,<i>by Stephen Vincent Benet. When I finished reading that magnificent Civil War epic, I burst into tears and put my own manuscript away on a closet shelf.</i>John Brown's Body<i>gave me such a terrible case of the humbles that it was months before I could find the necessary faith in myself and my book to go on.</i><br><br>Momentarily, Margaret Mitchell doubted herself too much to go on. As William Shakespeare put it, "Our doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft might win, By fearing to attempt" (<i>Measure for Measure,</i>act I, sc. 4, lines 77–79).<br><br>My student John saw his crumpled-up paper and visualized failure. He didn't even want to try. But Bart taped his name to his desk and kept his eye on how it would look when written correctly and then marked his progress.<br><br>Our Savior is the perfect image for us to visualize as we strive to be successful. We need to tape his image on the pages of our lives so that we may visualize his perfect life as we lift ourselves up from our failures. That we may mark our progress as we learn from our mistakes is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Janet G. Lee, wife of Rex E.

<h1> from A Mistake: Paul, Alma, and Other Prophets - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Janet has announced a principle that is both straightforward and important. Over this coming school year, everyone of you is going to experience some disappointments and some setbacks. Some of them will be rather profound and laden with sorrow, but we can learn and grow from these sorrow-laden experiences if we will resolve to do so.<br><br>For my part, I propose to discuss two related propositions that I believe follow as corollaries to the basic premise that we can learn from our mistakes. But first, with regard to the basic principle, let me tell you of an experience in which I personally learned from a mistake.<br><br>The general lesson I learned from this mistake concerns the importance of preparation. More particularly, I learned that when you argue a case in the United States Supreme Court you can never prepare too much.<br><br>One of the customs in the Supreme Court is that lawyers arguing cases for the government always appear in formal attire called a morning suit, consisting of striped pants, a vest, and swallowtail coat. I bought such a suit from a fellow who left the solicitor general's office at about the time I joined it. He was nearly my size but a little bigger around the middle. Following my first argument Janet told me she thought my argument was all right, but that my hair kept falling down in my eyes and my pants were baggy. She told me to bring the pants home so she could fix them.<br><br>My next argument a month later involved an important constitutional issue, citizen and taxpayer standing to bring constitutional challenges in federal courts. The morning of the argument, as I was changing into my government lawyer uniform, I tried to anticipate the questions that I might be asked. I remembered that Justice Harlan in a dissenting opinion in a case called<i>Flast v. Cohen</i>had suggested what he characterized as a possible Hohfeldian analysis that might be applicable to this citizen standing issue. I didn't remember precisely what he had said, and my first inclination was to reread that opinion before I went to the Court. But then I said to myself, "No, it's just an abstract theory in a dissenting opinion, no subsequent opinion has even acknowledged it, and the briefs don't discuss it. No one is going to ask me about it, and, besides, I need the extra time to apply some safety pins to my pants and comb my hair just right and then spray it." I had forgotten to take the pants home to Janet for alterations.<br><br>It was not until after my argument time had expired, and I was in the process of sitting down, that Justice Stevens said, "By the way, Mr. Solicitor General, what is your view of Justice Harlan's theory in<i>Flast v. Cohen</i>that there may be a Hohfeldian analysis applicable to the citizen standing issue?"<br><br>Well, if you read the transcript of my answer to that question, it will remind you of a high foul ball hit back behind home plate and out of play. The batter was not put out, but no runners advanced. Then, when I returned to my office, the first thing I did, of course, was to read Justice Harlan's opinion, something I should have done two hours earlier. You can imagine my dismay when I discovered that Justice Stevens' question was a home run ball, which I should have hit out of the park. But all was not lost. Three separate people came up to me after that argument and told me how nice my hair looked and how well my pants fit.<br><br>The first corollary that I would like to discuss with you is that we can learn not only from our mistakes but also from a willingness to attempt something at which we are not particularly skilled or experienced.<br><br>The experience of missionaries learning a new language is familiar to so many of us. One of the most valuable attributes for a new missionary or anyone else attempting to learn a second language is a simple willingness to do his or her best even when the inevitable consequence, at least for the first few months, will be a form of communication that ranges all the way from the incomprehensible to the embarrassing. One of my companions learned very quickly and very effectively the difference between the Spanish phrases<i>yo se</i>and<i>yo soy.</i>What he meant to say to our investigator family was, "Yo se que Jose Smith es un profeta de Dios." "I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God." The words he in fact pronounced with great confidence were, "Yo soy Jose Smith, un profeta de Dios." After the cottage meeting I informed him that he had testified he was Joseph Smith. The members of the family that we were visiting were very impressed. Earlier in my mission I had made an even worse mistake when I attempted to apologize to a young woman for having embarrassed her. After the meeting my companion told me what I had in fact said, and I assure you I will never forget that the Spanish word for "embarrassed" is not<i>embarazada,</i>which means "pregnant."<br><br>About a month ago Janet and I visited in Santa Monica, California, with one of the most remarkable people we have ever met. Bill Hobson is not a member of the LDS Church but is very impressed by the Church and also by our university. He is in his eighties, and some time ago suffered a stroke that affected his speech so severely that his doctors said he would never be able to speak again. In fact, he can speak, and after visiting with him I think I know why. At one point he told us how highly he thought of our "college." He then added that he knew there was another word, more correct than<i>college</i>as applied to our school, but the other word was one he could not say.<br><br>When Janet responded, "Is the word<i>university?"</i>his entire countenance became radiant.<br><br>"Yes, that's it. I can't say the word, but that's it." Our newly found friend, Bill Hobson, is the perfect example of this first corollary to Janet's general principle about learning from our mistakes. He is able to communicate so effectively now in spite of his stroke because he has a willingness and desire to do so.<br><br>Whether a missionary struggling with a new language, or a Bill Hobson grappling with his own English language after his physical setback, we can learn not only from our mistakes, but also from activities that might carry the risk of mistakes. Both are wrapped up in the same package with opportunities for learning, growth, and improvement.<br><br>My second corollary deals with a particular kind of mistake called transgression. In this context also we can learn from our errors. But the difference is that when the error fits in the category of transgression, we should not deliberately make mistakes--or even enter into circumstances or activities likely to lead to mistakes--because of opportunities to learn and grow from them. Consider, for example, the cases of Paul and Alma. We know them mainly because of their great spiritual strengths. They are even more memorable because of mistakes made before their miraculous turnarounds and because of the contrasts in their lives before and after those turnarounds.<br><br>I cannot think of any examples, either in scriptural or other history, of persons for whom the before and after disparity was as great. Nothing could be lower than the depths to which each had sunk during his extended mistake period, and nothing could be greater than the heights to which each rose after he discovered the mistake, learned from it, and changed his life to conform with what he had learned. Try to imagine--to recreate in your own mind--how each must have felt immediately after he was informed of his wrongdoing. How would you feel if you had received the devastatingly chastising question--either by the Savior himself as in Paul's case, "Why persecutest thou me?", or by an angel in Alma's, "Why persecutest thou the church of God?" In both cases, the direct heavenly verbal scolding was accompanied by severe physical consequences. Paul was stricken blind for three days, and Alma lost the use of his mouth and his limbs for two days and two nights.<br><br>It is hard to say who must have felt worse--Alma because he knew that his mistake had affected not only his relationship with his Heavenly Father, but with his earthly father as well, or Paul because he had inflicted actual physical harm on those who believed in Christ. Each knew that his transgression was so serious that heavenly intervention was warranted to stop it. What possible circumstance could be worse? What possible mistake could be more serious? Lesser persons would have simply given up. Not so with Paul and Alma. Both raised themselves up from those great depths to become among the most prominent figures in the Book of Mormon and the New Testament.<br><br>While it is true that Paul and Alma grew greatly as they learned from and corrected earlier mistakes, this surely does not mean that we should deliberately make the mistakes in the first place or put ourselves in mistake-laden opportunities. There will be adequate opportunities for unavoidable error and disappointment; we need not reach out affirmatively to create them. If we could talk to Paul and Alma, for example, they would surely tell us that their lives would have been better and happier if they had never faltered.<br><br>The same is true of the prodigal son. He is the dominant figure that emerges from the account in the fifteenth chapter of Luke. He deserves the notoriety that he gets because he learned from his mistake and apparently turned his life around. But I submit that the better role model, the one who chose the better course, and whom we should strive to emulate, is the prodigal son's brother. By following his path rather than that of the prodigal son, we may not get front-page coverage, but we will save ourselves a lot of agony. And I am confident that if we could interview the prodigal son himself, he would agree. Eating corn husks is not all that great.<br><br>In conclusion I would like to return now to Janet's fundamental principle, unadorned by corollaries, that we can learn from our mistakes. And, specifically, I would like to recount for you what I learned twenty years ago, almost to the day, from one of my great heroes and role models, Harold B. Lee. On September 11, 1973, following the last devotional address he ever gave at this university and about three months before his untimely death, President Lee gathered together a group of BYU administrators and talked to us for about an hour regarding some of the principles of leadership he had learned over the course of his life. He did this by telling us about a dozen stories. The stories fascinated me, as did the conclusions he drew from them. It wasn't until a couple of days later that Elder Oaks, then president of the university, pointed out something I had not realized: Everyone of President Lee's stories revolved around a mistake he had made at some phase of his life. Let me tell you the one example I remember best.<br><br>As many of you may know, President Lee was a great admirer of President J. Reuben Clark. Prior to being called as a General Authority, Brother Lee served as managing director of the Church welfare program. On that day in 1973 when he spoke to the BYU administrators, he told us how frustrated he had become while serving in his welfare position because of a lack of cooperation by employees in another Church office. Shortly after his call as a member of the Council of the Twelve, he said to his mentor, President Clark, "Now that I am one of the Twelve, do you suppose I can get some response from those people in such and such an office?"<br><br>President Clark's response, as President Lee reported it that day, was, "Yes, my boy, now that you hold the whip hand, there is a great temptation to use it. But you must never do that."<br><br>For me that story bore a powerful message about respect for the use of power and the mistakes that can be made in its misuse. Perhaps even more important, the entire collection of stories that President Lee reviewed illustrate the powerful potential for the sons and daughters of God--be they prophets ancient or modern or visiting teachers or anyone else--to learn and grow and assist others to learn and grow from the mistakes that are the inevitable consequences of life on this planet.<br><br>We have before us a wonderful school year. It has the potential to be one of the best years of our lives. For many of you it will be. Inevitably it will be a year in which everyone of you will make some mistakes and suffer some disappointments and discouragements. For some of you, these will be large and overwhelming. For others, not so large. Will each of you resolve with me this morning that whether large or small, when those mistakes are made, when those setbacks occur, you will prove yourself to be greater than they, that you will weather the storm, take your lumps, shed your tears, even say a few "if onlys," if that helps, and then pick yourself up and ask, "Now what have I learned from this, and how can I come out of this particular windstorm a better and stronger person because I've had to go through it?" It is because I care for each of you that I want you to make this promise. And I, in turn, will give you a promise that you will come out of it a greater, wiser, and better person. I do so in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Bruce C.

<h1>ything There Is a Season” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.</i>[Ecclesiastes 3:1–2]<br><br>The Lord has a marvelous system for providing for his children here on earth. The creation account found in Moses tells how our earth was formed and how the necessary elements were prepared for life to exist.<br><br>First, God said, "Let there be light; and there was light" (Moses 2:3). Then God divided the light from the darkness, and day and night were created. Next, the waters were divided to create the firmament or heaven. The third day the land and the waters were separated, "And the earth brought forth grass, every herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, after his kind" (Moses 2:12).<br><br>On the fourth day, the lights were set in the firmament, the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night, to "be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years" (Moses 2:14).<br><br>Living creatures were formed on the fifth day--those to inhabit the waters, the land, and the sky, and each "after his kind."<br><br>Finally, God created man in his own image, and told him to "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it" (Moses 2:28). He gave him dominion over every living thing; every herb bearing seed and every fruit of a tree yielding seed were given him for meat or food. Thus we see the Lord made provision for seasons, for seeds, for herbs, and for ways for man to plant and harvest.<br><br>The harvest is always a special time. I still marvel that tiny seeds, carefully nurtured, produce a bounteous harvest. The Lord's system is still in place.<br><br>I have pleasant memories associated with the fall season of the year and the time of the harvest. After eight years of living in sunny California, we moved to New York, where I was again reminded of the more dramatic seasonal changes of a cooler climate.<br><br>One morning as I was walking down the street on the way to the train station, kicking through the leaves that had fallen on the walk overnight, I suddenly had the urge, the strongest urge, to bite into a beautiful crisp, red apple. The association of the rustle of the leaves and that taste of an apple just seemed to go together. I could hardly wait to arrive in the city and find a fruit stand to buy one. I was not disappointed; the falling leaves and a big, red apple were just as pleasant to enjoy as I remembered from my boyhood.<br><br>In this area, the fall season and the time of the harvest go together. The Savior often used common, ordinary activities of life to illustrate a message. Since this is the season of the harvest, let us look at how the Savior used the example of the harvest in his teachings.<br><br>First, let's turn to a parable given to us in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Matthew, starting with verse twenty-four:<br><br><i>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</i><br><br><i>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</i><br><br><i>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</i><br><br><i>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</i><br><br><i>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</i><br><br><i>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</i><br><br><i>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</i>[Matthew 13:24–30]<br><br>Then continuing on, after the multitudes had left, the disciples asked Jesus:<br><br><i>Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</i><br><br><i>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</i><br><br><i>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</i><br><br><i>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</i><br><br><i>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</i><br><br><i>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</i><br><br><i>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire:</i><br><br><i>there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</i>[Matthew 13:36–43]<br><br>We must continually be thinking about our preparation for the time of the harvest. Our challenge is to protect the tender plants among the tares that choke out and leave us no credit or return for a life of toil. We must learn what it is that can be harvested to help us enjoy life eternal. Could we look at just the three essential ingredients that will insure us of a bounteous harvest? First, President Kimball taught us about our quest for knowledge of God in contrast to secular learning. In his writings he said:<br><br><i>In what kind of ignorance is the danger of damnation? In what kind of knowledge is found power, and what power comes from knowledge? Let us analyze this great truth. In proper sequence, first comes the knowledge of God and his program, which is the way to eternal life, and then comes the knowledge of the secular things, which is also very important....</i><br><br><i>Peter and John had little secular learning, being termed ignorant. But they knew the vital things of life, that God lives and that the crucified, resurrected Lord is the Son of God. They knew the path to eternal life. This they learned in a few decades of their mortal life. Their righteous lives opened the door to godhood for them and creation of worlds with eternal increase. For this they would probably need, eventually, a total knowledge of the sciences. But whereas Peter and John had only decades to learn and do the spiritual, they have already had nineteen centuries in which to learn the secular or the geology of the earth, the zoology and physiology and psychology of the creatures of the earth. Mortality is the time to learn first of God and the gospel and to perform the ordinances. After our feet are set firmly on the path to eternal life we can amass more knowledge of the secular things.</i><br><br><i>The so-called ignorant Peter and John are heirs to exaltation and can learn what they need to know to create worlds. A highly trained scientist who is also a perfected man may create a world and people it, but a dissolute, unrepentant, unbelieving one will never be such a creator even in the eternities.</i><br><br><i>Secular knowledge, important as it may be, can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom nor create a world nor make a man a god, but it can be most helpful to that man who, placing first things first, has found the way to eternal life and who can now bring into play all knowledge to be his tool and servant.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball,<i>President Kimball Speaks Out</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1981), p. 90–92]<br><br>A second area to consider in the harvest of our mortal experience is honesty. The thirteenth article of faith says, "We believe in being honest."<br><br>The Book of Mormon tells us about a group of people who were "distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end" (Alma 27:27).<br><br>Because of their honesty, these people were noted by their fellow beings, as well as by God. It is important to learn what honesty is, how we are tempted to be dishonest, and how we can overcome this temptation. Complete honesty is necessary for our salvation.<br><br>Elder Mark E. Petersen once said, "Honesty is a principle of salvation in the kingdom of God. ... Just as no man or woman can be saved without baptism, so no one can be saved without honesty" (<i>CR,</i>October 1971, p. 63).<br><br>The honest person loves truth and justice. He is honest in his words and actions. He does not lie. Lying is intentionally deceiving others. The Lord gave this commandment to the children of Israel: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour" (Exodus 20:16).<br><br>Jesus also taught when he was on earth that bearing false witness is a form of lying (see Matthew 19:18). There are many ways of lying. When we speak untruths, we are guilty of lying. We can also intentionally deceive others by our gestures, by a look, by silence, or by telling only part of a truth. Whenever we lead people in any way to believe something that is not true, we are not being honest. The Lord is not pleased with such dishonesty, and we will have to account for our lies.<br><br>Many in the world would have us believe that it is all right to lie. They say, "Lie a little; ... there is no harm in this" (2 Nephi 28:8). Satan, knowing the consequences, also tempts us to lie and then encourages us to justify our lies to ourselves. An honest person will recognize Satan's temptation and will speak the whole truth, even if it seems to be to his disadvantage.<br><br>An honest person does not steal. Jesus taught while he was on earth "Thou shalt not steal" (Matthew 19:18). Stealing is taking something that does not belong to us. When we take what belongs to another person, or from a store, or our school, or a community, without permission, we are stealing. Taking merchandise or supplies from an employer is thievery. Accepting goods from one who is dishonest, or taking more than our share of anything, is stealing.<br><br>An honest person does not cheat. We cheat when we give less than we owe, or when we get something we do not deserve. Some employees cheat their employers by not working their full time, then accepting full pay. Some employers are not fair with their employees by paying less than they deserve. Providing inferior service or merchandise is also cheating.<br><br>There must be no excuse accepted for dishonesty, though many excuses are used. People lie to protect themselves and also to make others think well of them. Some excuse themselves for stealing, thinking that they deserve what they took, or intending to return it, or thinking they need it more than the owners. Some cheat to get better grades in school, or because someone else does it, or even to get even. These excuses, and many more, are given as reasons for dishonesty.<br><br>In the Lord's eyes, there is no acceptable reason. President Kimball has told us that when we excuse ourselves, we cheat ourselves, and the spirit of God ceases to strive with us. We become more and more unrighteous.<br><br>You might ask, "How can we be completely honest?" To be completely honest, we must look carefully at our lives and have the courage to face the whole truth. If there are ways in which we are being even the least bit dishonest, we should begin at once to repent from them. When we are completely honest, we cannot be corrupted. We are true to every trust, duty, agreement, and covenant, even if it costs us money, friends, or our lives. Then we can face the Lord, ourselves, and others without shame.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith counseled us:<br><br><i>Let every man's life be so that his character will bear the closest inspection, and that it may be seen as an open book, so that he will have nothing to shrink from or be ashamed of.</i>[<i>GD,</i>p. 252]<br><br>Third, in the record of my harvest, I would like to have my granary full of eager service. Service seems to follow true conversion. We have many examples in the scriptures of what happens when conversion takes place. I like the account of Alma in the book of Mosiah because of the mighty change that occurred after his remarkable conversion. The scriptures record:<br><br><i>Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</i><br><br><i>And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them....</i><br><br><i>And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</i><br><br><i>And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them....</i><br><br><i>And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</i><br><br><i>And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God....</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</i><br><br><i>For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit....</i><br><br><i>And now it came to pass that Alma began</i><br><br><i>from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</i>[Mosiah 27:8–9, 11–12, 19–20, 23–24, 32]<br><br>You see the inactivity brought about with a visitation of an angel, which brought a desire of service. The value of service in the Church was of equal worth to me as the years I spent in getting an education. I remember early in my business career I was given a great opportunity with a retail firm. It was a great opportunity. Of course, immediately following World War II, employment opportunities were easy to find. Businesses were starting to fill their executive ranks after years of personnel shortages as men and women who had been engaged in the war effort were returning home. After six months with the firm as an internal auditor, I was promoted to controller of one of their units. I was poorly prepared for such a promotion. I left my wife and two little children where we were then living to sell our home, and I set out on my new assignment.<br><br>The work was challenging and difficult. It was more than I could handle during the normal working day. I found myself often working through the night, catching an occasional nap at my desk, to keep going as the night progressed. In fact, it turned out to be almost every other night that I would remain in the office.<br><br>In a couple of weeks our home sold, and I arranged to drive back to pick up my family and bring them to our new residence. After getting my family settled, I let my wife know what my work schedule was. Needless to say, she wasn't very happy with the arrangement and the burden she had at home with two small children. She wanted some assistance there. I tried to explain how burdened I was at the office and that it wouldn't last forever.<br><br>After just a few days of having the family together again, I was home having dinner one evening expecting to go back to the office. A car pulled up in front of our apartment. A man came to the door and introduced himself as a member of our stake presidency. He invited me to come out and visit with him in his car. As we approached the car, I could see a counselor from our bishopric seated in the front seat. Inside the car, it was explained to me that they were reorganizing the bishopric of our ward on the next Sunday, and the counselor was to become the new bishop. He turned to me and called me to become his second counselor.<br><br>I paused for some time before responding, wondering how I could take on any more in my life. However, the example and training I had received in my home as I was growing up fortified and strengthened me, and I agreed to serve. It turned out to be one of the great blessings of my life. This new bishop taught me the art of delegation and how to organize my time much better. My life became almost normal once again, which, of course, pleased my wife and family.<br><br>This was followed by service in two bishoprics, two high councils, two stake presidencies, and finally as a stake president before being called to serve as a General Authority in Salt Lake. Church service is the best schoolmaster I know to teach human relations, a quality I believe is essential to all who want to succeed. It is difficult to stay even with the Lord. The more you give, the greater will be your blessings.<br><br>In conclusion, let us turn to the writings of Paul to the Galatian Saints:<br><br><i>Be ye not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i><br><br><i>And let us not weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</i><br><br><i>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</i>[Galatians 6:7–10]<br><br>As we experience the beauties of another plentiful harvest season, may it remind us of the preparation we must continually be making to ensure ourselves of a bounteous harvest from the efforts of a lifetime, so that we may reap the rewards of enjoying life eternal with him who is the creator of all. May I urge you to do regular personal evaluations on the following important lifetime efforts:<br><br>1. Remember in your quest for knowledge to<i>balance your studies between gospel truths and secular learning.</i>The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants to "seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 109:7).<br><br>2. Remember the<i>value of absolute integrity and honesty.</i><br><br>3. Learn the joy of<i>gospel service.</i><br><br>Your good works will be rewarded: Our Lord and Savior will bless your righteous efforts with a complete and fulfilling life.<br><br>I give you my solemn witness that God lives! Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. We are engaged in his work. It is my witness to you if you follow him you will find that fulfillment you are seeking to find in this mortal experience which is yours. May God bless each of us with a firm determination to follow the counsel we've been given in the holy scriptures is my humble prayer, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>bscurity: The Emergence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in “That Vast Empire of Russia” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In June of 1843 the Prophet Joseph Smith announced the appointment of apostle Orson Hyde and George J. Adams to serve as missionaries in "that vast empire" of Russia, with which, he continued, are connected "some of the most important things concerning the advancement and building up of the kingdom of God in the last days, which cannot be explained at this time" (<i>HC</i>6:41). Although months of preparation followed this announcement, the two men never served in Russia.<br><br>Much later, in 1903, the land of Russia was dedicated for missionary work by an apostle, Francis M. Lyman, who offered dedicatory prayers in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Subsequently, many Church leaders and members, professional men and women, statesmen, educators, and, significantly, BYU performing groups helped prepare the way for the introduction of the restored gospel to Russia.<br><br>It was especially during Gorbachev's era of glasnost, beginning in 1985, that conditions gradually became favorable for establishing a mission in that country. In particular, Elder Russell M. Nelson, assisted by European area president Hans B. Ringger and Austria Vienna East and Finland Helsinki mission presidents Dennis B. Neuenschwander and Steven R. Mecham, established vital contacts, opened doors long closed, and commenced the missionary effort.<br><br>By the time my wife and I, accompanied by our three youngest children--Betsy, Katie, and Jon--arrived to begin our missionary service in what was originally named the Finland Helsinki East Mission, three young, but already flourishing, branches of the Church existed: the largest in Leningrad, with nearly a hundred members; then Tallinn, Estonia, with almost fifty members; and Vyborg (located between Helsinki and Leningrad), with approximately twenty-five members.<br><br>Many of the earliest Russian and Estonian members joined the Church while visiting abroad in Europe and, especially, Finland. Finnish members of the Church, among them the Kemppainens, Jakkos, Laitinens, Kirsis, Lammintauses, Rotos, and Forsmans, were particularly active in friendshipping, teaching, fellowshipping, and training Soviet members and their friends.<br><br>Soon President Mecham in Finland received authorization to send the first fulltime Finland Helsinki missionaries--mainly Americans who had previously studied Russian--for a few days at a time to conduct home teaching and fellowshipping visits in the apartments of baptized members living in the USSR. While with members, these Finnish and American Church representatives answered members' and their nonmember friends' questions and taught them about the Church and, if requested, gospel doctrine.<br><br>Among the factors that inhibited our missionary work was the millennium-long and very rich heritage of the Russian Orthodox Church, so tightly interwoven into society's cultural, educational, and political lives. On the other end of the spectrum are over seven decades of official atheism, which left many with impaired spiritual receptivity. And, finally, the current punishing economic conditions complicate missionary activity by forcing many to work longer hours, often at more than one job, and depriving Russians of much of the energy and leisure required for reflection and the pursuit of lofty aspirations. Nevertheless, a golden layer of Russians remains, prepared by the Spirit and receptive to the gospel message.<br><br>Our mission began in July 1990 with sixteen missionaries transferred from the Finland Helsinki Mission and upwards of 175 Russian and Estonian members. By the time of the first division of our mission in February 1992 into the Russia St. Petersburg and Russia Moscow Missions, there were approximately seventy missionaries and over 750 members. Our family moved to Moscow with twenty-eight of these seventy missionaries to serve with nearly 200 of the 750-plus members.<br><br>By the time of our release almost a year and a half later in July 1993, the Moscow Mission included Moscow, Nizhnii Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, and Voronezh; the missionary force had grown to nearly 140 and the membership was approximately 750. The St. Petersburg Mission and the Kiev, Ukraine (Russian-speaking) Mission had experienced comparable or yet greater growth.<br><br>Factors that did and continue to contribute to the growth of the Church in Russia include a dissatisfaction with ancient dogmas and rigid ideologies that forbade open inquiry. Further, favorable though limited press and TV coverage, the visits of the Tabernacle Choir and several BYU performing groups, General Authority meetings with members and friends of the Church, and superb missionaries, dedicated and competent, have been crucially important.<br><br>As all who have served a mission know, hardships and disappointments are a prominent part of the experience. Chief among ours was the dearth of Church materials and our own meetinghouses, although through the efforts of many, progress is being made in these and other areas.<br><br>On the other hand, the missionary visa obstacle, one of our most vexing and persistent problems during the first half of our mission, was addressed and solved. The first missionaries entered the USSR only on expensive tourist visas for short periods of time, returning often to Finland for renewals. Later, members, at tremendous cost to themselves from long hours lost while standing in lines, secured private invitation visas for missionaries for longer periods of time--months rather than weeks. In March 1991 Church attorney David Farnsworth completed arrangements to establish a Russian Religious Association with Russian leadership. This association eventually was granted the authority to issue invitations to missionaries, resulting in visas for the full time of their residence in the country.<br><br>Similarly, severe problems with arranging for adequate health care, missionary living quarters, telephone and mail communications, banking services, and office procedures were lessened or overcome through time and, particularly, through the efforts of two heroes in the mission, our Moscow office couple, Elder and Sister Dewey of Logan, and their predecessors in Helsinki, Elder and Sister Warner, now presiding over the Bulgaria, Sofia Mission.<br><br>In Moscow the first group of members became a branch with a Russian branch president in March of 1991, nearly five months after full-time missionaries arrived. One year later, in March of 1992, the Moscow branch was divided into six small branches. Not quite a full year following, fifteen Russian-speaking branches were organized in Moscow, with a branch conveniently located along each subway line radiating from the center.<br><br>Rapid growth and relatively inexperienced members meant that timely and intensive leadership training was essential. Initially that was accomplished through monthly branch leadership meetings which I conducted and, especially, through one-on-one contact with the more experienced missionaries. In some branches, young missionaries served with simply astonishing skill and wisdom as branch and Relief Society presidents and as other leaders.<br><br>Eventually a Mission Training Council was formed, led by Americans working in Moscow embassies and businesses. Regular training meetings were held for branch presidents, clerks, leaders of priesthood quorums, Relief Societies, Primaries, and Young Women, teachers of all organizations, members preparing for the temple or missionary service, and members of branch social and cultural committees. For instance, our own Professor Barbara Lockhart contributed significantly to the success of social activities in Moscow during her recent tenure on the training council.<br><br>Now the Moscow member districts are gradually assuming more of the training function, with relatively experienced and remarkably successful Russian leaders training others.<br><br>Challenges abounded in the mission, but so did treasured moments of spiritual refreshment and affirmation. For example, I was deeply moved as I attended church meetings in Vyborg on the first Sunday of my mission. Since 1963 I had visited Russia fairly frequently. In my heart I had felt that the restored gospel would be shared with this deserving people whom I had come to love dearly, but in my mind I could not imagine how our Church could ever be established with that country's government and ruling party so opposed to religion.<br><br>On that day early in July 1990, I walked into a small music school and was greeted by two legendary missionaries and by nearly two dozen recently baptized members of the Church.<br><br>Before my sacrament meeting talk, six little girls, from about three to nine years of age, sang in Russian "I Am a Child of God." The singing was angelic, as were, especially, their radiant, broadly smiling faces. As I watched and listened in awe, my heart filled with "hosannahs" for the blessing of this long-awaited day.<br><br>Further, I recall with delight the words of a relatively new Saratov member teaching a priesthood lesson on the importance of the family. The lesson was fairly standard, except for a few moments when he soared in spirit as he related experiences from his own family. He spoke of his young, grade-school son who had returned from school one day with a bruised face. His son had objected when a bully was tormenting a girl classmate. For his trouble, the young member of the Church had been hit very hard. His classmates saw what happened and ran up to him, offering to join him in teaching the tormentor a lesson. But the boy replied that he had been reading the Bible and attending a church where he was taught not to do mean things, even to those who do mean things to you. His friends were dumbfounded, as, especially, was the father, who generally had followed a different, far harsher ethic all his life, and who that day personally experienced Jesus' teachings powerfully and deeply for the first time.<br><br>May I tell you of a few of the leaders of our Church in Russia in order for you to appreciate the strength they represent to members and missionaries. Boris Mokhov, now one of Moscow's district presidents, came to the Church along a path many have followed. Growing up in an avowedly atheistic society and home, and, after the 1985 institution of Gorbachev's glasnost, unable to respond to the appeal of the Russian Orthodox Church, he was surprised when his oldest daughter met LDS missionaries. Two young elders had visited her high school class and made a presentation about the Church, inviting any interested to attend church services with them the following Sunday. Several of the young students did visit the church, among them, Natasha Mokhov.<br><br>Natasha told her older brother about this church, and he agreed to attend meetings with her. In time the missionaries taught them the missionary discussions, secured permission from the Mokhov parents, and baptized the two oldest children. Eventually the two younger sisters in the family also began going each Sunday to the meetings and were baptized. The parents were pleased to note a very positive change in the children's attitudes and behavior. They had worried earlier about some of their older children's choices of friends and activities. Now they felt increasing admiration for their resolution and integrity.<br><br>On occasion the Mokhov father and mother also attended church services. The children, many missionaries, and Church members helped the parents gain an assurance that they belonged with the children in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Finally their baptismal day arrived, and church service and growth followed. Approximately two months ago, the Mokhov parents and their four children were among thirty-one Moscow members of the Church to visit the Stockholm Temple, where they were sealed as a family for time and for eternity.<br><br>The first family in Russia to receive the temple endowment and sealing ordinance was the Semionov father, mother, and son from Vyborg. Two years earlier the father, Andrei, a young medical doctor of surgery, had met a devoted and generous Finnish family, the Jakkos, on a canoe trip. The Jakkos gently but persistently explained Church values and teachings to Andrei, and, sensing his genuine interest, maintained contact with him over a period of months. Eventually missionaries were able to present the discussions to the Semionovs and, as they were prepared, baptize them. The Semionovs were especially active in sharing the gospel with their neighbors, a considerable number of whom made the same decision that the Semionovs had to affiliate with the LDS Church.<br><br>One of Andrei's friends told a former classmate, Yelena Petrov, about his positive impressions of Church teachings, especially about the emphasis on family ideals. Yelena and her small daughter were then visiting Yelena's mother in Vyborg for the summer, seeking relief from the heat, pollution, and bustle of Moscow and her tiny, one-room communal apartment, where bathroom and kitchen facilities are shared with two other families. When her husband, Andrei Petrov, then a Ph.D. student completing his degree in radio telecommunication engineering, came for a visit, they attended the Vyborg branch of the Church.<br><br>The Petrovs, too, were favorably impressed by the spirit and liberating teachings of this new and, as yet, largely unfamiliar church. Missionaries offered to help them learn more. Following weeks of meetings, the Petrovs were baptized. As they returned to Moscow, the embryonic church was meeting in the none-too-spacious but spiritually expansive home of the Thorntons. The year was 1990 and Dohn Thornton was employed at the American Embassy. In his free time he shared his knowledge and testimony with Russians, several of whom were to form the nucleus of the first Moscow branch in 1991. Having accepted various opportunities for growth through Church service, Andrei Petrov became the first Russian president of that branch and, in 1992, the first Russian Moscow district president.<br><br>President Petrov, his wife, and now two children are currently living in Wymount Terrace while Andrei attends the Marriott School of Management, studying in the MBA program, thanks to the vision and generosity of professors Scott Smith and Heikki Rinne and their colleagues and donors. After two years the Petrovs will return to Moscow to continue their groundbreaking work in establishing the kingdom in that choice land of Russia.<br><br>The Moscow Mission was and is blessed immensely by Americans living in Moscow, who virtually all told me at one time or another that they had set aside other appealing professional opportunities to come to Moscow and help build up a new Zion.<br><br>Dan Souders moved from employment at the U.S. Embassy to Aeromar, taking a position of administrative leadership in a joint venture between Aeroflot and Marriott, providing meals on international Aeroflot flights. President Souders served as original Moscow group leader as Russians began to attend meetings and become interested in the Church. He currently again is a branch president living in Moscow with his fine Russian wife and daughter. Albert Walling, recently deceased, headed Huntsman Chemical in Moscow and served with unparalleled devotion and sensitivity as second group leader of the Moscow Russian Saints, and as one of the first two Moscow district presidents. Through his example and teachings, he prepared a very substantial number of Russians for success in their Church service. Now the Matthews and Bennett families ably continue the work of the Wallings.<br><br>The Gibbs played a starring supporting role in strengthening the Moscow branch while Daryl, a computer specialist, helped colleagues at Moscow's leading language university master state-of-the-art computer technology and language-learning applications. William Atkin is a leading international attorney with Baker-McKenzie. He and BYU law professor Cole Durham have been centrally important in steering the Church's fragile frigate through the rough waters of discriminatory legislation and unresponsive bureaucracies. The Neuberts, U.S. Embassy employees, provided successful youth conferences and Primary leadership training.<br><br>Here I would mention BYU Professor Trevor McKee, who brought dozens of BYU and University of Utah students to teach English in Russian kindergartens. Their sterling example stood and stands in stark contrast to the pornography, violence, and vulgarity entering Russia from the West through tawdry films and TV. These students and their leaders helped a considerable number of Russians form positive impressions about the USA, Utah, and the Church, promoting, consequently, missionary success.<br><br>Dedicated Russian Church members and those who strengthened them paved the way for what I consider the highlight of the Moscow mission through July of 1993. The event occurred on February twenty-first of this year.<br><br>It had been a considerable trek from Moscow member-missionary work by Americans in early 1990, to the arrival of the first six full-time missionaries in October of 1990, to the organization of the first official Russian Moscow branch in March of 1991, to the establishment of fifteen Russian-speaking branches this February. On that day, February 21, 1993, over 500 members and friends were seated comfortably in the newspaper-publishing house Izvestiia Building in downtown Moscow, across the street on one side from the famous Pushkin statue to Russia's most beloved poet and on the other from McDonald's, a must-visit cultural mecca for Western tourists.<br><br>The fifteen branches had just been organized and their presidents sustained. Now the ten new branch presidents were bearing brief testimonies. Most of us were enjoying a particularly delectable spiritual feast. When the eighth or ninth president began speaking, I started to review in my mind the main points of my talk, which would conclude the conference.<br><br>I was prepared to speak on the blessings of attending a large, established ward of the Church, as I had done as a preteenager living in what was for me the comparative metropolis of Pocatello, Idaho, after spending my earlier years in Notice, Coltman, Rigby, and Jerome. I would recall our full Church program and lovely meetinghouse facilities, like our Pocatello building with that inspiring mural on the wall behind the podium. The mural depicted heroic pioneers crossing the plains, struggling and, on occasion, disheartened, but attended always on their journey by unseen angels. Maybe these pioneers could not see the angels, but every week I and others saw them plainly above the pioneers' heads, and I learned well the lesson that a loving Heavenly Father is aware of our burdens and strengthens us just enough to bear them. And I would draw a parallel to the Moscow pioneers crossing to their eagerly anticipated spiritual Zion.<br><br>Then I wanted to emphasize how much I learned and benefited in other ways from living during my junior and senior high school years in the small northern Idaho town of St. Maries, where our fledgling branch of the Church met in a modest, two-room Grange Hall, similar to facilities of many of the new Moscow branches. But there as a teenager I had the opportunity to serve with Weldon and David Tovey, two other very young men, in the Sunday School presidency and to grow through the warm encouragement of humble, generous Saints who overlooked our inadequacies and loved us for what we were and what they believed we could become.<br><br>As I was mentally reviewing these and other points, suddenly and unexpectedly an intimation, a thought, a sensation filled my consciousness and in an instant encompassed my whole being. I no longer thought about my talk or listened to the speaker.<br><br>I had felt a distinct and powerful impression that the spirit of the Prophet Joseph Smith was rejoicing with us in this historic meeting. I believe for a moment my spirit felt his spirit of youthful buoyancy, joyful enthusiasm, and expansive vision.<br><br>As I reflected on this feeling, I realized that in 1993, 150 years had passed from the 1843 appointment of the first missionaries to Russia, and that this day of fulfillment must be an occasion for heavenly rejoicing and grateful recognition of the efforts of so many over fifteen decades who made the emergence of the Church out of obscurity a reality in Russia.<br><br>I close with a more personal experience that, I hope, will contain lessons of benefit to you. Like you, I too have observed that life presents challenges to everyone of us. Some struggle in certain areas, others in different ones, but we all face difficulties. In my case, for example, I have experienced problems with my eyes for years. Progressive myopia has caused strain on my eyes' tissue-thin retinas. My vision continued to deteriorate while I was on my mission, especially during my final year. In March of this year I was referred by a local Moscow doctor to the highly regarded Fiodorov Eye Institute of Microsurgery in Moscow.<br><br>Following a thorough examination, the doctors there recommended a surgical procedure called scleroplasty, which is not uncommon in Moscow, although not well known or accepted in the West. The procedure was intended to stabilize my eyes and forestall further irreparable damage to my retinas. After receiving somewhat differing opinions from consulting specialists whom the Missionary Department and area presidency recommended, and after studying as much of the professional literature as the institute could make available to me, my wife and I prayed earnestly for inspiration to know whether I should have this operation. We prayed with all our hearts and often to know the Lord's will.<br><br>In my life I have found that, following prayer, for me it is best to remain on my knees with my eyes closed and my mind and heart as open to inspiration as I can make them, and to wait on the Lord. During these moments as we sought answers regarding my eyes, I felt only the tiniest kernel of tender confidence that I should have the operation. We continued to pray and I continued to feel only barely assured.<br><br>Finally I decided to act on this faint confirmation and scheduled the operation. From that time my confidence grew quickly and held firm. I asked my wife how she was feeling and learned that her experience closely paralleled mine. As we made our decision, we had not known in every fiber of our beings; some of our fibers still had questions. We did not receive the specific assurance that the operation would end my eye problems, but we felt confident that it was in accordance with the Lord's purposes for me to proceed.<br><br>This process of perceiving spiritual communication is beyond my ability to define in certain, unchanging terms. But I do feel that, while we should never disavow the possibility of angelic appearances or heavenly voices, neither should we remain insensitive to gentle enlightenment to the mind and quiet assurance to the heart. This was another confirmation to us to trust the deep, calm feelings in our souls.<br><br>Before the surgery I desired a priesthood blessing. I was surrounded by many of surpassing spiritual plenitude. I would have been honored to have any two of dozens bless me. As I continued my work in the mission, I felt certain that I would recognize the opportunity at the appropriate time to invite someone to provide the blessing as a complement to the moving and effectual prayers of my faithful wife.<br><br>It was when I was meeting with two members of the two Moscow district presidencies that I recognized I should ask these brethren to be the participants in this ordinance of blessing. After our meeting I invited the two men present, President Martynov from the north and President Petrov from the south, to give me a priesthood blessing. As they laid their hands on my head and spoke with humility and power beautiful words of comfort and blessing in the Russian language, I understood a remarkable truth: in my moment of need I had come to two worthy Moscow priesthood holders, neither of whom had been a member of the Church when our mission was begun in 1990. Further, I had been among those who had had the opportunity to teach them to anoint and bless the sick and disconsolate.<br><br>The operation itself was quite simple. The virtually painless procedure involved rotating the eyeball downward to expose the back of the eye. Small rectangular strips of human donor sclera, the white part of the eye, were carefully placed on the thinned back wall of my eyes.<br><br>Much of my life I have felt or wanted to believe, romantic that I am, that part of my soul, my aspirations and dreams, my cultural preference was Russian. Now I can proudly acknowledge that a portion of my physical being is Russian. Someone gave part of her- or himself that I might have the possibility of better health.<br><br>That is what we missionaries around the world hope to do--share something of ourselves, of our faith and conviction, that part of us which is most needed by others to affirm heartening meaning in this often perplexing life, in which we all see as though "through a glass darkly." For the sufficient light I do receive and can impart, and for my inestimable opportunity of laboring with beloved Russians and Estonians, and with splendid missionaries from the USA, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Finland, Sweden, and Nicaragua, I express my deep appreciation, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Gary L.

<h1>ver Take No Cutoffs&quot; - Elaine L. Jack - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate that introduction given so you will know who I am. Recently I went to the welfare cannery with my ward to do pears. I sat by, and visited with, a nice woman from another stake. After about twenty minutes of conversation, she looked at me and said, "You remind me so much of Elaine Jack. Has anyone ever told you that before?" I said, "Actually, more people tell me I am like my sister" and then confessed I was Elaine Jack. I am glad to be here.<br><br>Every time I visit this campus I marvel at the enormous force for good you represent. You are the leaders who will shape this world for years to come. You are indeed being prepared for a most hazardous journey. I assure you that Elisha's counsel to his young comrades as they faced what appeared to be overwhelming odds holds true today: "They that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:16).<br><br>It is your journey ahead that I would like to address--the journey that will require careful planning and execution, wise use of your resources, and constant reliance on and dedication to eternal principles.<br><br>Nearly one hundred fifty years ago, a small band of settlers organized under George and Jacob Donner set out on a journey to a better life. At first their trek was typical of the scenes that had been played out time and again as pioneers made their way west to the rich lands of opportunity. But this was a misguided effort flawed by mistakes and misjudgments. Indeed, the Donner party was one of the most tragic dramas in the history of America.<br><br>The party included an assemblage of folks from Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, and Ohio. Of the ninety men, women, and children who began the trek, forty-two died; and those who lived struggled the rest of their lives with the effects of exposure, starvation, and wrenching memories. Their journey left an account for history that will never be forgotten.<br><br>The Donner party made their way to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, with little fanfare. But then they succumbed to the lure of a quicker, but unproven, route to California charted by a man named Lansford W. Hastings. Instead of the much-traveled course around the rugged Sierra mountains and then down to the California coast, the Donner party chose to go south through the Wasatch Mountains, down Echo Canyon, across the salt flats on the south side of the Great Salt Lake, and over the deserts of northern Nevada. They intended to clear the mountain pass near the present site of Reno, Nevada, before the snows fell.<br><br>Such was the outline for the journey, but they never made it. They got within one day of the last mountain pass before meeting with final disaster. What happened?<br><br>In May 1847, shortly after her rescue from the snowbound encampment near what is now Donner Lake, twelve-year-old survivor Virginia Reed wrote to her cousin in Illinois this message: "Never take no cutoffs and hurry along as fast as you can" (quoted in George R. Stewart,<i>Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party</i>[Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1960], p. 361).<br><br>We can learn much from Virginia and the historical accounts of the ill-fated journey. Many of the settlers, not able to part with their material luxuries of home, brought an excess of possessions that slowed the progress of the entire company. Factions splintered the group into camps of "us" and "them." Before the party reached the Sierras, one of the members had killed another.<br><br>The single worst factor was taking an unproven shortcut. When Virginia said, "Don't take no shortcuts", she knew what she was talking about. The Hastings Cutoff was supposed to save as much as 300 miles, but the path led into a blind canyon. What reportedly would take a week took thirty days. Things just got worse. The stretch across the salt flats was almost twice the distance indicated, not forty but seventy miles. They had too few provisions and too little water for themselves and their animals.<br><br>Finally, upon reaching the towering Sierra Nevada range, they rested. They squandered their last week of good weather gathering strength for the final days. Had they not stopped they would have been only a footnote in the history of the developing West. But it snowed.<br><br>The party was one day short of clearing the pass when early storms in late October buried them in snow depths of more than twenty feet. They built crude shelters of logs, rocks, and hides, and ate twigs, mice, their animals that did not run away, and then their own shoes. Finally, some of them resorted to eating the dead. Four rescue parties worked their way in from the west that winter and spring to save those who were miraculously still alive.<br><br>Today, I want you to look at your journey. There are several lessons to be learned from the Donner party that have nothing to do with wagon trains and everything to do with exaltation. For you, the stakes are higher than a home in the untamed West. Your destination is eternal glory.<br><h2><b>Lesson One: "Never Take No Cutoffs"</b></h2><br>The Donner party took a shortcut, an unproven one at that. Beverly Sills, a famous musician familiar with the rigor of working to get someplace has said, "There are no shortcuts to anyplace worth going." She was right. To be marooned in the middle of the mountains was not the destination of the Donners.<br><br>Our journey is clearly defined, the path well marked, the pitfalls noted. But the Lord is wise. He knows he must prove us, for he says, "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves" (Matthew 10:16).<br><br>We are not only here to learn, we are here to test that learning. That phase of this earthly journey was outlined from the beginning, for the scriptures tell us, "Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" (Luke 2:52). He learned, like you are learning in this great institution dedicated to bringing forth righteous leaders.<br><br>For the Donner party there was a proven trail. It was longer, but it was sure. Gambling on their own abilities and personal ambitions, they took a road that had never been tested. The result is history.<br><br>The Lord says, "Enter ye in at the strait gate: ... Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Matthew 7:13–14).<br><br>As you follow the path of the Savior, keeping your covenants and his commandments, you will be assaulted from all sides with offers to take other roads, other travel packages. Anything the adversary can do to pull you off course, he will do. He'll stop at nothing to catch your attention, and then, ever so slyly, he will lead you away from the work of the Lord.<br><br>This is the dispensation of the fullness of times. We have been given the fullness of the gospel. To entice us from the path, Satan suggests a salad bar of sin--a little here and a little there until the plate is piled high and the price is paid. Knowing of his style and cunning, we must "press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 3:14).<br><br>There are some who are not satisfied with the peace that comes from the Lord. Seeking to find gratification in places other than in holy settings, they hang out--usually on a limb--and play into the hands of Satan and his evil designs. "Stand ye in holy places," we are told, for the road back from sin is a long one (see D&amp;amp;C 87:8).<br><br>Some break what they view as the lesser commandments, hoping that these will only be minor deductions in the final exam. They don't keep the Sabbath day holy, they invite temptation, they seek release from the pressures of school with drugs or alcohol, they don't fulfill their callings. They lie--just a little; they cheat--just when they need to; and they miss church meetings--only when they're tired.<br><br>"Never take no cutoffs" means to enter in at the strait gate, my brothers and sisters, and to stay on the strait and narrow path. Such devotion to the Lord's cause is difficult. But know that just as the Donner party set off with the best of intentions, you too can be led into blind canyons and forced to cross treacherous desert sands when you have strayed.<br><br>In this audience are some of the best the Lord has on this earth. You are here at BYU as part of your prescribed journey. President Benson has counseled that "Intelligence, or light and truth, becomes a vital force in our eternal journey" (<i>TETB,</i>p. 302).<br><br>This gathering of Saints is a sampling of the strength of the Lord's force for righteousness in the last days. Does that give you pause? As a group you are capable of mighty works, but each of you must go forth on the journey as did Moroni, whose<br><br><i>heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ.</i>[Alma 48:12–13]<br><br>With such devotion there are no sidesteps, no missteps. My dear young friends, there are no shortcuts to eternity.<br><h2><b>Lesson Two: Travel Light</b></h2><br>One of the families in the Donner party was unable to leave behind their cherished personal belongings. They had a specially built wagon twice the size of a typical Conestoga to carry their treasures across the wilderness. But the wagon was slow, cumbersome, and difficult to maneuver. Ultimately it was abandoned on the salt flats as water and rations became far more valuable than tables and chairs.<br><br>Reflect on the counsel of the Savior to the young man who asked, "Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" The Savior listed all the basic commandments, then next we read:<br><br><i>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."</i><br><br><i>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</i>[Matthew 19:16–22]<br><br>Are we willing to leave behind the world to become like God? Worldly comforts may temporarily minimize the impact of our struggles here on earth; they may give us comfort and a sense of importance, even a measure of success. But such reliance on material possessions deprives us of reliance upon our Heavenly Father and his saving grace. Our spiritual growth comes from seeing the Lord's hand in our lives. There is little comparison between a worldly check register and our account in the Lamb's book of life.<br><h2><b>Lesson Three: Contention, Strife, Anger, and Derision Thwart Our Progress</b></h2><br>Relationships with one another are sacred trusts. That's why we call each other brother and sister. We are indeed the closest of companions on this journey. Respect, honor, love, and humility are the basics for living with the Father. To practice and refine these traits here is to be in touch with the eternities today.<br><br>Reading the Book of Mormon puts clearly in front of us the debilitating nature of contention. The prophet Jacob mourned the dissension rampant among the people. At the end of his life he wrote,<br><br><i>I conclude this record ... by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</i>[Jacob 7:26]<br><br>Then we read of a happier people who had just been visited by the Savior. Wrote the prophet Nephi,<br><br><i>And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.</i><br><br><i>And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.</i>[4 Nephi 1:15–16]<br><br>Anger and friction delayed and divided the Donner party on their journey. Such discord led, in part, to their temporal tragedy. Satan loves dissension in any form. He encourages harsh feelings, angry words, ruthless judgments, scorn, pride, and the cruelest of actions.<br><br>Our greatest teacher and example on this point is Jesus Christ. To those unbelievers, those who wished him harm, those who plotted his capture and even his death, Jesus Christ showed mercy and compassion, charity and love that never wavered. No unkind words passed his lips. His behavior was always becoming of the King of Kings. What did the Lord say from the cross to those who jeered at him, spit upon him and called him names? "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br><br>May we, too, forgive and love and honor each other on this journey.<br><h2><b>Lesson Four: "Hurry Along as Fast as You Can"</b></h2><br>The Donner party showed us the risks of taking our time. We have no time to lose--or even time to take it easy. I love the old Chinese saying, "Man who sit with legs crossed and mouth open waiting for roast duck to fly in have long hunger."<br><br>We can't sit. We can't wait. The Donners waited, and the snows came, and their journey was a tragedy.<br><br>Recently, the administration here at BYU instituted a new policy to help students "hurry along" in their college training. This is not to deprive or limit an education, but instead it encourages you to focus on this season of your life. The new approach is designed to keep students from loading up on unneeded courses, encourages planning early, and increases the odds that a student will "graduate." This is good advice applied to any task at any time. Such direction would have aided the Donners. It will reap benefits for you.<br><br>There is more to "hurrying along" than simply speeding up the system. We have to pace ourselves to get where we want to go. In the book of Joshua (24:15) we are told firmly, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve." When we look to this scripture we usually hear "choose" and "serve." But notice it says "this day," not tomorrow or the next day or when you finish your finals. It says, now. Right now. The Lord has told us, "I come quickly," and he is a man of his word. We must be prepared.<br><br>This is not idle counsel. We read in Helaman 13:38, "Behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late."<br><br>We cannot procrastinate our days of serving the Lord in his kingdom, or our daily reading of the scriptures until our class loads are lighter. Believe me, you are busy now; and it will never get better or easier. The load is always there, for the Lord is training you to lift and carry more and more. To sidestep such service is to miss opportunities in the kingdom that may not come again.<br><h2><b>Lesson Five: Sometimes We Need to Be Rescued</b></h2><br>Some of the members of the Donner party were saved only because of the timely rescue efforts of others, people who set aside their work and their personal safety to find those who were lost. Some of us in this room need rescuing--maybe some who aren't here do too. And some of us are the rescuers. We aren't being asked to strap on snow shoes and scale the west slope of the Sierras in the middle of winter; we are being asked to save souls, one person at a time. Remember, this is a spiritual journey, and this is the greatest work in the eyes of God.<br><br>I have a good friend who told me of a personal rescue that she holds close to her heart. She was a college student like you, but she attended that red-and-white institution to the north. (Some of you might think that was the source of her problems.) It was near the end of her senior year, and things were not falling together as she had hoped. She had applied to graduate school but wasn't sure about taking that next step in her education. She was very involved in student affairs and recognized that these experiences that she loved were coming to an end. She was dating the missionary for whom she'd waited for two years, but she was also dating his best friend and had been for most of the time the missionary was gone. You get the picture. At that moment, her journey was a nightmare.<br><br>It was a Friday afternoon, and she was particularly downhearted. She hadn't heard from any graduate schools. She was juggling dates for the weekend with both men. She had papers to write and projects to finish. Her little ten-year-old brother was the only one home, and he was begging her to play a game with him. She couldn't stand to deal with life, so she left. She walked out the front door and up the street, and then she turned and began to walk toward the freeway. As she walked she heard a crunch on the gravel behind her, and turning she saw her little brother. He looked at her face streaked with tears and then asked, "Where ya going?"<br><br>She replied in a voice most dramatic, "I don't know."<br><br>For a minute he looked at her, not sure what to do, and then he said, "Do you want to go to Skaggs?"<br><br>He was a rescuer that day. A little ten-year-old chasing a lost-looking sister around the corner and up the street. He knew something was wrong, didn't know what, and yet he was the only one there. He made her laugh, and they went to Skaggs. She'll never forget that day he saved her. He more than made her day.<br><br>How long has it been since you've made someone's day? Or made a very bad day just a little bit better? Sometimes climbing up on that white horse feels good for the rider as well as the one in distress.<br><h2><b>The Last Lesson: Journeys Are Packed with Troubles</b></h2><br>The Donner party had big troubles that crippled their course. All of us have obstacles and difficulties in our lives. But let me contrast the difference in the approach of the Donner party with that of a band of Mormon pioneers crossing the Atlantic. William Clayton sailed from England to America in 1840 with a host of new converts. You know his name, for he later wrote the classic hymn "Come, Come Ye Saints." The words are a testimony of his understanding of adversity as part of the eternal plan. After arriving in Nauvoo, Clayton wrote home to his fellow Saints in England and said:<br><br><i>We have sometimes almost suffocated with heat ... sometimes almost froze with cold. We have had to sleep on boards instead of feathers, and on boxes which was worse. We have had our clothes wet through without the privilege of drying them or changing them. We have had to sleep out-of-doors in very severe weather. Don't suppose for a moment that all will be peace and ease. ... These are days of tribulation and we must endure our portion.</i>[And then he continued,]<i>If you will be faithful you have nothing to fear from the journey. The Lord will take care of his saints.</i>[William Clayton, letter from Commerce, 10 December 1840, Church Archives]<br><br>"Be faithful and you will have nothing to fear from the journey." I testify to you today that this is true. Be faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the covenants you have made, and you will sing praises, "All is well." I am not being simplistic when I say that our faith can carry us when we are weary, wounded, worn by the buffetings of the world, and wanting to go home. Faith can bring the journey of a lifetime. Look at Peter, who stepped off the boat to join Jesus. Peter stepped off because of his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He understood that with him all things are possible.<br><br>They are. I know this, and I promise you that such a testimony will come to you in your life as you exercise faith at the most trying of times.<br><br>The Lord loves you. Everyone of you is numbered, known, and loved by the Lord Jesus Christ. With such assurance, indeed, can't we sing, "All is well"?<br><br>There are indeed reasons for our trials. Lorenzo Snow, fifth president of the Church, said, "You and I cannot be made perfect except through suffering: Jesus could not. In His prayer and agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, He foreshadowed the purifying process necessary ... to secure the glory of a celestial kingdom" (10 January 1886,<i>JD</i>26:367).<br><br>That concept of Gethsemane speaks to my heart. We all face those monumental periods in our lives when we turn to the Lord and pour out our souls, for the pain is too great to stand alone. Know that this, too, is part of the process of perfection. Let me share with you a poem that makes this point so well:<br><br><i>All those who journey, soon or late,</i><br><i>Must pass within the garden's gate;</i><br><i>Must kneel alone in darkness there,</i><br><i>And battle with some fierce despair.</i><br><i>God pity those who cannot say,</i><br><i>"Not mine but thine," who only pray,</i><br><i>"Let this cup pass," and cannot see</i><br><i>The purpose in Gethsemane.</i><br>[Ella Wheeler Wilcox, "Gethsemane,"<i>Poetical Works of Ella Wheeler Wilcox</i>(Edinburgh: W. P. Nimmo, Hay, &amp;amp; Mitchell, 1917), pp. 133–34]<br><br>This life is a spiritual journey. There are lessons to be learned. Virginia said, "Never take no shortcuts," and she was wise. Shortcuts only deflect us from the narrow trail. Travel light, be kind to everyone, hear with your heart when someone needs you. Hold your head high amid troubles and find comfort in the cry "All is well."<br><br>Time is short, my brothers and sisters, so "hurry along as fast as you can." We can do this for we are some of the Lord's most faithful Saints, and he is with us. He hears our prayers. He knows our needs. We have nothing to fear from the journey; we are on a well-marked path that leads home, all the way home to our Father in Heaven. Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Elaine L.

<h1>e Doer of Our Deeds and the Speaker of Our Words&quot; - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My subject this morning concerns the pursuit of self-esteem. I'm going to resist defining self-esteem and simply use the term to circumscribe a number of ways of viewing the self. I would like to explore the nature of the self and the conditions under which it flourishes. In particular, I want to ask this question: What is the eternal value of the pursuit of self-esteem?<br><br>Whatever the valid uses of the term<i>self-esteem</i>are, however much good is intended, I wonder if self-esteem isn't a red herring. The term<i>red herring</i>comes from the practice of dragging this smelly fish across a trail to destroy the original scent. Thus a red herring is a diversion intended to distract attention from the real issue. I suggest that the issue of self-esteem is a diversion to distract us from the real issue of our existence.<br><br>We might be justified in telling people to fix their self-esteem in order to solve their most basic problems if we knew nothing of man's premortal life, or the spiritual purpose of his earthly probation, or his glorious destiny. But the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ teaches the true nature and true needs of the self. There are two major human conditions that the self is subject to that may have led to the idea that the pursuit of self-esteem was important: man's vulnerability, or even pain, incident to the fall of man; and the conflict and insecurity, or pain, created by personal sin.<br><br>First, the pain incident to fallenness: Like our Savior, though to a lesser degree, we condescended to come to a fallen world, having agreed to submit to a considerable reduction in our premortal powers. As we came to earth, separated from the presence of heavenly parents, we died spiritually (see Helaman 14:16) and, in a sense, we were "orphaned." And now, with memory veiled, and much reduced from our premortal estate--somewhat as aliens in a world that is inimical to our spiritual natures--we may carry an insecurity, a self-pain that pervades much of our emotional life. Like Adam and Eve, we feel our self-consciousness or spiritual nakedness. The scriptures teach about this nakedness as a feeling of guilt or shame (see 2 Nephi 9:14, Mormon 9:5). Do we have a sense of loss from deeply buried memories of who we once were in contrast with who we are now? But here is my main question: Is it possible that in our efforts to find security, we have fallen into a number of errors? Is it possible that we have created the whole issue of self-esteem in an attempt to soothe this fallen, homesick self?<br><br>But there is a better way. Our Savior, who felt all this pain himself (Alma 7:11–13), would not send us to earth without compensation for the distresses he knew we would feel, separated from him. He would not leave us comfortless. You recall the passages in John in which the Savior has told the Twelve that he will be with them only a little while (John 13:33). Peter responds with, "Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake" (John 13:37). Jesus senses their pain, almost their desperation, at his leaving them. He promises, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" (John 14:18). The English word<i>comfortless</i>translates the Greek word for "orphans": "I will not leave you orphaned." The Savior continued,<br><br><i>If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him....</i><br><br><i>. . . my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</i>[John 14:23, 27]<br><br>Here we grasp the stunning insight that the Lord Jesus Christ himself is that consolation, that compensation, designed from the foundation of the world to comfort the human pain of fallenness, to compensate men and women for their earthly reductions and sacrifices. Only the Atonement, or more expressly, the<i>At-one-ment,</i>can heal the pain of the Fall.<br><br>Now to the second source of pain: The Lord explained, speaking to Adam: "When [thy children] begin to grow up, sin conceiveth in their hearts, and they taste the bitter" (Moses 6:55). What is this bitterness? The Lord says it is the conception of sin in our hearts. The pain of fallenness, then, is compounded by the bitterness of sin.<br><br>To understand why sin produces bitterness in the human soul, we remember that each individual spirit was begotten by glorious heavenly parents and thereby inherits a nature that is at its very core light, truth, intelligence, and glory (D&amp;amp;C 93:23, 29, 36). "Knowest thou not," the Prophet John Taylor wrote, "that thou art a spark of Deity, struck from the fire of his eternal blaze, and brought forth in the midst of eternal burnings?" ("Origin, Object, and Destiny of Women,"<i>The Mormon</i>3 (28): 3, 29 August 1857). Christ says, "I am the true light that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye could not abound" (D&amp;amp;C 88:50). Christ is the life and the light of every person (John 1:4, 9). King Benjamin teaches similarly that God preserves us from day to day, lending us breath, that we may live and move--even supporting us from one moment to another (see Mosiah 2:21), and that all we have and are come from him (see Mosiah 4:21).<br><br>I ask, if we live and move and have our being in him (see Acts 17:28), where is self-esteem? How do I even separate my self out from the abundant grace that makes my life and even my intellect go forward in some marvelous symbiosis with my Creator?<br><br>Is it not obvious that we, created out of the very stuff of truth and permeated by his power, cannot live against our own natures of light and truth and intelligence without setting up conflict and spiritual disease within ourselves? The quality of our emotional and spiritual existence is absolutely governed by divine law, and whether or not we know about these laws, or observe them, we are continually and profoundly affected by them. I suggest that at the base of much low self-esteem lies not only spiritual conflict but a deep self-disapproval, whether conscious or not, over neglect of the spiritual laws that govern happiness and freedom.<br><br>So here we have a challenging situation: a person, whose primeval nature is truth and light and purity, begins, under the influence of a fallen environment and a fallen body, to act against his spiritual nature. His sins of ignorance or choice produce bitterness, and he begins to suffer--but usually he doesn't know what the real source of his unhappiness is. He thinks it has something to do with the people around him, or he thinks it has to do with his circumstances. But Elder Neal A. Maxwell observes: "The heaviest load we feel is often from the weight of our unkept promises and our unresolved sins, which press down relentlessly upon us" (<i>CR,</i>October 1989, p. 106; also, "Murmur Not,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1989, p. 85).<br><br>Resistance to our spiritual natures manifests itself as guilt, despair, resentment, self-pity, fear, depression, feelings of victimization, fear over the scarcity of needed things, and other forms of distress. These are all functions of the fallen self, and we all necessarily experience them. But the pursuit of self-esteem will not solve the problems of the self that is in conflict because of sin. It will not even solve the problems of those who suffer from others' sins against them.<br><br>King Benjamin called this fallen self the natural man:<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</i>[Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>Could this putting off of the natural man through the Lord Jesus Christ actually be a recovery of our true, premortal self?<br><br>We have this account of King Benjamin's people, who, upon hearing the word of God, became painfully conscious of their carnal state. They cried out, "O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins" (Mosiah 4:2). Whereupon their sensitive souls were cleansed by the Holy Spirit, top to bottom, of all their accumulations of willfulness and disobedience; into that vacuum rushed the sublime love of God. They received "peace of conscience, because of the[ir] exceeding faith... in Jesus Christ" (Mosiah 4:3). They probably had not realized just how spiritually sluggish they were until that Mighty Power consumed in love all their sins and their pain and their sickness and their infirmity. They became acquainted with God's goodness and tasted his love.<br><br>King Benjamin, seeing their joy, taught them how to retain it:<br><br><i>I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you....</i><br><br><i>. . . if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins.</i>[Mosiah 4:11–12]<br><br>What does the Lord mean by the nothingness of man? We recoil at nothingness because we try so hard to overcome our feelings of unimportance. But nothingness refers to man's state in this mortal sphere (see Mosiah 4:5). Nothingness describes not man's lack of value, but rather his powerlessness during his mortal probation and, especially, his all-encompassing need for the Lord. Nothingness reminds us of the reductions we voluntarily subscribed to before the foundations of this world in order to come to earth and learn how to be taught from on high.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott recently told of a sacred experience when strong impressions came to him during a period when he struggled to do a work the Lord had given him far beyond his personal capacity to fulfill. The Lord said to him, "Testify to instruct, edify, and lead others to full obedience, not to demonstrate anything of self. All who are puffed up shall be cut off." And then the Lord said to him, "'You are nothing in and of yourself, Richard.' That was followed with some specific counsel on how to be a better servant" ("Acquiring Spiritual Knowledge,"<i>BYU 1992–93 Devotional and Fireside Speeches</i>[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, 1993], p. 155).<br><br>You remember Ammon, who joyfully described his own nothingness:<br><br><i>I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.</i><br><br><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.</i>[Alma 26:11–12]<br><br>For Ammon, it seems, the whole concept of self-esteem was irrelevant. Being filled with the love of God was of far greater worth than any sense of self-confidence. If one grand objective of earth life is to gain access to the grace of Jesus Christ for our trials and divine development, then we will immediately realize that self-confidence is a puny substitute for God-confidence.<br><br>With respect to confidence, the Lord says, "Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men,... let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God" (D&amp;amp;C 121:45).<br><br>The Lord identifies love and virtue as the essential ingredients in feelings of confidence and security. By these we dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel (see 1 Nephi 22:28).<br><br>Indeed, might the pursuit of self-confidence actually pull us away from the connection the Lord is trying to make? Might it merely produce "carnal security" (2 Nephi 28:21)?<br><br>Have you noticed that the pursuit of self-esteem seems to produce anxiety, whereas increasing humility and faith in the Lord produces consolation and rest? Mormon describes Church members who, waxing "stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ," are filled with joy and consolation (Helaman 3:35). Alma instructs his son to teach the people to humble themselves and "to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls" (Alma 37:34).<br><br>Some may not like the dichotomy between the pursuit of self-esteem and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Some may say that you can pursue and have both. But I do not find this idea of both pursuits in the scriptures. It seems to me that King Benjamin finds these two incompatible. He said to remember your own nothingness and God's goodness. In trying to have both, is there a possible double-mindedness? James says that a double-minded man is "unstable in all his ways" (James 1:8). Nephi says of self-promotion:<br><br><i>Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.</i><br><br><i>Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity they were nothing.</i>[2 Nephi 26:29–30]<br><br>Nephi seems to view setting oneself up for a light to the world in order to get praise as directly antithetical to having the pure love of Christ. One apparently can't do both. The Savior says, "Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up" (3 Nephi 18:24). In Doctrine and Covenants 88, verse 67, again he says that if our eye be single to his glory, our whole bodies will be filled with light: "Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him" (D&amp;amp;C 88:68). It seems as though the less attention we can give to self-esteem, the more light we can have.<br><br>Low self-esteem is often associated with feelings of incapacity, or a sense of victimization, or the realization that we can't make happen the opportunities, the approval, the feelings, etc., that we feel we need. But our relief comes when we realize that God made us powerless so that as we cleaved unto him, he could work his mighty miracles in our lives. Indeed, Moroni teaches that hopelessness and despair come of that iniquity which is lack of faith in one's access to the Lord Jesus Christ (see Moroni 10:22–23).<br><br>We may think that we or some other mortal opens the necessary doors to our future, but this conclusion is an error: We ourselves do not open these doors; only the Lord does. We give him our obedience, our diligence, our cooperation, but he opens and closes the doors. We can only make right choices; he controls the consequences of our choices.<br><br>Often doors have closed before us that seemed to lead to the opportunities we thought we had to have. We assumed that the closed door was a reflection of some inadequacy in ourselves. But perhaps the closed door had nothing to do with whether we were good or bad or capable or incompetent. Rather, a loving Father shapes, even now, our path according to a prearranged, premortal covenant (see Abraham 2:8). The opening or the closing of these various doors is absolutely dependent on the Lord's perfect perception of our developmental needs. All the elements that we really need for our individual experience here, he puts onto our path. The most important things that will happen to us in this life will come to us often by no initiative of our own, but they come because he is piloting the plan. He says that he does nothing save it be for our benefit (see 2 Nephi 26:24); he has promised that all things work together to our good in order that we may be conformed to the image of his Son (see Romans 8:28–29).<br><br>Therefore, one does not need to fear that one's future lies in the fact that an authority over us plays favorites, or that one's employer isn't well-disposed toward him. Under such a belief, one might be tempted to think that only self-promotion, or image manipulation, or compromising of what one really believes will open the doors one needs to open. But even though someone in authority thinks he opens doors, there is really only one Keeper of the Gate (see 2 Nephi 9:41). "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper," he says, "This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord" (3 Nephi 22:17).<br><br>Now, I ask you, as various doors open and close, as the Lord Jesus Christ orchestrates even the details of our lives, where is the need to pursue self-esteem? We don't need it. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will take us farther.<br><br>Christ himself is our model where the self is concerned. Hear the manner in which he presents himself. He says,<br><br>1. "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise" (John 5:19).<br><br>2. "I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things" (John 8:28).<br><br>3. "The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works" (John 14:10).<br><br>You remember that Moroni wrote that the resurrected, perfected Christ spoke to him in "plain humility" (Ether 12:39). Elder Maxwell observed that "The Savior--the brightest individual ever to walk this planet--never sought to 'prosper' or to 'conquer' 'according to his genius' and 'strength'!" (See Alma 30:17.) ("Out of the Best Faculty," BYU Annual University Conference, 23–26 August 1993, p. 37). Alma identified the precept that man prospers by his own resources as the doctrine of the antichrist (see Alma 30:17).<br><br>It seems to me that the self may actually be an interloper in most of what we do and that we can find relief from the stresses and strains of self-promotion by saying, in effect, "Get thee behind me, Self." I wonder if this is what the Savior means when he says, "He who seeketh to save his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (JST Matthew 10:39). The self seems to be a constant intruder as we strive for selflessness. But President Benson pointed out that "Christ removed self as the force in His perfect life. It was not<i>my</i>will, but<i>thine</i>be done" (<i>CR,</i>5 April 1986, p. 6; also, "Cleansing the Inner Vessel,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1986, p. 6; emphasis in original).<br><br>I have become aware of how demanding of attention the self is. What a lot of prayer and deliberate living it will take for me to remove my self as the force in my life. I have become aware that all my sins rise out of the self-absorption of my heart--impulses rising like the ticking of a clock in their persistent quest for self-promotion, self-defense, and self-gratification. It seems as though a change is needed at the very fountain of my heart out of which all thought and emotion rise. Could I actually come to the point where I could act without calculating my own self-interest all the time? Could I really live my daily life so that I was constantly searching out the Lord's will and drawing down his grace to accomplish it? And when the Lord in his mercy meshes his power with my agency and my effort and brings forth some measure of success, I ask, where is self-esteem? Where is even the need for self-esteem? I feel as though I just want to say instead, "Oh, Lord, increase my faith."<br><br>How then does one appropriately think about oneself? I offer you Elder Enzio Busche's remarks. He said,<br><br><i>A disciple of Christ is . . . constantly, even in the midst of all regular activities, striving all day long through silent prayer and contemplation to be in the depth of self-awareness to keep him in the state of meekness and lowliness of heart.</i>["Truth Is the Issue,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1993, p. 25]<br><br>It seems appropriate as well to be conscious of our preciousness to our Father and at the same time to feel meek and lowly before his sacrifices on our behalf, his reverence for us, and his continuing graciousness to us. Again, Elder Busche spoke of the point at which we realize the Lord's love:<br><br><i>This is the place where we suddenly see the heavens open as we feel the full impact of the love of our Heavenly Father, which fills us with indescribable joy. With this fulfillment of love in our hearts, we will never be happy anymore just by being ourselves or living our own lives. We will not be satisfied until we have surrendered our lives into the arms of the loving Christ, and until He has become the doer of all our deeds and He has become the speaker of all our words.</i>[Busche, "Truth," p. 26]<br><br>When Christ is the doer of all our deeds and the speaker of all our words, I have to ask, where is self-esteem? Where is the need of self-esteem? I propose that self-esteem becomes a nonissue for the person who is perfecting his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>If I decide to give up some of the attention my self demands, what will I replace it with? The Lord answers, "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not" (D&amp;amp;C 6:36). The self is so demanding that perhaps one can only let go of the pursuit of self-promotion as one cleaves to the Lord Jesus Christ (see Omni 1:26). Like Peter walking on the water, it may be our sudden self-consciousness that will cause us to fall (see Matthew 14:30).<br><br>The world speaks of self-image, but Alma spoke of receiving the image of God in our countenances (see Alma 5:14). In fact, as the<i>Lectures on Faith</i>inform us,<br><br><i>All those who keep his commandments shall grow up from grace to grace, and become . . . joint heirs with Jesus Christ; possessing the same mind, being transformed into the same image..., even the express image of him who fills all in all; being filled with the fullness of his glory, and become one in him, even as the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one.</i>[<i>Lectures on Faith</i>5:2]<br><br>It seems as though the perception of the self as an entity separate from God will, under the right conditions, just get thinner and thinner.<br><br>President Benson has pressed us to be changed for Christ, captained by Christ, and consumed in Christ (see "Born of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>July 1989, p. 5). We might ask, what is it that must be consumed? Maybe it is our old concept of self, the one we have learned from the precepts of men. Is it possible that the pursuit of self-esteem might delay this mighty change? Indeed, what if one ceased defining self-esteem or justifying one's pursuit of it, and just ignored it? What if, instead, one just began to obey whatever divine instruction he was not obeying, to sacrifice whatever needed sacrificing, and to consecrate whatever he was holding back? What if he just set out to "seek this Jesus" (Ether 12:41)?<br><br>So many issues that revolve around the subject of self fade like the dew in the sun as one cultivates faith in the Savior. Without him, nothing else matters. No amount of self-esteem or anything else can adequately fill the void.<br><br>I'll close with some thoughts of Robert Browning, quoted by President David O. McKay:<br><br><i>There is an answer to the passionate longings of the heart for fullness...: Live in all things outside yourself by love, and you will have joy. That is the life of God; it ought to be our life. In him it is accomplished and perfect; but in all created things it is a lesson learned slowly and through difficulty.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>Cherished Experiences,</i>comp. Clare Middlemiss (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1976), p. 161]<br><br>One who practices faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will find relief from the stresses and anxieties of the pursuit of self-esteem. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.
