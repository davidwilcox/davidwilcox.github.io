<h1>l Stability: Constancy Amid Change - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I pray for an interest in your prayers and your faith in us.<br><br>As I prayed and pondered for inspiration and guidance as to what would be appropriate to say to you tonight, my thoughts have been centered on<i>you</i>--the youth of Zion, or young adults of Zion, or young marrieds of Zion.<i>You</i>all are children of a loving Father in Heaven, born into the world at this challenging time. You were reserved for this particular period, after the true gospel of our Lord and Savior had been divinely restored. It is<i>you</i>on whom an awesome responsibility is placed. Mankind--because of its past and present failures--will soon need to look to you for solutions.<br><br>Today is the first Sunday of the new year. Today is the first Sunday of a new decade. There are 365 clean pages for your history. How will they read? The Savior only had 3 years to establish his work.<br><br>As we turn the corner into the 1980s the world is flooded with warning signals cautioning trouble ahead: political upheavals in vital areas of the world; ancient religions becoming inflamed; energy not only short, but the solution to this problem moving at a snail's pace; inflation spreading unabated worldwide.<br><br>There is no solution to the evils of the world except the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus, the hope of the world is in the lives of the youth of Zion--in your faith in a living God, your faith in His son our Savior, your faith and continuous involvement with affection in His restored Church. The principle of faith is as firm as the pillars of heaven. As you exercise your faith and use the gift of the Holy Ghost, you will influence people and influence events; some of you will influence important world decisions. That day will come.<br><br>We pray for you. We believe in you. We have faith you will be equal to the opportunities that lie ahead. Today mankind is losing ground in producing a moral society, a society that can keep our country going and free and strong, a society of mature adults who understand responsibility, integrity, and character.<br><br>Today some say we have lost our heroes. But we in the Church not only live gospel principles, we have Church heroes to emulate. Jesus said, "For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done" (John 13:15).<br><br>President Nathan Eldon Tanner, who had originally planned to speak tonight, is unable to be here. He, as is President Spencer W. Kimball and President Marion G. Romney, is as near perfect an example of the integrity and character so needed by mankind--not just in words, but by their lives. You, the youth of Zion, have heroes at home in your fathers and also leading the Church.<br><br>A few months ago President Spencer W. Kimball said of President Tanner on the occasion of his receiving the "Giant In Our City" award at a large civic banquet sponsored by state and city officials as well as the State business community:<br><br><i>How does one go about saying the proper things about a man like President Nathan Eldon Tanner? All that is said seems to be so little and weak and inexpressive for this grand man for all seasons, for all climates, and for all situations. Certainly Nathan Eldon Tanner is a man to match our mountains: tall, rugged, unyielding, immeasurable.</i><br><br><i>As the oldest of eight children, he assumed responsibility and grew to maturity in a rural area where he first taught school and moved up gradually to university status. His lovely, charming, and cooperative wife, Sara Merrill, and their five beautiful daughters went with him as they left their home in Cardston and moved to Edmonton where he began his political career. There he became a cabinet minister and served as speaker of the Alberta Legislature. He was called to serve as Minister of Lands and Mines in the provincial cabinet and was chairman of the Alberta Research Council. This leadership was natural for Nathan Eldon Tanner as he served as chairman of this council and also on the board of governors of the University of Alberta. Always active in Scouting, he served as Provincial Commissioner of Scouting for Alberta.</i><br><br><i>Nathan Eldon Tanner has become a great leader in industry, business, and education. His roots are planted in the foothills of Canada where he became renowned. Following his resignation from government service, he organized and became president of Merrill Petroleum. Then when TransCanada Pipelines needed a man of unusual courage, stamina, and vision to forge its way ahead, he became its president and guided its destiny.</i><br><br><i>He had gained experience in many fields in cities, towns, provincial government offices, and now industrial developments. Everywhere and in every field they found Nathan Eldon Tanner a man of clear thinking, trained, able, and experienced.</i><br><br><i>Having spent most of his life in Canada engaged in government service and in industry, he is held in high regard there by Church members and nonmembers alike, where he became known as "Mr. Integrity."</i><br><br><i>His rise to importance was also in the spiritual field. He began as a branch president, a bishop, and then the first president of the Calgary Stake. His superior knowledge and experience brought him to Salt Lake City to help preside over the vast expanse of the Church in the nations of the world, and here in Church Headquarters he has given leadership over the financial interests of the Church.</i><br><br><i>Soon after his call as a General Authority, he was assigned as president of the West European Mission; since then he has assisted in the leadership of the entire Church, where he is loved and appreciated by its millions of members. As a counselor to its last four presidents he has helped to give guidance and direction to the Church.</i><br><br><i>This is a man of rare makeup: as approachable as a child, as wise as a father, as loving as a gentle brother; he has not shunned any obligation of which he was aware as a father, friend, and brother, or as a businessman, citizen, or civic leader, or as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. May he have health and long life and every needed blessing with his loved ones this day, always, and forever.</i><br><br>Thus our prophet characterized his first counselor, President Tanner, who planned a timely message for you tonight, which I will attempt to give.<br><br>Says President Tanner:<br><br><i>During the World War II a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Albert E. Bowen, wrote a book, compiled from a series of radio addresses which he entitled</i>Constancy Amid Change.<i>The messages of these talks were very timely. We were a world in conflict, and people the world over needed a message of certainty, assurance, and stability.</i><br><br><i>This present era seems very similar in many ways to those turbulent war years. Today we face many perplexing issues. In addition to significant international political problems, we are experiencing one of the most difficult economic periods we have faced in many decades--the problem of inflation and personal financial management.</i><br><br>Borrowing the title of Elder Bowen's book, President Tanner shares with us some experiences and convictions which he has drawn over the sixty years of his working life.<br><br>He has lived during each phase of the economic cycle. As a young man getting started in life, he experienced personal depression. He has experienced a national and international depression, as well as periods of recession and inflation. He has watched so-called solutions come and go with each change in the economic cycle. These experiences led him to the same convictions as Robert Frost, who said, "Most of the change we think we see in life is due to truths being in and out of favor."<br><br>We share with you tonight some of President Tanner's observations about<i>constant</i>and<i>fundamental</i>principles which, if followed, will bring financial security and peace of mind under any economic circumstances.<br><br>First he says, "Build a foundation and establish a perspective within which these economic principles must be applied."<br><br>One day a grandson of President Tanner's approached him and said, "I have observed you and other successful men, and I have made up my mind that I want to be a success in my life. I want to interview as many successful people as I can to determine what made them successful. So looking back over your experience, Grandpa, what do you believe is the most important element of success?"<br><br>President Tanner replied that the Lord gave the greatest success formula he knew of: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matt. 6:33).<br><br>Some argue that some men prosper financially who do<i>not</i>seek the kingdom first. This is true. But the Lord is not promising us just material wealth if we seek first the kingdom. In the words of Henrik Ibsen, "Money may be the husk of many things, but not the kernel. It brings you food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness; days of joy, but not peace or happiness."<br><br>President Tanner continues:<br><br><i>Material blessings are a part of the gospel if they are achieved in the proper way and for the right purpose. I am reminded of an experience of President Hugh B. Brown. As a young soldier in World War I, he was visiting an elderly friend in the hospital. This friend was a millionaire several times over who, at the age of eighty, was lying at death's door. Neither his divorced wife nor any of his five children cared enough to come to the hospital to see him. As President Brown thought of the things his friend had lost, which money could not buy, and noted his tragic situation and the depth of his misery, he asked his friend how he would change the course of his life if he had it to live over again.</i><br><br><i>The old gentleman, who died a few days later, said: "As I think back over my life, the most important and valuable asset which I might have had, but which I lost in the process of accumulating my millions, was the simple faith my mother had in God and in the immortality of the soul. You ask me what is the most valuable thing in life. I cannot answer you in better words than those used by a poet." This dying man asked President Brown to get a little book out of his briefcase from which he read a poem entitled "I'm an Alien."</i><br><br><i>I'm an alien to the faith my mother taught me.</i><br><i>I'm a stranger to the God that heard my mother when she cried.</i><br><i>I'm an alien to the comfort that "Now I lay me" brought me.</i><br><i>To the everlasting arms that held my father when he died.</i><br><br><i>When the great world came and called me, I deserted all to follow.</i><br><i>Never noting in my blindness I had slipped my hand from His,</i><br><i>Never dreaming in my dazedness that the bubble, fame, is hollow,</i><br><i>That the wealth of Gold is tinsel, as I since have learned it is.</i><br><br><i>I have spent a lifetime seeking things I spurned when I found them,</i><br><i>I have fought and been rewarded in many a winning cause</i><br><i>But I'd give it all, fame and fortune and the pleasures that surround them,</i><br><i>If I only had the faith that made my mother what she was.</i><br><br><i>That was the dying testimony of a man who was born in the Church but had drifted far from it. That was the broken-hearted cry of a lonely man who could have anything money could buy, but who had lost the most important things in life in order to accumulate this world's goods.</i>[<i>Continuing the Quest,</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1961), pp. 32-35.]<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Jacob gives us some important counsel on this matter:<br><br><i>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye first the kingdom of God.</i><br><br><i>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</i>[Jacob 2:18–19]<br><br>The solid foundation and lofty perspective President Tanner is teaching us are these: We must first seek the kingdom--work and plan and spend wisely and plan for the future, and use what wealth we are blessed with to help build up that kingdom. When guided by this eternal perspective and by building on this firm foundation, we can pursue with confidence our daily task and our life's work, which must be carefully planned and diligently pursued.<br><br>It is within this framework that President Tanner outlines his five principles of economic constancy.<br><br><i>Constancy number one:</i>Pay an honest tithing.<i>I often wonder if we realize that paying our tithing does not represent giving gifts to the Lord and the Church. Paying tithing is discharging a debt to the Lord. The Lord is the source of all our blessings, including life itself.</i><br><br><i>The payment of tithing is a commandment, a commandment with a promise. If we obey this commandment we are promised. If we obey this commandment, we are promised that we will "prosper in the land." This prosperity consists of more than material goods--it may include enjoying good health and vigor of mind. It includes family solidarity and spiritual increase. I hope those of you not presently paying your full tithe will seek the faith and strength to do so. As you discharge this obligation to your maker, you will find great, great happiness, the like of which is known only by those who are faithful to this commandment.</i><br><br><i>Constancy number two:</i>Live on less than you earn.<i>I have discovered that there is no way that you can ever earn more than you can spend. I am convinced that it is not the amount of money an individual earns that brings peace of mind as much as it is having control of his money. Money can be an obedient servant but a harsh taskmaster. Those who structure their standard of living to allow a little surplus control their circumstances. Those who spend a little more than they earn are controlled by their circumstances. They are in bondage. President Heber J. Grant once said, "If there is any one thing that is grinding and discouraging and disheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet"</i>(<i>Gospel Standards</i>[Comp. G. Homer Durham. Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1940], p.111).<br><br><i>The key to spending less than we earn is simple--it is called discipline. Whether early in life or late, we must all eventually learn to discipline ourselves, our appetites, and our economic desires. How blessed is he who learns to spend less than he earns, and puts something away for a rainy day.</i><br><br>Continuing with constancy number three President Tanner says, "<i>Learn to distinguish between needs and wants.</i>Consumer appetites are manmade. Our competitive free enterprise system produces unlimited goods and services to stimulate our desire to want more convenience and luxuries."<br><br>I am reminded of a wife who announced to her tired, hungry husband that she couldn't fix any dinner because the electricity was off. To this her husband replied, "But, dear, we have a gas stove." And her reply was, "Yes, but with the power off the can opener won't work."<br><br>We don't criticize the system or the availability of these goods or services. We are only concerned about our people using sound judgment in their purchases. We must learn that sacrifice is a vital part of our eternal discipline.<br><br>In this and many other countries, many parents and children born since World War II have known only prosperous conditions. Many have been conditioned to instant gratification. There have been ample job opportunities for all who are capable of working. Yesterday's luxuries, for most, are considered today's necessities.<br><br>This is typified by young couples who expect to furnish their homes and provide themselves with luxuries as they begin their marriage that their parents managed to acquire only after many years of struggle and sacrifice. By wanting too much too soon, young couples may succumb to easy credit plans, thereby plunging themselves into serious debt. This would keep them from having the financial means necessary to do as the Church suggests in the matter of food storage and other security programs.<br><br>Overindulgence and poor money management place a heavy strain on marriage relationships. Most marital problems, it seems, originate from economic roots--either insufficient income to sustain the family or mismanagement of the income earned.<br><br>One young father came to his bishop for financial counseling and told an all-too-frequent story:<br><br>"Bishop, I have been well trained as an engineer, and I earn a good salary. It seems that all through school I was taught how to make money but no one taught me how to manage money."<br><br>While we believe, President Tanner continues, that<br><br><i>it is desirable for every student to take classes in consumer education, the primary training rests with the parents. Parents should not leave this vital training to chance or transfer the responsibility entirely to our public schools and universities.</i><br><br><i>An important part of this training should be to explain debt. For most of us there are two kinds of financial debt--consumer debt and investment or business debt. Consumer debt refers to buying on credit those things we use or consume in daily living. Examples would include installment buying of clothes, appliances, furniture, etc. Consumer debt is secured by mortgaging our future earnings. This can be very dangerous. If we are out of work, disabled, or encounter serious emergencies, we have difficulties meeting our obligations. Installment buying is the most expensive way to purchase. To the cost of the goods we buy must be added heavy interest and handling or service charges.</i><br><br><i>We realize that young families find it necessary at times to purchase on credit. But we caution you not to buy more than is truly necessary. Skilled advertisers can create a desire to own nonessentials. Pay off your debts as quickly as possible. When money is tight, as it is now, avoid the extra burden of additional interest charges.</i><br><br><i>Investment debt should be fully secured so as not to encumber family security. Don't invest in speculative ventures. The spirit of speculation can become intoxicating. Many fortunes have been wiped out by the uncontrolled appetite to accumulate more and more. Let us learn from the sorrows of the past and avoid enslaving our time, energy, and general health to a gluttonous appetite to acquire increased material goods.</i><br><br>President Kimball has given this thought-provoking counsel:<br><br><i>The Lord has blessed us as a people with a prosperity unequaled in times past. The resources that have been placed in our power are good, and necessary to our work here on the earth. But I am afraid that many of us have been surfeited with flocks and herds and acres and barns and wealth and have begun to worship them as false gods, and they have power over us. Do we have more of these good things than our faith can stand? Many people spend most of their time working in the service of a self-image that includes sufficient money, stocks, bonds, investment portfolios, property, credit cards, furnishings, automobiles, and the like to guarantee carnal security throughout, they hope, a long and happy life. Forgotten is the fact that our assignment is to use these many resources in our families and quorums to build up the kingdom of God.</i><br><br>By way of testimony, President Tanner adds this to President Kimball's statement: "I know of no situation where happiness and peace of mind have increased with the amassing of property beyond the reasonable wants and needs of the family."<br><br>President Tanner's Constancy number four:<i>"Develop and live within a budget."</i>A friend of President Tanner's has a daughter who went overseas with a BYU Study Abroad program for a semester. She was constantly writing home for more money. His concern was such that the father called her long distance and questioned her about the need for additional funds. At one point in the conversation the daughter explained, "But Dad, I can tell you where every penny you have sent me has been spent." He replied, "You don't seem to get the point. I'm interested in a budget--a plan for spending--not in a diary of where the money has gone."<br><br>Perhaps parents should be more like the father of the college boy who wired home: "No Mon, No Fun, Your Son." His father wired back: "How Sad, Too Bad, Your Dad."<br><br>"It has been my observation," President Tanner continues,<br><br><i>in interviewing many people throughout the years that far too many people do not have a workable budget and have not disciplined themselves to abide by its provisions. Many people think a budget robs them of their freedom. On the contrary, successful people have learned that a budget makes real economic freedom possible.</i><br><br><i>Budgeting and financial management need not be overly complicated or time consuming. The story is told of an immigrant father who kept his accounts payable in a shoe box, his accounts receivable on a spindle, and his cash in the cash register.</i><br><br><i>"I don't see how you can run your business this way," said his son. "How do you know what your profit is?"</i><br><br><i>"Son," replied the immigrant father, "When I got off the boat, I had only the pants I was wearing. Today your sister is an art teacher, your brother is a doctor, and you're an accountant. I have a car, a home, and a good business. Everything is paid for. So you add it all up, subtract the pants, and there's my profit."</i><br><br>As President Tanner continues his advice he says,<br><br><i>Wise financial counselors teach that there are four different elements to any good budget. Provision should be made first for basic operating needs such as food, clothing, and, in your case, here at this university, your educational costs; second, for home equity; third, for emergency needs such as savings, health insurance, and life insurance; and fourth, for wise investment and a storage program for the future.</i><br><br><i>Nothing seems so certain as the unexpected in our lives. With rising medical costs, health insurance is the only way most families can meet serious accident, illness or maternity costs, particularly those for premature births. Life insurance provides income continuation when the provider unexpectedly or prematurely dies. Every family should make provision for proper health and life insurance.</i><br><br><i>After these basics are met we should, by frugal management, regularly save to create funds for investments. It has been my observation that few people have been successful with investments who have not first developed the habit of saving regularly. This requires discipline and discriminating judgment. There are many ways to invest. But you must choose wisely your investment counselors. Be sure they merit your confidence with a proven successful investment record.</i><br><br>President Tanner's constancy number five:<i>"Be honest in all your financial affairs.</i>The ideal of integrity will never go out of style. It applies to all we do. As leaders and members of the Church we should be the epitome of integrity."<br><br>As I have studied this timely and sincere advice of President Tanner given for your benefit, I have hoped that each of you will be blessed with the wisdom to make it meaningful in your lives. It is given by one who loves the Lord, who loves His gospel, who labors for its success, and who has proven himself to all who know him.<br><br>He is known as "Mr. Integrity." He understands "seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness" and has witnessed the fulfilling of the Lord's promise that "all these things shall be added unto you" as needed and prudent.<br><br>President Kimball said, "Where there is integrity, there is character, and thus quality is indispensable in our work."<br><br>The Lord inspires his servants to teach and inspire you so you will not be found unprepared nor afraid.<br><br>The Lord, in a revelation to Joseph Smith in 1841, during those tense and critical days, said, "Blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me" (D&amp;amp;C 124:15).<br><br>May you understand the constancy of truth. The gospel of Jesus Christ is true. It is the Lord's way. This is His restored Church. Any sincere seeker can know for himself by study and prayer and seeking the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The work will expand more successfully as people see the principles of the gospel at work in the lives of members.<br><br>May you have a desire to follow the leaders of the Church. May you love God, love your neighbors as yourselves. Remember, on these commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<br><br>For this, I pray as I declare that God lives, Jesus is the Christ, this is His true Church, Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet. This testimony I leave with you in great sincerity. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David B. Haight was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 January 1980.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>hy Father and Thy Mother” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a great privilege to be with you today. I take delight in sharing this opportunity with you students and missionaries; it's a great honor to be in your presence.<br><br>Introductions are always interesting and sometimes a concern for me. Several years ago, while serving as a member of the Sunday School General Board, I attended a stake conference where I received an introduction that I shall not soon forget.<br><br>When I arrived at the airport, a counselor in the stake presidency was there to meet me, and he greeted me with the words: "I'm surely happy you've arrived. I've been anxious to see what you looked like." He smiled a curious smile, I smiled one in return, and we left for the stake center.<br><br>Several times during the two days of conference, the stake presidency exchanged knowing looks. During the follow-up meeting with Elder Thomas S. Monson and the stake presidency, the counselor who had met me at the airport handed a letter to Elder Monson with the comment, "Perhaps you'd like to know how they've introduced the member of the general board who attended our conference." Elder Monson then read: "This is to introduce Brother Rex D. Pinegar, currently an assistant professor of special education at Brigham Young University, and formerly a mentally retarded teacher."<br><br>About all I could respond with was, "At least it said 'formerly.'"<br><br>Elder Monson has had a lot of fun with that introduction many times since. He later sent me that written introduction with a memo saying, "Thought you would like to have my copy of the most interesting biographical outline a Sunday School General Board member I have yet read."<br><br>(Perhaps I should explain that my career as a teacher had included several years of teaching students with various types of mental retardation.)<br><br>Knowing who you are at Church headquarters is sometimes a challenge also. Each of us seems to have our own double. Elder Neal A. Maxwell had given one of his brilliant, stimulating talks at a session of general conference. As I stepped up to meet my wife following the session, a woman came rushing to me and congratulated me on my excellent message. I hesitated in responding, as I had not spoken in that session. Seeing my embarrassment she said, "Oh, I'm sorry Elder Rector, I thought you were Elder Maxwell." You just have to keep track of who you really are.<br><br>There is no group of people I love or admire more than the young adults of the Church, perhaps because I have four of my own numbered among you. I see exemplified in them and in you great strengths of character and purpose. Because of your strength, I have confidence in our future.<br><br>In my assignment I have many opportunities to associate with the splendid young men and women of the Church. My experiences with the Missionary Department and now with the Young Men of the Church provide me with daily examples of faith and courage and strength of character.<br><br>Recently I have had some experiences with young men and women that I believe exemplify this strength in youth and young adults of the Church and that lead me to the thoughts and message I would like to share with you today.<br><br>While in Canada recently, I was happy to meet a young man serving as a missionary whom I had interviewed some years before. He had wanted so much to serve a mission, but his parents were against his doing so. He felt torn, knowing the prophet's counsel that every worthy young man should serve a mission, yet also knowing the Lord's commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother." He wanted to do what was right, and he wanted me to tell him what to do. I counseled him to go home and live worthily for a mission call and to honor his parents by abiding by their wishes. And that is what he did. I didn't hear any more from this young man until I saw him on my visit to Canada. Now he was a missionary, serving with his parents' approval and support. "Elder Pinegar is a prophet," he said to the stake president. "He promised me my parents would some day consent to my coming on a mission if I would honor and obey them, and he was right." Now I want to be quick to assure you that I make no claim of being a prophet; but I can promise you, as the prophets have promised, that the Lord's words are true. His commandments are for our good. His promises are sure to those who love him and keep his commandments.<br><br>It is interesting to me that the Lord found it necessary to command us to honor our parents. Why must we be commanded to honor those whom we love? Why do we sometimes become thoughtless and thankless toward our parents who seldom, if ever, stop caring for us, their children?<br><br>One morning some time ago, my wife received a telephone call from a friend in a distant state, a person she had not seen for ten or eleven years. After visiting and renewing their acquaintance for a few moments, this friend said she had called to ask a special favor. She related that she had spent the night in prayer, seeking help in reaching her somewhat rebellious son. As morning approached, my wife's name came to her mind, and this had prompted her telephone call. She asked my wife for the names of persons who could perhaps reach out to her son and touch his life in a positive way. She expressed her love and confidence in her son and said, "I know someday he can be reached, and I don't intend to give up. If I have to stay on my knees throughout eternity, I'll do it, but I will never give up!"<br><br>Good parents feel concern for their children, regardless of age. A great responsibility comes with being a parent. Until that privilege and responsibility comes to you, I believe you cannot fully comprehend the love and concern parents feel for their children. Until you have held your newborn child and realized that the spirit of life within has just come from the presence of God himself; until you have observed its body as a miniature adult in a state of perfection and purity and have promised yourself and the Lord that you will do everything in your power to return this blessed being to its Maker as pure and powerful as it was when God sent it to your care; until you have, as a parents, experienced this wonderful, awesome, humbling, and joyful occasion, you cannot understand the extent of your parents' love for you or of a parent's determination to "never give up." A parent's love never ceases. Remember Alma? How he prayed and pleaded for the return of his son from a life of sin to one of righteousness!<br><br>Some time ago, I was assigned to attend a stake conference in a certain city where a new stake president was called. On Sunday morning this fine, outstanding man, a vice-president of a leading national company, approached the pulpit in a spirit of deep humility. He began his remarks by talking about his father. He had telephoned his father, who lived in a distant city, and asked that he pray for him in his new assignment and calling. His father's answer was, "Son, I've been praying for you all of your life."<br><br>If we are to be able to live the commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother," we must recognize the love our parents have for us. We must have faith in our parents. We must understand that their love and concern for us is usually basic to the hopes and desires they have for us and we have for ourselves. They usually know best. They have been down the path of life. They are not perfect. They may make mistakes in judgment, and they may lack wisdom; however, we will not go wrong by respecting them and heeding their righteous counsel.<br><br>At a stake conference in Idaho, we were talking about the importance of journals. A man had spoken on how important and what a blessing his journal had been to him. Then his fourteen-year-old son responded to what his father's journal meant to him. He said, "As I have read my father's journal, I've discovered that he has had many of the same problems that I have, and he has come out of them all right. It would be my prayer that we all write our journals so that we can turn out to be as good as my dad is." What a great tribute to that man who was an example for his son. This boy had gained from this experience a new love and respect for his father.<br><br>Sometimes the real test of the love of a parent comes in denying us a pleasure of the moment so that we may have, instead, the happiness of eternity. Or a parent may have to stand by and let us struggle with life in order for us to grow in strength and in wisdom.<br><br>One of the favorite stories of our family comes from a true incident in the life of a woman who was the victim of cerebral palsy. The woman tells how as a child she would look forward to meeting her father at the gate of the ranch corral each evening as he returned from rounding up the cattle. He would drive the herd into the corral, close the big gate, and then hoist her up into his arms and steady her hand as she practiced placing the rope over the post to secure the gate. One evening she waited in her usual place by the gate. She watched as the cattle ran into the corral. Then she looked for her father, but he did not come. Panic struck her as she realized the gate must be closed and secured without his steadying hand to guide her own. It was with great effort and struggle that she tried over and over again to slide the rope up and over the gate post. With great concentration and with her strength almost completely exhausted, she finally succeeded. As she completed what was for her a very difficult task, she looked up to see her father nearby. He had been there for some time watching her determined struggle, wanting to reach out and help her and to steady and guide her hands as he usually did; but he knew she needed that experience. She needed to know she could do the task and thus gain the confidence to try other difficult tasks on her own. As much as he loved her and wanted to make her trial easier, he had to permit her to struggle, to learn through her own efforts the satisfaction that comes from personal sacrifice and achievement.<br><br>As you face your own struggles and challenges, you will most often find that your greatest support and understanding will come from your parents.<br><br>As a young high school boy, I was wrestling in a state tournament, and I was in my usual position--on the bottom. When I looked up from the mat, I spotted a familiar face among the fans in the bleachers. It wasn't a pleasant face. In fact, it was one filled with pain. It was one of a father who was seeing his son on the bottom and who was working with all his energy (at that distance) to get his son on top. Having seen that look on his face, I knew there was only one thing I could do and that was to change my position. From somewhere came the strength I needed. I am quite certain that the young man I was wrestling was as surprised as I was when he found that I was on the top and that he had suddenly lost the match. Immediately the look on the face of my father changed; and a smile, a sense of accomplishment, and a sense of satisfaction were there instead. The encouragement from that parent, and the desire of a son to please his father, had reached to the son and given him strength to change his situation for the better.<br><br>Let us consider the strength that comes from parental support as we look at the life of the boy Joseph Smith. Consider his experience with the Lord, the miraculous experience of having seen the Father and the Son. Following this experience was the visit of the Angel Moroni. Who was the first person Joseph was told to tell about his experience? Not his best friend, not even his girlfriend, not his teacher, not his minister. He was told to go and tell his father (see Joseph Smith--History 1:49). His father's words were, "This is of the Lord. You do what he has told you to do." The Lord taught Joseph to first turn to his parents; and having done so, Joseph received the support of his family.<br><br>We also should turn to our parents, counsel with them, and share with them our ideas, our goals, our plans, and even our problems. We should obey them. Obedience is the greatest measure of our faith in our parents and of our desire to keep the commandments to honor them.<br><br>While I was serving as mission president in Virginia, two of our missionaries met and taught a young man at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg. As they progressed through the discussions, the young man gained a vision of the truth. He received a testimony. He desired to be baptized, but his parents would not permit him to do so. He was very discouraged. He came and sought my counsel. I told him to heed the feelings of his parents, to honor them, and that the time would come when they would allow him to join the Church.<br><br>Several months later I was seated on the stand at stake conference prior to the beginning of the Saturday evening session. Up the aisle came this young man--bright, shining, his face just beaming. As he approached me he said, "President, you'll never guess what has happened."<br><br>I knew in my heart what the result was, but I said, "Mike, tell me."<br><br>His response was, "You'll never believe it. Not only have my parents permitted me to be baptized tonight, but they are taking the lessons! They are grateful for a Church that teaches its youth to honor their parents. Thanks so much for encouraging me to honor them."<br><br>This kind of experience has been repeated many times for me as I have met with the youth of the Church. There was a girl from Charlottesville, Virginia; a young lady from England; a young man from Toronto, Canada. I have many letters from young people who have kept the commandment to honor their parents and have thereby received the blessings of support and strength of their families as they have joined the Church.<br><br>A young woman with whom I am acquainted was planning to be married. Sound familiar? Her parents were overjoyed. "At last," they said. She was twenty-six years old. She had been very choosey. The whole family rejoiced when she found someone she could agree to marry. The date was set; the invitations were printed; the wedding dress was selected; and the trousseau was ready. Then one evening this young woman sought out her parents. She was very sorry to disappoint them, but she just couldn't go through with it. She could not marry this man.<br><br>Her parents were shocked. "Why?" they asked. "You have so much in common. You enjoy being together. You are perfect for each other. You're in love. And you're twenty-six years old!" Then she explained her feelings to her parents. This man did not honor his mother. The girl had been bothered for a long time by the way he spoke to his mother, by the disrespect he showed her, by his discourtesy. She could not marry this man because some day he might treat her the same way.<br><br>Contrast that with the family where the mother's mother, a young woman not quite sixty years of age, is suddenly stricken with cancer, her life ebbing away--a most difficult situation--and yet the family determined that they would sacrifice their lives to care for her, to meet her every need, to look after that which would make her comfortable during her remaining days. Or consider the young widow who had planned to go to Europe to pick up her son who had just completed his mission. All her children were in Europe. This would be a great occasion. She could visit them all, but she followed the counsel of her father-in-law who said, "I don't feel good about your going." She remained at home.<br><br>We honor our parents most through living a personally righteous life. I realize that some of you may be without parents. Most of you are away from your own parents now. But someone has said that the success of children is the success of their parents. As a parent I can tell you there is no greater honor that can come to me or any parent than to see my children successfully living the teachings of the gospel. Financial success, educational attainments, honors of men--these marks of your success in life are sources of pride to any father and mother. But the real joy and honor comes to them through your faithfulness to the Lord's commandments. In this way we honor not only our parents, but also our Heavenly Father.<br><br>A young man shared with me an experience he had the first day he arrived on this campus, an experience that taught him a valuable lesson. He had left his home and parents and traveled all the way across the United States to attend Brigham Young University when he was just seventeen years old. He left with a feeling of excitement for this opportunity to be on his own. He looked forward to this new independence and "freedom." He was rather happy to be away from the close supervision of his parents. This thought enticed him, for he could now do, or not do, anything he wished.<br><br>As he went into the administration building to get his identification card, one of the first persons he met said to him, "Aren't you the son of--?" and she mentioned his mother's name. "I've known your mother for many years."<br><br>As she expressed her respect and special regard for his mother, this fine young man determined that he would never do anything to disappoint or discredit her--or his father. Being away from his parents had become all the more reason to live as they had taught him and to honor them by living honorably and righteously himself.<br><br>Paul has said, "Honor thy father and thy mother; which is the first commandment with promise [and listen carefully to the promise]; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth" (Eph. 6:2–3). While we bring honor and happiness to our parents through living this great commandment, we, the children, receive the greatest blessings. All that we have and enjoy is the result and evidence of loving parents. Our forebears sacrificed their all to leave us a legacy of freedom and peace. Our ancestors who embraced the gospel suffered hardships and trials to establish for us the true way of life. Our parents gave us our very lives.<br><br>May each of us live righteously so that we may qualify for the blessings that flow to those who honor their parents. May we all honor our parents by having faith in them, by being obedient to their righteous counsel, and by living righteous lives through obedience to the commandments of God.<br><br>I testify to you from personal experience with this commandment that it is truly from God. Obedience to it will result in blessings for others as well as for ourselves. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Rex D.

<br>
The responsibility involved in speaking to this large gathering of university students has been a matter of great concern to me since the invitation came. The music has helped a great deal. I am grateful for these lovely sisters, these missionaries, who have inspired us at the beginning of this meeting.<br><br>Do you remember how nervous and unsettled you felt when you were asked to give a two-and-a-half-minute talk or you were asked to give a Sunday School lesson? If you think those of us who are called to the presiding councils of the Church are free from that anxiety, you are misinformed.<br><br>In your mind, come and stand beside me here at the pulpit for a moment. Look out upon the thousands and thousands of young people assembled in this audience. Do you sense the weight of the responsibility? Do you feel the pressure? I have talked to venerable presidents of the Church, more than one of them, and have been told that even they are not free from that deep feeling of concern.<br><br>You should take comfort in the knowledge that in your anxiety and feeling of inadequacy you are not alone. Those far ahead of you in years and experience, and those carrying the weight of authority far beyond that which you carry now, are not free from it--ever.<br><br>But lest you be discouraged, remember this. When we have prepared the best we can and tried the best we know how, there is a source of great spiritual power, adequate indeed, that will counterbalance our inadequacies and shortcomings and, if we are worthy, will make us better than we are. And on that I rely now.<br><br>I have considered what would be of most worth to you in a time that is very unsettled. I have a great desire to be informative rather than entertaining. Therefore, my talk will not be like a dessert. It will be more like a main course that you will relish to the degree that you are hungry for basic information.<br><br>I quote some deep wisdom from a first-grade student who said to his teacher, "Do we have to do what we want to do again today? We don't want to be teached to play, we want to be teached to learn."<br><br>What I say will have interest to you, I think, to the degree that you want to be "teached" to learn and to the degree that you want to know what you ought to know.<br><br>I want to talk to you about<i>ordinances</i>. Nothing I say will be new. It may be arranged--and that is my hope--in such a way that you will see something in the subject beyond what you have seen before.<br><br>I begin with the third Article of Faith: "We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and<i>ordinances</i>of the Gospel." (Italics added.)<br><br>The Oxford Dictionary gives as the first definition of the word<i>ordinance</i>, "Arrangement in ranks or rows," and as the second definition, "Arrangement in sequence or proper relative position." That may not strike you at the moment as having much religious significance, but indeed it has. The word<i>ordinance</i>also means "a religious or ceremonial observance, an established rite."<br><br>Among the ordinances we perform in the Church are baptism, administering the sacrament, naming and blessing of infants, administering to the sick, setting apart to callings in the Church, and ordaining to offices in the priesthood. And then there are the higher ordinances, performed in the temples. These include the endowment and the sealing ordinance, spoken of generally as temple marriage.<br><br>The word<i>ordinance</i>comes from the word<i>order</i>, which means, again, "a rank, a row, a series."<br><br>The word<i>order</i>appears very frequently in the scriptures. I'll just give a few examples: ". . . established the<i>order</i>of the Church" (Alma 8:1). ". . . all things should be restored to their proper<i>order</i>" (Alma 41:2). Moroni even defined depravity as being "without<i>order</i>" (Moroni 9:18). ". . . all things may be done in<i>order</i>" (D&amp;amp;C 20:68). "Mine house is a house of<i>order</i>" (D&amp;amp;C 132:8).<br><br>We talk often in the Church about the order of the priesthood.<br><br>The third word,<i>ordain,</i>is a close relative to the other two words. It has as its first definition from the Oxford Dictionary, "To put in order, arrange, make ready, prepare" ; and as its second definition, "To appoint or admit to the ministry of the Christian Church . . . by the laying on of hands or other symbolic action."<br><br>From all of this dictionary work there comes the impression that an ordinance, to be valid, must be done in proper order.<br><br><i>Order, Ordain, Ordinance!</i><br><br><i>Order</i>--To put in ranks or rows, in proper sequence or relationship.<br><br><i>Ordain</i>--The process of putting things in rows or proper relationship.<br><br><i>Ordinance</i>--The ceremony by which things are put in proper order.<br><br>Now, about the ordinances of the gospel. How important are they to you as young members of the Church? Can you be happy, can you be redeemed, can you be exalted without them?<br><br>The answer: They are more than advisable or desirable, or even necessary. More, even, than essential or vital, they are<i>crucial</i>to each of us.<br><br>We learn from the revelations that<br><br><i>This greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, in the</i>ordinances<i>thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.</i><br><br><i>And without the</i>ordinances<i>thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:19–21; italics added]<br><br>It is my purpose to fix in your minds so serious an interest in the ordinances of the gospel that you will seek to qualify for each ordinance in proper sequence, to make and keep the covenants that are connected with them, and to make sure that everything in this regard, for you, is in proper order.<br><br>Consider this illustration.<br><br>Suppose an agent came to you with a real bargain in insurance. He claims that his policy offers complete protection. He talks of generous coverage, very low premiums, no penalties for making a claim--even a heavy claim. Other features make the policy look better than any you have considered before. He tells you of the company he claims to represent. You know it to be very reputable. You study the policy and find more offered to you, with less required of you, than any policy you have looked at before. You check carefully on the company and come away satisfied that they are indeed reputable. They do stand behind their policies. Some of your friends have dealt with them for years and have always been satisfied. You, it appears, have found a real bargain.<br><br>But in this imaginary account there is one thing that you did not discover, one hitch. This agent was never hired by that company. They have not authorized him to represent them. The company is not even aware that he is using their name. He obtained copies of the policy and adjusted it to give it a little wider appeal. He had some forms and letterheads printed and set himself up in business. When he writes a policy and collects the premiums, they do not go to the head office. The policy goes into a drawer somewhere, and the premium money into his pocket. Chances are, he figures, there will be no claim against the policy anyway, at least not while he is around. And since it is life insurance, certainly there will be no claim while the policyholder is around.<br><br>You have, as the expression goes, been sold a bill of goods. For all you know, you are well insured. You feel content and suppose that when the day comes, as it surely will, your claim will be paid.<br><br>Too bad for you! No doubt the company will reject your claim. They cannot be compelled to honor policies except those written by authorized agents whom they have hired and certified, no matter<i>how</i>convinced you were that this man was a bona fide agent.<br><br>Will you get sympathy? Oh yes. Full value of the policy? Not a chance! Would you not receive anything? Well, for as long as you didn't know the difference you felt secure, for whatever that is worth.<br><br>My wife has an aged aunt in Brigham City. She is the last of fourteen children. Perhaps seventy-five years ago, Millicent took her little brothers and sisters to town to see the Peach Days Parade. With excitement they walked the long way to town. They hadn't been there long when a horse-drawn water wagon came along, sprinkling the streets to settle the dust. They watched it in awe and were greatly impressed. When it had passed they went home. They thought the parade was over. They were quite satisfied, until they learned the difference.<br><br>If you had been sold the insurance policy we talked about, you might be quite complacent, thinking you were well insured. But oh my, how that gets reversed. Somewhere in later conversations would come the sermon, "You ought to have been more careful about where you put your trust. You should have checked more carefully."<br><br>Now let me apply this illustration to the ordinances of the gospel.<br><br>There are no discounts. No credit buying. Nothing is ever put on sale at special, reduced prices. There is never something for nothing. There is no such thing as a "bargain." You pay full value. Requirements and covenants are involved. And you will get, in due time, full value. But you must, positively must, deal with an authorized agent, or your claims will not be honored.<br><br>Let me quote this very meaningful scripture from section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants.<br><br><i>And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.</i><br><br><i>Behold, mine house is a house of</i>order<i>, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion.</i><br><br><i>Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name?</i><br><br><i>Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed?</i><br><br><i>And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father</i>ordained<i>unto you, before the world was?</i><br><br><i>I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment--that no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God.</i><br><br><i>For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:7–14; italics added]<br><br>That scripture is very clear. He will not receive at our hands that which He has not appointed. And things that are "ordained of men . . . shall not remain . . . in nor after the resurrection."<br><br>Now, I counsel you to take inventory of your spiritual progress. Is your life in order? Have you received the ordinances of the gospel that you should possess by this time in your life? Are they valid? If they come under the influence of the sealing power and authority, they will remain intact eternally; and your life, to this point, is in proper order.<br><br>I want to explain something to you. Sometimes I think this is understood by relatively few in the Church. But<i>you</i>should understand it. Again I make a comparison.<br><br>It is common in the world for institutions to delegate authority and at once to strictly limit the extent of what is delegated. For instance, in a branch bank the manager may have authorization to make loans up to a certain amount. If someone requests a loan larger than that amount, then a supervisor must approve it. For even larger amounts, the regulations of the bank may require that the president and chief executive officer himself must approve the loan. If a commitment for a loan is made by a branch manager, if it is within the policy, the bank will honor it, even though that manager may later quit and go to work for a competing bank.<br><br>Recently I attended a meeting of the board of directors of a corporation. The board decided to give a certain employee authority to commit the company on some important matters. So, a motion was passed. One director then observed that a motion was not enough. It should have been a resolution, a formal one, duly entered in the minutes. And so the motion was replaced by a resolution, because delegating authority is serious business, indeed.<br><br>The practices of delegating authority, and at once limiting it, is so commonly demonstrated in business and education, in government, in cultural organizations, that we should not have difficulty in understanding that principle in the Church. A missionary is given authority to teach and to baptize. With certain approval he can ordain. If he is an elder, however, he could not ordain someone to be a seventy or a high priest, for his authority is limited. A bishop can call and release within the limits of his jurisdiction. But he could not, for instance, set apart a stake high councilor. A stake president can set apart a stake high councilor, but he cannot ordain a patriarch.<br><br>Those who hold the Aaronic Priesthood, or the preparatory priesthood, have authority to perform the ordinances that belong to that priesthood. They can baptize, bless the sacrament, and perform those services relating to the lesser priesthood. They cannot, however, confirm someone a member of the Church, for that takes a higher authority.<br><br>Those who have the Melchizedek Priesthood can perform the ordinances relating to the higher priesthood. But unless they are given special authorization, they cannot endow, nor seal, nor perform the ordinances that pertain to the temple, for there are limits.<br><br>I have heard President Kimball say (and it is something that other presidents of the Church have said) that while he holds all of the keys that are upon the earth, there are keys that he does not hold. There are keys that have not been given to him as president of the Church because they are reserved for higher power and authority.<br><br>For example, he said that he does not hold the keys of the resurrection. The Lord has them, but He does not delegate them--neither anciently, nor to modern prophets. He mentioned, also, the authority to command the elements and to walk on the water. The Lord has these keys, but He has not given them to us.<br><br>Nevertheless, in the Church we hold sufficient authority to perform all of the ordinances necessary to redeem and to exalt the whole human family. And because we have the keys to the sealing power, what we bind in proper order here will be bound in heaven. Those keys--the keys to seal and bind on earth and have it bound in heaven--represent the consummate gift from our God. With that authority we can baptize and bless and endow and seal, and the Lord will honor the commitments.<br><br>I have thought a dozen times while preparing for tonight how much I wish there could be time to trace the history of how we got the sealing power. For in that account we would find how much the Lord regards it. We would begin to see into eternities. But that must wait for another day. I will only set the door ajar, hoping that you, on your own, will seek to open it completely. I will mention just this one thread through history.<br><br>Nearly nine hundred years before Christ, a prophet appeared in the court of the king of Israel. He is introduced only as "Elijah the Tishbite of the inhabitants of Gilead." (We don't know what "Tishbite" means; we know that "Gilead" was a wilderness.) He carried with him a sacred authority. He denounced King Ahab, and then he closed the heavens over that wicked land and said there should be no rain. He set no conditions such as "It won't rain until you repent"; he simply said there should be no rain except "according to my word." In plain language, "It's not going to rain until I say so."<br><br>Elijah worked out his ministry, ordained and anointed Elisha to succeed him, and then--and this is important--he did not die. Like Moses before him, he was translated.<br><br>After that, his name appears only once in the Old Testament, in the next to the last verse of the last chapter of the Old Testament. It is here that Malachi prophesies that Elijah would return and that he would "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers," lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse.<br><br>I would encourage you to read in First and Second Kings and in Chronicles the account of Elijah because there is something special about him.<br><br>The Jews, the Mohammedans, and later the Christians, all maintain traditions that Elijah will return.<br><br>When John the Baptist strode onto the pages of history, he was asked, "Are you Elijah?"<br><br>When Peter, James, and John went with the Lord to the Mount of Transfiguration, there appeared with the transfigured Lord two personages. They recognize them to be Moses and Elijah, who had come to convey to that presidency the sealing power.<br><br>In 34 A.D., after His crucifixion, the Lord ministered to the Nephites. He dictated to them--and this is remarkable in scriptural history--the last two chapters of Malachi (which contained the prophecy that Elijah would return), caused them to write them, and then expounded them.<br><br>When the Angel Moroni appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith to tell him of the plates, the first scripture he quoted was Malachi's prophecy that Elijah would return. The prophet installed that quotation as section one of the Doctrine and Covenants. It is now section two, since the preface was given by revelation and now precedes it.<br><br>Thirteen years after Moroni appeared, a temple had been built adequate for the purpose, and the Lord again appeared and Elijah came with Him and bestowed the keys of the sealing power. Thereafter ordinances were not tentative, but permanent. The sealing power was with us.<i>No</i>authorization transcends it in value. That power gives substance and eternal permanence to all ordinances performed with proper authority for both the living and the dead.<br><br>We used the analogy of an insurance policy. It would not be wise to buy insurance if all of the claims had to be paid by the agent who sold you the policy, out of his pocket. You would not be very secure if your protection depended upon the financial resources of the salesman instead of the company. You should know what the policy requires the<i>company</i>to do and what it requires<i>you</i>to do. For instance, how do you cancel a policy if you decide not to continue? Remember too, policies can be cancelled by the company as well. They cannot be obliged to keep their part of the contract, if you willfully disregard yours.<br><br>When you receive an ordinance, whether it be baptism, the sacrament, an ordination or setting apart, an endowment or a sealing, you receive an obligation. Thereafter, you are under covenant not to steal, nor to lie, nor to profane, nor take the name of the Lord in vain. You are obligated to maintain the moral standard. This standard--by commandment of the Lord--requires that the only authorized use of the sacred power of procreation is with one to whom we are legally and lawfully wed. You have responsibility to support every principle of the gospel and the servants the Lord has ordained to administer them.<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith said this: "Each ordinance and requirement given to man for the purpose of bringing to pass his salvation and exaltation is a covenant" (<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56], 1:152).<br><br>Be careful, our youth, not to take the ordinances and covenants of the gospel lightly, nor to maintain them carelessly. It will take increased courage to keep your covenants. The world has moved away from those high standards.<br><br>It seems that there comes, each generation or so, a time when the faithful of the Church are under great criticism, even under attack. That has always been true of those who are under covenant to the Lord. We must expect, as part of our way of life, to stand, on occasion, condemned by those outside the Church who oppose the standards the Lord has directed us to keep.<br><br>Occasionally one inside the Church joins the ranks of the critics. Beware of covenant breakers. It is one thing for nonmembers to criticize and attack the Church and the leaders. It is quite another when someone within the Church does so, after they have entered into solemn and sacred covenants to do otherwise. It makes a very big difference indeed.<br><br>Some years ago I attended a meeting at Ricks College with a group of seminary teachers. President Joseph Fielding Smith, then the President of the Council of the Twelve, met with us. One of the teachers asked about a letter being circulated throughout the Church at that time from a dissident member who claimed that many of the ordinances were not valid because of some supposed mistake in the procedure in conferring the priesthood. When President Smith was asked what he thought about the man's claim he said, "Before we consider the claim, let me tell you about that man." He then told us of several things about him and about the covenants he had not kept. He concluded with this statement: "And so you see, that man is a liar, pure and simple--well, perhaps not so pure."<br><br>There are those outside the Church--and in--who will try to persuade us or compel us to change our direction. The keeping of covenants is a measure of those outside of the Church as well.<br><br>An individual seeking to hold high public office, perhaps in business or in government, may claim to be worthy of trust and insist he would not cheat, not represent, nor mislead the public. Ask yourself, what does that individual do with a private trust? A good measure is to determine how he keeps covenants relating to his family. While one could not excuse, one perhaps could understand that it would be somewhat easier to steal from, cheat on, or lie to an anonymous stranger, or to the public, than it would be to one's own family. Those who are not faithful to their marriage partners and to their families are hardly worthy of confidence and trust in education, in business, in government. If they would cheat on marriage vows, counting perhaps on forgiveness and tolerance that may have been extended at times, surely they must stand unworthy of any great public trust.<br><br>Beware of covenant breakers, inside the Church and out. Beware of those who mock the prophets.<br><br>In Civil War days a performer named Blondin astonished the country by crossing the Niagara River on a tightrope. On one occasion President Abraham Lincoln faced a delegation of critics and said:<br><br><i>Gentlemen, suppose all the property you possessed were in gold, and you had placed it in the hands of a Blondin to carry across the Niagara River on a rope. With slow, cautious steps he walks the rope, bearing your all. Would you shake the cable and keep shouting at him, "Blondin stand up a little straighter; Blondin, stoop a little more; go a little faster; lean more to the South; now lean a little more to the North?" Would that be your behavior in such an emergency? No, you would hold your breath, every one of you, as well as your tongues. You would keep your hands off until he was safe on the other side.</i><br><br><i>This government, gentlemen, is carrying an immense weight. Untold treasures are in its hands. The persons managing the ship of state in this storm are doing the best they can. Don't worry them with needless warnings and complaints. Keep silence; be patient, and we will get you safe across.</i>[John Wesley Hill,<i>Abraham Lincoln: Man of God</i>(New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons), p. 402]<br><br>Keep your spiritual premiums paid up. Do not let your spiritual policy lapse. Do not cause it to be cancelled in some moment of rebellion. Extend your policy by adding endorsements as you receive the higher ordinances. Work to qualify for each of them.<br><br>I was always impressed when President Joseph Fielding Smith was asked to pray. Invariably, he would make reference to the principles and ordinances of the gospel and would always include this expression: "May we remain faithful to our covenants and obligations."<br><br>And that is my message, simply this: Be faithful to the covenants and ordinances of the gospel. Qualify for those sacred ordinances step by step. Honor the covenants connected with them, and you will be happy. Then your lives will be in order.<br><br>Now, coming back--<i>order, ordain, ordinance</i>: To put in rows; to set in proper sequence; to put in proper relationship. And then each of you--with your father and his father and so on through the generations--will be in order and in proper rows, and your children, likewise.<br><br>This is a great time to live. When times are unsettled, when the dangers persist, the Lord pours out his blessings upon His Church and kingdom. Look forward, young people, with an attitude of faith and hope. Look forward to being married and then, in due time, to giving in marriage.<br><br>I have been associated now in the councils of the Church for nearly twenty years. During that time I have seen, from the sidelines at least, many a crisis. I have seen, at times, great disappointment, some concern, maybe at times some anxiety. One thing I have never seen is fear. Fear is the antithesis of faith. In this Church and in this kingdom, there is faith.<br><br>God bless you, our youth. Learn to understand the meaning of the ordinances. Do not accept them or maintain them carelessly.<br><br>I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father. He has delegated to His prophet upon this earth that sealing power that will see us all in order and all happy. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K.

<h1>rward - Paul H. Dunn and the Osmond Family - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
What a wonderful sight to see so many young Latter-day Saints assembled in one place. I can't help but contrast this with the days when I was about your age growing up in the South and in California when Latter-day Saints were not so numerous. I grew up in a stake where there were few girls my age. I had a bishop who was interested in youth, and quite frequently he'd stand at the pulpit and say, "Now you young people [all five of us], when you grow up I want you to marry in the Church and in the temple." And I would look around and ask, "Who?" You are fortunate in that you don't have to look very far. We're thrilled about this great university and the environment in which you find yourselves.<br><br>I know President Kimball is deeply touched that this building is being named for him. He's the last person who would seek this honor, but obviously he's the most deserving; so I would say, on behalf of all General Authorities, what a wonderful selection.<br><br>Looking at these delightful missionaries--and you can tell who they are, can't you--prompts just one other observation: I've had the privilege now for eight years of touring with the Osmond family, whom we honored this morning, and they are real missionaries. Some half-million people in that eight-year period have listened to their testimonies in special firesides that we have conducted all over the world--five hundred thousand people. I have on file in my office letters and responses from thirty thousand converts whose baptisms have come as a direct result of that exposure. I think it would be quite fitting for a few moments to invite this wonderful family, my friends, to come and say a word. We are sorry that Donny, Virl, and Brother and Sister Osmond can't be here. They are on other assignments. I think it would be exciting to have each one in turn, starting with Jim, give you a little response and let you feel their spirits in a different vein than they did at their recent concert at BYU. Now family, you know me well enough to know that I'd do this to you, don't you? Jim, why don't you start.<br><h2><b>Jimmy Osmond</b></h2><br>It's a great opportunity for me to speak to all of you today. I just want to say how much my family means to me. All my brothers and my little--I mean my big--sister (sorry, Marie) are great examples to me, and I love them so much. They've always been there to help me through my problems. I started performing when I was three years old and have been performing for thirteen years now, and I know I couldn't have done it without them behind me because they have helped me so very much. Backstage they have encouraged me, and it's just terrific to have their support.<br><br>I'd like to share with you a little story about examples. There once was a father and his son flying a kite in a field. The kite had gone really high, and the father had let out all the string when the little boy said to his father, "Let the kite string go so that the kite will fly higher and higher." The father said to the little boy that the kite wouldn't fly higher but that it would fall to the ground. The little boy didn't believe his father, so he begged him to let go of the string, and sure enough, the kite fell to the ground. Now, comparing this little story with the laws today, we see that the things we sometimes think are holding us down are really the things that are keeping us up.<br><br>I want to thank my parents publicly for teaching us the proper principles, for having family nights, for helping us grow close as a family.<br><br>I would also like to bear my testimony of this gospel, and I bear it very boldly because I know of the truthfulness of it. I know that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God. I've met him several times, and he is a wonderful man. I'm very grateful that the Church has taught me the principle that my family can be together forever, and I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Marie Osmond</b></h2><br>Hello. I'm very grateful for this opportunity to bear my testimony to you. To start with, I'd like to clarify a couple of things. Being in the entertainment business and being in it at a young age can present many challenges. I'd like to set the record straight about some of the things that have been written about us recently and to let you know that I am not rebelling against my family, that I do have a very strong testimony of this gospel, that I sustain the General Authorities, and that I know Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God. I am so thankful for my family and for the example they have been to me and for my brothers and my wonderful mother and father.<br><br>I'd like to talk for a moment to the girls. Right now is such a great time to be a woman, but it's also a challenging time. There is everything out in the world that we could possibly want, but there is much opposition as well. I think that Satan is working very hard at breaking down the family and the role of women. Now is the time to develop and educate ourselves and to study issues. I admire all of you so much; in fact, I wish I had more opportunities to attend college (I try to attend every chance I get). I really respect all of you for the ambition that you have shown by being here at this university.<br><br>I heard a little story once that has helped me to live the way the Lord would want me to live. It was a story about a salmon that was swimming upstream. He saw a little fish in the water that he could eat, and he said, "Ummmm, what good aroma! High protein content! Just the right size--I could take it in one mouthful. What could be wrong with that?" And of course, what was wrong with it was that the little fish had a hook in it. And I think that many times, as we go through life, we have to be very careful of the hooks, which is why it's important to know what's going on and to trust in our Father in Heaven. I have such a testimony of prayer, for it has helped me through so many difficult times in my life and in making many important decisions. I want you all to know that we appreciate you, and we love you, and I love the gospel with all my heart. And I say these things in Jesus' name. Amen.<br><h2><b>Jay Osmond</b></h2><br>It's a great privilege for me to be here and to share my testimony with you. It is great to be in your presence. You know, as we have traveled around the world we've met lots of different kinds of people and been to many different places, and one thing I've learned is how closely the Mormons are being watched. We are not only a peculiar people, but we are respected throughout the world for our beliefs and our standards. Being twenty-four years old (and still available), I've also realized how important it is for me to make decisions now about what I'm going to do in the future and how I'm going to cope with temptations when they come. I know it's important to decide to make these decisions. And as I see how Mormons are being watched, I realize how important it is to keep ourselves humble, to be prayerful, and to study the gospel. There is a little poem that I keep in the back of my mind as I go through my life, and I'd like to share it with you. It says,<br><br><i>Dare to be a Mormon,</i><br><i>Dare to stand alone,</i><br><i>Dare to have a purpose,</i><br><i>And dare to make it known.</i><br><br>I want you to know that I have a testimony that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God who was instrumental in restoring the necessary gospel truths, keys, and authority to this earth. We have a prophet today, and we should sustain him as well as all the General Authorities. And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Merrill Osmond</b></h2><br>Over seven years ago I had the opportunity and the privilege of meeting a person who came from BYU and who is now my wife. We were married for time and all eternity by Brother Paul H. Dunn, and since that time we have had three wonderful children. Although marriage is put down by so many, I can testify that marriage has brought a depth and meaning to my life that you cannot find in any other way. And as glorious as this entertainment business may be, the real meaning of life lies in seeing my family in our family home evenings gathered around together to be taught the truth about why we are here and what we are doing and how we can get back to our Father in Heaven. I do have a testimony of this gospel. We have met many powerful people--from the Queen of England to the president of the United States--but my greatest blessings are knowing that I have the power of the priesthood in my family and having the testimony that I can accomplish anything that I need to accomplish. And this testimony I leave with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Tommy Osmond</b></h2><br>Good morning, my brothers and sisters. It's good to be here. I want you to know that I have felt the wonderful spirit that is here. I want you to know that the Osmond family has been so good to me and has been patient and understanding in discussing my problems. I want to thank my Heavenly Father for the wonderful blessings he has given me, one of which is the problem of deafness that happens to make me a better person. I thank my Heavenly Father for my wonderful wife and for my beautiful kids; they are a joy to be with. I want you to know that my testimony of the gospel has grown tremendously every day. I know that the only way we gain a testimony is by studying the gospel and doing things we are supposed to do. Remember, obeying God's commandments is the only way we will ever be truly happy. I love you all, my brothers and sisters. I understand that each of us is a special child of our Father in Heaven and that we are here to gain experience and to grow until we overcome temptation so that we can be worthy to meet our Father in Heaven someday if we live faithfully and righteously. I thank Heavenly Father, also, for the struggle I have to improve my speech, communication skills, and everyday conversation. I understand I still have a long way to go, and I bear testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Alan Osmond</b></h2><br>Tommy's a very special boy, and we all love him dearly. As he mentioned, he is profoundly deaf and has had a tremendous obstacle to overcome. We all admire him greatly for the tremendous example he is to us when we feel like things aren't going quite right.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the thing most on my mind right now is how thankful I am for this wonderful, wonderful gospel. The reason I am thankful is because it gives us all the guidelines necessary to keep our lives in order and to direct us toward eternal goals. Without it, brothers and sisters, I think we all realize where we'd be right now--certainly not here. I love the gospel so much. I'm deeply thankful for it, and I have a testimony of its truthfulness. I'm thankful also for my sweet wife--I met her here at BYU--for my two sweet, wonderful children, and for so many choice blessings that Heavenly Father has poured out upon our family. I just hope that I can live the kind of life that will make me worthy to go back to my Heavenly Father someday and stand before him and receive the blessings that he has in store for all who truly love him. As Jesus has said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." I'm thankful for this gospel and its precepts and for this opportunity to speak to you today. And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Wayne Osmond</b></h2><br>I too am very thankful to be here today and to take some of Brother Dunn's precious time to share with you my feelings and my testimony. It's great to be here in Utah. A lot of people ask us why we are here. To the entertainment field it seems like kind of a funny place to be because it is so out of the way. But we want you to know that our decision to come to Utah was a matter of prayer, which has always been very important in making the decisions that we have made.<br><br>I'd like to let you all know that it's fun to be a Mormon; it's fun to have something to believe in. The things that are worth having aren't always the easiest to keep; you have to stand up for them, but they are worth standing up for. We've had an opportunity to travel around the world and do many things, but the things that give us the most joy are having our families and the gospel of Jesus Christ and knowing that the Lord hears us when we kneel to him in humble prayer. We've had to call on him many times. We've had airplane engines go out on us, we've had stages collapse on us, at times we've been so sick we've hardly been able to make it on stage. We've had to call on him often, and it's good to know that he's there. How great it would be if everyone had a personal relationship with him. It's so important that we maintain that relationship, especially today.<br><br>Some of the hardest decisions I've ever made I have arrived at through fasting and prayer and then through listening. Once I've received the confirmation, I like to write it down so that I will never doubt my feelings later on. Then we stick by that confirmation as a family or individually. President Harold B. Lee gave us some good advice many years ago when he said, "Choose that which will bring you closest to the celestial kingdom. No matter what decisions you have to make, you'll always have at least two choices, so choose that which will bring you closest to the celestial kingdom." And that's why we're here in Utah, and we're so happy to be among friends today. We're filled with emotion, and we thank you for that, but we want you to know that the gospel and our families are important to us. These are the things that make us happy, and we leave these testimonies in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Elder Paul H. Dunn</b></h2><br>Thank you, Osmonds; you are great. I couldn't help but pull from my notes a little verse that seemed appropriate as they were talking about their testimonies and the Lord. Let me share it with you.<br><br><i>He was just a little lad</i><br><i>And on the Sabbath Day,</i><br><i>Was walking home from Sunday School</i><br><i>And dawdling on the way.</i><br><br><i>He scuffed his foot upon the grass,</i><br><i>And saw a caterpillar,</i><br><i>He picked a fluffy milkweed pod,</i><br><i>And blew out all the filler.</i><br><br><i>A bird's nest in the tree o'erhead</i><br><i>So wisely placed and high,</i><br><i>Was just another wonder</i><br><i>That caught his eager eye.</i><br><br><i>A neighbor watched his zigzag path</i><br><i>And hailed him from the lawn.</i><br><i>And he asked him where he'd been that day</i><br><i>And what was going on.</i><br><br><i>"Oh, I've been to Sunday School," he carefully</i><br><i>Turned the sod and found a snail beneath.</i><br><i>"Ah, a fine way," the neighbor said,</i><br><i>"For a boy to spend his time.</i><br><i>If you can tell me where God is,</i><br><i>I'll give you a brand new dime."</i><br><br><i>Quick as a flash his answer came,</i><br><i>Nor were his accents faint--</i><br><i>"I'll give you a dollar, mister,</i><br><i>If you can tell me where God ain't."</i><br>[Author Unknown]<br><br>For many of us, particularly at this time of year in school, I suppose there is no greater gulf than that between what we started out to achieve and what we will finally settle for. There is not a person here, I'm sure, who hasn't spent some of his time in childhood dreaming of what he had hoped to be someday. I heard a seven-year-old boy the other day on the airplane who said, when he heard that O. J. Simpson had retired, that he wanted to apply for the job. I think that's showing high hope and real spirit, and without doubt a young man with that kind of goal will work it out. But life has a way, sometimes, of besetting us with discouragement and, as I mentioned in an assembly not long ago, the "blahs." We thought we were going to be somebody, and then it didn't turn out that way.<br><br>Sometimes dreams have a way of fading, don't they? Negative thinking takes over, and we start to be satisfied with just getting by. You know, success and failure always start in the mind. The game of life can be lost before the starting whistle if we think of ourselves as losers. Unfortunately, some of us do. We watch ourselves fall on our faces, make mistakes, and start over again on our diet tomorrow and again tomorrow. Our self-confidence gets dashed; we give in; we throw in the towel; we holler "Uncle." Oh, we may call our giving up on ourselves by different names such as facing up to reality or understanding our limitations, but it's giving up all the same.<br><br>Someone once pointed out that if you heat water to 211 degrees Fahrenheit all you've got is a lot of hot water, but just add to it one more degree to bring it to the boiling point and you've got steam--steam that can move trains and boats, steam that produces power. It's all in one little degree. Anyone who has ever tried to start a car knows that the engine can be in perfect working order, the tank full of gas, the parts of the motor perfectly tuned and ready to roll, but nothing will happen if the battery doesn't lend a little spark to start the whole process. Without that spark there is nothing but an assortment of useless parts. Wouldn't it be sad to fall short of your best expectations in life because you were missing some little thing like will power, perseverance, or self-confidence? You and I, for the most part, have grown up in a church that has taught us through song and verse and sermon that "I Am a Child of God." Do you really believe that? Or does it mean no more to you than a tender moment that comes when you hear a Primary chorus sing? No, it's true. God has sent you and me here to succeed. Sometimes there are forces at work against us--both within and without--that contribute to our defeat.<br><br>Sometimes it's a well-meaning person who doesn't understand. Do you remember the story of little Timmy, the slow learner who was taken to an ungraded school? The teacher asked why he was sent to her. He said, "I was sent because I am a moron. Teacher, what is a moron?"<br><br>The teacher said, "A moron is one who does not know all the answers."<br><br>"I guess I'm a moron because there are a lot of things I don't know. My father must be one, too. Just this morning at breakfast my mother told Dad that he would never learn to eat like he ought to. I like my father, though, because he always says, 'Timmy, what do you think?'"<br><br>The teacher inquired, "What do you think, Tim?"<br><br>"Just let a bird sing two notes, and I can tell you what kind of a bird it is. I can tell you its color, what the papa looks like, how many eggs the mother lays, the color of the eggs, and how long it will take for them to hatch. I know all the birds that stay here and when and where they go. I even know when the birds are here and when they are going somewhere else."<br><br>The teacher said, "Timmy, you're a genius."<br><br>Timmy said, "Teacher, you know more about me already than my teacher did last year. She never asked me what I thought; she always told me what I didn't know. She must be a moron."<br><br>A great leader once said, "Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance. He that shall walk with vigor three hours a day will pass in seven years a space equal to the circumference of the whole earth." I think in order to do that you and I need to develop even more faith than we already have, to rely, as the Osmonds have suggested, on a higher power. One day a small boy tried to lift a heavy stone, but he couldn't budge it. His father, watching, finally said, "Are you sure you are using all of your strength?"<br><br>"Yes, I am," the boy cried.<br><br>"Oh, no, you're not," said the father. "You haven't asked me to help you."<br><br>Think about it.<br><br>Some of you old sports fans remember Babe Ruth; most of you would have to read about him. He's still revered today as one of the great sluggers of all time. Seven hundred and fourteen home runs was the standing record until Hank Aaron came and broke it with a few more. But did you know that while Babe Ruth was making all those records he struck out twice as many times as he hit a home run? I remember reading about the incident that happened in Scheib Park in Philadelphia late in the season in 1927 when the Yankees were trying to secure another pennant. On the mound that day for the Athletics was perhaps one of the greatest left-handed pitchers the game had ever produced, Lefty Grove. He had fanned Babe Ruth on two successive tries at the plate; and, of course, the Philadelphia fans were overjoyed. Every time that Babe would come up to bat they would jeer at him, and he was such a colorful player he would take off his cap and wave back to the crowd. In the eighth inning, he came to bat for the third time, and this time the situation was extremely critical. The Athletics were ahead of the Yankees three to one, and the bases were loaded with two outs. He could win or lose the game for the Yankees as he went to bat. He selected his favorite bat, strolled out to the batter's box as only he could do it, and faced Lefty Grove. Now it all depended on him--the man who had just struck out twice, the man who had earned the insults of the crowd. The excitement was tremendous. All eyes were upon him. The pitcher threw the first pitch across the plate, and with all his power Babe swung and missed. The next pitch was equally good, and Babe swung so hard that he fell down, creating a cloud of dust. The crowd went crazy. But the third time Babe swung, he connected with a loud explosion that sent the ball hurtling out of the park, beyond the houses, and across the street; and it was recorded later as one of the longest hits in the history of baseball. You see, brothers and sisters, Babe Ruth had a basic ingredient that produces winners. We call it "staying power." He stayed in there and wouldn't give up. He didn't measure and remeasure his failures, as we sometimes do. He didn't declare himself a loser and curl up and die in the dugout. The great slugger kept trying, putting his whole heart into the effort until he succeeded.<br><br>Do you remember reading about little Patty Wilson of La Palma, California? She's another winner, and she's an inspiration, I think, to every person who has tried to win. Patty comes from a family of athletes, but she is an epileptic. That by itself, I suppose, would stop some of us, but not Patty. She began running with her father in her early teens despite the fact that she occasionally had seizures. Once she finished a high school race standing up, even though she was semi-conscious. She continued to run despite the odds, despite the challenges. Then just two years ago, when Patty was fifteen, she and her father decided to run 1,310 miles from California to Portland, Oregon. On June 19 television crews, reporters, and state and local officials gathered to wish the Wilsons well.<br><br>Now, Patty's run to Portland presented challenges that would have stopped most athletes. During the first twenty-five miles she suffered a stress fracture in the metatarsal bone of her left foot. It would sometimes swell so much that she could barely get her shoe on, but she would not quit. She knew what she represented not only to thousands of athletes, but also to thousands of handicapped people who were watching her on television all over the country.<br><br>Patty averaged thirty-one miles per day. She arose every morning at 4:30. Her mother spent the first hour every morning draining twenty blisters on her feet. That process was repeated every noon and evening. She and her father ran mile after lonely mile only to encounter hecklers who pelted them with garbage, dirt, and thoughtless insults. Sometimes she and her father would have to pull each other along, but they would not quit. As they approached Portland on July 29, one and a half months after they had begun, the crowds poured out to meet them. People with handicaps came to run beside Patty and to talk to her. People with epilepsy shouted their encouragement. During the last hundred yards her father looked over to see if Patty wore a smile of victory, but she could only grimace from the incredible pain. Then it was over, and they were swooped up by the welcoming ceremonies. Some people in the crowd fought back tears; others wept openly. It was a victory of immeasurable proportions. Think of it: a run of over thirteen hundred miles by a fifteen-year-old girl with epilepsy. Doesn't it make you proud to be a part of the human race? Babe Ruth kept slugging, Patty Wilson kept running, and you and I must do the same.<br><br>I cut out of a newspaper some time ago an encouraging little formula.<br><br><i>"Did" is a word of achievement.</i><br><i>"Won't" is a word of retreat.</i><br><i>"Might" is a word of bereavement.</i><br><i>"Can't" is a word of defeat.</i><br><i>"Ought" is a word of duty.</i><br><i>"Try" is the word of each hour.</i><br><i>"Will" is a word of beauty.</i><br><i>"Can" is a word of power.</i><br><br>This is the way the Lord said it, and I quote: "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life" (2 Ne. 31:20). Press forward. That's not just a piece of nice advice, brothers and sisters; it's a commandment. Press forward, one step at a time, always believing that you can do a great and excellent work here on the earth and that your life matters, maybe more than you imagine. Progression is an eternal law, and those who are managing just to get by in life will find in eternity that they are eons behind those who were willing to plod along undaunted, one step at a time. May you have the confidence to keep slugging when you are striking out and to keep running when blisters fill your shoes. May you be undaunted in reaching for the Lord's kingdom where the righteous dwell and not end up in some halfway house for those who gave up too soon. Remember, my young brothers and sisters whom I love very dearly, we're counting on you, and so is the Lord. God bless you wonderful youth and marvelous teachers, I pray, as I bear witness to these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<h1> Fundamentals to Follow the Prophet - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, I am honored to be in your presence today. You students are a part of a choice young generation--a generation which might well witness the return of our Lord.<br><br>Not only is the Church growing in numbers today, it is growing in faithfulness and, even more important, our young generation, as a group, is even more faithful than the older generation. God has reserved you for the eleventh hour--the great and dreadful day of the Lord. It will be your responsibility not only to help bear off the kingdom of God triumphantly but to save your own soul and strive to save those of your family and to honor the principles of our inspired constitution.<br><br>To help you pass the crucial tests which lie ahead I am going to give you today several facets of a grand key which, if you will honor them, will crown you with God's glory and bring you out victorious in spite of Satan's fury.<br><br>Soon we will be honoring our prophet on his eighty-fifth birthday. As a Church we sing the song, "We Thank Thee, O God, For a Prophet." Here then is the grand key--follow the prophet--and here now are fourteen fundamentals in following the prophet, the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>First:<i>The prophet is the only man who speaks for the Lord in everything.</i><br><br>In section 132, verse 7, of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord speaks of the Prophet--the President--and says: "There is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred."<br><br>Then in section 21, verses 4–6, the Lord states:<br><br><i>Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;</i><i></i><br><br><i>For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.</i><br><br><i>For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</i><br><br>Did you hear what the Lord said about the words of the prophet? We are to "give heed unto all his words"--as if from the Lord's "own mouth."<br><br>Second:<i>The living prophet is more vital to us than the standard works.</i><br><br>President Wilford Woodruff tells of an interesting incident that occurred in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith:<br><br><i>I will refer to a certain meeting I attended in the town of Kirtland in my early days. At that meeting some remarks were made that have been made here today, with regard to the living oracles and with regard to the written word of God. The same principle was presented, although not as extensively as it has been here, when a leading man in the Church got up and talked upon the subject, and said: "You have got the word of God before you here in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants; you have the written word of God, and you who give revelations should give revelations according to those books, as what is written in those books is the word of God. We should confine ourselves to them."</i><i></i><br><br><i>When he concluded, Brother Joseph turned to Brother Brigham Young and said, "Brother Brigham, I want you to take the stand and tell us your views with regard to the living oracles and the written word of God." Brother Brigham took the stand, and he took the Bible, and laid it down; and he took the Book of Mormon, and laid it down; and he took the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and laid it down before him, and he said: "There is the written word of God to us, concerning the work of God from the beginning of the world, almost, to our day. And now," said he, "when compared with the living oracles those books are nothing to me; those books do not convey the word of God direct to us now, as do the words of a Prophet or a man bearing the Holy Priesthood in our day and generation. I would rather have the living oracles than all the writing in the books." That was the course he pursued. When he was through, Brother Joseph said to the congregation: "Brother Brigham has told you the word of the Lord, and he has told you the truth."</i>[In Conference Report, October 1897, pp. 18–19]<br><br>Third:<i>The living prophet is more important to us than a dead prophet.</i><br><br>The living prophet has the power of TNT. By that I mean "Today's News Today." God's revelations to Adam did not instruct Noah how to build the ark. Noah needed his own revelation. Therefore, the most important prophet, so far as you and I are concerned, is the one living in our day and age to whom the Lord is currently revealing His will for us. Therefore, the most important reading we can do is any of the words of the prophet contained each week in the Church Section of the<i>Deseret News</i>and any words of the prophet contained each month in our Church magazines. Our marching orders for each six months are found in the general conference addresses, which are printed in the<i>Ensign</i>magazine.<br><br>I am so grateful that the current conference report is studied as part of one of your religion classes--the course entitled "Teachings of the Living Prophets," number 333. May I commend that class to you and suggest that you get a copy of the class manual at your bookstore whether you're able to take the class or not. The manual is entitled "Living Prophets for a Living Church."<br><br>Beware of those who would pit the dead prophets against the living prophets, for the living prophets always take precedence.<br><br>Fourth:<i>The prophet will never lead the Church astray.</i><br><br>President Wilford Woodruff stated: "I say to Israel, The Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as president of the Church to lead you astray. It is not in the program. It is not in the mind of God." (<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>, selected by G. Homer Durham [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946], pp. 212-213.)<br><br>President Marion G. Romney tells of this incident which happened to him:<br><br><i>I remember years ago when I was a Bishop I had President</i>[Heber J.]<i>Grant talk to our ward. After the meeting I drove him home. . . .Standing by me, he put his arm over my shoulder and said: "My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church, and if he ever tells you to do anything, and it is wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it." Then with a twinkle in his eye, he said, "But you don't need to worry. The Lord will never let his mouthpiece lead the people astray."</i>[In Conference Report, October 1960, p. 78]<br><br>Fifth:<i>The prophet is not required to have any particular earthly training or credentials to speak on any subject or act on any matter at any time.</i><br><br>Sometimes there are those who feel their earthly knowledge on a certain subject is superior to the heavenly knowledge which God gives to His prophet on the same subject. They feel the prophet must have the same earthly credentials or training which they have had before they will accept anything the prophet has to say that might contradict their earthly schooling. How much earthly schooling did Joseph Smith have? Yet he gave revelations on all kinds of subjects. We haven't yet had a prophet who earned a doctorate in any subject, but as someone said, "A prophet may not have his Ph.D. but he certainly has his LDS." We encourage earthly knowledge in many areas, but remember, if there is ever a conflict between earthly knowledge and the words of the prophet, you stand with the prophet, and you'll be blessed and time will vindicate you.<br><br>Sixth:<i>The prophet does not have to say "Thus saith the Lord" to give us scripture.</i><br><br>Sometimes there are those who haggle over words. They might say the prophet gave us counsel but that we are not obligated to follow it unless he says it is a commandment. But the Lord says of the Prophet Joseph, "Thou shalt give heed unto all his<i>words and commandments</i>which he shall give unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 21:4; italics added).<br><br>And speaking of taking counsel from the prophet, in D&amp;amp;C 108:1, the Lord states: "Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you, because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning to receive<i>counsel</i>of him whom Ihave appointed" (italics added).<br><br>Said Brigham Young, "I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call scripture" (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 26 vols. [London: Latter-day Saints' Book Depot], 13:95).<br><br>Seventh:<i>The prophet tells us what we need to know, not always what we want to know.</i><br><br>"Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear," complained Nephi's brethren. But Nephi answered by saying, "the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center" (1 Nephi 16:1, 3). Or, to put it in another prophet's words, "Hit pigeons flutter."<br><br>Said President Harold B. Lee:<br><br><i>You may not like what comes from the authority of the Church. It may contradict your political views. It may contradict your social views. It may interfere with some of your social life. . . . Your safety and ours depends upon whether or not we follow. . . . Let's keep our eye on the President of the Church.</i>[In Conference Report, October 1970, p. 152-153]<br><br>But it is the living prophet who really upsets the world. "Even in the Church," said President Kimball, "many are prone to garnish the sepulchers of yesterday's prophets and mentally stone the living ones" (<i>Instructor</i>, 95:257).<br><br>Why? Because the living prophet gets at what we need to know now, and the world prefers that prophets either be dead or mind their own business. Some so-called experts of political science want the prophet to keep still on politics. Some would-be authorities on evolution want the prophet to keep still on evolution. And so the list goes on and on.<br><br>How we respond to the words of a living prophet when he tells us what we need to know, but would rather not hear, is a test of our faithfulness.<br><br>Said President Marion G. Romney, "It is an easy thing to believe in the dead prophets." And then he gives this illustration:<br><br><i>One day when President Grant was living, I sat in my office across the street following a general conference. A man came over to see me, an elderly man. He was very upset about what had been said in this conference by some of the Brethren, including myself. I could tell from his speech that he came from a foreign land. After I had quieted him enough so he would listen, I said, "Why did you come to America?" "I am here because a prophet of God told me to come." "Who was the prophet;" I continued. "Wilford Woodruff." "Do you believe Wilford Woodruff was a prophet of God?" "Yes, I do." "Do you believe that President Joseph F. Smith was a prophet of God?" "Yes, sir."</i><br><br><i>Then came the sixty-four dollar question. "Do you believe that Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God?" His answer, "I think he ought to keep his mouth shut about old age assistance."</i><br><br><i>Now I tell you that a man in his position is on the way to apostasy. He is forfeiting his chances for eternal life. So is everyone who cannot follow the living Prophet of God."</i>[In Conference Report, April 1953, p. 125]<br><br>Eighth:<i>The prophet is not limited by men's reasoning.</i><br><br>There will be times when you will have to choose between the revelations of God and the reasoning of men--between the prophet and the politician or professor. Said the Prophet Joseph Smith, "Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may not see the<i>reason</i>thereof until long after the events transpire" (<i>Scrapbook of Mormon Literature,</i>vol.2, p. 173).<br><br>Would it seem reasonable to an eye doctor to be told to heal a blind man by spitting in the dirt, making clay, and applying it to the man's eyes and then telling him to wash in a contaminated pool? Yet this is precisely the course that Jesus took with one man, and he was healed. (See John 9:6-7.) Does it seem reasonable to cure leprosy by telling a man to wash seven times in a particular river? Yet this is precisely what the prophet Elisha told a leper to do, and he was healed. (See 2 Kings 5.)<br><br><i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i>[Isaiah 55:8, 9]<br><br>Ninth:<i>The prophet can receive revelation on any matter--temporal or spiritual.</i><br><br>Said Brigham Young:<br><br><i>Some of the leading men in Kirtland were much opposed to Joseph the Prophet, meddling with temporal affairs. . . .</i><br><br><i>In a public meeting of the Saints, I said, "Ye Elders of Israel, . . . will some of you draw the line of demarcation, between the spiritual and temporal in the Kingdom of God, so that I may understand it?" Not one of them could do it. . . .</i><br><br><i>I defy any man on earth to point out the path a Prophet of God should walk in, or point out his duty, and just how far he must go, in dictating temporal or spiritual things. Temporal and spiritual things are inseparably connected, and ever will be.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>10:363-364]<br><br>Tenth:<i>The prophet may be involved in civic matters.</i><br><br>When a people are righteous they want the best to lead them in government. Alma was the head of the Church and of the government in the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith was mayor of Nauvoo, and Brigham Young was governor of Utah. Isaiah was deeply involved in giving counsel on political matters and of his words the Lord Himself said, "Great are the words of Isaiah" (3 Nephi 23:1). Those who would remove prophets from politics would take God out of government.<br><br>Eleventh:<i>The two groups who have the greatest difficulty in following the prophet are the proud who are learned and the proud who are rich.</i><br><br>The learned may feel the prophet is only inspired when he agrees with them; otherwise, the prophet is just giving his opinion--speaking as a man. The rich may feel they have no need to take counsel of a lowly prophet.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we read:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good</i>if<i>they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><br><br><i>And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28, 29, 42; emphasis added]<br><br>Twelfth:<i>The prophet will not necessarily be popular with the world or the worldly.</i><br><br>As a prophet reveals the truth it divides the people. The honest in heart heed his words, but the unrighteous either ignore the prophet or fight him. When the prophet points out the sins of the world, the worldly either want to close the mouth of the prophet, or else act as if the prophet didn't exist, rather than repent of their sins. Popularity is never a test of truth. Many a prophet has been killed or cast out. As we come closer to the Lord's second coming, you can expect that as the people of the world become more wicked, the prophet will be less popular with them.<br><br>Thirteenth:<i>The prophet and his counselors make up the First Presidency--the highest quorum in the Church.</i><br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord refers to the First Presidency as "the highest council of the Church" (107:80) and says, "whosoever receiveth me, receiveth those, the First Presidency, whom I have sent" (112:20).<br><br>Fourteenth:<i>The prophet and the presidency--the living prophet and the first presidency--follow them and be blessed; reject them and suffer.</i><br><br>President Harold B. Lee relates this incident from Church history:<br><br><i>The story is told in the early days of the Church--particularly, I think, at Kirtland--where some of the leading brethren in the presiding councils of the Church met secretly and tried to scheme as to how they could get rid of the Prophet Joseph's leadership. They made the mistake of inviting Brigham Young to one of these secret meetings. He rebuked them, after he had heard the purpose of their meeting. This is part of what he said: "You cannot destroy the appointment of a prophet of God, but you can cut the thread that binds you to the prophet of God and sink yourselves to hell."</i>[In Conference Report, April 1963, p. 81]<br><br>In a general conference of the Church President N. Eldon Tanner stated:<br><br><i>The Prophet spoke out clearly on Friday morning, telling us what our responsibilities are. . . .</i><br><br><i>A man said to me after that, "You know, there are people in our state who believe in following the Prophet in everything they think is right, but when it is something they think isn't right, and it doesn't appeal to them, then that's different." He said, "Then they become their own prophet. They decide what the Lord wants and what the Lord doesn't want."</i><br><br><i>I thought how true, and how serious when we begin to choose which of the covenants, which of the commandments we will keep and follow. When we decide that there are some of them that we will not keep or follow, we are taking the law of the Lord into our own hands and become our own prophets, and believe me, we will be led astray,</i>because we are false prophets to ourselves when we do not follow the Prophet of God.<i>No, we should never discriminate between these commandments, as to those we should and should not keep.</i>[In Conference Report, October 1966, p. 98; emphasis added]<br><br>"Look to the Presidency and receive instruction," said the Prophet Joseph Smith (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>selected by Joseph Fielding Smith [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938], p. 161). But Almon Babbitt didn't, and in the Doctrine and Covenants section 124, verse 84, the Lord states: "And with my servant Almon Babbitt, there are many things with which I am not pleased; behold, he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained, even that of the Presidency of my Church."<br><br>In conclusion, let us summarize this grand key, these "Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet," for our salvation hangs on them.<br><br>First: The prophet is the only man who speaks for the Lord in everything.<br><br>Second: The living prophet is more vital to us than the standard works.<br><br>Third: The living prophet is more important to us than a dead prophet.<br><br>Fourth: The prophet will never lead the Church astray.<br><br>Fifth: The prophet is not required to have any particular earthly training or credentials to speak on any subject or act on any matter at any time.<br><br>Sixth: The prophet does not have to say "Thus saith the Lord" to give us scripture.<br><br>Seventh: The prophet tells us what we need to know, not always what we want to know.<br><br>Eighth: The prophet is not limited by men's reasoning.<br><br>Ninth: The prophet can receive revelation on any matter, temporal or spiritual.<br><br>Tenth: The prophet may be involved in civic matters.<br><br>Eleventh: The two groups who have the greatest difficulty in following the prophet are the proud who are learned and the proud who are rich.<br><br>Twelfth: The prophet will not necessarily be popular with the world or the worldly.<br><br>Thirteenth: The prophet and his counselors make up the First Presidency--the highest quorum in the Church.<br><br>Fourteenth: The prophet and the presidency--the living prophet and the First Presidency--follow them and be blessed; reject them and suffer.<br><br>I testify that these fourteen fundamentals in following the living prophet are true. If we want to know how well we stand with the Lord, then let us ask ourselves how well we stand with His mortal captain. How closely do our lives harmonize with the words of the Lord's anointed--the living prophet, the President of the Church, and with the Quorum of the First Presidency?<br><br>May God bless us all to look to the prophet and the presidency in the critical and crucial days ahead is my prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 26 February 1980.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Try Again - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am glad to be here this evening. We have had four of our five daughters attend BYU. With the first two daughters, I was led to believe that the BYU was a two-year school because they got married after their sophomore year and didn't come back. Our third daughter did finish here. I remember her graduation. She had married before she finished, and at her graduation we weren't sure which would come first, the baby or the diploma. But the diploma beat the baby by a few weeks.<br><br>I feel an anxiousness about my subject tonight because I know, as the scriptures have stated, that we are in the wind-down period of time that precedes the second coming of the Savior. The preparation is being hastened as never before. The signs of this hastening are all about us. The coming months and years will bring some important events in fulfillment of ancient and latter-day prophecies attesting to the times in which we now live. Each of you will have an opportunity to be part of these great experiences. Now it's true that not all will be prophets, apostles, bishops, or presidents, but the particular assignment is unimportant in the overall perspective of what is happening and what will happen. All of us are Heavenly Father's sons and daughters, and regardless of our ecclesiastical assignment, the eternal rewards to the faithful are the same. There is no one here tonight--and I hope you will all listen to this--there is no one here tonight whose experience in life cannot be exciting, satisfying, happy, and profitable. None of us here came into mortality to fail or to be mediocre in the things that matter most. I firmly believe in this truth. And lest we forget, there are no greater blessings than those that can come to a successful husband and wife.<br><br>I don't know when I have prayed more fervently or worried more continually about being able to communicate with any group than I have in speaking with you this evening. I feel none of us will ever be exalted except as we increase our understanding of and our dedication and commitment to the subject matter of this fireside. I have chosen to speak about prayer.<br><br>Because of my desire to teach you this evening, I will share with you some experiences that are considered special and sacred by me and my family. I hope you will please forgive me for this. (Some of my family members have suggested that there are better things to talk about than one's self and loved ones.)<br><br>The greatest purpose and challenge in life is to learn to know and to live like the Savior. We learn to know Him as we live like Him--as we keep his commandments. Knowing Him is increased as we testify of Him. In this mortal experience, there are many Christlike things we can do, but unless we keep His commandments and testify of Him, we will not achieve our full purpose in life. The world has many good people who do many wonderful things but who cannot testify of the Savior and His mission.<br><br>Now there are several important things we can all do that will help us in our pursuit of our goal to know the Savior. We speak of selfless service to others, daily scripture study, daily prayer, keeping the commandments, and so forth. The list goes on and on. The number of things we must do seems endless.<br><br>In our pursuit of a righteous life, we all experience trials, disappointments, discouragements, and frustrations. You name it, and somebody has had it. Never-ending problems seem to be the name of the game. They come to all. None are shielded; none are exempt from problems.<br><br>If you will forgive me, I would like to give a personal reference or two. As was mentioned, I am the oldest of four boys in my parents' family. I remember when I became twelve years of age and was ordained a deacon. The first time I was assigned to pass the sacrament, I worried and was nervous (about like I feel this evening). My mother had given me a clean shirt, a tie, and neatly pressed trousers; but I had a problem in those days (I have problems nowadays, too, but I had one particular problem in those days). I had white hair (a different kind of white than now), and I used to have a cowlick. I don't know if any of you know what a cowlick is--it's hair that sticks up and doesn't know when to lie down. Well, it was all right under regular circumstances for me to go around with this kind of chicken tail-feather cowlick, but I didn't want it to be that way when I passed the sacrament. So mother bought a jar of vaseline, and it seemed like most of it went on my head as we tried to pull down the unruly hair. The time came to pass the sacrament (this story is almost sacrilegious because of the sacred occasion of the sacrament, but one's feelings have to come out), and as I walked down the aisle passing the emblems, I knew that everyone in sacrament meeting was watching me. I knew there was nobody else they were looking at except me, and I was afraid my hair wouldn't stay where it was supposed to stay, even with that vaseline treatment. Then about halfway through the service it happened, and my hair flipped up. I quickly looked around, and I was sure, again, that everybody saw it. I remember looking up on the stand at our bishop. He was seated very comfortably on the stand with his arms in front of his rather robust front--not asleep but enjoying the sacrament service. When I looked up at Bishop Udall, I thought to myself, "Gee, it must be neat to be a bishop. He doesn't have any problems at all. He doesn't even know what has happened to my hair." Now that happened when I was twelve years old. Then I became a bishop some years later, and I found out that Bishop Udall wasn't resting as comfortably as I thought he was.<br><br>As you know, we have five daughters. One of the things that happens in our home when our daughters turn sixteen--that magic age--is that they can do two things: First, if they have taken the driver's education course, they can get a driver's license; and second, if someone asks them, they can have a date--although that hasn't always worked out in just the way they wanted it to. We had one daughter who had her first date upon turning sixteen, and then there was a dry spell that lasted for months and months and months. One day my wife and I were talking about some problems we were trying to solve that were very important and, I thought, very serious, when this sixteen-soon-to-be-seventeen-year-old said to us, "Dad, you don't know what problems are. Here I am sixteen, and I'm ready, but nobody else is." And so it is that trials seem to have their part in each of our lives.<br><br>I honestly thought as a bishop and stake president down in Arizona that the General Authorities were fortunate in that they didn't have anything to worry about except running the church. And then I became one. Since I have become acquainted with the General Authorities, I have found that all of them, brothers and sisters, have some very serious matters--in their personal lives, in their families, and with their health--that challenge the very best in them. And these are trials that I certainly wouldn't want to trade with them.<br><br>We've all been aware of President Kimball's health experiences and problems. I remember how eight years ago, just eight years this coming conference, I was called into the Presiding Bishopric and how we were invited into the room in the temple where the newly sustained Brethren were to be set apart. Prior to the setting apart the Brethren were going to give a blessing to President Kimball, who was then President of the Quorum of the Twelve, because he was going to have open-heart surgery within a matter of a few days. (I think Dr. Nelson will remember many things about this.) As they gave him the blessing, many thoughts went through my mind because President Kimball had been raised in Arizona, as I had been, and I had paid particular attention to him for many reasons. I remembered many of the trials that he had had, the very serious health problems he had had. I knew he sang in a quartet at one time with members of the Twelve, and I understood he sang beautifully. And then he had cancer and had to have that voice taken away from him. I thought as I saw him seated in his chair, with the Apostles' hands on his head, "Why? Why should a man who has been through what he has been through--he's President of the Quorum of the Twelve; he's seventy years old--why should he have to go through open-heart surgery?" I knew the Lord could heal him in an instant if he chose to, and I wondered why? Well, now I understand, as I'm sure you do, that the Lord was preparing a man, an apostle, to be his prophet. He wanted a prophet and a president who would listen to him; he wanted one who could receive the promptings of the Spirit and who would be open to them. These are the reasons for the continual trials with which we are all faced. We need these experiences so that we might draw closer to the Lord and learn to depend on him for everything. That is what He wants for each of us. More than anything, He wants us to know Him.<br><br>Now for the next few minutes, I would like to visit with those of you who have become discouraged in your personal prayers, the ones you say when no one else is listening. I'd like to talk to those of you who have stopped praying or who do not pray as frequently or as fervently as you once did. Perhaps you find it difficult to pray because you aren't sure the Lord is listening; maybe you aren't sure if He is even there; or maybe you feel guilty or unworthy. But whatever the reason, your communication isn't what it ought to be.<br><br>Have you ever knelt down alone and asked the Lord for something that is really important to you and then gotten up and found that your prayer wasn't answered as you had hoped? I have. Have you ever prayed and prayed for days and days for something special and then found that it didn't work out? I have. In times past, on more than a few occasions, I have gotten up off my knees and wondered in despair, "What's the use--He isn't even listening," or "Maybe I'm not worthy," or "Maybe I just don't understand the signals."<br><br>A few years ago, after one such frustrating experience in prayer, I was reflecting on my experiences with my earthly father who has been dead for some time. I remember that when he was alive, I could always go to him and talk to him about anything, and he would listen to me. He was not a perfect man, but he would listen, and I want you to know that I know that whenever one of Heavenly Father's children kneels and talks to Him, He listens to each one. I know this as well as I know anything in this world--that Heavenly Father listens to every prayer from His children. I know our prayers ascend to heaven. No matter what we may have done wrong, He listens to us.<br><br>Now, I also believe He answers us. I don't believe He ignores His children when they talk to Him. The problem in our communication with the Lord is that not all of us have learned how to listen for His answers, or perhaps we are not prepared to hear Him. I believe we receive His answers as we prepare ourselves to receive them. Now let me explain this.<br><br>As we go through life, we ofttimes build a rock wall between us and heaven. This wall is built by our uncorrected or unrepented-of mistakes or actions. For example, in our wall there may be stones of many different sizes and shapes. There could be stones because we have been unkind to someone, for we place a stone between us and the Lord when we are unkind. Criticism of leaders or teachers may add another stone. A lack of forgiveness may add another and another. Vulgar thoughts and actions may add some rather large stones in this wall. Dishonesty will add another; selfishness another, and so on.<br><br>As we build the wall in front of us and we cry out to the Lord in heaven, He still sends His messages from heaven, but instead of being able to penetrate our heart, they hit the wall that we have built up and they bounce off. His messages don't penetrate, so we say, "He doesn't hear us," or "He doesn't answer." Sometimes this wall is very formidable. The great challenge of life is the experience of destroying this rock wall or, if you please, of cleansing ourselves, of purifying this inner vessel, so that we can be in tune with the Spirit.<br><br>Now, let me give you some examples. I suppose we have all had someone do something to us that we didn't like, and that made us mad. We can't forget it, and we don't want to be around that person. This is called being unforgiving. Now the Lord has had some very strong words to say to those who will not forgive one another. Many years ago I had an experience with being unforgiving. I felt I had been taken advantage of, and I did not like the person. I did not want to be around him. I would pass to the other side of the street if he came down the side I was on. I wouldn't talk to him; and long after the issue should have been closed, it was still cankering my soul. One day my wife, who is very astute and knows when I'm not doing everything I should, said, "You don't like so and so, do you?"<br><br>"No, I don't," I said, "but how could you tell?"<br><br>"Well, it shows--in your countenance it shows. Why don't you do something about it," she said.<br><br>"Well, like what?"<br><br>"Why don't you pray about it."<br><br>I said, "Well, I did pray once, and I still don't like him."<br><br>"No," she said, "Why don't you really pray about it?"<br><br>Then I began to think, and I knew what she really meant. So I decided that I was going to pray for a better feeling about this person until I had one. That night I got on my knees, and I prayed and opened up my heart to the Lord. But when I got off my knees, I still didn't like him. The next morning I knelt and prayed and asked to have a feeling of goodness toward him; but when I finished my prayers, I still didn't like him. The next night I still didn't like him; a week later I didn't like him; and a month later I didn't like him--and I had been praying every night and every morning. But I kept it up, and I finally started pleading, not just praying, but pleading. After much prayer--and I can't tell you a specific time because it didn't happen like that--the time came when without question or reservation I knew I could stand before the Lord, if I were asked to, and that He would know that at least in this instance my heart was pure. A change came over me after a period of time. Now that stone of unforgiveness needs to be removed from all of us, if it happens to be there, and I suggest that persistent prayer might be a way to remove it.<br><br>Another stone that creeps into this wall between us and heaven is evil speaking. Have you ever come home from a sacrament meeting, priesthood meeting, or Relief Society meeting and said, "Boy, what a dumb lesson," or "Boy, why did the bishop do that tonight; wasn't he thinking?" or "Boy, I wish they would get a better teacher for us; she's a lemon," and on and on. I believe that every time we speak evil of anyone who is a servant in the kingdom--and I'm not just talking about the prophets--we are sowing the seeds of apostasy. We talk about speaking evil of the Lord's anointed, but I believe that<i>anointed</i>applies to all who are working in the kingdom. I believe that you can't speak evil of a bishop, a counselor, or a teacher without putting a stone in your path that might keep the messages of heaven from reaching you. So I would suggest that we look for elevating things to say about people and not for the degrading things, no matter who we are talking about.<br><br>One of the stones that presents a very real problem for many is unworthy thoughts. Many are the stones that are placed in the wall between us and heaven because of vulgar thoughts and actions. Now I'd like to give you some suggestions for solving that problem. One way is the process of praying and pleading and asking for strength. Beyond that there are some other things that we can do. Our minds are tremendous reservoirs, if I can use that term. Our minds have the capacity to retain anything that we put in them. They can take it. We can put filth, garbage, trash, or vulgarity into our minds, or we can fill them with beauty and spiritual experiences. Our minds just seem to take everything in like a sieve, and they never seem to fill up. Our minds, however, are not like our physical bodies. When we put something into our physical body that isn't right, that is dirty, that is trashy, that is not good for us, our physical body can get rid of it in a brief period. But our minds will keep the trashy kinds of things for days and weeks, months and years, and sometimes for a lifetime. So the important thing to do, remembering that the mind has a hard time cleansing itself, is to be careful of what you put in it. Magazines that are suggestive or even more than suggestive should not be looked at.<br><br>Don't answer this question aloud, but let me ask you: Do you ever go to a show in which there are some bedroom scenes or nudity displayed on the screen; and, if so, do you have the courage to get up and walk out? Or do you say, "Why not? Everybody talks about this now, everybody's watching this kind of thing; why not just stay?" I suggest to you, brothers and sisters, that every time you look at something that would not have the approval of the Master you are filling your mind with something that you will have a hard time getting rid of. As we review Church court cases we find, if a proper report is given, that the mind's processes and thoughts eventually lead to the act. Those who unceasingly fill their minds with things that are filthy and ugly are the ones who are led step-by-step into terribly destructive experiences. So have the courage to walk away from any experience that fills your mind with garbage, and then plead with the Lord for experiences that will fill your mind with refreshing thoughts. There are many rocks that need to be destroyed.<br><br>The pattern of our lives determines our eligibility to receive the promptings of the Spirit and to hear the answers to our prayers. Again, let there be no misunderstanding. Heavenly Father does answer our prayers, but often we aren't prepared to hear Him. Some prayers are not answered immediately, and that's where we may become discouraged. Some are answered immediately, but some do take longer. If you will forgive another experience, a couple of years ago I had an assignment that took me to Germany. I had had a bout with the flu before I left, and I wasn't sure if I ought to go or not; but I felt that I had better because of what had been planned and because of the many who were depending on me. After the flight from New York to Frankfurt, I was tired and not feeling well. I was alone, and I didn't speak German, so I checked into the hotel at the airport. Before going to my room, however, I went to the pharmacy in the airport, and I got a throat spray to disinfect my throat. It was the kind of can that you push the button and the medication comes out through a finger-length piece of plastic tubing that you stick down into your throat.<br><br>I went to my room and prepared to rest for a while; but when I began to spray my throat, the plastic tube came loose and drove itself down my throat and into my chest. I couldn't feel it, but I knew there was a three-inch piece of plastic somewhere, and I didn't know what to do. I coughed. I did all that I could to get rid of it. Then I began to worry--not that I would die, for I knew that I wasn't near death--but because I knew that there were people waiting for me in various countries where I was to be going for the next three weeks, and I knew that if something didn't happen right away I would end up in the hospital to have the plastic pipe removed surgically. So I needed an immediate answer. I needed an immediate response. I knelt at my bed, and I told the Lord that I had no place to go, that I didn't speak the language, that I didn't know a doctor, that I didn't know anyone, and that there were people waiting for me. And I asked Him to please remove this tubing. I got up from praying, and in two seconds it came out of my throat. You see, there are some answers to prayers that come immediately.<br><br>Then, there are other times when you wonder if He is ever going to answer. About twenty-two years ago our fourth daughter was born. After she was born, the doctor told my wife that she shouldn't have any more children. We talked about it, and she said, "I feel that there is another child for us." We talked to the doctor, and he said, "No, you can't." My wife told him, "Well, I think I can," but he persisted in telling her no. Doctors just don't know what my wife knows. She is motivated by other things, I suppose. So we decided, of course, that we were going to have this baby.<br><br>Well, a year went by, and the baby didn't come; and two years went by, and finally one of the girls said to me, "Are you sure we're supposed to have another baby?" My wife had said that she knew we could have one, and they said, "Mother said we were going to have one, so where's the baby?" I replied, "Well let's go ask her." So we went and collectively asked her, "Are you sure we're going to have a baby?" She said, "Yes, but we haven't prayed long enough; we haven't prayed hard enough." So we prayed for another year and still no baby came. Then we asked the question again, "Are you sure you know what you're talking about?" "Yes," was her reply. So we prayed and prayed and prayed for one and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight years! And then one day at the table she said, "Guess what? We're going to have a baby." And there she is, right on this front row. Prayers, you see, are sometimes answered quickly, but other times you pray a long, long time before you get what you want.<br><br>As we learn how to listen to the promptings of the Spirit, as we prepare ourselves to receive them, we must also learn to obey what we feel prompted to do and this element is important. Many feel the promptings of the Spirit, but not all have the courage to obey. We've all had the experience of knowing and not doing.<br><br>I remember attending a stake conference not long ago and hearing a very cute example of receiving the promptings but not being obedient. After the morning session of the conference, we were having dinner at the stake president's home. His counselors and their wives were there. One of the counselors was a rancher with a family of eight or nine children, as I recall, and his ranch was made up of many square miles. Before we sat down to eat his wife was kind of smiling because, she said, I had talked that day about being obedient to the promptings of the Spirit. She continued to smile and said: "Early in our married life, my husband was out on the ranch late one night, and he had a breakdown. So he knelt and prayed and asked Heavenly Father to let me know that he was having problems so I could go out and find him."<br><br>And she did. He had prayed, and she, feeling the promptings of the Spirit, had gone out, gotten in the pickup, and found him broken down somewhere on the ranch. She continued:<br><br><i>That got to be kind of a thing with us. Over the next twenty years whenever he got in trouble, he would pray, and I would get the promptings, and would get in the car and go out to find him. While I was carrying our last baby, and I was about nine and one-half months pregnant</i>[and that means you really are]<i>, and I was in my mid-forties. It was about ten-thirty at night, and I was seated waiting for either him or the baby, whichever came first, when I got the impression, "Your husband is in trouble; go out and help him." I was just too big and too tired and too old, and I just couldn't do it, so I said to the Lord, "You'll just have to help him get home yourself." Then at about one-thirty in the morning he came in, and he didn't say, "Hi, honey," or anything. He just came right to me and said, "What's the matter? Didn't you get my message?" I said, "Yes, but I just couldn't come out, so I had the Lord do it for me."</i><br><br>One of the great challenges of life is to live to receive the message and then to have the courage to obey it.<br><br>Now, I want to give you an additional thought on what to pray for. We're all alike, and we seem to want the best for us, but some times what we consider to be the best isn't right for us, especially when the Lord doesn't think we're ready for it. May I suggest that when you pray for something very special that you pray for two things. First, pray for the blessing that you want, whether it's a new baby, or a job, or better grades, or whatever; and second, ask the Lord for the blessing of understanding. Then if He feels for some reason that the blessing isn't appropriate for that time, the blessing of understanding will come. Then the frustrations that ofttimes come because we feel our prayers are not answered will blow away in the wind.<br><br>Now, tonight, and tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, regardless of your circumstances, in good times or in bad, I plead with you to do the following. Tonight, if it's possible, go where you can be alone. If you can't be alone, do what I suggest anyway. And if your roommate doesn't pray, perhaps your example tonight will be all that he or she needs to make a fresh start. Go and kneel. Think about who you are praying to, for ofttimes we kneel and start to pray so quickly that we don't have in mind to whom we are praying. Frequently, I will try to picture in my mind a painting of the Savior. Now, I'm not exactly sure what Heavenly Father looks like, but that image gives me something to contemplate as I kneel. And then as you think to whom you are praying, speak out loud to Him, or if you wish, whisper to Him and address Him as your Father and say what you would like to say to Him. Don't repeat trite phrases that you have heard others say; instead, be sincere with Him, and talk about the things you want to talk about. Thank Him for what He has done for you. Confide in Him; let Him know what's in your heart. Ask Him for some help. Now those of you who may have had some particularly difficult experiences may only want to ask Him for a desire to pray. That may be all you will want to ask for tonight, but at least ask for that--a desire to pray. Then plead with Him, enjoy Him, tell Him you love Him. I don't know how many of you have prayed out loud and in that vocal prayer have told the Lord that you love Him, but that is a great experience. And then, after you have talked to Him, listen to Him. Now you must listen carefully or you are going to miss His answers. Sometimes people will pray for a minute, or two, or five, or fifteen, and then not even listen for a second. Maybe something different would happen if you continued to kneel at your chair or your bed after you prayed for a minute, or two, or five, or fifteen until you get that good feeling, that warm feeling, that tells you that you have received an answer. Then you know the Lord has heard your prayer, you know He's there, and you know that you have finally figured out a way to allow Him to get His messages through to you. A great experience comes to those who feel the Spirit.<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, I testify to you that the Lord is in His heavens. I testify to you that I know He listens to us and that I know He answers us. I also know that we must be prepared to hear Him. I testify to you that without prayer we will never really know our Heavenly Father or His Son, the Savior. And I testify to you that without prayer we cannot return to Him, for we will have closed the door. Now understand that He does not close the door--we do. I plead with those of you who are discouraged to not give up. I think we have all had at least one experience, and maybe many more, in our lives when we have had an unusually warm and good feeling about something spiritual. But those feelings, the warmth of the Spirit that comes as we learn to talk to the Lord, are available to all of us, and I plead with you to not give up.<br><br>Remember the incident that is recorded in the New Testament of how after the Savior had been crucified, some of the disciples had gone fishing? They had gone out on the Sea of Galilee that afternoon with their nets, and they kept throwing their nets over and over and over; and every time they threw their nets, they brought them back empty. They fished all night, and when morning came their boats were still empty. They were tired and discouraged by their failure, and they started for the shore. When they approached the shore they saw a man walking. They didn't recognize Him, according to the scriptures, but it was the Savior. As they got closer to the Savior, He told them to cast out their nets one more time. Now they didn't argue with Him; they didn't say, "We've tried"; they didn't say, "I tried praying and it didn't work," or "I'm discouraged." Instead, they listened; they had faith; and they obeyed. They lowered their nets in the waters one more time, and this time they brought forth nets overflowing with fish (See John 21:1-6).<br><br>May the Lord bless you to persevere in righteous purposes, my brothers and sisters; and I testify to you that He lives, that He is in His heavens, and that He loves you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>H.

<h1>s of Trouble - In the Face of Discouragement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to be quite personal this morning--personal about you and personal about myself. I have thought about you a great deal over the past few weeks and have prayed to know what might be helpful to you. In doing so I have been drawn back to my own days as a student and some of the challenges I faced then. While such experiences now border on primitive history, fit only for a geology lecture, I'm nevertheless going ahead. I have wondered if some of your experiences and feelings might even now be very much the same.<br><br>I come this morning knowing the semester is nearly over and that what suggestions I offer were perhaps needed months ago. Furthermore, the year is nearly over and maybe for some an entire college career. But part of what Iwant to stress is that every day counts--including these remaining few in the semester--and that you have thousands of days thereafter. Iwill speak of you as you are right now and will hope it matters as much to the graduating senior as to the first-semester freshman.<br><br>I wish to speak today of a problem that isuniversal and that can, at any given hour, strike anywhere on campus--faculty, staff, administration, and especially students. I believe it is a form of evil. At least I know it can have damaging effects that block our growth, dampen our spirit, diminish our hope, and leave us vulnerable to other more conspicuous evils. I address it here this morning because I know of nothing Satan uses quite so cunningly or cleverly in his work on a young man or woman in your present circumstances. I speak of doubt--especially self-doubt--of discouragement, and of despair.<br><br>In doing so I don't wish to suggest that there aren't plenty of things in the world to be troubled by. In our lives, individually and collectively, there surely are serious threats to our happiness. I watch an early morning news broadcast while I shave and then read a daily newspaper. That is enough to ruin anyone's day and by then it's only 6:30 in the morning. Iran, Afghanistan, inflation, energy, jogging, mass murders, kidnapping, unemployment, floods. With all of this waiting for us we are tempted, as W. C. Fields once said, to "smile first thing in the morning and get it over with." But my concerns for you today are not the national and international ones. I wish to speak a little more personally of those matters that do not make headlines in the<i>New York Times</i>but that may be important in your personal journal. I'm anxious this morning about your problems with school and love and finances and the future, about your troubles concerning a place in life and the value of your contribution, about your private fears regarding where you are going and whether you think you will ever get there. Against a backdrop of hostages and high prices I wish to speak more personally of you and fortify you, if I am able, against doubt--especially self-doubt--and discouragement and despair. This morning I want to attack double-digit depression.<br><br>In doing so, however, I wish at the outset tomake a distinction F. Scott Fitzgerald once made, that "trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement--discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint" (<i>The Crack-Up,</i>1945). Troubles we all have, but the "germ" of discouragement, to use Fitzgerald's word, is not in the trouble, it is in us. Or to be more precise, I believe it is in Satan, the Prince of Darkness, the Father of Lies. And he would have it be in us. It's frequently a small germ, hardly worth going to the Health Center for, but it will work and it will grow and it will spread. In fact it can become almost a habit, a way of living and thinking, and there the greatest damage is done. Then it takes an increasingly severe toll on our spirit, for it erodes the deepest religious commitments we can make--those of faith, and hope, and charity. We turn inward and look downward, and these greatest of Christlike virtues are damaged or at very least impaired. We become unhappy and soon make others unhappy, and before long Lucifer laughs.<br><br>As with any other germ, a little preventive medicine ought to be practiced in terms of those things that get us down. There is a line from Dante that says, "The arrow seen before cometh less rudely" (<i>Divine Comedy</i>). President John F. Kennedy put the same thought into one of his state of the union messages this way: "The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining." The Boy Scouts say itbest of all: "Be prepared." That isn't just cracker-barrel wisdom with us; it is theology. "And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice . . . Prepare ye, prepare ye" (D&amp;amp;C 88:92). "But if ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30). And fear is part of what I wish to oppose this morning. The scriptures teach that preparation--prevention if you will--is perhaps the major weapon in your arsenal against discouragement and self-defeat.<br><br>For example, if as a student you are the way I was, you may be discouraged over money matters--and almost everyone is, at least some of the time. A recent study indicated that financially related problems outranked all other factors in marital difficulty by a margin of three to one. And the pressure can be about that great on single students as well. If shared misery provides any consolation for you, take heart--you have friends. From the day I walked into my first college class until I staggered out the exit of my last-- a period of time stretching over twelve years and four degrees--I was responsible for every cent of my education. Iknow that many in this audience are getting through school exactly the same way--part-time jobs, loans, working spouses, an almost desperate plea for scholarships, postponed personal comforts, and all the rest. These things can be troublesome, but you have an obligation--to yourself if no one else--to see that they are not destructive. Prepare. "The arrow seen before cometh less rudely." Take advantage at this tender age to learn to use a budget, to sit down at a table spread out with your debts and come to grips with the economic facts of life. It's none too soon if you've made itto college and still have not had to establish personal fiscal priorities to decide what you will have at the expense of some things you will not have. Get it down on paper and deal with it there. That is the counsel given to husbands and wives, and the same solution works for others. The alternative is to leave it churning in your stomach and head and heart, all of which are susceptible to their own forms of ulcer.<br><br>I see the Brethren labor over the wise use ofthe Church's resources. I see President Oaks labor over it for the university. I hope soon to see someone labor over it for our nation. You can consider it part of a very valuable education to labor over it in your own life. Plan. Prepare. Budget. Work. Save. Sacrifice. Spend cheerfully on things that matter. Smile at an old pair of shoes. Pay your tithing. Cherish a used book. Though some of you may be living in almost desperate financial straits, I promise you there is a way. Such times may be burdensome. Such sacrifice may be hard. But it does not have to lead--for you it must not lead--todespair and destruction and defeat. In the words of Henry David Thoreau:<br><br><i>Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only dispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.</i>[<i>Walden</i>(1854), 1, "Economy"]<br><br><i>Love your life, poor as it is. . . . The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode.</i>[<i>Walden</i>(1854), 18, "Conclusion"]<br><br>Now no one here need be so dramatic as topeer out of an almshouse, but you may be going without some things, you may even consider yourself poor. Well, "Love your life, poor as it is." "If God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?" (Matthew 6:30).<br><br>Quite apart from the financial challenge, schoolwork itself can be quite a drag. (Hold your applause.) I suppose it's fair to say that math and English and economics and zoology can be discouraging on certain days, especially as finals approach. But a little preparation can work wonders here as well. Otherwise, it's the night before the paper is due or the morning before the afternoon exam. And despair distills upon us as the dews from heaven. I plead with you, in making your university experience a pleasant and rewarding one, work conscientiously in the early weeks, and you'll work more cheerfully at the end.<br><br>I remember handing in a paper to Dean Bruce B. Clark who was at the time the teacher of an English literature class I was taking. I loved the class and knew from the first day of instruction that three short papers would be due on clearly stated dates during the term. YetI left those papers--in every case, Ithink--until the night before they were due. I remember Dean Clark handing one of them back to me, saying something like "You had the makings of a good paper here. It's too bad you didn't spend more time on it." I was devastated. Here was the chairman of my major department, teaching only one class a semester that year, the very symbol of my academic hopes and dreams for the B.A., saying "You didn't work very hard." Oh, I had worked hard all right--from 9:00 the night before until 3:00 that morning--without stopping, without breathing.<br><br>Now, my young brothers and sisters, I<i>deserved</i>to be devastated. I should have been devastated. And it<i>could</i>have been a good paper. Perhaps that discouraged me more than anything. You see,<i>I</i>discouraged me. I discouraged<i>myself.</i>Remember, dear Brutus, "The fault. . . is not in our stars, but in ourselves" (William Shakespeare,<i>Julius Caesar</i>). And that's the worst kind of despair, the kind of self-despising that eats at our image and crushes our hopes. It isn't the class or the teacher or thepaper. It never is. I simply should have done better. I should have been at work much sooner. I should have written a draft or two and then left it alone for a time. I should have gone back to it in freshness and strength. I might even have asked for some suggestions. Ishould have reworked it and shaped it and fine-tuned it over several rewritings. At the end I should have been working with a scalpel; as it was I delivered one butchered idea, the meat axe still dripping as I walked into class. And furthermore, you don't type very well at 3:00 in the morning. The point is the same with school as with money or marriage or profession or any hope and dream. Prepare. Plan. Work. Sacrifice. Rework. Spend cheerfully on matters of worth. Carry the calm, and wear the assurance of having done the best you could with what you had. If you work hard and prepare earnestly, it will be very difficult for you to give in or give up or wear down. If you labor with faith in God and in yourself and in your future, you will have built upon a rock. Then, when the winds blow and the rains come--as surely they will--you shall not fall.<br><br>Of course, some things are not under your control. Some disappointments come regardless of your effort and preparation, for God wishes us to be strong as well as good. There, too, I say, "Love your life, poor as it is." Drive even these experiences into the corner, painful though they may be, and learn from them. In this, too, you have friends through the ages in whom you can take comfort and with whom you can form timeless bonds.<br><br>Thomas Edison devoted ten years and all of his money to developing the nickel-alkaline storage battery at a time when he was almost penniless. Through that period of time, his record and film production was supporting the storage battery effort. Then one night the terrifying cry of fire echoed through the film plant. Spontaneous combustion had ignited some chemicals. Within moments all of the packing compounds, celluloid for records, film, and other flammable goods had gone up with a roar. Fire companies from eight towns arrived, but the fire and heat were so intense and the water pressure so low that the fire hoses had no effect. Edison was sixty-seven years old--no age to begin anew. His son Charles was frantic, wondering if he were safe, if his spirits were broken, and how he would handle a crisis such as this at his age. Charles saw his father running toward him. He spoke first.<br><br>He said, "Where's your mother? Go get her. Tell her to get her friends. They'll never see another fire like this as long as they live!"<br><br>At 5:30 the next morning, with the fire barely under control, he called his employees together and announced, "We're rebuilding." One man was told to lease all the machine shops in the area, another to obtain a wrecking crane from the Erie Railroad Company. Then, almost as an afterthought, he added, "Oh, by the way. Anybody know where we can get some money?" (Paraphrased from Charles Edison, "My Most Unforgettable Character,"<i>Reader's Digest,</i>December 1961, pp. 175–77.)<br><br>Virtually everything you now recognize as a Thomas Edison contribution to your life came<i>after</i>that disaster. Remember, "Trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement-- discouragement has a germ of its own."<br><br>If you are trying hard and living right and things still seem burdensome and difficult, take heart. Others have walked that way before you.<br><br>Do you feel unpopular and different, or outside the inside ofthings? Read Noah again. Go out there and take a few whacks on the side of your ark and see what popularity was like in 2500 B.C.<br><br>Does the wilderness stretch before you in anever-ending sequence of semesters? Read Moses again. Calculate the burden of fighting with the pharaohs and then a forty-year assignment in Sinai. Some tasks take time. Accept that. But as the scripture says, "They come to pass." They do end. We will cross over Jordan eventually. Others have proven it. I stand before you as a living symbol that anyone can make it through school, fill a mission, and find a job.<br><br>Are you afraid people don't like you? TheProphet Joseph Smith could share a few thoughts with you on that subject. Has health been a problem? Surely you will find comfort in the fact that a veritable Job has led this Church into one of the most exciting and revelatory decades of this entire dispensation. President Kimball has known few days in the last thirty years that were not filled with pain or discomfort or disease. Is it wrong to wonder if President Kimball has in some sense become what he is not only<i>in spite</i>of the physical burdens but also in part<i>because</i>of them? Can you take courage from your shared sacrifice with that giant of a man who has defied disease and death, has shaken his fist at the forces of darkness and cried when there was hardly strength to walk, "Oh, Lord, I am yet strong. Give me one more mountain" (see Joshua 14:11–12).<br><br>Do you ever feel untalented or incapable or inferior? Would it help you to know that everyone else feels that way too, including the prophets of God? Moses initially resisted his destiny, pleading that he was not eloquent in language. Jeremiah thought himself a child and was afraid of the faces he would meet.<br><br>And Enoch? I ask all of you to remember Enoch as long as you live. This is the young man who, when called to a seemingly impossible task, said, "Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, [I] am but a lad, and all thepeople hate me; for I am slow of speech?" (Moses 6:31).<br><br>Enoch was a believer. He stiffened his spine and squared his shoulders and went stutteringly on his way. Plain old, ungifted, inferior Enoch. And this is what the angels would come to write of him:<br><br><i>And so great was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them; and he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled, even according to his command; and the rivers of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, so powerful was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.</i>[Moses 7:13]<br><br>Plain old, inadequate Enoch--whose name is now synonymous with transcendent righteousness. The next time you are tempted to paint your self-portrait dismal gray, highlighted with lackluster beige, just remember that in like manner have this kingdom's most splendid men and women been tempted. I say to you as Joshua said to the tribes of Israel as they faced one of their most difficult tasks, "Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you" (Joshua 3:5).<br><br>There is, of course, one source of despair more serious than all the rest. It is linked with poor preparation of a far more serious order. It is the opposite of sanctification. It is the most destructive discouragement in time or eternity. It is transgression against God. It is depression embedded in sin.<br><br>Here your most crucial challenge, once you have recognized the seriousness of your mistakes, will be to believe that you can change, that there can be a different you. To disbelieve that is clearly a satanic device designed to discourage and defeat you. When you get home tonight, you fall on your knees and thank your Father in Heaven that you belong to a Church and have grasped a gospel that promises repentance to those who will pay the price.<i>Repentance</i>is not a foreboding word. It is following<i>faith,</i>the most encouraging word in the Christian vocabulary. Repentance is simply the scriptural invitation for growth and improvement and progress and renewal. You can change! You can be anything you want to be in righteousness.<br><br>If there is one lament I cannot abide--and I hear it from adults as well as students--it is the poor, pitiful, withered cry, "Well, that's just the way I am." If you want to talk about discouragement, that phrase is one that discourages me. Though not a swearing man, I am always sorely tempted to try my hand when I hear that. Please spare me your speeches about "That's just the way I am." I've heard that from too many people who wanted to sin and call itpsychology. And I use the word<i>sin</i>again to cover a vast range of habits, some seemingly innocent enough, that nevertheless bring discouragement and doubt and despair.<br><br>You can change anything you want to change, and you can do it very fast. That's another satanic suckerpunch--that it takes years and years and eons of eternity to repent. It takes exactly as long to repent as it takes you to say, "I'll change"--and mean it. Of course there will be problems to work out and restitutions to make. You may well spend--indeed you had better spend--the rest of your life proving your repentance by its permanence. But change, growth, renewal, and repentance can come for you as instantaneously as for Alma and the sons of Mosiah. Even if you have serious amends to make, it is not likely that you would qualify for the term, "the vilest of sinners," which is the phrase Mormon uses in describing these young men. Yet as Alma recounts his own experience in the thirty-sixth chapter of the book that bears his name, his repentance appears to have been as instantaneous as it was stunning.<br><br>Do not misunderstand. Repentance is not easy or painless or convenient. It is a bitter cup from Hell. But only Satan, who dwells there, would have you think that a necessary and required acknowledgment is more distasteful than permanent residence. Only he would say, "You can't change. You won't change. It's too long and too hard to change. Give up. Give in. Don't repent. You are just the way you are." That, my friends, is a lie born of desperation. Don't fall for it.<br><br>As you know, the Brethren used to announce in general conference the names of those who had been called on missions. Not only was this the way friends and neighbors learned of the call, more often than not it was the way the missionary learned of it as well. One such prospect was Eli H. Pierce. A railroad man by trade, he had not been very faithful in Church meetings--"even had my inclinations led in that direction, which I frankly confess they did not," he admitted. His mind had been given totally to what he demurely calls "temporalities." He said he had never read more than a few pages of scripture in his life and that he had spoken to only one public gathering (an effort which he says was nocredit to himself or those who heard him). He used the vernacular of the railroad and the barroom with a finesse born of long practice. He bought cigars wholesale--a thousand at a time--and he regularly lost his paycheck playing pool. Then this classic understatement: "Nature never endowed me with a superabundance of religious sentiment; my spirituality was not high and probably even a little below average."<br><br>Well, the Lord knew what Eli Pierce was, and he knew something else. He knew what I'm pleading for today. He knew what Eli Pierce could become. When the call came that October 5 in 1875, Eli wasn't even in the Tabernacle. He was out working on one of the railroad lines. A fellow employee, once recovered from the shock of it all, ran out to telegraph the startling news. Brother Pierce writes, "At the very moment this intelligence was being flashed over the wires, I was sitting lazily thrown back in an office rocking chair, my feet on the desk, reading a novel and simultaneously sucking on an old Dutch pipe just to vary the monotony of cigar smoking." (For my friends in the English Department I would just hasten to add that the novel reading was probably a more serious transgression than the pipe smoking.)<br><br>He goes on. "As soon as I had been informed of what had taken place, I threw the novel in the waste basket, the pipe in a corner [and have never touched either to this hour]. I sent in my resignation . . . to take effect at once, in order that I might have time for study and preparation. I then started into town to buy [scripture]."<br><br>Then these stirring words:<br><br><i>Remarkable as it may seem, and has since appeared to me, a thought of disregarding the call, or of refusing to comply with the requirement, never once entered my mind. The only question I asked--and I asked it a thousand times--was: "How can I accomplish this mission? How can I, who am so shamefully ignorant and untaught in doctrine, do honor to God and justice tothe souls of men, and merit the trust reposed in me by the Priesthood?"</i><br><br>With such genuine humility fostering resolution rather than defeating it, Eli Pierce fulfilled a remarkable mission. His journal could appropriately close on a completely renovated life with this one line: "Throughout our entire mission we were greatly blessed." But I add one experience to make the point.<br><br>During his missionary service, Brother Pierce was called in to administer to the infant child of a branch president whom he knew and loved. Unfortunately, the wife of the branch president had become embittered and now seriously objected to any religious activity within the home, including a blessing for this dying child. With the mother refusing to leave the bedside and the child too ill to move, this humble branch president with his missionary friend retired to a small upper room in the house to pray for the baby's life. The mother, suspecting just such an act, sent one of the older children to observe and report back.<br><br>There in that secluded chamber the two knelt and prayed fervently until, in Brother Pierce's own words, "we felt that the child would live and knew that our prayers had been heard." Arising from their knees, they turned slowly only to see the young girl standing in the partially open doorway gazing intently into the room. She seemed, however, quite oblivious to the movements of the two men. She stood entranced for some seconds, her eyes immovable. Then she said, "Papa, who was that . . . man in there?"<br><br>Her father said, "That is Brother Pierce. You know him."<br><br>"No," she said, matter-of-factly, "I mean the<i>other</i>man."<br><br>"There was no other, darling, except Brother Pierce and myself. We were praying for baby."<br><br>"Oh, there was another man," the child insisted, "for I saw him standing [above] you and Brother Pierce and he was dressed [all] in white."<br><br>Now if God in his heavens will do that for a repentant old cigar-smoking, inactive, swearing pool player, don't you think he'll do it for you? He will if your resolve is as deep and permanent as Eli Pierce's. In this Church we ask for faith, not infallibility. (See<i>Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow,</i>pp. 407–13.)<br><br><i>Immerse yourself in the scriptures.</i><br><br>You will find your own experiences described there. You will find spirit and strength there. You will find solutions and counsel. Nephi says, "The words of Christ will tell you all things . . . ye should do" (2 Nephi 32:3).<br><br><i>Pray earnestly and fast with purpose and devotion.</i><br><br>Some difficulties, like devils, come not out "but by prayer and fasting."<br><br><i>Serve others.</i><br><br>The heavenly paradox is that only in so doing can you save yourself.<br><br><i>Be patient.</i><br><br>As Robert Frost said, with many things the only way out is through. Keep moving. Keep trying.<br><br><i>Have faith.</i><br><br><i>Has the day of miracles ceased?</i><br><br><i>Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?</i><i>Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith . . . that angels appear and minister unto men.</i>[Moroni 7:35–37]<br><br>Several decades ago an acquaintance of mine left a small southern Utah town to travel to the East. He had never traveled much beyond his little hometown and certainly had never ridden a train. But his older sister and brother-in-law needed him under some special circumstances, and his parents agreed to free him from the farm work in order to go. They drove him to Salt Lake City and put him onto the train--new Levi's, not so new boots, very frightened, and eighteen years old.<br><br>There was one major problem, and it terrified him. He had to change trains in Chicago. Furthermore, it involved a one-night layover, and that was a fate worse than death. His sister had written, carefully outlining when the incoming train would arrive and how and where and when he was to catch the outgoing line, but he was terrified.<br><br>And then his humble, plain, sun-scarred father did something no one in this room should ever forget. He said, "Son, wherever you go in this Church there will always be somebody to stand by you. That's part of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint." And then he stuffed into the pocket of his calico shirt the name of a bishop he had taken the time to identify from sources at Church headquarters. If the boy had troubles, or became discouraged and afraid, he was to call the bishop and ask for help.<br><br>Well, the train ride progressed rather uneventfully until the train pulled into Chicago. And even then the young man did pretty well at collecting his luggage and making it to the nearby hotel room that had been prearranged by his brother-in-law. But then the clock began to tick and night began to fall and faith began to fail. Could he find his way back to the station? Could he find the right track and train? What if it was late? What if he was late? What if he lost his ticket? What if his sister had made a mistake and he ended up in New York? What if? What if? What if?<br><br>Without those well-worn boots ever hitting the floor, that big, raw-boned boy flew across the room, nearly pulled the telephone out of the wall, and, fighting back tears and troubles, called the bishop. Alas, the bishop was not home, but the bishop's wife was. She spoke long enough to reassure him that absolutely nothing could go wrong that night. He was, after all, safe in the room, and what he needed more than anything else was a night's rest. Then she said, "If tomorrow morning you are still concerned, follow these directions and you can be with our family and other ward members until train time. We will make sure you get safely on your way." She then carefully spelled out the directions, had him repeat them back, and suggested a time for him to come.<br><br>With slightly more peace in his heart, he knelt by his bed in prayer (as he had every night of his eighteen years) and then waited for morning to come. Somewhere in the night the hustle and bustle of Chicago in the 1930s subsided into peaceful sleep.<br><br>At the appointed hour the next morning he set out. A long walk, then catch a bus. Then transfer to another. Watch for the stop. Walk a block, change sides of the street, and then one last bus. Count the streets carefully. Two more to go. One more to go. I'm here. Let me out of this bus. It worked, just like she said.<br><br>Then his world crumbled, crumbled before his very eyes. He stepped out of the bus onto the longest stretch of shrubbery and grass he had ever seen in his life. She had said something about a park, but he thought a park was a dusty acre in southern Utah with a netless tennis court in one corner. Here he stood looking in vain at the vast expanse of Lincoln Park with not a single friendly face in sight.<br><br>There was<i>no</i>sign of a bishop or a ward or a meetinghouse. And the bus was gone. It struck him that he had no idea where he was or what combination of connections with who knows what number of buses would be necessary to get him back to the station. Suddenly he felt more alone and overwhelmed than he had at any moment in his life. As the tears welled up in his eyes, he despised himself for feeling so afraid--but he was, and the tears would not stop. He stepped off the sidewalk away from the bus stop into the edge of the park. He needed some privacy for his tears, as only an eighteen-year-old from Southern Utah could fully appreciate. But as he stepped away from the noise, fighting to control his emotions, he thought he heard something hauntingly familiar in the distance. He moved cautiously in the direction of the sound. First he walked, and then he walked quickly. The sound was stronger and firmer and certainly it was familiar. Then he started to smile, a smile that erupted into an audible laugh, and then he started to run. He wasn't sure that was the most dignified thing for a newcomer to Chicago to do, but this was no time for discretion. He ran, and he ran fast. He ran as fast as those cowboy boots would carry him--over shrubs, through trees, around the edge of a pool.<br><br><i>Though hard to you this journey may appear,</i><br><i>Grace shall be as your day.</i><br><br>The sounds were crystal clear, and he was weeping newer, different tears. For there over alittle rise huddled around a few picnic tables and bundles of food were the bishop and his wife and their children and most of the families of that little ward. The date: July 24, 1934. The sound: a slightly off-key a cappella rendition of lines that even a boy from Southern Utah could recognize.<br><br><i>Gird up your loins; fresh courage take;</i><br><i>Our God will never us forsake;</i><br><i>And soon we'll have this tale to tell--</i><br><i>All is well! All is well!</i><br>["Come, Come, Ye Saints,<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30]<br><br>It was Pioneer Day. The gathering to which he had been invited was a Twenty-Fourth of July celebration. Knowing that it was about time for the boy to arrive, the ward had thought it a simple matter to sing a verse or two of "Come, Come, Ye Saints" to let him know their location.<br><br>Elisha, with a power known only to the prophets, had counseled the king of Israel on how and where and when to defend against the warring Syrians. The king of Syria, of course, wished to rid his armies of this prophetic problem. So--and I quote:<br><br><i>Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</i><i>. . . an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots.</i>[2 Kings 6:14–15]<br><br>If Elisha is looking for a good time to be depressed, this is it. His only ally is the president of the local teachers quorum. It is one prophet and one lad against the world. And the boy is petrified. He sees the enemy everywhere--difficulty and despair and problems and burdens everywhere. The bus is gone and all he can see is Chicago. With faltering faith the boy cries, "Alas, my master! How shall we do?"<br><br>And Elisha's reply? "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:15–16).<br><br>"They that be with us?" Now just an Israelite minute here. Faith is fine and courage is wonderful, but this is ridiculous, the boy thinks. There<i>are</i>no others with them. He can recognize a Syrian army when he sees one, and he knows that one child and an old man are not strong odds against it. But then comes Elisha's promise:<br><br><i>Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</i><i>And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</i>[2 Kings 6:16–17]<br><br>In the gospel of Jesus Christ you have help from both sides of the veil, and you must never forget that. When disappointment and discouragement strike--and they will--you remember and never forget that if our eyes could be opened we would see horses and chariots of fire as far as the eye can see riding at reckless speed to come to our protection. They will always be there, these armies of heaven, in defense of Abraham's seed.<br><br>I close with this promise from heaven.<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;</i><i>And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:17–18]<br><br><i>I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, . . . and mine angels</i>[shall be]<i>round about you, to bear you up.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 84:88]<br><br><i>The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 78:18]<br><br>Oh yes, "We'll find the place which God for us prepared." And on the way "We'll make the air with music ring, Shout praises to our God and King; Above the rest these words we'll tell--All is well! All is well!" ("Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30).<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>tude of a Teacher: Weightier Matters - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate the music and the humility of the prayer and the courtesy of the introduction, and I am very proud of you girls and your basketball team. I have been following your progress and feel very good about what you have done and certainly congratulate you.<br><br>I hope all of you this morning qualify, as I pray I do, for what the psalmist wrote when he said to a certain one that he had been "anointed with the oil of gladness." I feel that way this morning perhaps largely because of the period of preparation that has permitted me more intensive access to the scriptures and some thought of you and your particular setting.<br><br>Sister Hanks and I share many good things as husbands and wives should. We share, among other things, good literature and good humor. She pinned on our refrigerator recently, for instance, a panel from "Hagar the Horrible" in the funny papers. In the first panel Mrs. Hagar is asked by her friends, "How did you happen to marry a man who travels so much?" Mrs. Hagar answers in the next panel, "I don't know, just lucked out I guess."<br><br>Then I pinned one on the refrigerator. It had Hagar, in the first of two panels, with all the military accoutrements--his sword and his shield and all the rest--heading resolutely for the door with the announcement to his wife and son, "I go exploring." In the next panel he is gone, the artist has shown by the "whooshes" that the door has slammed, and Mrs. Hagar says to their son, "Go let your father out of the closet."<br><br>That leads me directly to what I want to say this morning. Sometime ago I started exploring a theme in one of these devotionals. I didn't get much beyond the borders of the first country, so to speak, and later was somewhat discomfited by the fact that I had, through the pressures of time, not really spoken adequately about what I had wanted to. And so this morning I am going to make another brief effort, though under the same restraints.<br><br>In the Church we are all teachers in principle, and most of us, perhaps all of us one way or another, are teachers in fact. Some are professionals, and many of the rest of us find our way into a formal classroom setting sometime in our lives. We are home teachers, or ought to be, or visiting teachers. By assignment we are all missionary teachers. In a home we are surely teachers, or in a neighborhood, or as counselors or comforters or friends.<br><br>I sat on the airplane Saturday morning enroute to Louisville, Kentucky, with a young friend, a medical person, who said that for years he has been singing in the Tabernacle Choir and has not been able to attend priesthood quorum meeting. Under the new meeting schedule he has been earnestly looking forward to a more consistent attendance. The week before the first consolidated meetings began, he was invited by the bishop to teach Primary. You will discover that that means he cannot go to priesthood meeting again for a while. The incident reemphasizes what I am saying--that sooner or later most of us end up doing some formal teaching, and if we do not we are yet teachers in other ways along the route.<br><br>As a youngster I had mixed experiences with teachers, some very, very good experiences and some not quite so good. The latter bothered me and caused me to be less faithful in attendance I than I should have been and wish now had been. But I didn't really enjoy the experiences because I was not comfortable with the teachers or the kind of teaching I was exposed to. I know now they were very good men and that part of the problem was mine. But I also think that my youthful reactions were somewhat justified. Later, when I had some outstanding teachers, I became even more sure that anybody who undertakes to teach anything ought to do some very serious thinking. At that age I began to formulate, and in a measure formalized by writing down, some feelings about teaching. I didn't know then that I would spend a major portion of my life in that endeavor, but I did have some very strong responses to and experiences with and feelings about being a teacher. A few of those I want to share this morning, basically in terms of outline because there will be no adequate time to pursue them fully. But perhaps the outline will be sufficient to communicate the viewpoint. I label it<i>my</i>viewpoint. Much of what I say is my opinion, and I take responsibility for that but hope that what I say will motivate you to do your own thinking, which is of course my purpose in being here.<br><h2><b>Know the Scriptures</b></h2><br>The first of these suggestions for me and you: That we teach from a strong foundation in the scriptures and with consistent attendance to the study of those scriptures. Christ answered the cynical question of the Sadducees concerning marriage in the resurrection, a resurrection in which they acknowledged no belief, "Ye do err not knowing the scriptures." And so do we err if we do not know them. The scriptures center in the Lord Jesus Christ because it is he who is the center point in the plan of God for all of us and for all of his children. As we read the scriptures it should be with him and his mission in mind--his life, his love, his teachings, his atoning sacrifice. These are the unifying heart of the holy books.<br><br>As I drove down this morning I was thinking about what the scriptures themselves teach us about reading the scriptures. There are so many significant and strong affirmations about<i>searching</i>and<i>seeking</i>and<i>asking</i>and<i>knocking.</i>One of them is the report of Paul who, having been forced to leave Thessalonica, went to Berea and reported that they in Berea were nobler than those in Thessalonica in that they "received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily [to know] whether those things were so" (Acts 17:11).<br><br>In the twenty-ninth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy is a verse of special significance, perhaps a little less known than many to which we might refer:<br><br><i>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of the law.</i>[Deut. 29:29]<br><br>That is beautiful and significant, every word and every concept. There are things still secret, as it were, with God. But there is much he has revealed that belongs to us and to our children forever in order that we may do that which he wants us to do.<br><br>I repeat, we should be reading regularly in the scriptures to form a foundation for any kind of competence in understanding and teaching the fundamental principles of life, the<i>revealed</i>principles of life and salvation that God himself has given us. We read to know, to understand, to apply, to gain faith. There is much more in the scriptures that should be mentioned--the beauty, the comfort, the inspiration, the motivation, the encouragement, the enhancement of humility--that go with these fundamentals when we read for purpose and those purposes form for us a basis on which to live and share.<br><br>So,<i>get a foundation</i>. And this cannot be done with an occasional attendance at class, though that of course is obviously helpful. It requires personal effort and search.<br><h2><b>I Know</b></h2><br>When we teach it must be in a context of faith, not doubt. Seek, search, knock, ask?<i>Yes</i>. Question?<i>Yes</i>. But in a spirit of inquiry and discovery. Doubting, if it motivates us to move in the right direction and begin to search, can be constructive. But doubting can immobilize and enervate and destroy. We need to search and teach in the context of faith.<br><br>I could illustrate this many ways, and with some sorrow, because I have known some whose faith I did not question but who undertook, I think with proper purpose in the beginning, to question, to challenge, in a manner that became doubt-engendering, in a way in which those who were influenced couldn't quite handle. We must not hesitate to say "I know" when we do know. In Alma 36 it is written that he "stood upon [his] feet" and manifested unto the people that he had been born of God. Many times it is recorded that the prophets, the teachers, the leaders were moved to stand and testify, and did so. I believe in reading widely, in searching other sources that are good, but the voice that is listened to, the voice that means something, is the voice that says,<i>"This I know. I have the conviction. The Spirit has borne witness to me that this is true."</i><br><h2><b>I Do Not Know</b></h2><br>We must learn how to say also, as we testify of what we do know, "I do not know," because as we have just been reminded, there are matters that have not been revealed, much that is yet to be revealed. Teach principles that have consequences in salvation, not those details that may be questionable because there has been no clear revelation that would tie them with our salvation.<br><br>I for one feel no uneasiness when there is concern and questioning and when viewpoints are adopted that are different from my own. But I have great concern when people who have such viewpoints, which in all honesty I do not think are essential to my salvation or theirs or yours, then set them up as the measuring rod of everyone else's faith, and find those lacking or wanting who do not agree with them.<br><h2><b>Wise Teaching</b></h2><br>In the scriptures there are so many refreshing examples of wise teaching, of honest acknowledgment of limitation, or unwillingness to seek to force acquiescence in matters of detail that have no consequence in salvation or the faith and good life that lead to it. In 1 Nephi 22, for instance, is a statement about the "more part of all the tribes" that had been led away and scattered to the isles of the sea, with these instructive comments: "Whither they are<i>none of us knoweth,</i>save that we<i>know</i>that they have been led away" (1 Ne. 22:4; emphasis added).<br><br>Nephi teaches with power the great principle that God reveals his truths by the Spirit to the prophets, and explains the teachings on the brass plates relating to the future of the family of Israel. He does<i>not know</i>the details of their places of dispersion, but he does<i>know</i>that there will come a time when God<br><br><i>gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.</i>[1 Ne. 22:25]<br><br>He testifies that the writings of the prophets are true and that<br><br><i>they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God....</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day.</i>[1 Ne. 22:30, 31]<br><br>In 1 Nephi 11 is recorded the sobering inquiry from an angel to Nephi if he knows "the condescension of God." In effect the Lord seems to be asking if Nephi understands how close to man God is willing to come, how far he is willing to go to help us, how much he loves us, how much he does and is willing to do for us. Read again Nephi's humble answer: "I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things" (1 Ne. 11:17).<br><br>What a wonderful thing to know and what an honest attitude of humble limitation!<br><br>In Alma, the seventh chapter, is the record of Alma's choice instructions revealing his attitude toward teaching and testimony. The prophet<i>knows</i>that God has power to do all things. He<i>knows</i>the vital truth that Christ is coming. He does<i>not</i>know exactly when. He<i>does know</i>that he is called to cry repentance, looking to that coming.<br><br><i>For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing</i>I do not know<i>; but this much</i>I do know<i>, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are accorded to his word.</i><br><br><i>But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</i>[Alma 7:7–9; emphasis added]<br><br>In Alma 40 is another great example of teaching wisdom, a classic example of great faith in principle and perhaps a little impatience with too much emphasis on detail. Alma knows there will be a resurrection--"a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead." He does not know exactly when, or in what stages, and is satisfied to know that God knows these things. He announces that there is a space between death and the resurrection and inquires of the Lord what becomes of men during this time. He receives an answer.<br><br><i>Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead. Now when this time cometh no one knows but God knoweth the time which is appointed.</i><br><br><i>Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case--that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.</i><br><br><i>Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?</i><br><br><i>Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it</i>mattereth not<i>; for all do not die at once, and this</i>mattereth not<i>all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection. And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I</i>do know.<br><br><i>And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.</i><br><br><i>... Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God, who gave them life.</i>[Alma 40:4–11; emphasis added]<br><br>Alma testifies fervently and firmly and unequivocally of great principles but, I repeat, seems even a trifle impatient when people want to know details. Of many matters, it is written, he would "not say," though he was willing on occasion to offer his personal opinion. (See Alma 40:20.)<br><br>So was Paul, as recorded in the great fifteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians (see especially verses 34–36).<br><br>Don't be unwilling to say,<i>"I do not know,"</i>because in truth there is much we do not know. Teach principles that have consequence in salvation. Avoid judging the faith of others on the basis of your own strong personal opinions in matters that may not in fact really significantly relate to salvation.<br><br>It is of great consequence for us to know that God created man and that he created the earth. Is it of equal importance to know the method or methods and the time involved? I do not think so. I know that God created the earth and I know why:<br><br><i>Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be inhabited; and he hath created his children that they should possess it.</i>[1 Ne. 17:36]<br><br>I know that man is coeternal with God and that he clothed us, our eternal individuality, in spirit form and then made it possible for us to have earth life through his gift, through his love. I know that he is our Creator and that his children are his special and crowning creation. But I take great comfort in personal conversations I had with President McKay some years ago when I was concerned with these matters. His answer was about what I have given you. He said, "It would do no violence to my faith to learn that God had formed man in one way or another." Many times I was touched as he taught us of God's love, his marvelous Fatherhood, his power, or the holiness of our Heavenly Father. He testified that God created this earth and us. But the methods and time seemed not so significant to him, nor do they to me.<br><br>In my youth I memorized from a great book two sentences which I still remember that reflect a strong sense of wisdom and of appreciation for true faith. A young minister whose mentor was an older, self-sacrificing priest was going to leave his vocation because the older man was being unfairly treated by his administrative superiors. The older priest dissuaded him from resigning with these words, "You have inquisitiveness and tenderness. You are sensible to the distinction between thinking and doubting. But best of all you do not have that bumptious security that springs from dogma rather than from faith." (A. J. Cronin,<i>Keys of the Kingdom.</i>)<br><br>I seek faith. I am uncomfortable in the presence of "bumptious security that springs from dogma" and express my own strong feeling that it is of utmost importance that we value love, faith, repentance, obedience, morality, integrity, and walking in the spirit, and that we never undervalue these principles at the expense of less essential matters which may preoccupy some.<br><br>I believe, and I testify, that the principles God has revealed concerning our salvation are indispensably important to us and mark the path to his presence and that the only evil any of us can ultimately experience is to be separated from him, from Christ, from our dear ones.<br><h2><b>The Weightier Matters</b></h2><br>It is my conviction that in our lives and teachings we ought to emphasize the weightier matters of the law, as Christ himself taught them. You will remember that as he castigated certain ones for their hypocrisy he said, ...<br><br><i>ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin</i>[tithe in kind in their day]<i>, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</i>[ Matt.23:23]<br><br>I love the story of the man who, face-to-face with the Savior, pleaded for help for his tragically afflicted son. He had gone to others seeking assistance and they could not help him. Now he came directly to the Lord. Christ asked him if he believed: "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." Do you remember what followed?<br><br><i>And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</i>[Mark 9:23–24]<br><br>The child was healed. This honest, humble father knew some things very well, though he apparently had problems with some other matters. He knew who it was he faced. He knew that Jesus was the Christ and had full confidence that he could heal his son.<br><h2><b>The Great Commandments</b></h2><br>Teach the great commandments: To love God; to love our neighbor as ourself; to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; to repent and qualify for God's beautiful promises to forgive, forget, and never mention the sins of the truly penitent; to receive and honor the ordinances of the gospel; and to walk in the light of the Spirit, enduring the tribulations that come to all of God's children in this mortal experience.<br><h2><b>Link Arms with Good People</b></h2><br>I testify earnestly that we ought to join forces with good people who are seeking the same objectives we are and that we should walk with them as brothers toward those wholesome goals as far as we can go.<br><br>I sat in a meeting at a university seminar where Dr. John A. Widtsoe in his older years was one of several panelists speaking to the subject of alcoholism. One stood representing a great Christian denomination and justified the use of alcohol in moderation, declaring that there is nothing wrong with such use. A second speaker represented another part of the Christian world, a young man of considerable conviction, who announced that he differed with the viewpoint of the preceding speaker. He said, "I look upon alcohol, used even as it is used by men who think they are moderate, as a tool of the devil." He talked about the terrible destruction visited upon humankind through alcohol. Dr. Widtsoe was the last speaker. He was an internationally famous chemist and a man of celebrated intellectual accomplishment. He stood and said, "I think there is little need for me to add much today. I link arms with my young brother in what he has just said and walk with him." And then he said, "Because I am a chemist and know something of the nature and effects of alcohol, perhaps I could talk a little about that." And he did, and let it go at that.<br><br>I have never forgotten the imagery, and I have enjoyed the blessing frequently of trying to practice it. We must link arms with good people who have similar or common objectives and walk with them as long and as far as we can.<br><h2><b>Learn and Understand Alma 39:11</b></h2><br>It is the declaration of a sad father who, himself not always perfect, has some memories that are unpleasant for him to live with, but who has sorely repented and is God's agent. He finds it necessary to speak the sad message to his own son who has consorted with a professionally immoral person. The words are sobering to me in contemplation of my one day meeting my missionary father who died when I was a baby. Said Alma to his son Corianton concerning the Zoramites, "When they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words."<br><h2><b>Gather the Manna Daily</b></h2><br>Do you remember the great lesson the Lord taught the children of Israel in providing for them manna that they had to gather daily? They had been slaves in Egypt and had forgotten their relationship with the Lord. To teach them and prove them the Lord required that they gather the manna every day except over the Sabbath. They could not collect it or store it. It had to be gathered every day. (See Exodus 16.)<br><br>Spiritually, that condition of closeness with the Lord through his Spirit is like manna to us. We cannot live well without it, and it must be gathered every day. It isn't enough to have known, to have read, to have given, to have prayed, to have obeyed. That great series of verses in Alma 5 that move me so much begin with, "If ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask,<i>can ye feel so now</i>?" (See Alma 5:26–31; emphasis added.)<br><h2><b>Teach and Testify of Christ</b></h2><br>I repeat that it is my conviction that the only evil that can ultimately happen to us is to be separated from him, from the Father, from our loved ones.<br><br>I was trying to teach a lovely young lady once who had terrible problems. The major difficulty was that she had concluded there was no hope for her. She had cut herself off, shut the door. She would not listen to and really didn't want to hear promises that she felt applied to everybody else but not to her. She was making the most critical mistake that can be made, and that is to negate for her the gift God had given in the life of his Beloved Son, who himself gave his life willingly for all of us. She was sure it couldn't happen to someone who had made the sad mistakes she had.<br><br>We read through the verses you might have chosen, some of you perhaps with greater wisdom than I did, out of Isaiah 1 and the fifty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants and Ezekiel 18 and 33, the promises of God's forgiveness that state that our sins are wiped out in his heart and mind when we truly repent, for he will never mention them; they are gone. Truly repentant, penitent children of God are forgiven. She seemed not to comprehend, nor to believe.<br><br>I turned then to two other verses that have become so precious to me and read them. I share them today with you: "And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us<i>remember him</i>, and<i>lay aside our sins,</i>and<i>not</i>hang<i>down our heads, for we are not cast off"</i>(2 Ne. 10:20; emphasis added).<br><br>I watched the warmth and beauty of the Spirit of the Lord penetrate the hard curtain that had shut her off--by her own doing. I saw a tear come. Then we were able to turn to this wonderful ninth chapter of the book of Moroni to read a line that I wish all of us truly understood and had mastery of. Mormon is finishing his last letter to his son. He has reminded Moroni of some terrible problems of the time. He has been candid, laying out his own sad view of things as they are. In summation he declared the most unpleasant thing people could hear from a prophet, that he could not recommend them unto God. But then he says to his own son, "I recommend thee unto God," and bears his witness and delivers his valedictory to Moroni in these marvelous words:<br><br><i>My son, be faithful in Christ</i>[that is where it starts, and that is the heart of it all]<i>; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers</i>[that is, his resurrection]<i>, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.</i>[Moroni 9:25]<br><br>Don't let infamy, don't let sin, don't let what is happening in the world weigh you down. That is not what Christ is all about; don't let it grieve you.<i>Let him lift you up.</i>And let all that he represents for us rest in your minds forever.<br><br>Enos, finishing his unusual experience, wrote,<br><br><i>And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest. And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father.</i>[Enos 27]<br><br>I desire the faith of Enos. I believe it is my privilege to have that faith the way Enos received it. I believe it is my responsibility to share that faith in humility with anyone I may, in my own household and neighborhood and beyond. I will declare, for I do know some things very well. And I will be willing to announce that I do not know some other things. What I know is that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, that there is a plan for man centering in Christ, our advocate with our father, the mediator, he who came not in the form of an angel but in the seed of Abraham in order that he might understand our infirmities; for we do not have a high priest who is unfamiliar with our problems. He is very familiar with them. The purpose of his program is to give us immortality and to open the door to creative life for us eternally, to help us to find joy and to share happiness, to build, to strengthen, to exude the warm and beautiful spirit that comes when we truly know God and Christ and love each other and undertake to share what is good. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D.

<h1>hal Blessings - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
These firesides generate quite a bit of warmth. I can feel it clear down here. We've been delighted by that beautiful musical number. We are honored by the presence of President and Sister Oaks; Dr. Russell M. Nelson, one of the regional representatives; the stake presidencies; and all of you. I am most honored to be with my beloved wife, Ruth, who to me is the most important person in all the world.<br><br>This evening I wish to speak about one of the most important blessings available to worthy members of the Church. I speak of patriarchal blessings. My chief reason for speaking upon this subject is that patriarchal blessings verify the divinity of Christ and the truthfulness of the Church. These sacred blessings also strengthen the personal testimonies of those worthy persons who are the recipients of such blessings, provided those recipients live so as to merit the blessings pronounced therein. A patriarchal blessing is a very unique and remarkable privilege that can come to the faithful members of the Church having sufficient maturity to understand the nature and the importance of such blessings. These privileged blessings are a powerful witness of the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ in bringing exaltation to each of us. Like many blessings, they must be requested by the person or by the family of the one desiring the blessing. The responsibility for a patriarchal blessing rests primarily upon the individual and family.<br><br>Our testimonies can be strengthened and fortified and our lives given greater purpose every time we read and reread our patriarchal blessings. By their very nature, all blessings are qualified and conditional, regardless of whether the blessing specifically spells out the qualification or not. Each blessing is absolutely qualified and given upon the condition of the faithfulness of the recipient of the blessing.<br><br>We now have stakes of Zion in a great many countries of the world, and most stakes have at least one patriarch. This growth greatly extends the privilege of having patriarchal blessings to many people in many lands.<br><h2><b>The Patriarchs</b></h2><br>I wish to pay tribute to the faithful men holding this great calling and ordination. They are often among the most humble and faithful of our brethren. These chosen men live lives that entitle them to the inspiration of heaven. Patriarchs are privileged to impart blessings directly rather than just solicit blessings to the individual, for the patriarchs are entitled to speak authoritatively for the Lord. The office of patriarch is one of the great separate priesthood offices of the Melchizedek Priesthood. The patriarchal office is one of blessing, not of administration, nor of counseling. It is a sacred, spiritual calling that usually will be the remainder of the patriarch's life. Our patriarchs give total devotion to their callings and do all they can to live in faith and worthiness so that each blessing is inspired<br><br>As each patriarch receives the spirit of his calling and devotes himself to it, his calling becomes beautiful, sacred, spiritual, and fulfilling.<br><h2><b>The Blessing</b></h2><br>When moved upon by the Holy Spirit, the patriarch makes an inspired declaration of the lineage of the recipient together with such blessings, spiritual gifts, promises, advice, admonition, and warnings as the patriarch feels inspired to give. It is in essence a prophetic utterance. Generally, one patriarchal blessing is adequate, and second patriarchal blessings are not encouraged. If a worthy member has an important reason for desiring a second patriarchal blessing, the member may discuss it with his or her bishop.<br><br>The giving of additional patriarchal blessings may have been more common in the past. My grandmother, Maude Wetzel Faust, was challenged like most mothers with the raising of her children. She made an offhanded remark that the children were driving her crazy. My grandfather took her to the stake patriarch who blessed her that her "reason would never be dethroned." The blessing was literally fulfilled. She died at eighty-seven years of age, and she was joking with the nurses on the way to the operating room where she died from a ruptured appendix.<br><br>Patriarchal blessings should be read humbly and prayerfully and frequently. A patriarchal blessing is very personal, but may be shared with family members. A patriarchal blessing is a sacred guideline of counsel, promises, and information from the Lord. However, a person should not expect that the blessing will detail all that will happen to him or her, or be an answer to all questions. The omission of the blessing of a great event in life such as a mission or marriage does not mean it will not happen. My own blessing is short and is limited to perhaps three quarters of one page on one side, yet it has been completely adequate and perfect for me.<br><br>President Heber J. Grant tells of the length of a patriarchal blessing he received: "That patriarch put his hands upon my head and bestowed upon me a little blessing that would perhaps be about one third of a typewritten page. That blessing foretold my life to the present moment" (James R. Clark, comp.,<i>Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 5</i>vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965–75], 5:152).<br><h2><b>When Are Patriarchal Blessings Fulfilled?</b></h2><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe had the following to say:<br><br><i>It should always be kept in mind that the realization of the promises made may come in this life or the future life. Men have stumbled at times because promised blessings have not occurred in this life. They have failed to remember that, in the gospel, life with all its activities continues forever and that the labors of earth may be continued in heaven. Besides, the giver of the blessings, the Lord, reserves the right to have them become active in our lives as suits his divine purposes. We and our blessings are in the hands of the Lord, but there is a general testimony that when the gospel law has been obeyed, the promised blessings have been realized.</i>[<i>Evidences and Reconciliations</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1960),p. 75].<br><br>This was well illustrated in my father's patriarchal blessing. He was told in his blessing that he would be blessed with "many beautiful daughters." He and my mother became the parents of five sons. There were no daughters born to them, but of course they treated the wives of their sons as daughters. This last summer when we had a family reunion, I saw my father's granddaughters moving about tending to the food and ministering to the young children and the elderly, and the realization came to me that Father's blessing had been literally fulfilled; he has, indeed, many beautiful daughters. The patriarch who gave my father his blessing had spiritual vision to see beyond this life. There was a disappearance of the dividing line between time and eternity. The patriarch has no blessing of his own to give; the blessing is the Lord's to give. God knows our spirits; he knows our strengths and weaknesses. He knows our capabilities and our potential. Our patriarchal blessings indicate what the Lord expects of us and what our potential can be. Our blessings can encourage us when we are discouraged, strengthen us when we are fearful, comfort us when we sorrow, give us courage when we are filled with anxiety, lift us up when we are weak in spirit.<br><h2><b>Father's Blessings</b></h2><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe stated: "Every father, having children born to him under the covenant, is to them a patriarch, and he has the right to bless his posterity in the authority of the priesthood which he holds" (<i>Evidences and Reconciliations,</i>p. 72).<br><br>There are those who feel that the order of governing in families by the parents, under the influence of the priesthood held by the father and fully shared by the mother, should be changed. The patriarchy and the patriarchs of the Church are being attacked. We know that the gospel always has been and always will be operated through families.<br><br>Since early biblical times order has been brought into the house of Israel through the family units. The family unit was the organization that had inherently and internally the natural love, the concern, and the blood ties to bring a governing peace and stability to the prophets of God.<br><br>The same is true today for substantially the same reasons. No other unit of society can provide an effective substitute for the natural ties of love and affection inherent in families.<br><br>The natural leaders of the family unit are the parents, standing side by side as equals in their loving guidance of their children. Each parent brings a separate enriching influence. The patriarchal order is a righteous priesthood order in which that influence is dominant in family affairs. Whatever diminishes the family order is destructive to the family unity, the family life, and the family progress.<br><br>The patriarchal order does not just involve men. It involves equally and fully the women of the family in their joint and separate activities. It also blesses the wives and children and their descendants as they come together in family functions and activities.<br><br>Our great work in genealogy research and temple work centers around the ancient promise of the hearts of the children being turned to their fathers in order that all of the blessings of the Lord may be offered to Abraham's seed.<br><br>Genealogical ancestry or blood lines are of importance because our lineage is a chain or linkage through which many of our blessings flow. This began with father Abraham: "I give unto thee a promise that this right [meaning the right to receive the gospel and the priesthood] shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee" (Abr. 2:11). This teaching has been reconfirmed in our day and time through this statement found in the Doctrine and Covenants: "Thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers--For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, ... Your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage" (D&amp;amp;C 86:8–10).<br><br>President John Taylor made the following statement concerning a father's privilege to give a patriarchal blessing: "Every father, after he has received his patriarchal blessing, is a patriarch to his own family, which blessings will be just as legal as those conferred by any patriarch to the Church: in fact it is his right; and a patriarch in blessing of children can only bless as his mouthpiece" (<i>The Gospel Kingdom</i>, ed. G. Homer Durham [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1943], p. 146).<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith affirmed the statement of President Taylor with just one qualification, namely, that the father must hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. President Smith also added that "a father will be better qualified to give such blessings if he has been to the temple and had his wife and children sealed to him" (<i>Answers to Gospel Questions</i>, ed. Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr., 5 vols. [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1957–66], 3:199–200).<br><br>The First Presidency has issued the following policy statement:<br><br><i>Certainly we should give new and additional emphasis to the role of the father in giving blessings to children in the family. We think we should generally leave to the ordained patriarchs in the stakes the responsibility of declaring lineage in connection with an official patriarchal blessing, but still we could leave unlocked the door so that any father who felt inspired to pronounce the lineage in connection with a father's blessing he was giving to his children should not be prevented from doing so. We should urge and encourage fathers to give a father's blessing to their children on such occasions as their going into the military, or away from home, to school, or on missions, and on other appropriate occasions. The father's blessing may be recorded and preserved in family records, but in contrast to a blessing given by one of the ordained patriarchs, it is not to be preserved in the archives of the Church.</i>[<i>General Handbook of Instructions,</i>p. 50]<br><h2><b>Adoption into the House of Israel</b></h2><br>There are many coming into the Church in this day and time who are not of the blood lineage of a specific tribe of Jacob. Indeed, I am fully aware that there could be some within the sound of my voice who fall into this category. No one need assume that he or she will be denied any blessing by reason of not being of the blood lineage of Israel.<br><br>Paul makes repeated references to adoption into the house of Israel through faith: "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his" (Rom. 8:9). And again: "Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises" (Rom. 9:4).<br><br>King Benjamin refers to the faithful as "the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters" thus being able to be "spiritually begotten ... through faith," and thus coming into the family of Christ through a spiritual birth (Mosiah 5:7).<br><br>It really makes no difference if the blessings of the house of Israel come through the lineage or through the spirit of adoption. Elder John A. Widtsoe stated, "Whether this lineage is of blood or of adoption does not matter" (<i>Evidences and Reconciliations</i>, pp. 72–77).<br><br>In Abraham we are told, "And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father" (Abr. 2:10).<br><h2><b>Lineage</b></h2><br>Since families are of mixed lineage, it occasionally happens that members of the same family have blessings declaring them to be of different lineage. There has been an intermixture of the tribes one with another. One child may be of Ephraim, another in the same family of Manasseh, Judah, or one of the other tribes. The blood of one tribe, therefore, may be dominant in one child and the blood of another tribe dominant in another child, so children from the same parents could belong to different tribes.<br><br>The house of Israel, in the original sense, meant the literal blood descendants of the house of Jacob. The Lord said to Abraham, "I give unto thee a promise that this right [meaning the right to receive the gospel and the priesthood] shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee" (Abr. 2:11). By seed we mean the heirs of the body. In our time the Lord has said, "Thus sayeth the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers--for ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, ... Your life and priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage" (D&amp;amp;C 86:8–10).<br><br>Believing Gentiles, even though not of the blood lines or genealogical ancestry of Israel, become adopted into the house of Israel. King Benjamin refers to the faithful becoming "the children of Christ, his sons and his daughters; spiritually begotten ... through faith." Thus they are born again into the family of Christ. (See Mosiah 5:7.)<br><br>Joseph Smith taught that when "the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abraham, it is calm and serene; ... while the effect of the Holy Ghost upon a Gentile, is to purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the seed of Abraham. That man that has none of the blood of Abraham (naturally) must have a new creation by the Holy Ghost." (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, ed. Joseph Fielding Smith [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1972], pp. 149–150.)<br><br>I witness that there is here in this great hall an assemblage of thousands of future leaders of the Church who were called out of the world, having been chosen by the Lord before the foundations of the world under the same promise as that which came to Jeremiah and Abraham:<br><br><i>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</i><br><br><i>And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good, and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</i>[Abr. 3:22, 23]<br><br>You who are here at this great university have come under this great promise, and you have come here to receive secular and spiritual learning. Having become more learned in the wisdom of the heavens and of the earth, thus enabling us to become a light unto the world, what if we hide that light under a bushel basket? What if we do not stay in the course the Lord wants us to be in, and to which the Lord may have called us before the foundations of the world? As the Lord told Saul, you are chosen vessels unto him, to bear his name "before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel" (Acts 9:15). Seek to live worthy of the blessings pronounced upon you by the patriarchs and by your own fathers.<br><br>I received my own patriarchal blessing when I was but a boy of twelve. From that short blessing I learned something about my responsibilities and my labors in establishing the kingdom.<br><br>I pray that we will live worthily and seek the blessings that are promised us by the Lord through our family patriarchs and through our ordained patriarchs, and that we will strive to help conditions and circumstances so that these great promises can be realized.<br><br>I love the Lord. I love his holy work. I have come to love this work more than life itself. I know that it is true. I shall never know with more certainty than I do now. I have also come to know something of the Savior, and as one of his witnesses, I invoke the blessings of Almighty God upon each of you and pray that you will be sustained and built up and strengthened, and that he will watch over you and wrap his arms around you. I say this in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E.

<h1> the Faith - Loren C. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a pleasure to be with you this morning. The BYU campus has changed greatly over the last one hundred years. As I sat and looked out at this audience and thought of some of the changes that we have experienced, it has really been a remarkable thing to see the progress, growth, and development of this school.<br><br>As was mentioned, I did graduate from this institution, and from that day to this, although we have lived in a number of different places, I've never felt embarrassed about the fact, nor have I felt want to be critical about Brigham Young University and what it stands for.<br><br>As everyone knows, this year marks the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the Church. I would like to center my remarks today on unity in the Church and how this unity comes as the end result of keeping the commandments and thereby receiving the converting and healing influence of the Spirit.<br><br>In defining conversion as it is was used in the scriptures, President Marion G. Romney, in an October 1963 general conference address, said the following:<br><br><i>It would appear that membership in the Church and conversion are not necessarily synonymous... Being converted ... and having a testimony are not necessarily the same either. A testimony comes when the Holy Ghost gives the earnest seeker a witness of the truth. A moving testimony vitalizes faith; that is, it induces repentance and obedience to the commandments. Conversion, on the other hand, is the fruit of, or the reward for, repentance and obedience.</i><br><br>Elder Romney goes on to say:<br><br><i>Conversion is effected by divine forgiveness, which remits sins.</i>[That's important.]<i>The sequence is something like this. An honest seeker hears the message. He asks the Lord in prayer if it is true. The Holy Spirit gives him a witness. This is a testimony. If one's testimony is strong enough, he repents and obeys the commandments. By such obedience he receives divine forgiveness which remits sins. Thus he is converted to a newness Of life. His soul is healed</i>. [The Spirit has healed him.]<br><br><i>The answer to the question "How can one know when he is converted" is simple. He may be assured of it when by the power of the Holy Spirit his soul is healed. When this occurs he will recognize it by the way he feels, for he will feel as the people of Benjamin felt when they received a remission of their sins. The record says, "... The Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience"</i>(Mosiah 4:3). [In Conference Report, Oct. 1963 pp. 24–25]<br><br>This definition of Conversion brings us to the realization that being converted is not necessarily the same as receiving a testimony. A person can have a testimony and not be converted. A person can be baptized and not be converted. Conversion comes through obedience to the laws of the gospel, which bring a remission of sins and the healing influence of the Spirit.<br><br>In missionary work we see this process over and over again: the proper teaching of the gospel; the prayer of faith that brings a glimpse of the truthfulness of the gospel, or, in other words, a testimony; the desire to repent and become obedient to the commandments, which leads to baptism; and finally the conferring of the gift of the Holy Ghost, which truly brings a healing spirit to the newly baptized person. He then is walking in a newness of life. He feels different. Quite often he looks different. His appearance reflects peace and joy. There is a change for the better, and everyone is aware of it.<br><br>According to those who study communications, it is almost impossible to achieve what is called permanent attitude change. In other words, it is very difficult to change a person's attitude and then have that change last. To me, one of the miracles of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that men and women and children from all walks of life, from all ethnic backgrounds, can come to a "unity of the faith," as Paul calls it (see Eph. 4:13). What a remarkable gift is this gift of the Holy Ghost, which can touch the heart of one who has been baptized and is a worthy seeker and, without robbing that person of his free agency, can bring him to a unity with the Church and with its leaders and with his fellow members, as well as with good men and women everywhere.<br><br>Now the world cannot understand that. Unity is probably the greatest evidence of conversion. This oneness has been a fundamental characteristic of the gospel of Jesus Christ in all ages. In Romans we read: "So we, being many, are one body in Christ ... of the same mind one toward another" (Rom. 12:5, 16). During the persecutions in Missouri and Illinois, the early Saints of this dispensation stood together; and when they were united in this spirit and bond of unity, they were blessed and protected. When they began to draw away from this spirit, there began to be troubles, and the Lord told them in 1834, "[Ye] are not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom" (D&amp;amp;C 105:4). When individual dissenters began to pull away from the Church, they seemed to follow a similar pattern. First, they violated one or more of the basic commandments, and usually their sins included pride. Second came the gradual withdrawal of the Spirit that is always associated with such actions. Third, they developed feelings of disharmony and disunity, eventually followed by outright criticism. This was not the kind of criticism that tries to draw attention to something that may need correction, which can be done within the framework of the gospel; but it was a criticism that cannot be satisfied, a criticism that knows no bounds, a criticism that feeds upon itself. Says Peter of this kind of person: "He ... is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins" (2 Pet. 1:1–9). Such a person has given up the healing influence of the Holy Spirit. He no longer feels the bond of brotherhood and unity that is a gift of the Spirit and the endowment of the Saints of God in all ages.<br><br>Just before his betrayal and arrest, the Savior urged his disciples to love one another and to be united. He also promised that the Comforter, whom he identified as the Holy Ghost, would come. He then offered the great intercessory prayer that spoke of one of the gifts of the Spirit, and this gift is unity and oneness:<br><br><i>Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. ...</i><br><br><i>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</i><br><br><i>That they all may be one.</i>[John 17:11, 20–21]<br><br>Not only does this scripture clearly point out that unity and oneness must be a characteristic of those in the Lord's Church, but it also points out that the Father and Son are two separate beings and that the oneness they enjoy is that which they would have for all the Saints.<br><br>The ancient Saints understood that the sanctifying spirit of the Holy Ghost would create this unity among the faithful. In his epistle to the Hebrews, Paul makes this clear when he says, "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (Heb. 2:11). Sanctification comes from the Savior through the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Following the day of Pentecost, when three thousand were baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, the record says: "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship. ... And all that believed were together" (Acts 2:42, 44).<br><br>Prior to its being taken up into heaven, we read the following about the city of Enoch: "And the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness, and there was no poor among them" (Moses 7:18).<br><br>In Book of Mormon times, after the Savior had appeared to the Nephites and had given them the fulness of the gospel, and as they were living in peace and in the light of the Spirit, "There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God" (4 Ne. 17). And what does the Lord say in this generation? "I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, even as many as will believe on my name, that they may become the sons of God even one in me as I am one in the Father" (D&amp;amp;C 35:2).<br><br>Can you catch the spirit of these inspired words? In all dispensations--and this generation is no different--the Lord would have his followers embrace the spirit of oneness and peace and unity that has always been a part of the kingdom of God; a unity that characterizes the relationship between the Father and Son; a unity that is always characteristic of the gospel of Jesus Christ; a unity exemplified by the body of Saints who follow the same leaders, live the same doctrines, oppose the same evils, uphold the same virtues, and move in the same direction, with each member being guided by the light that is within him or her, which light, coming from the Holy Ghost, will create a perfect bond of unity and determination among all the Saints.<br><br>One who cultivates the gift of the Spirit comes to the unalterable realization that the Lord is governing his Church through the continuous spirit of revelation, that our leaders are being inspired by the exact same spirit that we are endeavoring to follow. "Whether by mine own voice or the voice of my servants it is the same," the scripture tells us (see D&amp;amp;C 1:38).<br><br>Such unity is born of the Spirit and is a natural thing for Church members. Listen to the words of Heber J. Grant on this subject:<br><br><i>You will always be blessed and benefited in following the advice and counsel of those whom God has chosen to preside over the Church. When you honor the man God has chosen, God will honor and bless you. And as you individually do your duty, you will grow and increase in the light and inspiration of the Spirit of God. As we grow and increase individually, so will the Church grow and increase.</i>[In Conference Report, Oct. 1903.]<br><br>Those who watch us cannot understand this concept, especially in this day and age when the world has put great emphasis on each person following his own desires, his own interests. Some may say, "You say that you believe in individual freedom, yet the great body of the Church follows its leaders, stands for the same principles, upholds the same things." To the world this course appears to be blind faith, but quite the opposite is true. It is a oneness born of the Spirit. It is a unity inspired by the spirit of testimony that lies within the hearts of all who have been converted. President David O. McKay said:<br><br><i>This testimony has been revealed to every sincere man and woman who has conformed to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, obeyed the ordinances and become entitled to and has received ... the Holy Ghost, to guide him. Every individual stands independent in his sphere in that testimony, just as [the thousands of lights do that light up a city] at night, each one which stands and shines in its own sphere, yet the light in it is produced by the same power, the same energy, from which all the other lights receive their energy. So each individual in the Church stands independently in the knowledge that God lives, that the Savior is the redeemer of the world, and that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith.</i>[In Conference Report, Oct. 1912, pp. 120–121]<br><br>No discussion of oneness and unity in the Church would be complete without some mention of the united order. This order is a part of the law of consecration. Righteous members of the Church in all ages have consecrated their time, talents, and means to the building up of the Lord's kingdom in their respective days.<br><br>The united order, we are told, rests upon three basic principles. First, the earth is the Lord's. Men are only stewards of their possessions. Therefore, all that man has should be used in accordance with the Lord's expressed will. Second, all men and women are children of God, and together they constitute a divine family. Therefore, the Lord requires that we must help one another as needs arise, provided that he who will not work shall have no claim upon his brother. Third, every man must be respected as a free agent. He may enter the order at his pleasure. Once in the order, he must be allowed to use, fully and as he pleases, any properties placed in his hands. And he may choose to leave the order at any time.<br><br>These principles of the united order reflect, again, the divine standards of unity among the Saints, while at the same time preserving free agency. We are told that the time will come when, as Saints, we will be required to live the law of consecration more perfectly, and this, of course, will include living the united order.<br><br>Up to this point, I have endeavored to point out the following things:<br><br>1. That a person cannot receive a fulness of the gospel unless he is converted.<br><br>2. That conversion may not be the same as receiving a testimony or even being baptized.<br><br>3. That conversion, as President Romney has defined it for us, involves having our sins remitted and being healed by the Spirit. The words<i>peace</i>and<i>joy</i>are used in this context.<br><br>4. That one of the clearest manifestations of the true gospel of Jesus Christ in all ages is the oneness and unity of its righteous members --unity between the individual and the Savior, unity among its leaders, unity and loyalty among the entire membership.<br><br>5. That the Spirit naturally creates this unity and oneness, especially among those who have been converted, and that unity and oneness among the members also bring the Spirit.<br><br>6. That the world cannot always understand this unity because it cannot understand the workings of the Spirit that bind the Church together.<br><br>Why do I choose this particular subject? Because, my young friends, in every age there are voices challenging that unity--voices from within, voices from without. Perhaps they challenge your unity with the Savior. Perhaps they challenge your unity with your Church leaders. Perhaps they challenge your unity with the Church itself. My friends, if you are to stand unitedly with the Church, then you need to seek the kinds of experiences that will put you on a firm footing so that outside voices will not detract you.<br><br>A number of years ago, when we were living in Boston, I had just finished a particularly bad week. You know what a bad week is, don't you? It's seven bad days in a row. By the end of the week I was feeling down and a bit sorry for myself. Finally, one night, after my family had gone to bed, I decided to stay up longer and really go before the Lord in a more determined way than when I said my regular night and morning prayers. As I knelt in the downstairs study of the darkened house, my circumstances made it easy for me to approach the Lord in the depths of humility, and I poured out my heart. As I prayed I felt a need for a confirmation that he was there and that he cared. From past experiences I knew these things, but there are times when one needs the strength of reconfirmation.<br><br>As I prayed and made this specific request I had a most remarkable experience. I had had spiritual experiences before, but this, to me, was more. There was an outpouring of the Spirit so real that I could feel it. This Spirit filled my whole soul; and this was not just a single experience, but it came again and again in the space of just a minute or two. I came out of the room that night with a reconfirmed and absolute knowledge, borne of the Spirit, that not only does the Savior live but that he knows me and cares for me with a truly divine love.<br><br>The influence of that experience lingered with me for days and caused me to have a feeling of genuine concern and love for everyone, even people on the street whom I did not know. While previously I had passed them with hardly a thought, I now felt a concern for and interest in them. My family, if it were possible, was more dear to me. I felt a bond with the Saints everywhere and wanted to serve my fellow men.<br><br>I can't remember the trials I was facing at that particular time. They passed as trials usually do. But I will always remember the experience of that evening when the Spirit healed me. It confirmed to me that if our hearts are right, we can go before the Lord, and, in one degree or another and in one way or another, he will send the healing influence of the Spirit, which Spirit not only heals but also unites. This need not be a singular experience, for it can happen and should happen over and over again.<br><br>Heber C. Kimball, speaking to those who would have liked to have lived at the time of the Prophet Joseph, said this:<br><br><i>You imagine that you would have stood by him when persecution raged and he was assailed by foes from within and without. You would have defended him and been true to him in the midst of every trial. You think you would have been delighted to have shown your integrity in the days of mobs and traitors. Let me say to you, that many of you will see the time when you will have all the trouble, trial and persecution that you can stand, and plenty of opportunities to show that you are true to God and his work. This Church has before it many close places through which it will have to pass before the work of God is crowned with victory. To meet the difficulties that are coming, it will be necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for yourselves.</i><br><br>And then he added these words:<br><br><i>If you have not got the testimony, live right and... call upon the Lord and cease not til you obtain it... The time will come when no man or woman will be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light within himself.</i>[Orson F. Whitney,<i>Life of Heber C. Kimball</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), pp. 449–450]<br><br>A few years ago, Elder Harold B. Lee used that quotation in a talk given at this institution, and he used it in such a way as to apply it to us today.<br><br>What, then, can a person do to help the healing and uniting influence of the Spirit come into his or her life? The scriptures and writings of the Brethren are filled with helps and aids. Let me list just a few things that have been helpful to me.<br><br>First, keep the commandments as a means of receiving the Spirit. As President Joseph Fielding Smith said,<br><br><i>We have the right to the guidance of the Holy Ghost, but we cannot have that guidance, if we wilfully refuse to consider the revelations that have been given to help us to understand and to guide us in the light and truth of the everlasting gospel.</i>[<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56), 1:43]<br><br>Second, learn to identify the impressions of the Spirit. The Lord has told us that "I will tell you in your heart and in your mind and ye shall feel that it is true." He also tells us that we must study it out in our minds. (See D&amp;amp;C 8:2 and D&amp;amp;C 9:8.) These impressions of truth are usually associated with peace, warmth, and assurance. You will find that such impressions will be in harmony with the scriptures, with the Church, and usually with good common sense. If you are unsure about your promptings, discuss them with your priesthood leaders. I have come to the realization that the Lord prompts most of us far more than we sometimes think. For many, the challenge lies not in receiving promptings from the Spirit, but in following them.<br><br>Third, pray. President Joseph F. Smith gave, I think, one of the greatest statements on this subject when he said,<br><br><i>It is not such a difficult thing to learn how to pray. It is not the words we use, particularly, that constitute prayer. True, faithful, earnest prayer consists more in the feeling that arises from the heart and from the inward desire of our spirits to supplicate the Lord in humility and in faith that we may receive his blessings. It matters not how simple the words may be, if our desires are genuine and we come before the Lord with a broken heart and a contrite spirit to ask him for that which we need.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>5th ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1939) p. 219]<br><br>Fourth, keep the Sabbath day holy. The new consolidated meeting schedule will help us catch the spirit of this day. While growing up in my home, my family kept the Sabbath day holy. No sports. No everyday activities. There is a spirit about this day that will truly heal the soul. The day should center around the partaking of the sacrament, during which we can shed harmful thoughts and actions and receive an increase of the Spirit. The Sabbath can heal us for the week ahead. Don't just keep the Sabbath, but catch the spirit of the Sabbath.<br><br>Fifth, observe the law of tithing. This law brings both spiritual and temporal blessings and is designed to prepare us so that we can live more unitedly in the future.<br><br>Sixth, be careful of too much scheduling and long-range planning because they can shut out inspiration. Sometimes our schedules are so tight that the Lord can't get through. Sometimes they are so loose that when he does get through there is no discipline to carry out what we need to do. A balance is needed.<br><br>Seventh, be an example of the believer. Don't damage your faith and the faith of others by constantly taking the role of the "devil's advocate." There are ways to clarify issues and bring up questions. Become known as a person who sheds light on a matter and not as the professional dissenter.<br><br>Eighth, get a basic testimony. A person who has received the promptings of the Spirit that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet, and that Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God today will have faith sufficient to meet the everyday issues until that time when the Lord provides all the "hows" and "whys." "For ye shall receive no witness," says Moroni, "until after the trial of your faith" (Eth. 12:6).<br><br>Ninth, don't compartmentalize. Seek the Spirit and take the principles of the gospel into every avenue of your life. The gospel embraces all truth. Allow it to do so.<br><br>Tenth, get an early witness of the divine calling of each of your leaders. Do not decide, in advance, who you are and are not going to follow or what leader you like or don't like. Seek an early witness of that person's calling.<br><br>Eleventh, develop charity. A person who is basically forgiving has an easier time cultivating the Spirit than one who finds it hard to forgive.<br><br>Twelfth, study daily the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. This need only be for a few minutes, but you will feel the difference.<br><br>May the Lord bless us all that we might have his healing Spirit to be with us, that by the power and peace of that Spirit we might be one--one in purpose, one in unity, one in the sustaining of each other--that we might, as Paul says, "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."<br><br>If there are any at this time who for one reason or another have found themselves running contrary to that unity and that peace, with all the energy of my soul I invite you back--back to the Lord's Church, back to the peace of the gospel, back to the healing influence of the Spirit, back to those who will stand with you and to those who really care.<br><br>To those who have not yet tasted of this tree, we invite you to come and be one with us. Receive the commandments. Join with the Saints, and let the Spirit heal you.<br><br>At this time I would like to add the witness that I have of this work, which has been borne of that same Spirit. There are many things in this life we know and there are many things in this life we don't know, and I would like to share with you what I do know. I bear to you my witness that I know God lives. I want you to know that. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know Joseph Smith saw what he said he saw. And I know Spencer W. Kimball is a prophet of God today. This church is true. The Book of Mormon is true. The spirit of the gospel will heal you. It will bind you together in the kingdom of God and with your fellow Saints, if you will allow it to do so. May the Lord bless us that we may catch this vision and this spirit of unity that comes through the gospel of Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Loren C.

<h1>Time of Complexity and Challenge - BYU Speeches</h1>

<br>
Now, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, may I in conclusion use only very briefly the prerogative extended to me in order to thank this very able administration and this dedicated and talented faculty for their service to us all and to you graduates and to wish you as graduates Godspeed.<br><br>These graduates now leave one of the few remaining universities that still has religion at its core. Once, among universities, it was otherwise.<br><br>Graduates, you enter a secularized society in which, alas, more and more individuals live without God in the world--a condition, say the prophets, that is contrary to the nature of true happiness. Be aware, therefore, of the secularized state that professes love of men but rejects God. For, as Dostoyevsky said, this "leads to the greatest coercion over men, and turns their lives completely into hell on earth."<sup>1</sup> No wonder, therefore, that for those who live without God in the world, life is, in the words of Saint Teresa of Avila, "no more than a night in a second-class hotel."<sup>2</sup><br><br>For you graduates, however, life can be a first-class experience, and no greater compliment can be paid to you than to remind you that an all-wise God has placed you here and now in this time of complexity and challenge. He did not bring you thus far to fail. You can be equal to your time and to your tasks, and yours is a very special time, for the Savior has told us that just as when the fig tree puts forth its leaves we may "know that summer is nigh,"<sup>3</sup> so it will be with His Second Coming. The foreseen summer of circumstances is now upon us. Let us therefore not complain of the heat.<br><br>May God bless you and stretch you and sustain you and all of us, I pray in the name ofJesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neal A.

<h1>of Living - Charles A. Didier - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be here with you tonight. It's a great opportunity to be here among you, to be with the missionaries, and to have an opportunity to appreciate the Sabbath day and to keep it holy by being in the right place, at the right time, and especially with the right kind of people.<br><br>To introduce my topic tonight, I would like to tell you a little story that happened in a country where there are pharmacies into which you can go and have your weight measured. One day a lady came with her baby and asked the pharmacist if he could weigh her baby. He replied, "Yes, this is possible, but I have a small problem. My scale is so old that when I have such a request I first take the weight of the mother with the little child, then I take the weight of the mother alone. When I have calculated the difference, I can give you the weight of your baby." There was a short silence, and the woman answered, "I'm sorry, but this will not work. I am the grandmother of the child."<br><br>You have had a long day already. You've had Church meetings, and you've had time to meditate about many things. I just hope that you will not feel like the grandmother tonight and that we will be able to communicate--to understand each other using the same common language, the language of the gospel.<br><br>Speaking about communication reminds me of the excellent story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. You will remember that there was a time when Snow White's stepmother was questioning her mirror constantly, saying, "Mirror, tell me if I am beautiful." As long as the mirror told her, "Oh yes, you are beautiful," all went well. But then there came the day when she asked the mirror another question: "Am I the most beautiful?" Well, apparently she did not like the answer because she broke the mirror.<br><br>Communication between men and women is not easy. What can we say then when this communication is difficult between God and men and women? We do not have a God who is blind, deaf, and mute. We do have a loving, caring, listening, communicating, helping Heavenly Father. How does it work? It can be explained in a very simple way by this little story.<br><br>One day I was listening to a dialogue between the fingers of my hand. The question they were discussing was who was the most important. The little finger said, "I am the most important one because I am the one who makes the decisions, and I hit the table when I make decisions."<br><br>The ring finger said, "I am the most important one because I have the ring, so I am the king."<br><br>The middle finger pointed out, "No, I am the most important one because I am the tallest, and because of my size I dominate you."<br><br>The index finger said, "I am the most important one because I point at things, and without me you cannot know the direction."<br><br>Then the thumb said, "I would like to perform an experiment with each of you. Why don't you try to raise that sheet of paper by yourself."<br><br>All of them tried, but no one succeeded.<br><br>At last the thumb said, "Now, try it with me."<br><br>All of them tried, one after the other, and to their great amazement they could all pick up the piece of paper with the help of the thumb.<br><br>The thumb finally said, "With me everything is possible, but I depend on your help and your cooperation to reach my objectives."<br><br>The principle is exactly the same in the Church. We can only reach our objectives with the help of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Now that you understand this principle and because of your faith, I would like to discuss one aspect of your life that will determine the nature of your spiritual life and thus your spiritual future. My topic is the art of living.<br><br>Some may raise this question: "If living is still an art today, can it not be left to a daily routine governed by the reality of life and the impositions of a modern world? The answer, when we consider the teachings of the living prophets who represent our Heavenly Father, is<i>no,</i>a definite<i>no.</i><br><br>My brothers and sisters, this is not a world of alibis and excuses. It seems that in our somehow forced way toward progress we have lost something we can still recover. The problem in our society of consumers is not that we become richer and richer with goods but, on the contrary, that we become poorer and poorer in the face of the new demands of every new day. More and more people are asking for assurance--assurance of new promised happiness, but based on what? What is there at the end of the road for them? Nothing. It seems that they are like tired little children at the end of the day who, after having dismantled their buildings, their towers, and their pyramids, desert their building sets, leaving pieces here and there and everywhere. What an image of despair as we see the destruction of the traditional values of life.<br><br>Some people then think that security can be found in collectivism, a system that will help save them from the anguish of a dark or unknown future. However, the true art of living is an art that will put you in front of your responsibilities, that will obligate you to fight (and I do not hesitate to use the word<i>fight</i>because you will need to), that will force you to conquer your enemies or die. Civilization is not and was not born of expediency. If we look at past accomplishments in architecture or in science or in any other field, history will show that great men have never selected the easy way. Are we now at a turning point in our attempts to solve our present economic and political issues where we only press for more social requests, always more imperial and irresponsible? The true art of living is an individual matter. Let me share with you an example of what can be done and what can be avoided. It is an excerpt of an interview between Jimmy Carter, when he was a young man, and Admiral Rickover. I was quite impressed by this dialogue as I read it some years ago in a weekly magazine in Belgium. As Jimmy Carter was being interviewed by the admiral, the admiral asked him a question: "How was your promotion in the naval academy?"<br><br>Jimmy Carter, proud of his accomplishments, answered, "Sir, I came out fifty-ninth out of 820 candidates." He leaned back in his seat waiting for congratulations that never came.<br><br>Instead, Admiral Rickover asked, "And did you do your best?"<br><br>Mr. Carter was ready to say, "Yes, sir," but suddenly he remembered with whom he was speaking, and he also had a vision of numerous occasions at the academy when he could have done a better job. With difficulty, Jimmy Carter said, "No, sir, I did not always do my best."<br><br>Admiral Rickover looked at him for a long time and then turned his seat to show that this was the end of the interview. But then he asked one last question that Jimmy Carter never forgot and that he was never able to answer: "Why? Why didn't you do your best?" Jimmy Carter sat for a moment quite moved and then slowly left the room. That question, "Why didn't you do your best?" may be one you and I will have to answer in the future.<br><br>There are some recipes that are given that will help us answer it in a positive way and that will enable us to live so as not to be ashamed of our actions. Let me share with you just a little one that is entitled "The Success":<br><br><i>The father of success is work.</i><br><i>The mother of success is ambition.</i><br><i>The eldest son is common sense.</i><br><i>Some of the other boys are perseverance, honesty,</i><br><i>Thoroughness, foresight, enthusiasm, and cooperation.</i><br><i>The eldest daughter is character.</i><br><i>Some of the sisters are cheerfulness, loyalty, courtesy,</i><br><i>Care, economy, sincerity, harmony.</i><br><i>The baby is opportunity.</i><br><i>Get acquainted with the old man and you will be able</i><br><i>To get along pretty well with the rest of the family.</i><br>[Yeomen Shielf,<i>This Is Gordon Owen</i>, Scrapbook Collection (n.p., 1952), p. 32]<br><br>The greatest of all the conquests is ourself. In Proverbs we read, "He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/16.32?lang=eng#31">Prov. 16:32</a>).<br><br>The art of living is easy, if you work hard. It is hard if you choose facility or easiness. Your destiny and your future are in your own hands. May I share with you this little poem from R. L. Sharp about destiny:<br><br><i>Isn't it strange that princes and kings,</i><br><i>And clowns that caper in sawdust rings,</i><br><i>And common people, like you and me</i><br><i>Are builders for eternity?</i><br><br><i>Each is given a bag of tools,</i><br><i>A shapeless mass, a book of rules;</i><br><i>And each must make, ere life is flown,</i><br><i>A stumbling block or a stepping stone.</i><br><br>There is an old fable about a king and a jester. The king one day offered the jester a staff and told him that he could have this staff until he found a bigger fool than himself. A little later, the jester again met with the king. The king didn't look well, and he said, "I'm going to leave for a long journey and probably will never return." The jester asked him what provisions he had made for that journey. The king answered, "None." Then the jester handed the king the staff and said, "If you have made no provisions for such a long journey, then the staff belongs to you. You are a greater fool than I." That is something to think about. Are we fools? Are we acting in a foolish way when we know what we know?<br><br>I was in Ogden this morning participating in a stake conference, and I had an opportunity to talk briefly with a professor. He is involved in a lot of social work, helping people solve their problems. What he told me was quite interesting. He said, "Everyone who comes into my office has had a problem for one reason: They have broken one of the commandments, and that has resulted in their problem." Now, it is always the same old lesson. Are we foolish enough that we will not accept the lessons from the gospel, from our teachers, from a living prophet? Or do we still prefer to go our own way, following our own "art of living" which is not the right kind of living? I read something one day while in a doctor's waiting room in Germany about how some people handle one particular problem:<br><br><i>"The Journal of an Unborn Child"</i><br><i>May 1: I was called to life today because of loving parents.</i><br><i>May 15: My first veins took shape; my body is shaping;</i><br><i>May 19: I already have a mouth.</i><br><i>May 21: My heart has started to beat.</i><br><i>May 28: My arms and legs have started to grow.</i><br><i>June 8: Small fingers are starting to appear on my hands.</i><br><i>June 15: My mother learned today that I am alive.</i><br><i>June 20: It is evident now that I'll be a girl.</i><br><i>June 24: My organs are complete. I can feel now.</i><br><i>July 7: I have hair and eyebrows.</i><br><i>July 8: My eyes are completed, but my eyelids are still closed.</i><br><i>July 19: My heart beats. I feel security and am very happy.</i><br><i>July 20: Today my mother killed me.</i><br><br>Is this the art of living?<br><br>Our message in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not a message of despair; it's a message of hope and faith in a world that can be a world of happiness; and it gives us an art of living that shows to us the light at the end of the tunnel rather than continual darkness. The art of living is found in the Church because it is a moral issue; whether we will benefit from it depends on you and me. Our art of living, living temporally or spiritually, depends on our belief in eternal values instead of mortal values. There cannot be an art of living, a divine art of living, if you do not know a divine God and think, act, and live exactly as he thinks, acts, and lives.<br><br>To illustrate my point, I would like to refer to section 29 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verses 34 and 35, wherein we read:<br><br><i>Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandments, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.</i><br><br>As we go further in the Doctrine and Covenants, let's turn to section 84 to discover to which kind of art of living the Lord is referring:<br><br><i>And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.</i><br><br><i>For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.</i><br><br><i>And everyone that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.</i><br><br><i>And the Father teacheth him of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole world.</i><br><br><i>And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage of sin.</i>[Verses 43–49]<br><br>We know it; we have it before our eyes. Then the Lord says:<br><br><i>And by this you may know that they are under the bondage of sin because they come not unto me.</i><br><br><i>For whoso cometh not unto me is under the bondage of sin.</i><br><br><i>And whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with my voice, and is not of me.</i><br><br><i>And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and that the whole world groaneth under sin and darkness even now.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.50-53?lang=eng#p49">D&amp;amp;C 84:50–53]</a><br><br>It was Cardinal Wojtyla, now pope of the Catholic Church, who said: "The constant danger for the apostle is to shape himself like the spirit of the world in order to be better accepted."<br><br>Our temptation is very similar as we consider that we are, of course, in this world and that decisions have to be made whether to follow the world and its pattern or the Church, which is a divine pattern. May I point out to you that if you have one foot in the Church and the other foot in the world, and that if the world is moving in one direction and the Church is moving in the other direction, it is going to hurt very soon! You have to understand the mechanism. This reminds me of another story about a certain town where an electric generator failed, throwing the inhabitants into darkness. Mechanics and engineers could not figure out what was wrong. They called an aged professor from the university who looked at the generator for a while, asked for a mallet, and tapped on the generator. Suddenly there was electricity again. He was asked to send his bill. The bill amounted to $1,000.07. The president of the company asked him to itemize the bill. The professor answered: "Tapping, $.07; knowing where to tap, $1,000.00."<br><br>Knowing where to tap requires that we know that we belong to a church that is the true Church of Jesus Christ and that we know our Heavenly Father. Do you really understand the mechanism of the Church? Do you understand that there is only one way and that the world is not giving you that way--this art of living?<br><br>In 2 Nephi, chapter 31, we find this statement about what the Church can do for us:<br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i><br><br><i>And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.</i>[Verses 20–21]<br><br>This is really the explanation of the art of righteous living, the application of which will bring us eternal life. In the thirty-second chapter of Second Nephi, this time in the third verse, we read that we should<br><br><i>feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</i><br><br>When we start to live because of our love of Jesus Christ and not because of the fear of others and their criticisms or rules, then, and only then, will we know the art of righteous living, not the drama of living.<br><br>A decision has to be reached while there is still time to reach it. I like this story about Will D. Lae, who was grossly overweight but who was fascinated by the idea of becoming a mountain climber. Determined to master the skill, he was able, through hard work and continuous practice, to develop his arm muscles so that they would support his obese body. He practiced on local slopes and then decided to try his skill on a mountain worthy of his ambitions. He picked the granite face of El Capitán. Halfway up the sheer cliff he looked up and was startled to discover that his rope was fraying and in a second or two would break. He looked down and saw that there was no ledge or bush to break his fall. He made a quick decision--he decided to use a heavier rope. (See Laurence J. Peter,<i>Peter Prescription</i>[New York: William Morrow and Co., 1972], pp. 164–65.) Mr. Lae's decision was right, but his timing was wrong. He had practiced and provided for the climb, but he had overlooked his most important need.<br><br>I think that we all are climbing up a rope. How strong is your rope? Will it resist until the end? You can strengthen your rope constantly by making the right decision, timely and wisely. The opportunity is yours and only yours. I cannot make your decisions for you, nor can your parents or teachers; and you cannot make mine for me. But we are not alone, and there are many here who will help us reach the right kinds of decisions. We are a blessed people because of our past history; because of our family history and examples; because of our friends, our teachers, our bishops, our leaders, our country, our university, our Church. It was Aristotle who said that those who have the responsibility of teaching and educating children should even be more honored than the parents because the parents give life but the others give the art of living.<br><br>May these thoughts help you select the art of living that is offered to you in a unique period of our civilization, a period where we have the Church of Jesus Christ on the earth, which is led by a prophet and based on direct revelation for your benefit and for your future happiness.<br><br>You may remember the story in the beginning of the Book of Mormon where Lehi had a dream that he shared with his family. His sons were asked to go back to get the records of Laban. You may remember that they tried different methods. They cast lots, they tried to sell their gold and their silver, until finally Nephi, the one who was faithful, said, "Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.1?lang=eng#primary">1 Ne. 4:1</a>). They then succeeded. There is one short sentence in that fourth chapter of 1 Nephi that tells us why he succeeded, a little sentence that can serve as a key for us today: "And I was led by the Spirit" (verse 6).<br><br>Are we prepared today to be led by the Spirit? Do we know what it means to live by the spirit of Jesus Christ, to know him, to talk to our Heavenly Father through Jesus Christ? It is important that in this difficult period of time we know there is a church to help us, a church, as I said, led by a living prophet and based on direct revelation. I testify to you that I know that this Church is true, that President Kimball is a living prophet, that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior, our Redeemer, and that there is a plan of salvation that is an art of living and that has been prepared by my Heavenly Father to help me prepare to meet him; and I am very happy to be able to share this testimony with you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Charles A.

<h1>ting, Measurements, and Objectives - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful, brothers and sisters, for the invitation that brings me here today. It is always a privilege to be on this campus and to participate in any way in the important processes that go forward here. I am especially grateful to be here as a part of this devotional today and trust that the Spirit of the Lord will bless us so that the things I have prepared will be carried into your hearts and understandings with some edification and some benefit for you. I would like to share with you today some thoughts on setting goals and measuring progress.<br><br>Much has been said and written in recent years about the value of goal setting and the importance of guiding our lives toward certain predetermined objectives. This process has taken on many of the aspects of an exact science. It has found expression in the world of education in the form of behavioral objectives, and in the corporate and industrial world it manifests itself in a "management-by-objective" philosophy. Some individuals feel that unless each hour of each day is programmed to achieve specific objectives, life cannot be lived to the fullest, and personal potential is being cheated. In fact, this general notion has become so universally accepted that to question the value of goal setting in the achievement of any public or private enterprise is no longer rational in the general point of view.<br><br>Setting goals and objectives to guide one's efforts toward accomplishment is one of the processes of human dynamics that can be demonstrated to yield positive results. It is a process, however, that can also be restricting and limiting when it is distorted or misguided. It is important to hold this process in the right perspective when we seek to understand the principles that lead to human progress.<br><br>An important distinction must be made between the potentially confining process of setting goals and objectives and the more encompassing need of having a general purpose in life. This distinction is more than a play on words. One's purpose in life has an overriding influence upon what he does with his time, energy, and resources. It can also have a profound effect upon how he relates to other people. Without this purpose life has no compass. Within the framework of such a purpose, there is an acceptable place for much spontaneity and flexibility. Indeed, without this freedom life can become stilted and sterile, and much of the potential for progressive inspiration and renewal can be thwarted. Unless the goals and objectives an individual works toward are harmonious with his general purpose in life, a devastating kind of internal conflict can develop that is destructive to happiness and personal development. Appropriate, useful goals and objectives must be a direct outgrowth of one's perceived purpose in life. Otherwise they can lead to a random expenditure of effort and resources that may not contribute effectively to long-range progress.<br><br>Purpose entails much that is qualitative. It does not always lend itself to quantitative measurement in terms of numbers, percentages, size, and volume. In today's material world most objectives are considered to be meaningless unless they are expressed in quantitative terms and are susceptible to measurement within these terms.<br><br>It is important for us to bear in mind that worthwhile goals and objectives can be of a qualitative nature as well as a quantitative one; that is, they can relate to the quality of people, things, and relationships as well as to numbers and size. In a materialistic society much more attention and validity seem to be attached to quantitative goals, probably because they are more easily measured and reflect more directly profit and loss, material growth, and production. This should not lead to the conclusion that attainments of a qualitative nature are less important than those that lend themselves to easy numerical measurement. In fact, in the realm of moral and spiritual things, qualities may be much more significant than quantities. The nature of one's relationship to others may have more significance and more value than his "productivity."<br><br>There is no conclusive evidence that setting and working toward quantitative objectives always and inevitably produces beneficial qualitative effects in one's life. Indeed, a too-intent focus upon the acquisition or production of quantities of things may actually obscure the need for qualitative development, and in the world of spiritual things, such a condition could be an obstruction to the achievement of the goals that matter most.<br><br>The material world places a high premium on quantitative things. Gross national product, profit margins, sales and production quotas, interest rates are the substance of corporate life and death. Men and women ascend to positions of power and authority on the basis of their ability to<i>produce</i>, and on their capacity to get others to do the same. In this arena product can easily be thought of as having greater importance than people. People can be viewed as a means to enhance production. Success and achievement can become product-centered. Product is measurable. Goals and objectives in this environment are generally and understandably of a quantitative nature. Survival depends on it.<br><br>Interestingly, such a focus upon attaining measurable objectives seems to generate a tendency to program production methods and procedures in order to guarantee acceptable production levels. This can apply to the attainment of sales quotas as well as to quotas of materials that flow from the production line. It can be effectively demonstrated that programming and regimentation of procedure will result in acceptable minimum production levels and thus provide a safe profit margin. Systems, processes, and programs therefore become essential in most profit-making enterprises.<br><br>Offering material incentives to stimulate sales or production is also a common practice. Competition is generally intense--competition for notoriety and power as well as for material rewards. All of this contributes toward increased production. In this atmosphere of competition and struggle for preeminence, the adage "When performance is measured, performance improves" generally holds true, especially when position and compensation are at stake. When objectives can be expressed quantitatively in terms of profit and loss and when peoples' continued employment and promise of reward are based upon meeting these objectives, then the management-by-objective system becomes a reasonable and profitable approach to administration.<br><br>Whether this approach can be applied with equal success to the attainment of spiritual and moral qualities is open to question. Spiritual qualities do not necessarily develop in the same environment as that which fosters the attributes upon which such high value is placed in the material world, nor can they always be accurately measured in a quantitative way. This is not to suggest that qualities of the spirit are not susceptible to assessment. But they must be assessed by spiritual means. They often reflect from individual lives in an observable way. They are closely associated with feelings, attitudes, commitments, and perceptions, but they are not always easily measured in a quantitative way at arbitrarily established audit periods.<br><br>At one time Elder Adam S. Bennion drew attention to the fact that Abraham Lincoln probably saw his first slave auction when he was about sixteen. While this experience undoubtedly left a profound impression upon the young man, he did not go back to his home and immediately produce the Emancipation Proclamation. The additional encounters and experiences that brought Lincoln to a position of commitment and a course of action in opposition to slavery all made their contributions to the final outcome, but their individual effect was not overtly measurable at particular points in his early life. One's assessment of what was happening in his consciousness and conviction would likely have depended upon more subtle perceptions and discernment.<br><br>The same is so often true of one who experiences conversion to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This conversion process can be a lengthy one. It can have a profound effect upon one's purpose in life. But its progress cannot always be accurately assessed by measurable performance at arbitrary points in time.<br><br>Those who attempt to measure qualitative growth with a quantitative measuring system of necessity must look for a "product." This product generally takes the form of some overt behavior or performance that can be counted and evaluated numerically. The frequency or regularity with which the performance is given is taken to be a direct reflection of the quality of commitment possessed by the individual who is being measured. Those who rely upon this kind of assessment often submit to the temptation to program for specific kinds of measurable performances, presumably related to the qualities desired in the individual. These performances are taken to be a direct evidence of internal commitment and conviction. Since the numbers or percentages now "produced" by the responsive individual become the prime measuring rod of his devotion, the tendency increases to program and regiment specified kinds of behavior so that the numbers and percentages will look good. Those who devise the programs and prescribe the activities must now demonstrate their success on the basis of the numbers produced.<br><br>In this process the importance of people and their intrinsic qualities can easily become subverted to the need for their production of measurable data. If the data is good, the people are presumed to be progressing qualitatively as well. The thesis that produces this system requires that this conclusion have validity. Unfortunately, there is much of history and experience to prove that the system does not always work. Inevitably it has produced discrepancies and distortions. Such was the case with the children of Israel under the law of Moses. Outward performance, that which the apostle Paul referred to as the "works of the Law," became the primary objective.<br><br>One of the most difficult challenges for the apostle Paul and other missionaries in the meridian of times was the unyielding loyalty of the converted Jews to the ritualism and outward performances of the law of Moses. Even those who accepted Christ and became baptized members of his church had great difficulty in relinquishing their ties to the old law. Apparently, many of them insisted on perpetuating, even after baptism, the programs and practices that had been developed over many years by the Jewish religious leaders. Some of them insisted that gentile converts to the Church also adopt the practices of the law. Obviously, they attached an efficacy to these performances and rituals that they could not easily discard.<br><br>Their insistence on perpetuating these things within the new Church was a constant source of concern for Paul. It was even an occasional cause for discord and misunderstanding among Church leaders, as Paul indicates in his letter to the Galatians. (See Gal. 2:11.) There is evidence in the book of Acts that some Christian Jews followed in the footsteps of Paul and his missionary successes, attempting to convince Paul's converts that they must now adopt the programs of the Jewish law as well as the principles of the restored gospel. This led to a major controversy in the Church and precipitated a general-level leadership conference in Jerusalem that Paul attended to represent the views of the gentile saints.<br><br>The account of this conference, which can be found in the fifteenth chapter of Acts, is most revealing. It discloses the intense loyalty that many Church leaders still felt toward the programs and procedures of the old law. This loyalty was obviously an outgrowth of a deep-set conviction on the part of some Church leaders that the "works of the law" were essential to salvation and that individual progress and perfection could not occur without a strict observance of the rituals. After "much disputing" at this conference, Peter made an attempt at a compromise that would free the gentile converts from adherence to the provisions of the law, but that would apparently allow the Jewish Christians to continue their old practices if they chose to do so. While Peter's recommendation was accepted by this conference, it is apparent that the issue was not settled. Adherents to the practices within the Law of Moses continued to press for an acceptance of their position, and many years later, when Paul visited Jerusalem once again, he encountered the same controversy. (See Acts 21:17–24.)<br><br>This loyalty to and affinity for programs that were an outgrowth of the ritualism and regimentation of the past proved to be a great obstacle to accepting the simple, basic principles that the gospel of Christ provided. For the converted Jews, whose lives had been so filled with the programmed requirements of the law, and whose religious commitment had been demonstrated by their outward observance of these requirements, the religious life outlined by the gospel of Christ must have seemed very open and unregulated. It was not easy for them to leave the feeling of security provided by the total regimentation of the Jewish law. Obviously, they could not understand how the gentile saints could possibly be trusted to develop any of the qualities prescribed by the new beliefs without the same set of regulations and programs to guide them and fill up their lives.<br><br>As the Savior confronted this same problem among the Jews, he not only decried the meaningless machinations that the law had imposed upon them, but he blamed this outward ritualism for having crowded out of their lives the qualities of virtue, charity, and compassion that were so important to the life plan that he reintroduced. He accused the Pharisees and scribes of fostering this hypocrisy, and to them he said,<br><br><i>Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</i><br><br><i>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</i>[Mark 7:6,8]<br><br>He accused them of being like whited sepulchres, impressive in their outward show, but inside full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. (See Matt. 23:27.)<br><br>It appears that the Savior was not only concerned with the unproductive expenditure of effort required by the programmed processes of the law, but he was also alert to the inevitable diversion from the development of the important inward qualities of life that are so essential to salvation.<br><br>Paul attacked this same problem in his great admonition to the Corinthian Saints on the subject of charity (see 1 Cor. 13). To the Galatians who had begun to experience the freedom offered by the gospel of Christ, Paul said,<br><br><i>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. . . .</i><br><br><i>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</i>[Gal. 5:1–2, 6]<br><br>There is sometimes the danger that the true purpose of an endeavor can be lost in the compulsion to make the records look good. As an example of this, I cite an incident recently related to me by a young wife who had just gone through the trauma of losing a baby through premature birth. Throughout the month of semiconfinement that preceded this misfortune, members of the Relief Society in this sister's ward made frequent calls on her to comfort her, to bring meals for the family, and to be of general assistance. Their caring concern and attention had been much appreciated.<br><br>Following her release from the hospital, this sister deeply felt the need to spend some private time with her scriptures and in prayerful quest for understanding. She reported that on a day close to the end of the month she was at home alone, particularly impressed and inspired by some part of the scriptures she had been reading. A sweet spirit of peace and consolation rested upon her, and she felt a closeness to the Lord and the reality of his love in a way she had never before experienced.<br><br>She was absorbed in this experience when the telephone rang. She reluctantly answered, only to find that it was one of the Relief Society sisters who had been in her home several times earlier in the month. On this occasion the call was to solicit a time during the day when an official visit could be made to present the visiting teaching lesson for the month. When the sister who related this incident to me asked to forego the lesson in view of the fact that the visiting teachers had already been in her home several times during the month, and more especially because she did not wish to have her restoring interlude with the scriptures interrupted, she was reminded that this was the<i>last</i>day of the month. On the earlier visits the official lesson for the month had not been presented. Therefore, the visits could not be counted.<br><br>Reluctantly, the ailing sister left her scriptures and cleaned her house in preparation for her visiting teachers. The spirit of the morning was lost and was replaced by a feeling of resentment and hurt. The visiting teachers' perfect record remained intact--but at what cost?<br><br>As members of the Church and human beings in general reach for a higher level of moral and spiritual attainment, they will be required to more clearly define the principal purposes in life. They will need to be motivated more toward the qualities of life associated with this kind of existence than toward the quantities of things they can produce or acquire. Historically people have always achieved their highest levels in material acquisitions as a by-product of their attainment of high spiritual and moral qualities. It has never occurred in reverse order as to time sequence nor as to priority.<br><br>Goals and objectives within the framework of life's true purpose can be helpful in motivating and maintaining general direction. The more important of these will be of a qualitative nature and their achievement must be evaluated more by discernment and observation than by quantitative measurement. In such an environment the doctrines of the priesthood will distill upon the people as the dews from heaven. Whatever dominion is achieved by man over himself or over material things will come then not by compulsion, but as a natural and inevitable result of his having qualified for such an endowment. (See D&amp;amp;C 84.) In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dean L.

<h1>n Deadly Heresies - Bruce R. McConkie - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have sought and do now seek that guidance and enlightenment which comes from the Holy Spirit of God. I desire to speak by the power of the Holy Ghost so that my words will be true and wise and proper. When any of us speak by the power of the Spirit, we say what the Lord wants said, or, better, what he would say if he were here in person.<br><br>I shall depart from my normal and usual pattern and read portions of my presentation because I want to state temperately and accurately the doctrinal principles involved and to say them in a way that will not leave room for doubt or question. I shall speak on some matters that some may consider to be controversial, though they ought not to be. They are things on which we ought to be united, and to the extent we are all guided and enlightened from on high we will be. If we are so united--and there will be no disagreement among those who believe and understand the revealed word--we will progress and advance and grow in the things of the Spirit; we will prepare ourselves for a life of peace and happiness and joy here and now, and for an eventual eternal reward in the kingdom of our Father.<br><br>There is a song or a saying or a proverb or a legend or a tradition or something that speaks of seven deadly sins. I know nothing whatever about these and hope you do not. My subject is one about which some few of you, unfortunately, do know a little. It is "The Seven Deadly Heresies" --not the great heresies of a lost and fallen Christendom, but some that have crept in among us.<br><br>Now I take a text. These words were written by Paul to certain ancient Saints. In principle they apply to us:<br><br><i>I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</i><br><br><i>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</i>[1 Corinthians 11:18–19]<br><br>Now let me list some axioms (I guess in academic circles we call these caveats):<br><br>--There is no salvation in believing a false doctrine.<br><br>--Truth, diamond truth, truth unmixed with error, truth alone leads to salvation.<br><br>--What we believe determines what we do.<br><br>--No man can be saved in ignorance of God and his laws.<br><br>--Man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge of Jesus Christ and the saving truths of his everlasting gospel.<br><br>--Gospel doctrines belong to the Lord, not to men. They are his. He ordained them, he reveals them, and he expects us to believe them.<br><br>--The doctrines of salvation are not discovered in a laboratory or on a geological field trip or by accompanying Darwin around the world. They come by revelation and in no other way.<br><br>--Our sole concern in seeking truth should be to learn and believe what the Lord knows and believes. Providentially he has set forth some of his views in the holy scriptures.<br><br>--Our goal as mortals is to gain the mind of Christ, to believe what he believes, to think what he thinks, to say what he says, to do what he does, and to be as he is.<br><br>--We are called upon to reject all heresies and cleave unto all truth. Only then can we progress according to the divine plan. As the Lord has said,<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Please note that knowledge is gained by obedience. It comes by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. In the ultimate and full sense it comes only by revelation from the Holy Ghost. There are some things a sinful man does not and cannot know. The Lord's people are promised: "By the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). But if they do not seek the Spirit, if they do not accept the revelations God has given, if they cannot distinguish between the revealed word and the theories of men, they have no promise of gaining a fullness of truth by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Now may I suggest the list of heresies.<br><br>Heresy one: There are those who say that God is progressing in knowledge and is learning new truths.<br><br>This is false--utterly, totally, and completely. There is not one sliver of truth in it. It grows out of a wholly twisted and incorrect view of the King Follett Sermon and of what is meant by eternal progression.<br><br>God progresses in the sense that his kingdoms increase and his dominions multiply--not in the sense that he learns new truths and discovers new laws. God is not a student. He is not a laboratory technician. He is not postulating new theories on the basis of past experiences. He has indeed graduated to that state of exaltation that consists of knowing all things and having all power.<br><br>The life that God lives is named<i>eternal life.</i>His name, one of them, is "Eternal," using that word as a noun and not as an adjective, and he uses that name to identify the type of life that he lives. God's life is eternal life, and eternal life is God's life. They are one and the same. Eternal life is the reward we shall obtain if we believe and obey and walk uprightly before him. And eternal life consists of two things. It consists of life in the family unit, and, also, of inheriting, receiving, and possessing the fullness of the glory of the Father. Anyone who has each of these things is an inheritor and possessor of the greatest of all gifts of God, which is eternal life.<br><br>Eternal progression consists of living the kind of life God lives and of increasing in kingdoms and dominions everlastingly. Why anyone should suppose that an infinite and eternal being who has presided in our universe for almost 2,555,000,000 years, who made the sidereal heavens, whose creations are more numerous than the particles of the earth, and who is aware of the fall of every sparrow--why anyone would suppose that such a being has more to learn and new truths to discover in the laboratories of eternity is totally beyond my comprehension.<br><br>Will he one day learn something that will destroy the plan of salvation and turn man and the universe into an uncreated nothingness? Will he discover a better plan of salvation than the one he has already given to men in worlds without number?<br><br>The saving truth, as revealed to and taught, formally and officially, by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the<i>Lectures on Faith</i>is that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. He knows all things, he has all power, and he is everywhere present by the power of his Spirit. And unless we know and believe this doctrine we cannot gain faith unto life and salvation.<br><br>Joseph Smith also taught in the<i>Lectures on Faith</i>"that three things are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life and salvation." These he named as--<br><br>1. The idea that he actually exists;<br><br>2. A<i>correct</i>idea of his character, perfections, and attributes; and<br><br>3. An actual knowledge that the course of life which he is pursuing is according to the divine will.<br><br>The attributes of God are given as knowledge, faith or power, justice, judgment, mercy, and truth. The perfections of God are named as "the perfections which belong to all of the attributes of his nature," which is to say that God possesses and has all knowledge, all faith or power, all justice, all judgment, all mercy, and all truth. He is indeed the very embodiment and personification and source of all these attributes. Does anyone suppose that God can be more honest than he already is? Neither need any suppose there are truths he does not know or knowledge he does not possess.<br><br>Thus Joseph Smith taught, and these are his words:<br><br><i>Without the knowledge of all things, God would not be able to save any portion of his creatures; for it is by reason of the knowledge which he has of all things, from the beginning to the end, that enables him to give that understanding to his creatures by which they are made partakers of eternal life; and if it were not for the idea existing in the minds of men that God had all knowledge it would be impossible for them to exercise faith in him.</i>[As quoted by Bruce R. McConkie in<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p.264]<br><br>If God is just dabbling with a few truths he has already chanced to learn or experimenting with a few facts he has already discovered, we have no idea as to the real end and purpose of creation.<br><br>Heresy two concerns itself with the relationship between organic evolution and revealed religion and asks the question whether they can be harmonized.<br><br>There are those who believe that the theory of organic evolution runs counter to the plain and explicit principles set forth in the holy scriptures as these have been interpreted and taught by Joseph Smith and his associates. There are others who think that evolution is the system used by the Lord to form plant and animal life and to place man on earth.<br><br>May I say that all truth is in agreement, that true religion and true science bear the same witness, and that in the true and full sense, true science is part of true religion. But may I also raise some questions of a serious nature. Is there any way to harmonize the false religions of the Dark Ages with the truths of science as they have now been discovered? Is there any way to harmonize the revealed religion that has come to us with the theoretical postulates of Darwinism and the diverse speculations descending therefrom?<br><br>Should we accept the famous document of the First Presidency issued in the days of President Joseph F. Smith and entitled "The Origin of Man" as meaning exactly what it says? Is it the doctrine of the gospel that Adam stood next to Christ in power and might and intelligence before the foundations of the world were laid; that Adam was placed on this earth as an immortal being; that there was no death in the world for him or for any form of life until after the Fall; that the fall of Adam brought temporal and spiritual death into the world; that this temporal death passed upon all forms of life, upon man and animal and fish and fowl and plant life; that Christ came to ransom man and all forms of life from the effects of the temporal death brought into the world through the Fall, and in the case of man from a spiritual death also; and that this ransom includes a resurrection for man and for all forms of life? Can you harmonize these things with the evolutionary postulate that death has always existed and that the various forms of life have evolved from preceding forms over astronomically long periods of time?<br><br>Can you harmonize the theories of men with the inspired words that say:<br><br><i>And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</i><br><br><i>And they</i>[meaning Adam and Eve]<i>would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.</i><br><br><i>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</i><br><br><i>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall.</i>[2 Nephi 2:22–26]<br><br>These are questions to which all of us should find answers. Every person must choose for himself what he will believe. I recommend that all of you study and ponder and pray and seek light and knowledge in these and in all fields.<br><br>I believe that the atonement of Christ is the great and eternal foundation upon which revealed religion rests. I believe that no man can be saved unless he believes that our Lord's atoning sacrifice brings immortality to all and eternal life to those who believe and obey, and no man can believe in the atonement unless he accepts both the divine sonship of Christ and the fall of Adam.<br><br>My reasoning causes me to conclude that if death has always prevailed in the world, then there was no fall of Adam that brought death to all forms of life; that if Adam did not fall, there is no need for an atonement; that if there was no atonement, there is no salvation, no resurrection, and no eternal life; and that if there was no atonement, there is nothing in all of the glorious promises that the Lord has given us. I believe that the Fall affects man, all forms of life, and the earth itself, and that the Atonement affects man, all forms of life, and the earth itself.<br><br>Heresy three: There are those who say that temple marriage assures us of an eventual exaltation. Some have supposed that couples married in the temple who commit all manner of sin, and who then pay the penalty, will gain their exaltation eventually.<br><br>This notion is contrary to the whole system and plan that the Lord has ordained, a system under which we are privileged to work out our salvation with fear and trembling before him. If we believe and obey, if we enter the waters of baptism and make solemn covenants with the Lord to keep his commandments, we thereby get on a strait and narrow path that leads from the gate of repentance and baptism to a reward that is called eternal life. And if we traverse the length of the path going upward and forward and onward, keeping the commandments, loving the Lord, and doing all that we ought to do, eventually we will be inheritors of that reward.<br><br>And in exactly and precisely the same sense, celestial marriage is a gate that puts us on a path leading to exaltation in the highest heaven of the celestial world. It is in that highest realm of glory and dignity and honor hereafter that the family unit continues. Those who inherit a place in the highest heaven receive the reward that is named eternal life. Baptism is a gate; celestial marriage is a gate. When we get on the paths of which I speak, we are then obligated to keep the commandments. My suggestion in this field is that you go to the temple and listen to a ceremony of celestial marriage, paying particular and especial attention to the words, and learn what the promises are that are given. And you will learn that all of the promises given are conditioned upon subsequent compliance with all of the terms and conditions of that order of matrimony.<br><br>Heresy four: There are those who believe that the doctrine of salvation for the dead offers men a second chance for salvation.<br><br>I knew a man, now deceased, not a member of the Church, who was a degenerate old reprobate who found pleasure, as he supposed, in living after the manner of the world. A cigarette dangled from his lips, alcohol stenched his breath, and profane and bawdy stories defiled his lips. His moral status left much to be desired.<br><br>His wife was a member of the Church, as faithful as she could be under the circumstances. One day she said to him, "You know the Church is true; why won't you be baptized?" He replied, "Of course I know the Church is true, but I have no intention of changing my habits in order to join it. I prefer to live the way I do. But that doesn't worry me in the slightest. I know that as soon as I die, you will have someone go to the temple and do the work for me and everything will come out all right in the end anyway."<br><br>He died and she had the work done in the temple. We do not sit in judgment and deny vicarious ordinances to people. But what will it profit him?<br><br>There is no such thing as a second chance to gain salvation. This life is the time and the day of our probation. After this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.<br><br>For those who do not have an opportunity to believe and obey the holy word in this life, the first chance to gain salvation will come in the spirit world. If those who hear the word for the first time in the realms ahead are the kind of people who would have accepted the gospel here, had the opportunity been afforded them, they will accept it there. Salvation for the dead is for those whose first chance to gain salvation is in the spirit world.<br><br>In the revelation recently added to our canon of holy writ, these words are found:<br><br><i>Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God;</i><br><br><i>Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom;</i><br><br><i>For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 137:7–9]<br><br>There is no other promise of salvation than the one recited in that revelation. Those who reject the gospel in this life and then receive it in the spirit world go not to the celestial, but to the terrestrial kingdom.<br><br>Heresy five: There are those who say that there is progression from one kingdom to another in the eternal worlds or that lower kingdoms eventually progress to where higher kingdoms once were.<br><br>This belief lulls men into a state of carnal security. It causes them to say, "God is so merciful; surely he will save us all eventually; if we do not gain the celestial kingdom now, eventually we will; so why worry?" It lets people live a life of sin here and now with the hope that they will be saved eventually.<br><br>The true doctrine is that all men will be resurrected, but they will come forth in the resurrection with different kinds of bodies--some celestial, others terrestrial, others telestial, and some with bodies incapable of standing any degree of glory. The body we receive in the resurrection determines the glory we receive in the kingdoms that are prepared.<br><br>Of those in the telestial world it is written: "And they shall be servants of the Most High; but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end" (D&amp;amp;C 76:112).<br><br>Of those who had the opportunity to enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage in this life and who did not do it, the revelation says:<br><br><i>Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven; which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.</i><br><br><i>For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:16–17]<br><br>They neither progress from one kingdom to another, nor does a lower kingdom ever get where a higher kingdom once was. Whatever eternal progression there is, it is within a sphere.<br><br>Heresy six: There are those who believe or say they believe that Adam is our father and our god, that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies, and that he is the one we worship.<br><br>The devil keeps this heresy alive as a means of obtaining converts to cultism. It is contrary to the whole plan of salvation set forth in the scriptures, and anyone who has read the Book of Moses, and anyone who has received the temple endowment, has no excuse whatever for being led astray by it. Those who are so ensnared reject the living prophet and close their ears to the apostles of their day. "We will follow those who went before," they say. And having so determined, they soon are ready to enter polygamous relationships that destroy their souls.<br><br>We worship the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Holy Ghost; and Adam is their foremost servant, by whom the peopling of our planet was commenced.<br><br>Heresy seven: There are those who believe we must be perfect to gain salvation.<br><br>This is not really a great heresy, only a doctrinal misunderstanding that I mention here in order to help round out our discussion and to turn our attention from negative to positive things. If we keep two principles in mind we will thereby know that good and faithful members of the Church will be saved, even though they are far from perfect in this life.<br><br>These two principles are (1) that this life is the appointed time for men to prepare to meet God--this life is the day of our probation; and (2) that the same spirit which possesses our bodies at the time we go out of this mortal life shall have power to possess our bodies in that eternal world.<br><br>What we are doing as members of the Church is charting a course leading to eternal life. There was only one perfect being, the Lord Jesus. If men had to be perfect and live all of the law strictly, wholly, and completely, there would be only one saved person in eternity. The prophet taught that there are many things to be done, even beyond the grave, in working out our salvation.<br><br>And so what we do in this life is chart a course leading to eternal life. That course begins here and now and continues in the realms ahead. We must determine in our hearts and in our souls, with all the power and ability we have, that from this time forward we will press on in righteousness; by so doing we can go where God and Christ are. If we make that firm determination, and are in the course of our duty when this life is over, we will continue in that course in eternity. That same spirit that possesses our bodies at the time we depart from this mortal life will have power to possess our bodies in the eternal world. If we go out of this life loving the Lord, desiring righteousness, and seeking to acquire the attributes of godliness, we will have that same spirit in the eternal world, and we will then continue to advance and progress until an ultimate, destined day when we will possess, receive, and inherit all things.<br><br>Now I do not say these are the only great heresies that prevail among us. There are others that might be mentioned. My suggestion, relative to all doctrines and all principles, is that we become students of holy writ, and that we conform our thinking and our beliefs to what is found in the standard works. We need to be less concerned about the views and opinions that others have expressed and drink directly from the fountain the Lord has given us. Then we shall come to a true understanding of the points of his doctrine. And if we pursue such a course, we will soon find that it proceeds in a different direction than the one that the world pursues. We will not be troubled with the intellectual views and expressions of uninspired people. We will soon obtain for ourselves the witness of the Spirit that we are pursuing a course that is pleasing to the Lord, and this knowledge will have a cleansing and sanctifying and edifying influence upon us.<br><br>Now, in order to have things in perspective, let me identify the three greatest heresies in all Christendom. They do not prevail among us, fortunately, but they are part of the gross and universal darkness that covers the earth and blots out from the minds of men those truths upon which salvation rests.<br><br>The greatest truth known to man is that there is a God in heaven who is infinite and eternal; that he is the creator, upholder, and preserver of all things; that he created us and the sidereal heavens and ordained and established a plan of salvation whereby we might advance and progress and become like him. The truth pertaining to him is that he is our Father in heaven, that he has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's, that he is a literal person, and that if we believe and obey his laws we can gain the exaltation that he possesses. Now that is the greatest truth and the most glorious concept known to the human mind, and the reverse of it is the greatest heresy in all Christendom.<br><br>The Christian heresy, where God is concerned, is that Deity is a spirit essence that fills the immensity of space; that he is three beings in one; that he is uncreated, incorporeal, and incomprehensible; that he is without body, parts, or passions; that he is a spirit nothingness that is everywhere and nowhere in particular present. These are concepts written in the creeds had in the churches of the world.<br><br>The second greatest truth in all eternity pertains to the divine sonship of the Lord, Jesus Christ. It includes the eternal verity that he was foreordained in the councils of eternity to come to earth and be the redeemer of men, to come and ransom men from the temporal and spiritual death brought upon them by the fall of Adam. This second greatest truth is that Christ worked out the infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice because of which all men are raised in immortality and those who believe and obey are raised also unto eternal life.<br><br>Now the second greatest heresy in all Christendom is designed to destroy the glories and wonders of the infinite and eternal atonement. It is that men are saved by some kind of lip service, by the grace of God, without work and without effort on their part.<br><br>The third greatest truth known to mankind is that the Holy Spirit of God is a revelator and a sanctifier, that he is a personage of spirit, that his assigned ministry and work in the eternal Godhead is to bear record of the Father and of the Son, to reveal them and their truths to men. His work is to cleanse and perfect human souls, to burn dross and evil out of human souls as though by fire. We call that the baptism of fire.<br><br>Now the opposite of that is the third greatest heresy in all Christendom. It is that revelation has ceased, that God's mouth is closed, that the Holy Ghost no longer inspires men, that the gifts of the Spirit were done away with after the death of the ancient apostles, and that we no longer need to follow the course they charted.<br><br>I simply name these things; I think you will want to weigh and evaluate what is involved. I think you will want to ponder and wonder and search the scriptures. After Jesus had been teaching the Nephites as a resurrected person, giving them as much truth as in his wisdom he felt they could absorb at one time, he counseled them to go to their homes, and to ponder in their hearts the things he had said, and to pray to the Father in his name to find out if they were true, and then to come again on the morrow and he would teach them more.<br><br>Now that gives us the pattern by which we should operate in the Church. We come together in congregations, seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit, studying the revelations, reading the scriptures, and hearing expressions of doctrine and counsel given by those who are appointed. These teachings ought to be delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit. They ought to be received by the same power. And if they are, then the speaker and the hearer will be mutually edified, and we will have true and proper worship.<br><br>Then when the meeting is over, the "amen" should not end it. We should go to our homes and to our families and to our circles, and we should search out the revelations and find out what the Lord has said on the subjects involved. We should seek to get in tune with the Holy Spirit and to gain a witness, not solely of the truth and divinity of the work in which we are engaged but also of the doctrines that are taught by those who preach to us. We come into these congregations, and sometimes a speaker brings a jug of living water that has in it many gallons. And when he pours it out on the congregation, all the members have brought is a single cup and so that's all they take away. Or maybe they have their hands over the cups, and they don't get anything to speak of.<br><br>On other occasions we have meetings where the speaker comes and all he brings is a little cup of eternal truth, and the members of the congregation come with a large jug, and all they get in their jugs is the little dribble that came from a man who should have known better and who should have prepared himself and talked from the revelations and spoken by the power of the Holy Spirit. We are obligated in the Church to speak by the power of the Spirit. We are commanded to treasure up the words of light and truth and then give forth the portion that is appropriate and needful on every occasion.<br><br>I do not think that the heresies I have named are common in the Church. I think that the great majority of the members of the Church believe and understand true doctrines and seek to apply true principles in their lives. Unfortunately, there are a few people who agitate and stir these matters up, who have some personal ax to grind, and who desire to spread philosophies of their own, philosophies that, as near as the judges in Israel can discern, are not in harmony with the mind and will and purpose of the Lord. It is incumbent upon us to believe the truth. We have the obligation to find out what is truth, and then we have the obligation to walk in the light and to apply the truths that we have learned to ourselves and to influence others to do likewise.<br><br>Now the glorious and wondrous thing about this whole system of revealed religion that the Lord, our God, has given us is the fact that it is true. There isn't a grander, a more glorious, a more wondrous concept than the simple one that the work in which we are engaged is true. And because it is true it will triumph and prevail, and the knowledge of God and his truths will roll forth until it covers the whole earth as the waters cover the sea. We do not expect to have a perfect society among us until the millennial day dawns. But that is not far distant. And when that day comes, we will all, as the scriptures say, see eye to eye and speak with one voice, and the Lord himself will dwell among us. He could not dwell among us now because we are divided and we are not living in that perfect harmony and unity and with that devotion that prevailed among the Saints in the city of Enoch.<br><br>God grant that we may be wise in what we do, that we may seek truth, that we may live in harmony with the truth, that we may bear testimony of the truth, and that we may, as a consequence, have joy and peace and happiness here and now and be inheritors, in due course, of eternal reward in our Father's kingdom. This is my prayer for myself and for all of you, and for all of the members of the Church, and for honest truthseekers everywhere, and I offer it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1>t of Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young fellow students, this is the type of Brigham Young University that I am more familiar with, about the size that I was acquainted with some time ago. It seems never to have gotten on the record that while I graduated from the University of Utah, I attended Brigham Young University at one time; and I have fond memories of those far-gone days. As Debbie Mitchell sang to us this morning in the spirit of a devotional assembly, I recalled how frequently, in numbers approximating the numbers we have here, we met down on the lower campus. I had the experience at that time of singing in the male and mixed choruses, and I gained something of an appreciation for this type of devotional experience. I sincerely pray that I may add something to your experience today.<br><br>As I have tried to contemplate what would be appropriate and edifying to say to this distinguished group of students and teachers, I have spent more than a usual amount of time in reflection.<br><br>I attended a Boy Scout court of honor a short time ago, and I was impressed, as I have been before, with the power of the Scout Oath: "On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country."<br><br>I felt that I would like to do justice to the concept "On my honor." As I have pursued the theme, it has led me into various branching paths. Honor, of course, implies honesty. These concepts led me to think of truth, and truth led me to light. I found myself considering virtue and a recognition of its opposites--evil, error, wickedness, and falsehood--and I felt the movement of our time that threatens virtue with the substitute of self-gratification, replacing freedom with license and with the proposition that there is neither good nor evil but only the right to follow your own point of view.<br><br>False teachers usually take the attitude that they have discovered something new and that their concepts are the ultimate truth. The opposite is frequently the case.<br><br>I had a teacher in geology of whom it was said, "He has rewritten all the books on the geology of Utah." A wise companion said to me, "Don't let that bother you. It won't be long until someone else will rewrite his books. He doesn't know it all yet either."<br><br>I had a history teacher who was insisting that the Bible was a fable as he made certain allegations about the origins of civilization. I challenged him one day by agreeing that as history the Bible was somewhat fragmentary, to which he quickly assented. At that point I asked him why he would discard something that, while imperfect as history, was obviously far more substantial than some of the ideas he was advancing and had a great deal more evidence backing it. He had no further comment.<br><br>Old principles are often the real truth. As we hear the constant theme of the so-called "new morality," we find that it too is as old as the hills. The only thing new is another generation waiting to be beguiled and enslaved.<br><br>Nineteen hundred years ago Peter said the false teachers were doing the same thing, "bring[ing] in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring[ing] upon themselves swift destruction. And many [he said] shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. . . . But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government." (2 Pet. 2:1–2, 10.) Can you see that attitude as you drive down the highway, finding that if you make one false move, the driver in the next car acts as if he would take your head off if he had the chance?<br><br>If you ask people to conform to certain standards of dress or grooming or be personally responsible for the rules of common decency, you frequently receive a snarl or a curse in response. Is that not despising government?<br><br>"But," continues Peter, "these, as natural brute beasts, . . . speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; . . . Having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls." (2 Pet. 2:12,14.) Do you not hear people all around you telling you that wantonness is the best way to live? These unstable souls are indeed beguiled.<br><br><i>An heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</i><br><br><i>Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray. . . .</i><br><br><i>These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</i><br><br><i>For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</i><br><br><i>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</i><br><br><i>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</i><br><br><i>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</i><br><br><i>But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."</i>[2 Pet. 14–15; 17–22]<br><br>And so in literal fulfillment of this prophecy, we can observe the magazine and television ads setting forth the glories of beer-drinking, the allure of the casinos and bars, the riotousness of pleasure-seeking in the modern fashion and in the modern dress or, in many cases, undress. I have heard the remark that someone is going to get into her bikini. That certainly is a contradiction in terms. No one ever got into a bikini. They are almost completely out of it. But the cry is the same as of old: "Wine, women, and song." We have seen the false teachers lead us from the principle of permanent marriage to the idea of temporary marriage and on to the concept of no marriage at all--and this in the short space of a few years.<br><br>We have been told that the way to eliminate the crime of drug abuse is to make drugs legal. We have eliminated bootlegging in our society by legalizing liquor. The way, therefore, to eliminate prostitution must be to make every woman a freewill harlot. All these are the inducements and temptations that speak evil of the way of truth. They represent a perversion of truth and a departure from the true way as it has been known from the beginning.<br><br>When Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate, he was asked: "Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." And Pilate made it plain that he was not of the truth. Either in confusion or in worldly cynicism, he asked: "What is truth?" (See John 18:37–38). Can you hear this helpless response around the world today? An ex-president answers the evidence of his duplicity with the implied statement: "What is truth?" His great weakness was that he couldn't tell the difference. The same with a former vice president. A candidate, when asked to tell the truth about what really happened, says in essence: "What is truth?" And as with the priest, so it is with the people. Can there ever be an adulterer without his being a liar? What about the covenants of marriage? What member of the Church can commit fornication without breaking the covenant of baptism? And so I speak to you today who are of the covenant. You have been brought up in light and truth and know the way of safety and salvation. It is our constant desire to so express the warnings that you will always be alert to the pitfalls that surround us in our society and daily lives.<br><br>One of the truest examples of the present condition of the world was brought to my attention many years ago when a man by the name of Ray Smith spoke in our sacrament meeting. Brother Smith had been involved over a number of years with the prisoners at the Utah State Penitentiary, and he told us some of his experiences with prisoners. He mentioned that on one occasion as he was speaking to a group of Church members, a woman pled with him, "When you return to the prison, Brother Smith, I wish you would look up my son. He needs help." And then she said something that Brother Smith found hard to understand: "He was always a good boy."<br><br>Brother Smith soon made contact with this young man, who he said appeared to be anything but a "good boy." He was one of the most rebellious and defiant of all the young men he had met, and Brother Smith was completely rebuffed. He wondered how the mother could say that this young man was a good boy until he reflected on her experience in bringing him forth into life and tenderly caring for him through his infancy and childhood. So he decided to make other overtures.<br><br>He noticed one day on the wall of the old prison a sort of mural that someone had painted. It showed the beginnings of talent, and he inquired who had done it. He was told that it was this same young man. This gave Brother Smith an idea, and he again approached the young man, saying, "I noticed the painting on the wall out there. I was told that you had painted it. I was impressed with it, and I wonder if you would be willing to paint a picture for me."<br><br>The young man responded, "I don't know whether I would or not. What is the picture?"<br><br>Brother Smith said, "I've never really seen the picture. I've just read about it and imagined it in my mind, but I wish you would try to envision the picture and decide if you could paint it."<br><br>The boy asked, "Where is the picture?"<br><br>Brother Smith said, "It is right here in the eighth chapter of the first book of Nephi. I want you to read about the picture and try to visualize it."<br><br>A few days later he returned and asked the boy if he had read it. He said, "Yeah, I read it."<br><br>"Did you see the picture?"<br><br>"Yeah, I saw it."<br><br>"Will you paint it?"<br><br>"I don't know whether I will or not."<br><br>Brother Smith said he then went downtown and purchased materials with which the young man could make a suitable painting and delivered them to him. For the first time the young man was touched. He said, "This is good stuff. I have never worked with this kind of material." And so, of course, he painted the picture. The reason I remember the story so well is that Brother Smith brought the picture with him when he spoke in our sacrament meeting.<br><br>Many of you will recognize that the picture was a portrayal of Lehi's dream. Lehi, as you recall, was led for a period of time through a dark and dreary wasteland and eventually beheld a large and spacious field where there was a tree whose fruit was desirable and capable of making one happy; and as Lehi went forth and partook of the fruit, he beheld it was most sweet, above all that he had ever tasted. Later on Nephi explained that the fruit was representative of the love of God. As Lehi partook of the fruit, it filled his soul with joy, and he wished that his family could partake of it also. As he cast his eyes about, he beheld a river of water that ran near the tree, and he saw his family standing a little way off at the head of the river. He beckoned to his family, and his wife and two sons came forward and partook of the fruit; but his two rebellious sons would not come. He then beheld that along the straight and narrow path that led to the tree and along the bank of the river was a rod of iron. He saw numerous concourses of people pressing forward so that they might obtain the path that led to the tree. As they came forth, there arose a mist of darkness so great that many on the path lost their way and wandered off, but others pressing forward caught hold of the end of the rod of iron, which I always felt served as a hand railing, and came safely through the mist of darkness until they arrived at the tree. Then after they had partaken of the fruit, they cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed, and looking on the other side of the river they saw a great and spacious building. It was filled with people, both old and young. Their manner of dress was exceeding fine, and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers toward those who had come and were partaking of the fruit. Many of the people who had tasted of the fruit were ashamed because of those who were scoffing at them, and they fell away into forbidden paths and became lost.<br><br>All of this I saw in the picture that Brother Smith showed us that night in sacrament meeting. I have never in my life seen a better representation of the true conditions on the earth, both in ancient and at present times. Truly the old patterns repeat themselves, and the inhabitants of the earth today are much the same.<br><br>Brother Smith, incidentally, pointed to a special item in the picture and said to the young man, "The picture is very descriptive, but where did you find that angel hovering over the chasm of filthy water? I don't remember reading about an angel in the picture."<br><br>The young man responded, saying, "I know. I put it there. That is my angel. I am sure that God has provided me with a safeguard to turn me about from the direction in which I seem to be going."<br><br>Naturally, the conclusion of the story was the redemption of this young man.<br><br>Now we, a new generation, are called upon to walk the paths of life. As Boy Scouts we pledge, on our honor, to live in righteousness. As members of the true Church, we have covenanted with our Heavenly Father that we will keep his commandments. Unless we grasp the rod of iron, we will be in peril.<br><br>Occasionally missionaries, with whom I have worked a great deal, falter in their trustworthiness. As I have instructed them, I have informed them that I am willing to accept any report they wish to give, but that it will be impossible for them to deceive me or the world very long. I ask them to turn their attention to their companions: Have you sized them up? When you made an appraisal of each of them, didn't you decide whether they were honorable and faithful and devoted? You can tell who is diligent. You know which ones "goof off." Remember they have each made the same appraisal of you, and you cannot shake off the destiny you create for yourself. You will be known as you are, both by your companions and by your Father in Heaven.<br><br>The same is true with the honor codes that have been established at this great university. They are there for the purpose, of course, of helping you build your character and keeping you faithful. They require that you walk in the light of truth. You do not have to. No one is going to check on you individually, but eventually your true nature will come to light and that is the only control applied by an honor code. The end product is visible to the whole world.<br><br>In the area of morality--and morality deals with much more than sexual purity--morality is an innate and integral honesty that abides within the intimate being of each individual. Those who do not have rules of honor are called amoral people, meaning people without morals, foreigners to truth. The measure of honor resides within the intimate actions of each individual. It has very little to do with the outward declaration of public utterance. This is one of the reasons why people have a tendency to scoff at politicians. Personally, I do not think we are justified in pointing our fingers at our politicians. These men and women are, after all, people like ourselves (to some extent most people are politicians), some honorable, some dishonorable, but probably in essence a true reflection of our own society, neither more nor less virtuous than other people in general.<br><br>Among the most impressive of the nonscriptural teachings in personal righteousness is the well-known passage in Hamlet wherein Polonius instructs his son Laertes, who is about to depart on a journey to France, and concludes his father's blessing that is filled with wisdom and good counsel by saying: "This above all,--to thine own self be true; and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man" (<i>Hamlet</i>, act 1, scene 3).<br><br>Among the great scriptures offering light to the people who have made the covenant are some pointed declarations in the ninety-third section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Speaking of John's testimony, the Lord said he bore a "record of the fulness of my glory." Glory would be synonymous with light.<br><br><i>And he bore record, saying: I saw his glory, that he was in the beginning, before the world was;</i><br><br><i>Therefore, in the beginning the Word was</i>[meaning the Savior]<i>, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation--</i><br><br><i>The light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came into the world, . . . because the world was made by him.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:6–9]<br><br>The Savior said:<br><br><i>Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth;</i><br><br><i>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth. . . .</i><br><br><i>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.</i><br><br><i>All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.</i>[There is enough philosophy in those lines to occupy your mind all day if you have a mind to think about it.]<br><br><i>And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.</i><br><br><i>For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; . . .</i><br><br><i>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</i><br><br><i>Light and truth forsake that evil one.</i><br><br><i>Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.</i><br><br><i>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience</i>[that means through our disobedience, not his]<i>, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.</i><br><br><i>But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:23–24, 26, 28–30, 32–33, 36–40]<br><br>May I relate an experience that came many years ago as I was learning to fly airplanes. My instructor and I were flying straight and level, and off on the horizon lay a range of mountains. Suddenly the instructor put the plane into a maneuver, and I saw with my own eyes the mountain range rear up, stand on its end, turn upside down and then continue around until it resumed its former position. The instructor then climbed up to a height, and he put the plane into a spin. As we came falling through the air, I looked down below and saw the whole world whirling around as if it were a huge wheel. I had never beheld phenomena of this nature before.<br><br>I have in the succeeding time performed these maneuvers myself many times. If I were to perform that snap roll today, I would not be able to see the mountains stand on end nor turn upside down. The reason is that I have been enlightened by reality and have learned the truth. I know now that it was I who was turning around, not the mountain, and it was not the world that was spinning. Having thus oriented myself, I now observe things in their true light. This is the case as the temptations of this world come upon us. We may momentarily be confused by what appears to be reality; but truth is eternal and will bring clarity to our perception, if we are obedient to the covenant and hold to the iron rod.<br><br>Since I have said a few things that may reflect on teachers--false teachers--I would like at the conclusion to express my great admiration for the true teachers with whom you associate at this university with abundance--people of devotion and faith and testimony, men and women who can act in the capacity of true prophets, as the Spirit of the Lord directs them. And as you have the privilege of living and learning under that kind of influence, you, too, become representatives of the light of the world.<br><br>"On my honor" is the rule by which every Latter-day Saint must govern his life. To this I testify as I express my knowledge and assurance that God lives and that Jesus is his Son and the author and finisher of our salvation, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Wm.

<h1>tage of Our Summer Holidays - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is always a humbling experience to come to this vast congregation and speak to you. Especially is this true this particular time. For the last two weeks I've been on the ranch in Wyoming. You could put that whole city in this center section here--that is, if you don't count the mosquitos and the cows.<br><br>We're delighted to be with you at this important time in BYU's history. I always enjoy the summer, and this summer is significant here at this university. The summer of 1980 marks the end of another great era of administration at BYU. I want the students and the staff to know of my admiration for President Dallin Oaks. He is a man of tremendous talent and ability. His talents are so wide and varied that they must be given opportunity to be expressed in other settings, for he will make contributions in many areas during his life. He has lifted this university to new and important heights; now he will render the same kind of service in his other professional pursuits. I will miss him at the functions here at the school, especially at the ball games. As long as President Oaks was in attendance, I felt uninhibited in my enthusiasm. He always displayed such a spirit and interest in the game that I could follow along without feeling out of place as long as he was by my side.<br><br>I was delighted when the name of Jeffrey Holland was presented to the Council to replace President Oaks. I have admired him for a great many years. He served as a counselor in the Hartford, Connecticut stake when I was a counselor in the Boston stake. Of course, we were in the same region, so I had an opportunity to become acquainted with him in those early days. I have watched with great interest his many accomplishments since that time. He has a special spirit about him. He touches and penetrates lives like few men I have ever been around. How blessed you are to have this new president. It's a difficult challenge to follow President Oaks, but I know of no one on earth I would rather see succeed him than President Holland. How blessed this university is to be touched with the lives of these two great men. Enjoy President Holland. I'm sure you will as this inspired leader assumes his position and takes BYU to even greater heights under his administration.<br><br>President Oaks has left a great heritage at this university, and it is heritage I'd like to talk to you about tonight. It is important to me and important to you that we understand the blessings we have received as members of our Father in Heaven's kingdom. The Book of Mormon begins with the story of a group of people who are required to understand their heritage. It begins this way, in the second chapter of 1 Nephi:<br><br><i>For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.</i>[Now that would surely get Lehi's attention, wouldn't it?]<br><br>[He listened to the instructions of the Lord, and these were the instructions:]<i>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and</i><i>his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.</i>[1 Ne. 2:1–4]<br><br>What a challenging assignment for that family. I've often wondered what would happen in my family if I awakened one morning and said, "Barbara, Lee, Gay, go to the garage and get your sleeping bags and the tents. We're going to leave our home and never return again. Now don't worry about all those things you have on your shelves in your bedroom, those precious things you've been accumulating. We won't be able to carry those, just a few provisions, and we're going to follow the direction of the Lord and never return to this place again." I can imagine what would have happened. Gay would call Dr. Nelson right away to find out what had happened to her father. You see, this was a great challenge to this family.<br><br>Now they had only gone a short distance when the Lord again spoke to Lehi in a dream. And Lehi then said to his sons:<br><br><i>Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.</i><br><br><i>For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of thy forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.</i>[1 Ne. 3:2–4]<br><br>You see, before they could start on this journey they had to have the history of their family so that they could preserve their heritage and remember the Lord's dealings with them. Repeated attempts were made to obtain the record. Finally, Laban was delivered into the hands of Nephi and he was able to obtain it. Then he was taught a great lesson. The Lord said to Nephi after he had slain Laban that "it is better that one man should perish than that a whole nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief" (1 Ne. 4:13). You see, without that heritage, without that history, without that law of the Lord with them, there was really no hope that they would progress in the ways of the Lord. The scripture goes on to say:<br><br><i>And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law.</i><br><br><i>And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.</i>[1 Ne. 4:14–16]<br><br>It was essential that this history of God's dealings with the children of man be carried into the wilderness for this family to grow and progress and stay close to the Lord. It is fundamental that we have the scriptures, the history of our progenitors, as we sojourn through life. If that was true for Lehi's family, it is true for each of us. We must have that history.<br><br>At the center of each summer are three special holidays that remind us of the blessings of our heritage. Of course, the first is the Fourth of July. This has always been a special day to me. It is only natural because I grew up in a home where our parents loved this great country. My father had been a history teacher and he loved American history. It became my favorite subject in school. One of the highlights, when we were children, of the Fourth of July was our annual family ceremony of taking five flags out of a special box we placed them in every year and attaching them to the ornament of our old car. Then we would have our own private family parade consisting of a drive down the main street watching those five flags wave in front of us. The Fourth of July every year was a time of anticipation and then celebration.<br><br>When I was a small child, the American dream was to drive behind those five flags and give honor and respect to them. As I have grown older, I have developed a great patriotic love for the blessings of possessing citizenship in this great land of opportunity. One author has written this about the dream of America:<br><br><i>There was, there is, an American dream. A dozen honest, perceptive observers all would sketch it differently--but why not? It is variegated, characterized by strong themes and subtle contradictions--things of the mind and things of the heart. Continuity and evolution, a sense of place, symbols, a history of sacred memories. Furthermore, it is alive--a living thing. And living things change. At the same time, with every decade that passes, the dream is given texture by an ever deepening sense of our land and our past. Compared with Europeans, Americans were irreverent towards tradition. Yet slowly, deeper than words, the images, symbols, and memories accumulated--Valley Forge, the frontier, the wide Missouri, the Gold Rush, the Pioneer journeys west, Civil War battlefields, the face of Lincoln, sod houses on the prairie, the Little Big Horn, Ellis Island, immigrant neighborhoods, the great American Expeditionary forces, the Model-T, bread lines, Pearl Harbor, the affluent society, . . . Vietnam, good memories and heartbreaking memories, growth and tragedy, lessons learned and lessons still to learn.</i><br><br><i>All of our history since then has been one, long instruction in the difficulties of the dream. We know now all too well that our Founding Fathers didn't hand us a completed task. They handed us a beginning. We have had to work, we still have to work very hard to make real the ideals of the founding fundamental documents.</i><br><br><i>There have been some enormous changes in America since the beginning. No doubt there will be great changes ahead in patterns of work, political and economic arrangements, the shape of institutions. The American reality will never be static. Nor will the dream. As in all things in the realm of values, it will be received with each generation by caring men and women to guide them, and they in turn will keep it alive by reshaping it to meet the unrolling future.</i>[John Gardner,<i>Two Hundred Years of Work in America</i>(1976), p. 74]<br><br>Our prophets have spoken fondly of this great country. One of the quotations I enjoy reading over and over again is that of John Taylor. He said:<br><br><i>A great destiny lies before the United States. The question is, is she competent for the task? She has outridden the fiery test of revolution, hurled defiance at a despot's power, and grasped the sceptre of liberty with a nervous, powerful grip. She has, out of the chaotic, confused masses of material associated with corrupt governments, organized a system of government and framed a constitution that while it is honorable to its founders, guarantees to all, to the fullest extent,</i>[liberty].<i>. . . Liberty here is more than a name Here man is free to speak, free to think, free to write, free to act, free to do good. The very genius of our constitution and institutions is freedom. If there is a fault, it is the fault of party, sectional strife, or narrow bigotry; it is not in our institutions.</i>[<i>Gospel Kingdom</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964), p. 312]<br><br>So wrote John Taylor as he looked at this great country.<br><br>There have even been declarations about America from those of other lands. Alexis de Tocqueville wrote this:<br><br><i>I sought for the greatness and genius of America in her commodious harbors and her ample rivers, and it was not there; in her fertile fields and boundless prairies, and it was not there; in her rich mines and in her vast world commerce, and it was not there. Not until I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because she is good. And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.</i>[<i>Prophets, Principles and National Survival,</i>Jerald L. Newquist, comp. (Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1969), p. 60]<br><br>Life has been good to me. I was privileged to be born in this great and noble land and share in this heritage. With that blessing, of course, comes responsibility--a responsibility to serve her when called, a responsibility to defend her when she is threatened, a responsibility to be informed when I go to the polls to vote for her leadership, a responsibility to contribute to her wellbeing.<br><br>This summer I find myself concerned about the problems we have allowed to come upon her because of our complacency and our greed. We have become lazy and uninformed. We have become complainers rather than contributors. And I wonder if it is not time for us to awaken in ourselves a greater sense of responsibility for this land of the free. I wonder if what we need is not another Moroni. When he learned of the great dissension and wickedness among his people, he stirred them up. How did he do it? "He rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it--In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children-- and he fastened it upon the end of a pole." Then he put on his armor set to do battle--<br><br><i>his head-plate, his breastplate, and his shield, and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land</i>. . .<br><br><i>And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:</i><br><br><i>Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let him come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.</i>[Alma 46:12, 13, 19–20]<br><br>Yes, the Title of Liberty--in memory of their God, their religion, their freedom, their peace, their wives, and their children. I wonder if it would be too much to ask that we have the courage of a Moroni and be willing to rend our garment and write upon it and let the people of this great land know of our feeling for its freedom, and make sacrifices to give our country the spirit and the leadership it deserves.<br><br>Now, of course, the second event that occurs in these summer holidays is the Twenty-fourth of July. I've always been excited with pioneer stories. My grandmother lived next door to us when I was a child. At the age of eight she had walked most of the way across the plains. She could remember enough stories to keep me fascinated by the hour as I would sit and listen to her tell about pioneer experiences.<br><br>Brigham Young has always been one of my special heroes. His answers to problems were basic and fundamental and benefited the people. I marvel at his spirit and enthusiasm as he led the Saints west.<br><br>When it became apparent that the cost of moving the new converts from Europe to Utah would be prohibitive, the idea was presented to President Young that they use handcarts to cross the prairies. President Young could immediately see the advantage, not only in the cost savings but also in the physical benefit it would be to the people to walk that far and arrive in the Salt Lake Valley full of vigor and vitality after such an experience. He said this:<br><br><i>We are sanguine that such a train will out-travel any ox train that can be started. They should have a few good cows to furnish milk, and a few beef cattle to drive and to butcher as they may need. In this way the expense, risk, loss and perplexity of teams will be obviated, and the saints will more effectually escape the scenes of distress, anguish and death which have often laid so many of our brethren and sisters in the dust.</i><br><br><i>We propose sending men of faith and experience with suitable instructions, to some proper outfitting point to carry into effect the above suggestions; let the saints, therefore, who intend to immigrate the ensuing year, understand that they are expected to walk and draw their luggage across the plains, and that they will be assisted by the fund in no other way.</i>[B. H. Roberts,<i>Comprehensive History of the Church</i>(Salt Lake City: Church Deseret News Press, 1930), v. 4, p. 85]<br><br>Between 1856 and 1860 a few thousand Saints successfully made the 1300-mile journey by handcart. The success of their travel was only marred by two fateful trips, the Willie and Martin handcart companies, who left much too late in the year to avoid the early winter snows. Again, notice the genius of this great leader. It was just before the beginning of October conference of that year when word reached President Young of the difficulties of these two companies. So, he devoted the entire conference to organizing the relief effort to go out and assist those distressed Saints. And he instructed the brethren not to wait a week or a month before they went. He wanted the four-horse teams ready the following Monday to go and relieve the suffering of the Saints caught in the snows. And that's exactly what happened. The first relief parties were on their way that following Monday. The description of the Willie company's joy upon receiving that first relief party brings emotions close to the surface. Captain Willie had left his small band and gone out with a single companion in search of the relief train. Then, history records,<br><br><i>On the evening of the third day after Captain Willie's departure, just as the sun was sinking beautifully behind the distant hills, on an eminence, immediately west of our camp, several covered wagons, each drawn by four horses, were seen coming towards us. The news ran through the camp like wildfire, and all who were able to leave their beds turned out</i>en masse<i>to see them. A few minutes brought them sufficiently near to reveal our faithful captain slightly in advance of the train. Shouts of joy rent the air; strong men wept until tears ran freely down their furrowed and sunburnt cheeks, and little children partook of the joy which some of them hardly understood, and fairly danced around with gladness. Restraint was set aside in the general rejoicing, and as the brethren entered [the] camp the sisters fell upon them and deluged them with kisses. The brethren were so overcome that they could not for some time utter a word, but in choking silence repressed all demonstrations of . . . emotions. . . . Soon however, feeling was somewhat abated, and such shaking of hands, such words of welcome, and such invocation of God's blessing have seldom been witnessed!</i>[<i>Comprehensive History of the Church</i>, v. 4, pp. 93–94]<br><br>Out of that hardy pioneer stock have developed traditions and a heritage which have built strong families that have contributed so much to the Intermountain West and the rest of the world.<br><br>I was invited to a luncheon a little over a week ago sponsored by a retail firm that was announcing the opening of four stores in the Salt Lake area. As I sat at the table with the president, I asked him, having had retail experience, how he was brave enough to open four stores all at the same time in a brand new market area. His reply was just about what I expected. He said they had made a demographic study of all the major metropolitan areas in the United States. They were interested in finding out which of these areas offered the greatest potential for a department store appealing to young families. The Salt Lake area ranked first in the nation. They also found as a result of their study that the work force there is noted to be honest and industrious. You see, a pioneer heritage is still evident down to the third and fourth generations in this area.<br><br>However, I was shocked by a statistic that crossed my desk a few weeks ago. It stated that only thirteen percent of the children being reared in our country today come from traditional homes consisting of a working father, a stay-at-home mother, and one or more children. Each day we see the effects of the breakup of the traditional home. There is an alarming increase in the number of battered wives, physically and sexually abused children, vandalism in schools, teenage crime rates, pregnancies among unmarried teenagers, and elderly people growing old without the solace of an extended family.<br><br>Our present prophet has warned us that the home is the place to save society. A proper home, of course, is not created automatically when a boy and girl fall in love and marry. It takes those same virtues that were taught in pioneer homes--faith, courage, discipline, and dedication--to make the success of a marriage. But just as those pioneers made a desert blossom as a rose, so it will happen in our lives and in our homes if we follow their traditions and follow the great heritage that they establish in these valleys of the mountains. Yes, a pioneer faith is needed as much in the world today as in any period of time. Once again, we need to know that heritage. We need to teach it; we need to be proud of it; we need to preserve it.<br><br>The third in this triad of holidays is the fifth of August. That date probably doesn't mean much to the rest of you, but it does to me. You see, that is my birthday. Now, birthdays were great events in our family. It was our special time each year. The whole family would try to make this day a day to remember. The choice of food, activities, and radio programs on that day always went to the birthday child, and parents made a special effort to show their love and appreciation to him. This attention was a way of showing us that we were wanted and needed and had the complete love and support of our family.<br><br>As the excitement of childhood birthdays has faded into the past, I have changed my method of celebration. My study of the gospel has greatly magnified my appreciation for the gift of life. I understand better each day the blessings of knowing that I am a child of God.<br><br>What tremendous power and potential the Lord has blessed each of his children with. I was reading an article in a news magazine on an airplane a short time ago. In it the storage capacity of the human brain was compared with that of the latest computer storage units. The measurements were all in millions of characters of storage. It said that the floppy disk could store 2.5 million characters, the magnetic disc 313 million, the optical disk memory 12,500,000 million, the IBM 3850 magnetic cartridge 250 million million. The human brain, though, can store 125 billion million characters. Think of that. Think of the power of a child of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>Birthdays have become, for me, a time of personal evaluation. Now I look at the five areas of my life each year on my birthday, and I analyze my growth and development and have a time of personal challenge and interview.<br><br>First, I look at my physical body. At the time of my birthday each year I submit myself to my annual physical examination, and I keep a record of the results and set targets for achievement each year. Vital signs such as weight, heart rate, and blood pressure are all evaluated. This is also the time when I establish my exercise program for the coming year to keep myself physically in shape.<br><br>Fortunately, I have improved since my experience with one of your good stake presidents. I came to his stake one day, and as we got involved in a conversation about his stake I noticed that he was quite nervous. I said, "What's the matter, President?" He said, "This is my first conference with a General Authority." But he quickly recovered. He soon had me down on the floor teaching me how to do sit-ups, and he saved himself from all of the questions I was going to ask him by keeping me working on sit-ups until I was so out of breath I could hardly speak. As you can see, it is important that we evaluate our physical progress and keep our bodies strong and able.<br><br>Secondly, there is mental development. I evaluate my performance in improving my mind. Have I kept pace with the program I established a year ago for my scripture study? Have I gained greater understanding and capacity in my professional field? Just because I'm a General Authority doesn't mean I want to lose the experience I have had in business, so I try to keep abreast of the latest developments in that field. Have I kept up with current events in my community and my state and in the world? Have I developed a better understanding of the cultural arts that the Lord has blessed us so abundantly with? Each of these I evaluate to see how well I have performed during the last year.<br><br>The third area is financial. Each year I take time to prepare a personal balance sheet and compare it with last year's; I make an operating statement and compare it with my financial objectives. And I ask myself: Have I given a fair return on the great blessings the Lord has given me? Is my performance up to an acceptable standard? Have I stayed out of debt? Am I preparing to be free of encumbrances as the Lord has required of us? It is very important to have a financial plan.<br><br>Fourth, social. How am I progressing in my "people skills." Am I improving my ability to communicate both in speaking and writing? Have I improved my listening skills? And--this one is always difficult for me--have I become more patient? (I try to let my wife evaluate me on this, and my ratings haven't been very high.) Have I improved in my ability to control my temper and to be in control of myself all the time?<br><br>Then, finally, I sit down and give myself a personal priesthood interview. I check myself to see if I am worthy of the temple recommend I carry. I ask myself: Have I improved in my ability to communicate with my Eternal Father? Am I faithful in my prayers? Have I shared the gospel with a friend or neighbor? (This is a responsibility we all have.) Have I completed the temple work commitment I established at the first of the year? Is my personal journal up to date? Am I recording a history so my family will know of the experiences I have had?<br><br>The fifth of August is a special day for me--a day to check on my personal progress toward completing the requirements that will yield eternal life.<br><br>Each summer we have the opportunity of participating in two events, and for some of us three, that reminds us of the Lord's blessings to us. Each summer I renew my vision of the American dream and my determination to make a contribution to our great country. I remember our pioneer heritage and commit myself to preserving the faith, the courage, and the industry of this great people who made a desert blossom as a rose. And finally, I remember that I am a child of God, with all of the potential power, talent, and eternal opportunities that this heritage provides me.<br><br>How blessed we are. What responsibilities our knowledge and our understanding carry. Arnold Palmer, the great golfer, once said, "Winning isn't everything, but wanting to is." What a great statement--"Wanting to is." God grant us the desire to want to win the greatest of all the gifts he has given his children--the gift of life eternal. May God bless us that we will understand our potential, that we will learn and grow and develop an understanding of our heritage and determine to preserve those great gifts that have been given to us as his children. I bear you my solemn witness tonight that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that it is his way that will lead us to life eternal. May God bless us with the courage to follow that leadership, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<h1>acteristics of an Educated Person - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be here. In this vast audience we have singers of songs, builders of buildings, dreamers of dreams, cleaners of homes and dirty faces, writers of words, planters of crops, healers of wounds, and preparers of meals who this week have become learners in many areas.<br><br>I like the theme that this devotional assembly has been given: "Oh, God, Our Help in Ages Past, Our Hope for Years to Come."<br><br>Education means learning from the past and from today and correlating that knowledge so that we grow in our relationship with God, who always extends to us hope for the future.<br><br>I thrill with you at the occupation to learn which you have assigned yourselves. One of the great learning experiences during the year anywhere is our own Campus Education Week. Your presence here today is evidence that education is not a destination but a highway we are to travel all the days of our lives. As I look upon this sea of faces, my brothers and sisters, faces of people who want to improve their own lives, I feel that a most appropriate message would center on the purposes of education in our lives.<br><br>As the apostle Peter wrote so many centuries ago, "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Pet. 2:9). What "marvelous light" are you seeking this week? What did you come here expecting to receive? What you will obtain here is, in part at least, what you retain and take to your homes. Every person attending Education Week can return home feeling more secure, more comfortable in understanding his duty, and more "in tune" as a human being. It was John Dewey who so aptly said, "Education should teach how to think, not merely what to think." And that, perhaps, should be an underlying goal for each of us: to think a little more clearly and wisely about everything than we did before.<br><br>Within the kingdom we talk of free agency, but only the educated are free (see Epictetus: Discourse II.1). Aristotle was asked to what degree educated men were superior to the uneducated: "As much," said he, "as the living are to the dead" (Diogenes Laertius,<i>The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers,</i>tr. C. D. Yonge [London: George Bell and Sons, 1891], p. 188). In his memoirs Edward Gibbon wrote, "Every man who rises above the common level has received two educations: The first from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself." Education Week is a blending of learning from your teachers, from those with whom you will associate, and from the time that I hope each of you will spend alone in meditation.<br><br>You are here because you want to be here. You are exercising your agency in a way that the councils of heaven would approve. Few have described the importance of education any more clearly than did H. G. Wells when he said, "Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe" (<i>The Outline of History</i>[1920], ch. 40). Oh how, in a very personal way, those words apply to each of us.<br><br>Yes, as we have been taught, the glory of God<i>is</i>intelligence (see D&amp;amp;C 93:31). We will take all that we learn here with us through our eternal lives, for that knowledge will rise with us in the resurrection. And "if a person gains more intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." (see D&amp;amp;C 130:18, 19).<br><br>What are some of the marks of an educated person? May I suggest that they are far different from what many commencement speakers have portrayed. Someone once said as he began college, "I'm glad I'm a freshman. Only four more years until my education begins." Let me mention ten characteristics of an educated person. Perhaps these characteristics will serve as a checklist, so to speak, of what we are and may become when we stretch our minds and spirits.<br><br>First, a person can call himself truly educated only after he understands that spirituality is the strongest and greatest of forces and is the foundation of all true learning. It is the link between Him and us! We read of the potential force of weapons that utilize atomic fission, but even the most destructive weapon ever produced is but a "snap, crackle, and pop" compared to the force and explosiveness of the Spirit. We have often heard the phrase, "With all thy learning, get wisdom." And I would like to add to that, "With all thy learning, get spirituality."<br><br>In a hospital not more than fifty miles from this beautiful building, an eleven-year-old boy lay comatose. He had been electrocuted while attempting to retrieve a kite that had blown into the electrical wires near his home. The parents had been given no hope. All muscle tone was gone. Medical science, with all of its marvelous equipment, was being utilized under the skilled hands of highly-trained medical people, but to no avail. Soon several men placed their hands upon that unfortunate boy's head. A neighbor had administered, and now the prayer was being offered by another to seal that anointing. As the last few words were spoken, slight movement began again, and the boy made a small noise. A miracle? Yes! And may we all understand that God's functions and procedures there and here are the true foundations of learning. Remember, the Holy Ghost has the assignment, as the Spirit of truth, to show us how to regulate all that really matters. May we never forget the importance of the burning within (see D&amp;amp;C 9:89).<br><br>The second characteristic of an educated person is that he can acquire facts and figures, correlate them in his mind, and then use them productively. The excitement of learning<i>per se</i>, as we absorb new facts from the pages of a book or from the lips of our teachers, brings joy immeasurable. Knowledge, whether it be knowledge of the Old Testament, of house plants and their care, of Roman architecture, of intermediate Spanish, or of a new dimension in social responsibility, makes us eternally different and more effective.<br><br>I remember with fondness learning the scientific names of the four species of trout that I was catching, the name of each fin, and the names of the insects I could see darting above the water as I fished. Suddenly fishing became even more exciting than before, just as the gospel of Christ did while I was in the mission field, memorizing Genesis 1:26–27; Acts 3:19–21; the fourth, thirteenth, and twentieth sections of the Doctrine and Covenants; Alma 7:11–15; and the other scriptures that, when learned, deepen our testimonies and improve our proselyting effectiveness.<br><br>A friend of mine in Hartford, Connecticut, and his lovely wife decided they wanted to know more about the British historian, educator, and political philosopher, Lord Acton. My friend is a medical doctor by training and a corporate officer in a giant insurance company by profession. But for one year this lovely couple decided to travel to Cambridge and research Lord Acton's life and learn more about England. They returned home filled with new facts and figures, having had an unforgettable experience.<br><br>Third, a person can consider himself to be well-educated only if he has the capacity to endure. The English author and medical doctor A. J. Cronin has thrilled all who have read his books. I remember reading of an experience he had before a single manuscript of his had ever been printed. He had given up writing because of discouragement and had thrown a bundled manuscript into the trash can. While walking down the lock shore a little later that day in a drizzling rain, he came upon his friend Old Angus, a farmer who was laboriously ditching a patch of the bogged and peaty heath. He reported to Angus what he had done. With disappointment in his voice, Angus said, "No doubt you're the one that's right, doctor, and I am the one that is wrong." He seemed to look right to the bottom of Mr. Cronin. "My father ditched this bog all his days and never made a pasture. But pasture or no pasture I canna help but dig. For my father knew, and I know, that if you only dig enough, pasture can be made here." Cronin understood, he tramped back to his place of abode--drenched, shamed, and furious--and retrieved the soggy bundle from the trash can. After writing furiously for three more months, he had created a book that sold more than three million copies. He had learned the importance of perseverance. Later he said,<br><br><i>But that lesson goes deeper still. Today, when the air resounds with shrilled defeatist cries, when half of our stricken world is wailing in discouragement: "What is the use . . . to work, to save, to go on living, with Armageddon round the corner?" I am glad to recollect it [meaning the experience he had had] in this present chaos. With no shining vision to sustain us, the door is wide open to darkness and despair. The way to close that door is to stick to the job that we are doing, no matter how insignificant that job may be, to go on doing it and to finish it.</i>[See Lillian E. Watson,<i>Light From Many Lamps</i>(Simon and Schuster, 1951), p. 147–50]<br><br>The virtue of all education, as those who have walked that lonely path of discouragement know, is victory over oneself. Those who know this victory will never know defeat. We are led by a great prophet-leader, Spencer W. Kimball, who, I suspect, has suffered as much physical pain, spiritual anguish, and discouragement as almost any man living. Through operation after operation and malady after malady he has continued to stand, guide, lead, and teach; he sets for us the supreme example. He simply does not know how to give up, and we are beneficiaries of his persistence and perseverance.<br><br>Each scientific discovery; each great book, painting, manuscript, or poem; and each attainment of dignified proportions comes from an individual who did not give up.<br><br>Fourth: Just as God is no respector of persons, we need to have equal esteem for all of our brothers and sisters without regard for gender, color, or anything else. Stereotyping simply is not a heavenly principle.<br><br>One gender is not superior to the other. This is a fact, I readily admit, with which many do not deal effectively. An understanding of our roles and responsibilities as brothers and sisters is another vital characteristic of the educated person.<br><br>Far too often we become embarrassingly aware of demeaning terminology and behavioral patterns that some will use or exert in reference to women. At the same time, the "sometime insensitivity" of women may force men into rigid "macho" roles, subconsciously denying them the broad range of human feelings that they need to express.<br><br>We cannot consider that which is called "masculine" to be more valuable than that which is defined as "feminine." The two are complementary and mutually helpful. Yes, they are equally valuable, and each has unlimited potential. No one would deny that the male role in the Church is usually more<i>visible</i>because of the priesthood responsibilities of conducting and presiding, but certainly it is no more<i>vital</i>than the roles that women have.<br><br>Of course, there are differences between men and women; and three cheers for those dissimilarities! However, we are far more alike than we are different, and thank goodness for that, too! The gospel includes<i>no</i>double standard relating to the commandments, doctrines, or our eternal destinies. But we do persist in making mistakes and insensitive errors that cause hurt and reduce our effectiveness.<br><br>I feel impressed to say more. Personal attitudes brought from a different time and place sometimes cause some of the frustrations we feel in this delicate area. Isn't it time to explore our own feelings? Many ideas about gender differences simply are not spiritually, physically, psychologically, or socially viable. But where differences do exist, they are equal in importance, and the differences are usually absolutely necessary. We are all part of a grand design. As we strive toward having mature and well-educated minds and spirits, may we accommodate this simple truth.<br><br>Both men and women are to have the same broad range of educational, social, vocational, and spiritual opportunities, as different as the opportunities might be. We should make these choices in a gospel perspective, remembering our eventual, eternal destiny. As literal brothers and sisters, we are to build, influence, lead, teach, and help each other.<br><br>I was talking to a recent convert to the Church in Virginia several months ago. She could hardly restrain her enthusiasm. She had found a "home" within her stake and ward where she could express her feelings, teach a class, know that she was loved and respected, and participate in a multiplicity of other ways. "Oh, Elder Pinnock, if only you could see the Church environment from which I have come, you would see why I am so happy," she stated. Her local brothers and sisters made that difference. May we do likewise.<br><br>Fifth: An educated person recognizes the importance of here and now. All too often, we hear of someone who has given up because he or she did not have an opportunity for a formal education, had not traveled to the great cities of Europe and Asia, or had not been born into a more "advantageous" place or position.<br><br>A bright young man who aspires to be a writer said to me several years ago, "If only I could spend a year or two in New York City, New England, or perhaps London, I could write something worth reading." I was reminded of two American writers who never traveled far from home: Walt Whitman who, with his own hands, set in type the first edition of his magnificent book,<i>Leaves of Grass</i>; and Henry David Thoreau, who was imprisoned for a short time for refusing to pay a tax that he claimed was a ploy to support slavery and who penned a little volume entitled<i>On the Duty of Civil Disobedience</i>. Years later Mahatma Gandhi read this book and was inspired to begin his campaign to free India. Ideas for poems, novels, political philosophies, and everything else worthwhile can be found everywhere, and often in unexpected places. Not in some other time or place, but right now, this year, today even, begin to work miracles in your life with the resources that lie nearby.<br><br>As I disembark from an airplane that has come from Anchorage, Alaska; Boston, Massachusetts; Merida, Mexico; or Montevideo, Uruguay, I am reminded that Joseph Smith perhaps traveled fewer miles in his entire lifetime than we do on some of our conference trips. The Savior of all mankind never left the eastern end of the Mediterranean basin during his lifetime. To be educated and happy, we must remember that it<i>can</i>happen here, not there, and now, not then or when. To labor, laud, laugh, and learn<i>today</i>is truly one of education's brightest keys.<br><br>Sixth: Each educated person will understand his mission to leave our environment a little better than he found it. A poem written, a garden free of weeds with straight rows, a strong and dedicated family, a motivating sermon, a helpful counseling interview, or the greenest grass and straightest fences on the street--all these make a difference.<br><br>President Kimball has often reminded us that we should paint our barns and rake our lawns. But any pursuit that makes the stairs a little less steep, an emotional burden a little less heavy, the environment a little less harsh, or the scenery a little more beautiful reflects the behavior of an educated person. Living a helpful life as well as making a living will inspire others to find themselves, to climb higher, and to realize their potentials. To make one's influence work for the common good is a vital part of the task of education.<br><br>I appreciate the art work of Arnold Friberg. Several years ago I was visiting him in his studio in Holladay, Utah, on a Sunday morning after priesthood meeting and Sunday School. He showed me his famous painting of George Washington praying at Valley Forge and a number of other magnificent paintings and sketches. I observed that he was a little tired as we talked, until I asked him about a sign I noticed hanging on the wall which read, "I believe in God and Cecil B. DeMille." With renewed enthusiasm and excitement, he told me of his experiences with Cecil B. DeMille as<i>The Ten Commandments</i>was being produced and filmed. He told me how this tiny, yet powerful, man had improved the lives of all with whom he came in contact. "He inspired us to think big, in epic proportions," said Brother Friberg, "and I have never been the same. He made us all better." And that's what we're to do, brothers and sisters.<br><br>Seventh: An educated person respects facts and truth and seeks to see things as they really are. In 1973, Elder Boyd K. Packer called me into his office and reported the condition of a Church unit that came within my responsibility. His words were exact. He told the truth. He didn't embellish or diminish. He changed my perspective. Suddenly, I could see what to do. His explicit few words charged me with excitement, and my task became more simple because of the truth he spoke.<br><br>While I was studying economic theory some years ago, a professor said to me in front of a large class that an answer I had given lacked substance and exactness. "Mr. Pinnock," said he, "don't be fuzzy minded." I was embarrassed, but the point was well made.<br><br>As a person who wants to be educated, are you searching for facts? A friend of mine, Dr. L. Kay Shumway, believed that within a cell of a leaf lay the germ of an entire plant--roots, leaves, and stems. By pursuing that truth through lengthy experimentation, he and his assistants were able to grow an entire plant from just a cell.<br><br>A loving father and mother came to me several years ago wanting to know why their son was not doing very well. A day or two earlier, I had been informed that their son was experimenting with drugs. After hesitating briefly, I told them this. They were shocked and did not want to believe what I had said. But they did, and immediately they began to do all they could to eliminate the problem. Eventually they were successful.<br><br>Perhaps tonight, or sometime soon, each of you could ask yourself those personal questions that, when answered factually, bring joy and progress: Where am I now? What do I need to do better? What do I need to learn in order to be more effective? Whom do I want to become? Yes, to be educated is to see things as they really are and not through the distorted lens of personal preference or desire.<br><br>The world progresses scientifically only as fast as it accepts facts. Often the sole reward for substantial and intensive effort is the discovery of a new truth, as our hymn so aptly states: "Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize to which mortals or Gods can aspire."<br><br>Eighth: Each educated person, because of the great knowledge that has been poured out in this millennium, has a broader duty to use the knowledge given than almost anyone who has ever lived. That duty devolves on each of us. The more we learn, the more responsibility we must assume. Every week that I attend a stake conference I see men and women sacrificing to accomplish the responsibility to which they have been called. I have known a blind bishop leading magnificently in Wyoming, a Nigerian medical doctor with five college degrees serving humbly as a ward clerk in New York, an incredibly powerful business leader serving as an assistant Scoutmaster, an opera star teaching the Mia Maids, and a noted lawyer ushering the elderly in his ward to their seats.<br><br>Because Joseph Smith and others did their duty, we have the kingdom of God on earth.<br><br>Because Brigham Young and others did their duty, we have more than 350 communities, towns, and cities in the West.<br><br>Because Aurelia Rogers and others did their duty, we have the Primary, blessing the lives of thousands of children.<br><br>Because Karl G. Maeser and others did their duty, we have this great university.<br><br>lgnatius of Loyola was once playing a game of ball with his fellow students when someone asked, suddenly and solemnly, what each of them would do if he knew he had to die in twenty minutes. All agreed that they would rush frantically to church and pray--all but Ignatius. He had a different duty. He answered, "I should finish my game."<br><br>On 19 May 1780, during the anxious days of the Revolutionary War, darkness came to Hartford, Connecticut, at noon. It was a total eclipse of the sun. The people lacked the sophisticated predictive devices that we use today, so they did not know an eclipse was coming or even what one was. The bats flew and the chickens roosted. The sun, which was at its zenith, suddenly disappeared. As we can imagine, panic broke out. People thought that the end of the world was at hand.<br><br>In Hartford the state legislature was meeting. When the darkness set in, the meeting of the lower house broke up in alarm. In the state senate a motion was made for adjournment to enable the legislators to meet the Day of Judgment with whatever courage they could summon. But the motion was opposed by Abraham Davenport, a man who had been an adviser to General George Washington. Davenport arose at the height of this panic and addressed the senate as follows: "I'm against this adjournment. The Day of Judgment is either approaching, or it is not approaching. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles be brought." And they stayed in session. May each of us be found doing our duty.<br><br>Ninth: An appreciation of the arts and an appreciation of extraordinary effort also are characteristics of the educated person. Education should teach us both how to live and how to appreciate.<br><br>While visiting the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., I saw a lovely black lady standing before a painting by one of the Dutch masters. Tears of emotion were streaming down her face. The beauty of light and depth had touched her deeply. In that same museum were displayed ancient tools and artifacts created by a group of prehistoric people who lived in what we now call East Africa. There was an amazing emotional experience waiting for all who saw those ancient implements.<br><br>How exciting is the life of one who truly appreciates clean and functional architecture, classical music, beautiful photography, skillfully penned poetry and prose, great art, and other expressions of inspired, creative genius.<br><br>Once while visiting a vice-president's office in New England, I commented upon a Thomas Eakins print that hung upon his wall. He confessed he knew nothing of the artist or the subject. The original painting is in the Philadelphia Gallery of Art and is titled<i>A Pair-Oared Shell</i>. The scene is of the famous racing brothers Barney and John Biglin. I told him about the painting and the river it portrayed. After learning a little about Eakins, skulling, and the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, he fell in love with his print and now calls it his favorite piece of art.<br><br>I had a similar experience in the Hemingway Gallery in Jamestown, New York. Mr. Hemingway, a delightful and sensitive gentleman, had a painting in his gallery of a Western scene. He confessed that he knew nothing of the artist, who happened to be John Fery (1865–1934), a Utah artist of whom I was aware. I told him a little about John Fery. Suddenly the painting was worth $1,000 instead of the $250 he had previously been asking for it, because now he knew the artist and his life.<br><br>I was delighted to learn of the new Museum of Church History and Art that will be constructed west of Temple Square. The Church encouraged such early Utah painters as C. C. A. Christensen, Dan Weggeland, John Haffen, and James T. Harwood, to name a few, in their studies and even sent some to Paris to study art. Just as a concert hall, museum, or playhouse occupies a place of importance in any city, so should the appreciation and understanding of art, music, and the theater occupy a central place of importance in our lives.<br><br>The miracle of reading enables us to live many other lives and visit other lands, even outer space. We can share the cheers heard in Yankee Stadium or the standing ovation at the Met by reading biographies of Lou Gehrig, Joe DeMaggio, Enrico Caruso, and other luminaries. We can appreciate the graphic storytelling of America's great illustrators by reading of Andrew Wyeth, James Montgomery Flagg, Maxfield Parrish, or Salt Lake City's own John Held, Jr. We can visit the great opera houses and other music centers of the world by playing recordings of the great music of this and other ages and cultures. How fortunate we are.<br><br>Perhaps pianist Arthur Rubinstein said it best when on his eightieth birthday he was reported to have stated, "I am passionately involved in life. I love its change, its color, its movement. To be able to speak, to see, to hear, to walk, to have music and painting, is all a miracle." And that is what learning is: a miracle.<br><br>Tenth, and last, an educated person is characterized by deeper integrity and more Christlike morality. John Ruskin, the nineteenth-century English critic, essayist, and social reformer, said, "Education does not [just] mean teaching people to know what they do not know, it means teaching them to behave as they do not behave." Character development is one of the great aims of education. Through learning we find that the best way to repress faults is to create virtue. As we proceed with our education, we realize that to be more Christlike is the summation of it all. It has been said that "the poorest education that teaches self-control is better than the best education that neglects it." Samuel Johnson wrote: "Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful" (<i>The Reader's Johnson</i>, ed. by C. H. Conley [New York: American Book Co., 1940],<i>Rasselas</i>XLI, p. 254).<br><br>Our word for school comes from the Greek word for leisure. The Greeks, during their Golden Age, thought of leisure as the opportunity for moral and intellectual development and for participation in the life of the community. An education is truly incomplete if it teaches facts without instructing us how to live happily.<br><br>The theme of this devotional, "Oh God, Our Help in Ages Past, Our Hope for Years to Come," reflects mightily upon the real reason that many of us are here. All of life echoes God, our Eternal Father, and Jesus Christ, his Son, who provide the hope that does spring eternal, the hope that all is well for those who prepare, repent, and respond to the Maker and Master of us all.<br><br>When Lord Kelvin, the great British physicist and inventor, at the end of his long life signed his name in the registrar of Glasgow University, he wrote "student" after his name. (See H. N. Casson,<i>How to Have Eighty Years of Youth</i>.) In 1919, Dr. Franklin S. Harris, of Utah State University, wrote, "If we had a knowledge of all the laws of the universe, we could make of earth a pretty good heaven" (<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 22, part 1, p. 328). Yes, that is what a learning person discovers. Knowledge can make earth more heavenly and add joy and peace to our lives.<br><br>Wherever our Mormon forefathers went, new schools were quickly built. Education is an eternal tradition of the kingdom and should be an eternal tradition for each of us.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that it is impossible to be saved in ignorance and that a person is saved no faster than he gains intelligence. These teachings place education beyond its mere practical value and make it a religious principle.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this morning we are talking of "inner ecology." Age does not destroy us nearly as effectively as ignorance does. Gutzon Borglum, the distinguished American sculptor (who, incidentally, was born in St. Charles, Idaho, of Mormon parentage), carved the four giants of American history on Mt. Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, and Theodore Roosevelt inspired Americans during their lifetimes, just as they inspire us today. Many times Borglum was asked how he was carving giants and what makes a giant. And his answer was a philosophy that he had followed all his life. He said, "I can't tell you how to be a giant any more than I can tell you how to be eight feet tall. I can merely say, 'Grow.'"<br><br>May we all continue to grow, brothers and sisters, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Master. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hugh W.

Thank you very, very much. The grave will be dedicated at about three o'clock. Of course, not all of you can make it, but. ... She does not know I'm going to do this, but I need my wife, Pat, to come up here with me. (I told the freshman young men on Friday that if they studied really, really hard, this is what they got at BYU.) I'd like her to share with you a few of her thoughts this morning, if you would.<br><h2><b>Sister Patricia T. Holland</b></h2><br>He promised me he would never do this to me, and he may be the first president to start his new administration with a black eye.<br><br>I told the new freshmen a couple of days ago that a little less than a hundred years ago, I was a new student here, facing all of the challenges, trying to find the right buildings, and wondering if I'd succeed. Now, for some reason, I'm feeling all those feelings again. I guess the only thing that's redeeming about my experience this time is that I do feel we were called by a prophet and thus by our Heavenly Father to serve you in this capacity. We have been blessed with a small family, and I'm grateful that the Lord would extend my family to include all of you. I feel like I now finally have my quiver full, and I want you to know and I want my Heavenly Father to know that I will serve you, that I will serve him, and that I will support and sustain my husband in his calling.<br><br>I have a testimony that the gospel is true, that this is the Savior's university, and that he will bless all of you who are willing to sacrifice whatever is necessary to be all that he would have you be. And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>President Jeffrey R. Holland</b></h2><br>Thank you sweetheart. You're going to see a lot of her, for we want to approach this task together. We believe that says something about what this Church believes in and what this school stands for, and I'm grateful to have her at my side. You have now learned what you would have learned anyway--that this is a different sort of devotional. I hope there will be an opportunity later in the year to do just something slightly more traditional, to take a scripture or an idea or a need and to discuss it in the way that I was able to do with some of you last spring. But today's assembly is different, and I hope you will understand that and bear with me. It's the first day of school, and of necessity some business devolves on the shoulders of the president. However, I do want to make it clear at the outset that I know why you are here. I didn't just fall off the turnip truck. I know quite a bit about you. Some eager young man comes in from concourse F and says, "Hey, Smitty, she's here." To which Smitty replies, "Yeah, and she's with Jonesey." But I'm glad to have you here under any circumstance, and if I can insert something of worth along the way, I'll be grateful.<br><br>Everyone has been new to this campus at one time or another--many of you are new here this morning--and I just want to reaffirm what Pat has said, that we do know how you feel. Yes, you will get registration worked out. And yes, there are exits from the Harris Fine Arts Building. We do have some folks lost over there: they're in the "E over P1R2 wing" of the southeast quadrant, and if you see them, you should leave them lunch money. To the young women in the audience we say, "Yes, there are enough young men to go around." However, you will soon find that to be part of the problem--they just keep "going around."<br><br>I recently passed a coed who was just furious. Her face was red, white, and blue--all at once. Sort of the Francis Scott Key of Heritage Halls, I suppose. I watched as she stormed into her apartment and slammed the door, shrieking, so that I could hear out on the street, "Men are all alike!!" I tried to guess her home town (I've been trying to do that with people), and I suspected maybe she was from Santaquin. But then from across the way came a sweet little melodic voice, replying, "Well men are all I like, too." I think she's from Atlanta, but I'm not sure.<br><br>And, of course, you will all look forward, married folks aside, to your first computer-arranged date. That will be your foreshadowing of the final judgment, for there you will stand face to face with exactly what you deserve.<br><br>There are many things that I would like to say to you today. I wish we could just visit privately and that you could ask me what a president feels about BYU and I could ask you how a student feels about BYU. Maybe sometime, someplace, we can do that. I would very much like to. But it probably can't be done here this morning.<br><br>It is customary, in this first assembly, for the president of the university to say something of what is expected of the students. Included in that is, almost routinely, some statement about such matters as dress and grooming. That is not my favorite topic, and I suspect it is not yours. (May I just commend you because I have been deeply impressed with and immensely grateful for how spectacularly good you look. And I'm a little chagrined to take the time of so many to address an issue that apparently is needed by so few.) But I would like to say something about why standards are important in the context of issues much larger than dress and grooming themselves. I'm not here this morning with a micrometer or a fabric gauge; I just want to talk about a principle. I might add that I have thought of not saying anything about this subject, which would break a long-standing tradition. But I worried about that inasmuch as this is my first devotional with you, and I feared that what I would not say would somehow ring louder in your ears than anything I would say, which might have implied a message I would not want to convey. So, without rehearsing the legal code of the Medes and the Persians or checking all the dietary restrictions in Leviticus, I do want to discuss a principle that explains why we have standards at this university. And at that point, I will leave it to you for the rest of the year.<br><br>Coincidentally, without any prompting from me, President Kerr mentioned twice in his prayer the mission of this school. BYU is a school with a mission. It has been "called," if you will, by prophets past and present, to accept a certain assignment, or mission, in the kingdom. In terms of the Church Educational System it is a mission that, at least at present, no other university can fulfill. This special mission, like other missionary service, has its course of action outlined in the scriptures and is reiterated by those called to preside over this university. The fact that our Board of Trustees is made up of the presiding authorities of the Church, including the First Presidency, adds to the sense of mission we feel here. Now you should understand that our call is essentially an academic one, so be prepared when we expect you to take your education seriously. But the mission of BYU has spiritual and religious implications, too, as any church educational experience should have and as almost all educational experiences anywhere once had. As David Reisman recently said, "We live within the secular cathedrals of higher learning but in the absence of the conviction which built those cathedrals." But that is a talk for another day.<br><br>As I have traveled throughout the Church and as I have been invited to sit in council settings at the invitation of some of the Brethren, it has been my impression that almost everyone in the Church-- from President Kimball to the most distantly located member of this Church--understands something of and believes something of whatever it is we call the mission of Brigham Young University. They speak of BYU as a school with a destiny; they speak of it as a special education in our time; they speak of it as the Lord's university. President Kimball himself speaks of the "education for eternity" that he hopes will be offered here.<br><br>So BYU is, by definition, a school of extraordinary expectation, a school with a mission, if you will, and those who come here--you and l--are missionaries. Now don't pull out the white shirts and the ten-speeds just yet: it isn't that particular kind of mission right now. But we are missionaries nevertheless. And certain expectations are always part of fulfilling an honorable mission. Now we give you considerably more latitude here than does the MTC. (You are, for example, allowed to date once a year.) But there are nevertheless rules and regulations and standards.<br><br>For example, each of you has received a brochure entitled<i>A Style of Our Own</i>, the title of which comes from President Kimball himself (and you should understand that). It is part of the missionary handbook, if you will, for students attending BYU. You have it. We invite--and expect--you to abide by it as you help to fulfill the mission of the school. The general theme of it is simply that campus attire and grooming of both men and women will be neat and clean and representative of a certain standard of appearance that the university is "called''--and I use that word advisedly--to maintain. Now I suspect that this won't be the case, but if there is in this congregation someone whose dress or grooming or behavior doesn't comply, then we ask you to adjust accordingly. That's why it's important to say this the first day of school so we don't have to say it ever again. We ask that not because we don't love you just as much in bib overalls. That has nothing to do with it, at least not initially. What it does have something to do with is the mission of BYU.<br><br>I suppose a full-time missionary could teach a discussion reasonably well in faded Levi's, a P.E. t-shirt, and flip flops. But President Kimball and the Brethren have said no to that, and wisely so, I believe, because, to borrow from Mr. McLuhan, "the medium is the message." Mr. and Mrs. Brown or Mr. and Mrs. Garcia hearing the message of the gospel for the first time, want to feel something besides the experience of Joseph Smith in the grove. They want to know, among other things, what dignity and what standard and what behavior that great truth has then instilled in this Church. So we try very hard not to detract from a discussion of the First Vision by having missionaries tell of it in something other than faded Levi's, a p.e. t-shirt, and thongs. Indeed, in the very waters of baptism, into which we hope to take Mr. and Mrs. Brown or Mr. and Mrs. Garcia, we dress in a certain way, not because other clothing would not work but because the right clothing becomes a part of the very ordinance itself.<br><br>In that same spirit, some of you will remember Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone saying on this campus that he would not give his own children a priesthood blessing--even in the middle of the night--without first putting on his suit and a shirt and a tie. It isn't, I suppose, that the priesthood wouldn't work without that. It obviously has. But rather this is something Elder Featherstone feels and wants his children to feel about the image and dignity and power of the priesthood.<br><br>In its own way, so it is with dress and grooming standards on this campus. There is a great deal of freedom here. We want you to be happy and to be comfortable. But please do not think that you should be able to dress sloppily or immodestly here or to wear your hair untrimmed or uncombed just because you did so at your former high school or at some other university. The great secret I want to share with you this morning is that this isn't your former high school or any other university. It is a school with a mission, a mission it has been called to by prophets, and we want the medium, which is you and me and everyone here, to be representative of the message. That is the agreement we made in coming here.<br><br>Now that's considerably more than I wished to say about dress and grooming. I'm grateful that you would listen; it seemed to me important to say it in my first devotional address as president of this university. There are so many other things that I want to say and hope to have a chance to say as the year goes on. Because you are adults you will understand our urgency in this matter and will furthermore understand the metaphor of the mission. You will not always be here, and you will not always need to worry about these regulations. But I believe with all my heart, as last week's<i>Newsweek</i>might have indicated, that in some sense the eyes of the world are indeed upon us, and now is a time for us to continue to make a statement about what BYU is and why it insists on being so. Thank you for helping me reaffirm in a new administrative term the unique part this school plays in the larger rendezvous with destiny that our sponsoring Church unflinchingly pursues.<br><br>I noted earlier in the introduction that this matter of standards is part of a larger issue, an academic issue as well as a behavioral one. Let me reinforce that. You surely could wear the cleanest clothes in town and keep the best groomed hair in the class, but if you do not invest your heart and soul in this opportunity for an education, then this university has failed in a more serious way in its mission. The only ultimate justification for BYU is that those who come here leave superbly educated. There are less expensive ways to hold Young Adult conferences. There are less expensive ways to have pizza parties. There are less expensive ways to meet new friends and play a little tennis. We have paid too much for this school if you and I don't leave here with a first rate education. If we haven't learned how to study, if we haven't learned how to write, if we haven't learned how to comb the library or use a laboratory, then we've paid too much of someone else's money for BYU. This is the far more important part of the "Mission Speech." You are called to get all you can from this educational experience. You will carry your block "Y" into the world as you leave here. For your sake and for the Church's sake, which pays for so much of your opportunity here, make that a good impression and a substantial contribution. Then the fun and the fascination that are so much a part of BYU will be appropriate icing on the cake. I like tennis and I like pizza. We would not have you miss anything that is wholesome and worthwhile here. You can get it all if you decide now to study first and play later. The alternative is, as so many come to learn, to play now and study never. I ask you to work hard and to work early. You'll be surprised at how much time you then have at your disposal. If you loaf early and try to work late, you'll be surprised at how much of your time has gone down the disposal.<br><br>Let me give you a personal example that probably won't mean much to you, but it does to me because it was my life. Following my undergraduate years and one year of graduate work, earning a master's degree at BYU, I taught for two or three years trying to save up enough money for further graduate work. I was married and we had our first child, so I knew that even with a fellowship it would be tight. During the summers of those teaching years, I took courses at local universities, filling in some gaps in my undergraduate education and strengthening my preparation for the graduate field I had chosen.<br><br>One summer in Seattle I was taking a class that was particularly demanding. I wasn't exactly ecstatic over the teacher, and the material he used in the course seemed uneven and often unwisely chosen. But I jumped in and tried to ride the waves as best I could.<br><br>Just as a major midterm paper was coming due, my parents called and said they were coming to visit us. That was, of course, wonderful news. We needed a shot in the arm from our parents just as you do from yours. They had never been to the Northwest, and we wanted to show them everything. However, time was going to be a bit of a problem. I was teaching a full summer schedule and taking this class on the side. And like the iceberg and the Titanic in Thomas Hardy's poem, my parents and this paper converged upon me at exactly the same moment. Now there's no sense even discussing which option was most attractive to me. We had not seen my parents in more than eighteen months, and I've already told you how I felt about the class. Furthermore, the class was an optional thing I was doing. After all, this wasn't the university at which I would be doing my graduate work, and certainly no one but I cared whether I did well in the class or not.<br><br>Well, as fate would have it, my parents arrived on a Friday, and my paper was due the next Monday. I had had the good sense to go to work on it reasonably early, so it wasn't as though I had to do it all over one weekend. (I had tried that at BYU and found that it didn't work very well.) So I had the paper virtually complete, except for one thing. I didn't like it. It wasn't right. I had to work more on it.<br><br>We set everything aside that Friday night and had a great time. My wife made tacos and enchiladas, the art for which my father said he would have banned me from the house had I not married her. We laughed and talked and had great fun. And then I had a decision to make. It was a kind of a missionary decision, if you will.<br><br>Saturday was a natural day to get up early, drive a couple of hours into British Columbia, meander back down the coast along the Puget Sound, and end up at the Seattle Center to enjoy all the remnants of the World's Fair. That would leave Sunday for my duties as a bishop and then most of Monday to visit some other spots before they left Tuesday to see my brother in California. That just posed one problem. My paper.<br><br>Now I ask you to remember that this was not life-and-death, or at least it did not seem so to me. For all intents and purposes, I could have caved in on the course, and no one would have cared. But that somehow did not seem right to me. I was plagued, if you will, with "missionary feelings." So I made a deal with my parents. If they would do all that I had outlined for Saturday with my wife, Pat, and our son, Matt, who was then two, but minus me, I would have my paper completely finished for the rest of their stay plus the promise of barbecued steak, tossed green salad, garlic bread and baked potatoes by the time they got back. With one proviso, of course--that my Dad leave me enough money to buy the steak.<br><br>Well, they were disappointed, and so was I, but it seemed the best thing to do. So they played and I worked. I wrote and rewrote and shouted and tore up papers and punched the typewriter and rewrote. It didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped, but it went. I finally got it into what seemed reasonably acceptable shape and then threw myself (figuratively, of course) into the tossed green salad. Dad had left a dollar or two, Pat had found some steaks at the store, and I had started the coals on the grill, using part of the fury I was feeling over a paragraph that wouldn't work. But the paper was finished and the food was on the table when they returned.<br><br>Now that isn't much of a story except that it has made a great deal of difference in my life. When I got that paper back from a teacher I didn't like much in a course I didn't particularly enjoy, the professor had written just five words. I think it was all he had said to me during the entire term. "Publishable paper. See me sometime." Well, the aftermath doesn't really matter either except to say that this professor turned out to be, by sheer coincidence I suppose, a very close friend of a faculty member in my intended department at Yale. And then one thing led to another, and he wrote a note, saying, in effect, "You may want to consider this chap even if you haven't heard of St. George, Utah." There were other contacts along the way and other blessings that came, but my point is, again, sort of a missionary point. With that paper that summer in a remote setting--remote at least in terms of my ultimate plans--it made all the difference in the world for me to tract just one more door before calling it a day. To have done otherwise certainly would have been understandable and certainly would have been more enjoyable. But it has made a wonderful difference in my life to have demanded just a bit more of myself on that occasion.<br><br>Forgive me if I see this experience as being in the same category as modest dress and attractive grooming and honesty on an exam, but I do. It is something better than average effort, it is something a little harder than par, it is something more rewarding in the long run. I ask you--for your sake and for the untold future you now only dream of--to work hard, work early, be honest, knock on one more door before quitting, stand out in the crowd through extra effort and personal commitment.<br><br>Some time ago I was invited to speak at a youth conference, which is the kind of invitation that I have had to decline routinely for years. But something about this one kept gnawing at me, and I answered that I would come. It seemed a foolish thing to do. It meant a morning drive of about four hours into a neighboring state and then the same drive back that night. But I felt I should go, and I did. I put my wife and children in the car with sandwiches and a Scrabble board, and off we went.<br><br>After I dropped them off at the local city park and swimming pool, I went over to the youth conference held at a local stake center. The trip was worth it all to me for one brief testimony that I heard there. At this very moment I honestly cannot tell you what I said to that group as their invited speaker. It's gone from my memory and undoubtedly gone from all of theirs. But this young convert's testimony is still with me, and I leave it with you today.<br><br>She described her conversion to the Church and what the gospel of Jesus Christ had come to mean in her life. Her home life was something out of a horror story--broken marriage, mother living with a man not her husband, brother on drugs, sister expecting a baby. It was as bizarre as any social worker would ever need to see. But into her life had come the Church, and for this young fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl it was everything, and she was hanging on. She described opening her school locker one day, only to have her paperback edition of the Book of Mormon fall to the floor. She used it in seminary, and to her it was a prized possession. She was still a little insecure about all of this, however, for the world around her had made her pretty insecure. And she was not yet certain what her new faith and friends held in store for her. She was happy but still tentative and very anxious to be stronger in the faith. She was embarrassed. She had not wanted anyone to see the book.<br><br>She hastily stooped down to pick it up before someone noticed. But someone had noticed, and they were standing right next to her. Three girls looked first at the book and then at her. Her heart sank, and she clutched at the little blue paperback cover. She said nothing, and neither did they for a moment. But then one of them asked, "Is that a church book?"<br><br>She said "Yes."<br><br>The other girl said "What church is it?"<br><br>And my young friend stuttered, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."<br><br>"Is that the Mormons?" shot back the inquirer.<br><br>"Yes," whispered the frightened little Latter-day Saint, "that's the Mormons."<br><br>There was a long pause, and then her interrogator said, "Are you true?"<br><br>After a pause that was both instantaneous and eternal, my little friend said, with her head slightly more erect and her back slightly straighter and her hands trembling a little less, "Yes, I'm true."<br><br>I must confess that when I first heard that young girl's testimony, I did not quite understand all that I was hearing. I've thought about it since, and obviously what the one girl, in her own way, was asking was, "Are you active?" That's the way we would have phrased it. But what a tragic loss to so phrase it. How much more meaning there is in the straightforward inquiry, "Are you true?"<br><br>There was no reprisal. The heretofore undisclosed copy of the Book of Mormon in a school locker had not brought on physical torture or social ostracism. A little confidence came, and a little conviction increased. There was just one young soul saying to another, "Are you true?" "If you are a Latter-day Saint, are you a good one?"<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, I testify to you this morning that the questions are no longer, "Is the Church true?"; "Is God true?"; "Is Christ or Joseph Smith or Spencer W. Kimball true?" All of that and a lot more was decided a long, long time ago. It is not now subject to popular ballot, yours or mine. In a word, all that remains for you and for me, if we are to have a marvelous year at this university, is the simple inquiry, "Are you true?" May God bless us always to so be, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1> of Tomorrow - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I feel almost as if I should look in the coffin to see if I am there. I am grateful for Brother Haycock's kindness. I assure you it was overdone.<br><br>I congratulate you young students who have the good fortune to be students at this great university. I am grateful that several of our grandchildren are with you. It is sixty-eight years this month since I came to enroll at Brigham Young University--these have been interesting years. Our family was among the refugees fleeing from the civil war in Mexico, having left all our worldly possessions behind. I was just seventeen. My uncle, Carl Eyring, had invited me to come and live with them and go to Brigham Young University.<br><br>The two years I spent here made a lasting impression on my life, and I developed and ever-increasing love and appreciation for this great school. I hope you appreciate the uniqueness of the Church-sponsored institution, my young friends, and realize that the major reason for its existence is to help you, its students, to develop a firm testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ as well as to receive an education that will prepare you to be successful men and women in your life's work.<br><br>As members of the Church of Jesus Christ, we have taken upon us his name, with a commitment to keep his commandments. He set the perfect example for us in his earthly life and has given us a pattern for living that can assure us a useful, happy, productive life here. We realize this is the purpose of our earth life in preparation for life eternal. When Christ was here in mortality He was asked by the Pharisees, "Which is the first and great commandment?" His answer, as you remember, was,<br><br><i>Thou shalt love thy Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i><br><br><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</i><br><br><i>Upon these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets</i>. [Matt. 22:37–40]<br><br>As we look about us at the lack of love of God or of fellowmen in the world today, we realize that failing to keep these commandments has brought the world into the state of war and contention in which we find it. What can we as individuals do about this situation? Our responsibility begins with ourselves. Can we look in the mirror at ourselves and see reflected one who has accomplished self-mastery? Are we honestly able to look to the welfare of our neighbors and to be as concerned about them as we are about ourselves?<br><br>The primary concern of each of us is to put our own lives in order. We are accountable primarily to ourselves for what happens to us in our lives. The source of real happiness comes from within. We are responsible for our success or failure. And the most fundamental need of every human being is to be loved and needed. This then fosters a feeling of self-worth. Hopefully each of us makes a firm commitment at the beginning of each day that this day will be a happy, successful experience. We must know that the source of our success and happiness comes from within. We are responsible for our choices.<br><br>Our free agency is our most priceless possession. Remember that the Prophet Joseph said, "We teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves." In the scriptures we read,<br><br><i>There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven . . . , upon which all blessings are predicated--</i><br><br><i>And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21]<br><br>It is important, then, that we keep always in mind that while free agency is a law of heaven, it is equally certain that we must take the consequences of our free choices. Therein lies the importance of seeking divine guidance in the use of our free agency so that we may always choose the right. As we make all of our decisions, our question ought to be: "What will be the result of my choice?"<br><br>You young people are the hope of tomorrow. You are here on earth at a time when the forces of evil are bombarding you with false standards as well as an enlightened age when the knowledge of technology has never been so sophisticated. You are being bombarded with false voices that cry, "Marriage is not necessary. Anything that comes naturally, that gives you satisfaction, is acceptable. Lie a little, steal a little, take advantage of your neighbors if it will bring you profit. Do your own thing." Close your mind and heart to the voices of evil. Take a long look at the future. Life is eternal. You are your own constant companion through everyday of life and throughout all eternity. You cannot escape yourself. You could make choices that might give you a thrill for the moment, but what will be the lasting result? We are spirit children of heavenly parents and have great potential. We all can communicate directly with Heavenly Father, and He is just as close as we will let Him be.<br><br>He has designed that we, as men and women united by the bonds of eternal marriage and strengthened by the bonds of love and companionship, can build a family unit and thus carry out the Lord's design for the fulfillment of the destiny of the human race. You young people are in a most crucial period of your development. This is the time of preparation and decision. Your choice of an eternal companion will have a most profound effect on your future and the future of civilization. Look for a companion who has ideals similar to your own--one who will help you be your best self. I quote from a noted historian and philosopher:<br><br><i>Throughout history, nations have been able to survive a multiplicity of disasters--invasions, famines, earthquakes, epidemics, depressions--but they have never been able to survive the disintegration of the family. The family is the seedbed of economic skills, money habits, attitudes toward work, and the arts of financial independence. The family is a stronger agency of educational success than the school. The family is a stronger teacher of religion than the church. . . . What strengthens the family strengthens society. The role of a father, a mother, and of children is the absolute critical center of social success--if things go well with family, life is worth living; when the family falters, life falls apart</i>.<br><br>We of the Church of Jesus Christ have the added knowledge that the family may be the eternal unit of importance if the marriage is sealed for eternity in the holy temple of God. Marriage is an equal partnership between husband and wife. Each has specific roles that the potential of man or woman can fulfill most effectively. The father who holds the priesthood fills most successfully the role of director and protector of the group. His position, hopefully, is never one of autocratic direction, but only of cooperative consideration carried out in perfect love and unselfishness. The role of a successful mother involves a lifetime of dedication. It is the most exacting and difficult of all professions open to women. Anyone who would say apologetically, "I am only a homemaker," has not fully appreciated the importance and intricacy of her profession. Some of the attributes required to be a successful mother are an unlimited amount of love, patience, unselfishness, and endurance. A mother should be skilled in child training, in economics and management, in nutrition and nursing; in fact, a well-rounded education will be a great help in her important role both as wife and mother.<br><br>Some weeks ago I received a letter from a sweet young girl from Colorado asking, "Sister Kimball, since the Church stresses so the importance of a woman's role as wife and mother, do you think it is necessary to have a college education?" You may be sure that I sent her a very detailed letter of the importance of all the education that a woman can acquire. A well-rounded education will be a great help in a woman's important role both as wife and mother.<br><br>There should be love and harmony between husband and wife. In the home the mother has the opportunity to teach her children to honor and respect their father, who holds the priesthood of God. It is he who will properly preside and lovingly direct the activities of the family. Children should be cherished with the strongest bonds of affection. No sacrifice is too great to protect our families from evil and to rear them in righteousness. Our constant anxiety is that all members of the family will live worthy of the eternal blessings promised to those who remain faithful to the end.<br><br>These suggestions may seem premature to you young people, but I remind you that you are in a period of preparation. It is not too early to make your opportunity for learning meaningful and serious. Hopefully you are here happily, making friendships that will be stimulating and lasting. The direction, "If you would have a friend, you must be a friend," is a truism. A happy, optimistic outlook on life will help you to attract friends. A smiling countenance and a glad handclasp are a way of projecting your desire to make friends. Be constantly on the lookout for anyone who seems to be lonely and timid. They need your help. I speak from experience of a long time ago. Develop your talents. Make the most of every opportunity. Be alert and alive, moving forward enthusiastically and joyfully. Life is good if we make it so.<br><br>I wish to bear my testimony of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the happiness and joy and feeling of peace that come when we follow His directions. May our Heavenly Father help each of us to follow the road and do the things that will make it possible for us to live eternally with Him and with our Savior, Jesus Christ. In His name. Amen.<br><br><i>Camilla E. Kimball, wife of Spencer W. Kimball, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 6 September 1980.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>to Our Redemption - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, it isn't often that Sister Tuttle gets to accompany me on church assignments, but she is here tonight, and I'd first like to introduce her to you and then have her say a few words.<br><br>First, you can see that she is beautiful. Second, she has a beautiful name. Her name is Marné, with a French "é." We have lived in many places fulfilling Church assignments, and wherever we have been, because she is so highly respected by her friends and my students, there are many little Marnés. For thirty-seven years she has been my companion and friend and wife. We have seven children and fifteen grandchildren. She is a wonderful girl. She is a good cook; she is serene and steady; she is a peacemaker.<br><h2><b>Sister Marné Tuttle</b></h2><br>I have a great admiration for Brigham Young University. Over thirty years ago we met here, and each of our five children who is here tonight has met his spouse here. I'd like them to stand up and to let you know that they are our cheering section for tonight. We have five of our children here. Our youngest son is in Tokyo serving as a missionary, and our eldest daughter is in California with her seven children.<br><br>If I could have a wish that would come true, I would wish that every wife--not only Latter-day Saint wives, but all wives--could have a husband about whom she could say that she was in love with a wonderful guy, someone she could love and cherish and support and sustain and with whom she could grow in harmony. As Latter-day Saints, we know that our purpose for coming to this earth is to prepare to leave it two by two so that we can reach our ultimate potential. Elder James E. Talmage has said, "The Latter-day Saints declare that part of the birthright of every worthy man is to stand at the head of a family as husband and father, and equally strong is the right of every worthy woman to be an honored wife and mother." As I have served as matron of the temple, these words have come to mean more to me than they used to. I would say to every young girl here to stay sweet and pure and your day will come.<br><br>I know the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. I know I have been blessed beyond measure because I am a member of the Church. I know that Jesus is the Christ, that our Father in Heaven loves us and hears and answers our prayers. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet who, as a young boy, went into the woods to pray and that he received an answer to his prayer that has made it possible for each of us to enjoy these beautiful blessings in our day. I know that President Kimball is a prophet who receives inspiration to guide us, that he is inspired and strengthened daily to carry the great load he has. I pray that you will each reach your full potential. Stay on the course that the Lord has charted for you. May the Lord bless you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Elder A. Theodore Tuttle</b></h2><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, this is an awe-inspiring sight. I don't know when I'll have another chance like this to invite each of you to the temple. We are a very efficient organization up there, and I'm sure we can handle you all--in due time. I want to join in welcoming you to Brigham Young University. BYU is the greatest university in the world. There are unlimited opportunities here. I hope that you will take advantage of every opportunity that is afforded you on this campus--to learn and to grow, both intellectually and spiritually. I'm happy to see so many missionaries here--this vast army of missionaries who are soon to leave the Missionary Training Center. I want to assure you that once you leave, everything gets better. (I guess I should have said that differently.) As Sister Tuttle said, our son was here just a few weeks ago, and now that he is over in Japan he thinks it is better there than here, and I know you will feel the same. The missionaries are some of our best attenders at the temple. Everyone loves them. Every one of the workers is just thrilled to have the missionaries attend the temple, and we'd be happy to have all of you come too.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, tonight I want to talk to you about redemption for the living and the dead. I approach this subject with reverence, for it is a sacred matter. The key to our redemption is the life and atonement of the Master. If we follow the path that he has outlined, it will lead us to the sacred rooms of the holy temple, for no man can receive the fullness of the priesthood outside of the temple of the Lord. Therein eligible members of the Church come to participate in the most exalted and sacred of the redeeming ordinances that have been revealed to mankind. Therein we may be washed and anointed and instructed and endowed and sealed. And after we have received these blessings for ourselves, we may then officiate for those who have died without having had these same opportunities. In the temples the sacred ordinances are performed for the living and for the dead alike.<br><br>I want to share all I can with you to increase your understanding as to why temples are built, how we obtained the authority to perform the ordinances and ceremonies of the temple, and why the earth will be smitten with a curse if we do not do this work--in the hope that all of you will have a greater desire to participate in these holy ordinances.<br><br>One of the impressive things to know about temple work is that it was formulated before the world was. These are eternal principles. They are eternal ordinances. They have existed to a greater or lesser degree among various peoples of all ages. Every person who desires to walk back into the presence of his Heavenly Father must understand the principles of this gospel and undergo the ordinances in order to gain admittance to the presence of our Father. These ordinances did not originate with the Prophet Joseph. There has been a long history of temple building in all ages--in both Bible and in the Book of Mormon lands. There have been allusions to the temple throughout history, but not much has been said, I suppose, for the same reason that not much is said today about temples. (And I can understand why some things are not said.) But there are fairly good descriptions of what temples looked like and of their purpose.<br><br>The Savior said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). Immortality and eternal life are not synonymous.<i>Immortality</i>means living forever in a resurrected state with body and spirit inseparably connected. Immortality is a gift of God that comes by grace alone, without works.<br><br><i>Eternal life,</i>on the other hand, is the kind or quality of life our Eternal Father enjoys. This quality of life is earned by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. During his earthly ministry the Savior declared, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man<i>be born of the water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom</i>of God" (John 3:5, italics added).<br><br>Given such a straightforward declaration, the world is faced with a great dilemma. How can all the good men and women of the world enter into the kingdom of God when most of the world's people have never even heard of the Lord Jesus Christ, his life, ministry, and atonement--let alone the necessity of baptism or of having authorized ministers perform it for them? We alone have the answer to this dilemma. We have the answer because we have the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was ordained by the Lord that all of his children who would enter into his presence would follow the same principles and the same ordinances in order to get there.<br><br>The third Article of Faith states, "We believe that . . . all mankind [<i>all</i>mankind] may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel." Then we read in the fourth Article of Faith, "We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>When people have not had an opportunity to hear and accept the gospel while in this probationary state, they may hear and accept it in the hereafter.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith, while contemplating the vast number of people on the other side of the veil, wondered how it was possible to preach and perform the necessary labor in such a short time as the Savior's three days in the spirit world. He had revealed to him the following, which is one of the two revelations recently accepted as scripture by the Church:<br><br><i>But behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.</i><br><br><i>And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.</i><br><br><i>Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without having a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.</i><br><br><i>These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.</i><br><br><i>And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</i><br><br>What a marvelous plan. What a divine plan. This could not have been calculated or contemplated by man alone. And we are the only ones that believe in it. Then the revelation continues:<br><br><i>And so it was made known among the dead, both small and great, the unrighteous as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought upon the sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross. . . .</i><br><br><i>I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.</i>[Joseph F. Smith--Vision of the Redemption of the Dead, verses 30–35, 57]<br><br>This is an amazing doctrine: to think that the millions of spirits on the other side of the veil can hear the message of the Restoration, can hear the fulness of the gospel, can be taught faith and repentance, and can be taught that there is vicarious baptism and that we are baptized for and in behalf of them. And they are on the other side hearing these same things. The Lord contemplated this doctrine from the beginning; hence, the great vicarious work for the dead, akin to the Savior's vicarious work for us, may go forth and we may become "Saviors upon Mount Zion."<br><br>Paul has given us evidence that he knew of the doctrine of baptism for the dead as well as of the practice when he declared, "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?" (I Cor. 15:29). This is one of the most enigmatic verses in all scripture unless one understands it in the context of the plan of salvation.<br><br>However, before these earthly ordinances can be efficacious in the heavens, man must have the authority and power to perform the ordinances, which is the sealing power. Elder Bruce R. McConkie has said,<br><br><i>Whenever the fullness of the gospel is on the earth, the Lord has agents to whom he gives power to bind on earth and seal eternally in the heavens. This sealing power, restored in this dispensation by Elijah the Prophet, is the means whereby "all covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, association, or expectations" attain efficacy, virtue, or force in or after the resurrection of the dead.</i>[<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 615]<br><br>It is an interesting thing to trace this sealing power from age to age. As I do so, I will be able to touch only the mountain peaks, as it were, in tracing it briefly. The Prophet Elijah is the main character in this interesting drama. He strides onto the scene in approximately 875 B.C. King Ahab, with his wicked wife Jezebel, was reigning in Israel at the time. The scriptures say, "and Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him" (1 Kings 16:30). Elijah's ministry opens with these words, "And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word" (I Kings 17:1). This statement, without any ifs, ands, or buts, was a simple declaration of a prophet who had the authority to seal the heavens. The ministry of Elijah the Prophet scarcely has an equal.<br><br>You all studied his life in seminary. Do you remember what happened after this? He went out to the brook Cherith, and there the ravens fed him until the brook dried up. Then the Lord said, "Get thee down to Zarafath . . . I have commanded a . . . woman there to sustain thee." When he got down there, he found a widow and her son. He said to her, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread." She then said, in essence, "I only have enough meal in my barrel and enough oil in my cruse to make one cake, then I die." He said, "Make it for me," and she did. The meal never failed, nor was the cruse ever dry, all the years he lived there. (See I Kings 17:9–15.) I hope we can learn a lesson from that. Elijah also raised the dead, destroyed the priests of Baal (you remember that contest), called down fire from heaven on at least three occasions, fasted forty days and nights, was attended frequently by angelic ministrants, and finally was translated. (See<i>Mormon Doctrine,</i>p. 206.) You will recall that as he and his successor, Elisha, were walking along, a fiery chariot came down, passed between them, and, it is said, "Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (See 2 Kings 2:1–11.) Now there was a reason for that. It was for the same reason that Moses was translated. You recall how Moses led the children of Israel for forty years. Just as he got them ready to cross the Jordan River, the Lord said, "This is far enough." Moses bade his people farewell, walked into the mountains, and, as the scriptures say, "No man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day" (Deut. 34:6). The reason there is no sepulchre is that he didn't die. He was translated. Both these men had a work to do, a mission to perform, that required that they do it in the flesh prior to the resurrection.<br><br>After Elijah was translated, we hear nothing more about him or the sealing power until four-and-one-half centuries later when in the two concluding verses of the Old Testament, Malachi prophesies concerning Elijah:<br><br><i>Behold, I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord:</i><br><br><i>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</i>[Malachi 4:5–6]<br><br>This was a great prophetic event with a dire warning, and thus the Old Testament closes.<br><br>Four more centuries pass before we hear of Elijah again. There is recorded in the sixteenth chapter of Matthew an account of the Savior's conversation with his disciples on the coast of Caesarea Philippi. He asked the question, "Whom do men say that I the son of man am?" After various answers had been given, Peter testified,<br><br><i>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven.</i><br><br><i>And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</i>[Now note.]<i>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:</i>and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. [Matt. 16:17–19; emphasis added]<br><br>Some six days later this promise was fulfilled when the Savior took Peter, James, and John "up into an high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them: . . . And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias," which should read Elijah. (See Matt. 17:1–3.) Now this event is referred to as the Transfiguration. The Savior's face did shine, his raiment was white, a cloud overshadowed the mountain, and he took upon himself his glory. Then those with the Savior heard a voice from heaven declaring, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him" (Matt. 17:5). We conclude from modern revelation that Moses conferred upon Peter, James, and John the keys of gathering. Elijah conferred upon them the keys of the priesthood or the sealing power, as the Savior had promised. (See D&amp;amp;C 110.)<br><br>Eighteen more centuries elapse before we hear anything more about Elijah. It is now 21 September 1823, nearly three-and-one-half years following the first vision of the Prophet Joseph. With reference to this occasion he said, "I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one" (Joseph Smith 2:22). If you ever want an example of faith, that is it. In answer to that supplication, the angel Moroni came and told Joseph about the Book of Mormon. After Moroni had delivered that message, he commenced quoting prophecies from the Bible. He quoted from Isaiah, Acts, Joel, and Malachi. The last two verses of the book of Malachi were quoted somewhat differently from the way they are written in the Bible, and you ought to compare them some time because the differences are interesting. These verses have been accorded a place in the Doctrine and Covenants as section two, and I quote,<br><br><i>Behold, I will reveal unto you the priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</i><br><br><i>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</i><br><br>Again this dire prediction is made.<br><br>About thirteen years later, on 3 April 1836, one week after the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph records some marvelous visitations. (Coincidentally, this was the same date that the Jews were observing their paschal feast where traditionally they opened their doors for Elijah to enter.) These visitations, which are recorded in section 110 of the Doctrine and Covenants, are the culmination of this great thread of sealing power. In the superscription of section 110, the Prophet makes this statement:<br><br><i>In the afternoon, I assisted the other presidents in distributing the Lord's Supper to the Church, receiving it from the Twelve, whose privilege it was to officiate at the sacred desk this day. After having performed this service to my brethren, I retired to the pulpit, the veils being dropped, and bowed myself, with Oliver Cowdery in solemn and silent prayer. After rising from prayer, the following vision was opened to both of us.</i><br><br>[And here begins the revelation.]<i>The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened. We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit.</i>[verses 1–2].<br><br>And then he describes, or tries to describe, the Lord.<br><br>The Lord tells Joseph and Oliver several important things. He says,<br><br><i>Behold, your sins are forgiven you; . . . lift up your heads and rejoice. . . .</i><br><br><i>I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here.</i><br><br>[Now notice:]<i>Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out and the endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house. . . .</i><br><br><i>After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses appeared before us.</i>[verses 5, 7, 9, 11]<br><br>And he committed to them the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth. After this vision, Elias appeared and committed unto them the keys of the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham. Then this:<br><br><i>After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:</i><br><br><i>Behold, the time has fully come</i>[Well I guess; think of how long he had awaited this day],<i>which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi--testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come--</i><br><br><i>To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse--</i><br><br><i>Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands; and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors.</i>[verses 13–16]<br><br>And so, after 2,700 years, Elijah the Prophet, who held the keys of the priesthood, succeeded in restoring them in the last days upon the head of the duly constituted prophet of God. Thus the succeeding prophets in these days were able to receive the power that allows them to forge the eternal links between the children and the fathers.<br><br>Prior to these events, the Prophet had already turned the minds of the Saints toward Jackson County and toward the building of a temple in Independence, Missouri. But because of the opposition of the mobs, they were forced to leave Independence. They went north to Caldwell County, and there laid the cornerstones of the temple at Far West. Again opposition stopped them from building a temple because the extermination order, if you can imagine such a thing, had been issued by Governor Boggs. They fled to Quincy, Illinois, and then to Nauvoo. Then in January of 1841, the Prophet Joseph received a commandment to build a temple in Nauvoo. This temple was started once again amidst increasing opposition which finally culminated in the martyrdom of the Prophet. Prior to this time, however, and prior to the completion of the temple, the Prophet Joseph had received the temple ordinances by revelation. The first endowments were performed on 4 May of 1842 in the upper room of his store. Half a dozen of the brethren received their endowments at that time. Early in 1843 the Twelve and a few others had been endowed. It was after the Twelve had been endowed that the Prophet Joseph declared that now the Twelve had all of the keys, power, and authority that he had and that if he were killed they would be able to carry on the Church in its fullness with all the power and authority they needed. The Prophet was martyred in June of 1844, and the temple was not completed and dedicated publicly until 1 May 1846. During December 1845 and the early months of 1846, more than five thousand saints received their endowments. Then the Saints moved west. The temples and temple sites and other property were lost. Our enemies seemed to have ended up with everything--and we had nothing. But just the reverse is true. All they had was property and buildings. We still had the priesthood and the keys of the sealing power. We had the authority. We had the knowledge to construct and to use other temples. We had everything--and they had nothing.<br><br>It was not long after the Saints entered the Valley that Brigham Young selected a place for the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. Other sites were also chosen. The St. George Temple was finished in 1877, the Logan Temple in 1884, the Manti Temple in 1888, and the Salt Lake Temple in 1893. And today the Church is involved in the most intensive temple activity the world has ever known.<br><br>Without the temple and temple work, without the authority to bind on earth and have it sealed in heaven, no gospel message can bring true peace and comfort to mankind. It is only through the ordinances performed in the sacred rooms of the temples that mankind has hope of exaltation.<br><br>Brother Talmage has said this:<br><br><i>The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part of the individual, such as covenant and promise to observe the law of strict virtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent, tolerant and pure; to devote both talent and material means to the spread of truth and the uplifting of the race; to maintain devotion to the cause of truth; and to seek in every way to contribute to the great preparation that the earth may be made ready to receive her king, the Lord Jesus Christ. With the taking of each covenant and the assuming of each obligation a promised blessing is pronounced, contingent upon the faithful observance of the conditions.</i>[<i>The House of the Lord</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1970), p. 84]<br><br>Now we started out with three questions: Why build temples? How did we get the authority to perform these ordinances? And, why would the earth be smitten with a curse if we did not do temple work? I presume you might remember how we got the authority, at least the mountain peaks. The other two questions deserve just a word of comment.<br><br>Why do we build temples? Because we are commanded to. We also build temples to bring to pass the work of the Lord. Would we have immortality without temples? Yes, we would live forever with body and spirit inseparably connected. Would we have exaltation--eternal life--without temples? No. Can you begin to see, then, why the mission and work of Elijah the prophet were so tremendous?<br><br>Let me read to you from section 128, verse 18, of the Doctrine and Covenants. In the preceding verse, the Prophet Joseph had quoted Malachi, chapter 4, verses 5 and 6, and then he states:<br><br><i>I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purposes as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other--and behold, what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of time, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time.</i><br><br>Why would the earth be smitten with a curse? President Joseph Fielding Smith answered the question as follows: "Simply because if there is not a welding link between the fathers and the children--which is the work for the dead--then we will<i>all</i>stand rejected; the whole work of God will fail and be utterly wasted." (<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>3 vols, ed. Bruce R. McConkie [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56], 2:122.)<br><br>This power the Lord has given to man is the culmination of the whole plan of exaltation. No man can receive a fullness of the priesthood without the temples, without the sealing power. No man can gain eternal life, no woman can gain eternal life, without the temples. Temple building is not optional in this church. Temple attendance is not optional in this church. May I be bold enough to suggest that one of the reasons some Latter-day Saints are not blessed and do not prosper is because they are not attending regularly to their responsibilities in the great work of the temples.<br><br>Perhaps I should conclude, but I feel like Wilford Woodruff, who was the first president of a temple in this dispensation. During the latter years of his life, whenever he was called on to speak, he said he always felt like speaking on redemption for the living and the dead; and he also added, "There was never enough time." I haven't mentioned anything about opposition to temples and to temple work, but you should realize that every time there was a temple built in the early days of the Church, the opposition increased to thwart it. You can understand that, can you not? The adversary would rather hinder temple work than probably any other thing. However, there is always a compensating power that emanates from a temple, but you should understand that you're going to have to exert a little extra determination in order to attend the temple, and to do the research, and the other things that are corollary to it.<br><br>I haven't said anything about covenants or symbolism, which we really must understand to understand the temple. Nor have I said anything about the peace found in the temple or about the revelation and inspiration that come from attending the temple. I hope that when you young couples have problems and decisions to make you will come to the temple. For some reason, when you are there doing something that someone cannot do for himself, you feel a little more like asking in faith that the Lord will bless you with power and insight. I haven't said anything about forging these connecting links, about searching to identify your dead, or about performing ordinances. Neither have I mentioned the connection between missionary work and temple work (this is a tremendous subject) or the Christlike service that is given by all the officiators in the temple. Fourteen hundred in the Provo Temple come day after day, hot or cold, rain or shine--they come to serve you. Nor have I mentioned anything about the promise made to those who do temple work. I haven't shared any of the sacred experiences. Who can say that angels do not attend this work? Who can say that those on the other side of the veil are not present on numerous occasions when their work is being done and when these principles are being explained?<br><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe has said,<br><br><i>Men rise through temple work to high levels of character and spiritual joy. Once only may a person receive the temple endowment for himself, but innumerable times he may receive it for those who have gone from the earth. Whenever he does so, he performs an unselfish act for which no earthly recompense is available. He tastes, in part, the sweet joy of saviorhood. He rises toward the stature of the Lord Jesus Christ who died for all. Men who thus serve the dead go out of the temple into the marts of men with renewed power to deal fairly with others, to put into practice the golden commandment "Do ye unto others as ye would have others do unto you."</i><br><br><i>Yet there are immediate rewards for such vicarious service. Every time a person receives the temple endowment for another, he reviews the eternal journey of man, he is reminded of the conditions of eternal progress and of his covenants to obey God's law, is impressed anew with the necessity of making truth alive by use, and beholds again the glorious destiny of a righteous man. His memories are refreshed, his conscience warned, his hope lifted heavenward. Temple repetition is the mother of daily blessings. Wherever one turns, temple service profits those who perform it.</i>[<i>Improvement Era,</i>6 April 1936, p. 228]<br><br>Now, my young brothers and sisters, study hard. Learn by faith as well as by study. But look up occasionally. Look up to the hill of the House of the Lord--the greatest spiritual power in this valley. And resolve now to live so that you can come to the temple to receive your blessings, and to be sealed for eternity. Resolve now to search out your ancestors, to identify them, and then to perform the ordinances in their behalf.<br><br>I bear humble witness that this work is true. I know it is divine. I know that those for whom we do the work are close to us. I know that God lives, that he is our Father, that he loves us, that he wants us to come into his presence; and this can only be done in the way that we have outlined tonight, through the temples. I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. Through his atonement he made it possible for us to be exalted and to live eternally. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet. Think of what he did. Think of the great sacrifices he was called to make, yet he was faithful and true. Somehow he had the spiritual capacity to receive these marvelous revelations from the Lord, to translate them into what we now have today as the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was a prophet. I know that President Kimball is a living prophet today, a man who has given more impetus and intensity to temple activity than anyone in this generation. Because that is true, and because opposition always follows, perhaps we can expect opposition, both as a Church and as individuals. I pray that the Lord will bless you with power of righteousness against the adversary, that you may go forth in your life and fill your resolves and resolutions to so live that you can walk, with your companion by your side, back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and ultimately become like him. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>A.

<h1>e - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President and Sister Kimball, Commissioner Eyring, President Holland, students, faculty, my dear brothers and sisters--I am honored and humbled by the invitation to be with you this morning and to speak briefly about two of my dearest friends, President and Sister Spencer W. Kimball.<br><br>Sister Kimball is a most remarkable woman. She is gentle, kind, and shy. She is a woman of intelligence and culture, strength and beauty. She has an unquenchable appetite for reading and learning--an appetite it would be well for the rest of us to acquire. I pay tribute to her.<br><br>Sister Kimball is the oldest of eighteen Eyring children. It was she who set the pattern for the other members of the noble and distinguished family. She was the first of the children to leave home and get an education, and then she used part of her meager earnings to help her brothers and sisters start their own education. Some of them, as we know, have gained worldwide recognition for their scholarship. All are loved and respected by everyone who knows them.<br><br>Sister Kimball attained most of her education here at BYU, beginning in 1912. It wasn't an easy matter in those days to get an education, any more than it is today. Here are just a few lines from Sister Kimball's own account of her first arrival at BYU:<br><br><i>About the first of September in 1912 I started on a high adventure--going away to school. It was hot summer when I left El Paso, so we packed my coat away in my trunk and shipped it through. When we got into the mountains of Colorado, it was snowing and the train was unheated. I nearly froze to death. I had a pair of cotton blankets in the roll that I was carrying, but I was too proud to wrap up in them until it came to the point of near freezing.</i><br><br><i>Finally when we reached Provo it was bitter cold and raining, and there was no one there to meet me</i>.<br><br>Parents were just as anxious about the welfare of their children who were here as students in those days as they are now. When a letter did not go to her parents one week, Sister Kimball received the following night letter telegram from her father:<br><br>SAFFORD, ARIZ., 9/10/13<br>CAMILLA EYRING, 257 S. 5th W., PROVO, UTAH<br>NO LETTER FOR WEEK (STOP) MOTHER MUCH WORRIED (STOP) IF ANYTHING WRONG WIRE IMMEDIATELY (STOP)<br>E.C. EYRING<br><br>Sister Kimball made the following notation on that telegram, "I had not written because I did not have two cents for the stamp." I hope you students can find fifteen cents for a stamp and won't forget to write your loved ones weekly while you are here.<br><br>In a few weeks (November 17), President and Sister Kimball will have been married sixty-three years. What a remarkable example for all of us and for the world. They have been sweethearts for all those years. The dedication in the front of that wonderful biography of President Spencer W. Kimball reads simply, "To Camilla Eyring Kimball, equal partner." And so she has been all these years. She has supported and sustained him throughout all their married life. Without her, I am sure he could not have succeeded half so well as he has.<br><br>Last March, upon the occasion of President Kimball's eighty-fifth birthday, Sister Kimball read the following tribute to her husband.<br><br><i>How do I love thee?</i><br><br><i>On this your eighty-fifth birthday, my beloved husband, my heart is full of gratitude for the sixty-two years we have been privileged to share. They have been years filled with joy and sadness. Sharing has made the joy more fulfilling and the sadness easier to bear.</i><br><br><i>You have been patient with my foibles and have richly fulfilled my needs. Your love and understanding have helped me over the rough spots. Our travels around the world have brought joyful and rewarding memories.</i><br><br><i>In addition to my great love for you, I deeply respect and honor your undaunted courage in meeting successfully the many challenges that have filled your life. Your complete and unwavering dedication to your callings in your service to others has been a lifetime inspiration to me.</i><br><br><i>"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach."</i><br><br><i>What joy I feel for the hope of eternal life together!</i><br><br><i>Camilla</i><br><br>I have heard Sister Kimball speak to thousands of people in congregations throughout the world. Her words are simple and eloquent and full of the gospel message. Here is just one example:<br><br><i>"I am a child of God, and He has sent me here, has given me an earthly home, with parents kind and dear. Lead me, guide me, walk beside me, help me find the way."</i><br><br><i>This, my brothers and sisters, is the quest of each of us. We recognize our eternal heritage as children of our Heavenly Father, each one of us. We recognize that He loves us, that He is deeply concerned for our happiness and well-being everyday of our lives.</i><br><br><i>I am grateful, as I think back of my own wonderful parents, and I look forward to the day when I will see them again. I am grateful for the almost sixty-three years that my husband and I have had together, for our children, four of them, and now for our twenty-seven grandchildren and our thirty-five great-grandchildren. The older I grow, the more I realize that there is nothing else that is so important as this family relationship and the fact that we know that if we keep the commandments of our Heavenly Father and follow the path that Christ outlined for us so specifically--that we love one another, that we serve one anther--that the family will be eternal, if we have the ordinances which have been ordained by Him which make for the eternal marriage</i>.<br><br>A young lady came to the office the other day to see President Kimball. Her family was originally from Lithuania, now a part of Russia. She is a convert of one year and is now in the missionary training school. She wanted to tell President Kimball that she loves him and loves Sister Kimball. She said, "I saw a picture of Sister Kimball recently, and I said to myself, 'That is what my Heavenly Mother looks like.'"<br><br>President Kimball is no ordinary man; Sister Kimball is no ordinary woman. I am grateful for the privilege of associating with them and having them as friends. I salute them and bear you my witness that the Lord loves them and blesses them.<br><br>In 1957, when President Kimball developed throat cancer, he went East for an operation. (You may remember that when he returned home, he said he had gone East and fallen among cutthroats.) As he was prepared for the surgery, President Harold B. Lee was there with him, and just before they wheeled him into the operating room, President Lee stopped the head surgeon and said to him, "Doctor, this is no ordinary man you are operating on today." That, indeed, was true, and it has been true throughout President Kimball's life. He is no ordinary man. President Kimball was born and reared in humble circumstances, and that humility and that common touch are his hallmark. The Lord has had him under His watchcare from the very beginning, preparing him for the call that he would someday receive to be His prophet and to preside over His Church and kingdom here upon the earth.<br><br>The road has not been easy. He has been tried and tested all along the way. He has had typhoid, smallpox, throat cancer, heart attacks, and open heart surgery. Last fall, he had two brain operations within three months, yet he never wavers and never complains. He is always about his Father's business, in season and out of season. He is the finest example of faith and courage and patience that I have ever seen. I sincerely believe that even Job could learn something from President Kimball. Yes, he has been tried and tested all his life, and he has been weighed in the balance but has never been found wanting.<br><br>As I work at President Kimball's elbow day after day, I feel of his great spirit and learn more and more of his great capacity for love and work. He loves people, and he loves to work. Almost daily, I have occasion to read and reflect upon some of the beautiful sermons he has given over the years. His sermons are not only stimulating, as they urge us to lengthen our stride, but they are lyrical, beautiful, powerful, and poetic. Here are just a few titles of some of those sermons:<br><br>"Absolute Truth"<br><br>"John and Mary"<br><br>"Tragedy or Destiny"<br><br>"Love or Lust"<br><br>"Hidden Wedges"<br><br>"Broken Power Line"<br><br>"Marriage and Divorce"<br><br>As you know, President Kimball has always had a great love for the Lamanites. I remember more than thirty years ago when President Kimball had been an apostle only three or four years, President George Albert Smith, whose secretary I was, called President Kimball down to his office and handed him the torch that he had been holding for many years and asked President Kimball to carry on the work among the Indians. Concerning that event, President Kimball recorded the following in his journal:<br><br><i>I went down to the office of President George Albert Smith at his request ... relative to the Indians. We talked about the Navajos in the mission. He then said, "Now Brother Kimball, I want you to look after the Indians--they have been neglected. You watch over the Indians. I want you to have charge and look after all the Indians in all the world and that includes those in the islands also."</i><br><br><i>I told him I would do my best</i>.<br><br>From time to time, I heard people criticize President George Albert Smith for spending so much time with the Lamanites. Upon such occasions, President Smith would stand up straight and tall, square his shoulders, look the questioner in the eye, and say,<br><br><i>My brother, I am an old man, and in the normal course of events, I will soon be called home, and when I get to the other side of the veil I am going to seek out Father Lehi. When I find him, I will look him straight in the eye and say to him, "Father Lehi, I want you to know that while I was on earth, I did everything in my power to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to your posterity"; and I don't want to have to hang my head</i>.<br><br>I don't have to tell you how well President Kimball has carried out that assignment given him by President George Albert Smith more than three decades ago. The Lamanites have no better friend in all the world than President Spencer W. Kimball.<br><br>Last October, Sister Haycock and I accompanied President and Sister Kimball, President and Sister Tanner, and others on a visit to the Holy Land for the dedication of the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens. While there, we visited a number of places held sacred in the memory of Christians, and particularly Latter-day Saints, because we were walking where Jesus walked.<br><br>We visited the Garden Tomb, and after my wife and I had been sitting with President and Sister Kimball inside the tombs meditating for a time, we came out in to the sunshine and beauty of that garden. The cameramen were anxious, as always, to get pictures of President Kimball walking in the garden, but I was concerned because the path was paved with flagstones, making it rough and uneven underfoot. I cautioned President Kimball to be careful and not fall. He responded quietly and with dignity, "Don't worry, Arthur, I am used to walking on holy ground."<br><br>We then visited the Garden of Gethsemane. We saw the small but beautiful garden with its ancient olive trees, which many believe were there when Christ knelt and prayed to His Father and our Father, just before His betrayal. Again, a film crew from BYU wanted to record the event for history. Our Israeli guides went to the priest in charge and asked permission for them to enter the part of the garden that was fences off. Permission would be given, he said, upon the payment of 5,000 Israeli pounds per person for five minutes. For President and Sister Kimball and one photographer, that would have been 15,000 Israeli pounds, or 450 dollars U.S., for five minutes. The Israeli guides shook their heads, and one of them said, "No, this is a holy man. He came here to worship, not to pay tribute."<br><br>In addition to all his many other virtues, President Kimball has a wonderful sense of humor. While traveling in Europe a couple of years ago, it became necessary to stay over for a full week before going to Poland to finalize arrangements for official recognition of the Church in that land. I thought perhaps we could climb the Matterhorn, visit the fjords of Norway, or explore beautiful England by taking a boat trip on the Thames river, but President Kimball, instead, said he wanted to visit the missions of Italy, Austria, and Germany. He left it up to one of the members of the Council of the Twelve and myself to arrange the itinerary.<br><br>We arranged special meetings each night in a different city or country. As soon as we arrived in the first mission, President Kimball asked when the missionary meeting would be held. I promptly told him that we hadn't planned any missionary meetings that afternoon because all of the missionaries would be attending the general meeting that night. And so it would be throughout the week. He said he still wanted a special missionary meeting. I told him the reason we didn't plan a separate meeting with the missionaries was because of the time and energy required. He replied, "I know what you are trying to do. You are trying to save me, but I don't want to be saved. I just want to be exalted!" I then went to the phone and arranged meetings all over Europe for the balance of our trip.<br><br>One day recently, about noontime, I was urging President Kimball to have some lunch and then to take a nap. He resisted, and I indicated that if he didn't do as I suggested, Sister Kimball might scold me. He looked up at me with a chuckle and a sly grin and said, "I'd a good deal rather she scolded you than me!"<br><br>One evening President Kimball stayed late at the office, so I continued working at my desk. It turned out that he was going to a dinner at the Lion House at 6:30 and was waiting for Sister Kimball to come and meet him so they could go together. About 5:30, he urged me to go home, but I told him that I would stay as long as he did. He insisted, so I said, "President, you're making it very difficult for me. I am torn between doing my duty to stay close to you and doing what you ask me to do." He looked up at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, "They both ought to be the same, hadn't they?"<br><br>I was with President Kimball when I saw the mantle of the Presidency fall upon him the day after Christmas in 1973. I had taken President Harold B. Lee to the hospital in Salt Lake the afternoon of December 26 because he was tired, and the doctor thought he ought to get a rest and have a checkup. His family had gone home for a brief period, and I was alone with him in the room when suddenly he sat up and spoke to me, the last words he said to anyone in this life. As I stood by his bed and tried to converse with him, I saw at once that he was not responding. He face was white and covered with perspiration and his eyes were gazing beyond me. Within seconds, I called a nurse and then a doctor and then the terrifying words came: "cardiac arrest." Immediately an alarm was sounded. A team of doctors and nurses worked heroically with sophisticated equipment for more than an hour in an effort to save his life. As I watched, I became convinced that unless the Lord indeed worked a miracle that President Lee could not live. I at once called President Romney and then reached President Tanner in Phoenix and got in touch with President Lee's wife and family. Again convinced that unless the Lord took a hand there would be a change in the leadership of the Church, I felt that the next President of the Church should be present.<br><br>Therefore, I immediately went to the phone and called President Kimball, and when he heard my voice he responded in his usual cheerful manner, "Well Arthur, how are you tonight?" I said, "President Kimball, I'm not very well. President Lee is very sick. I think you should come at once." I hung up, and then realized that I hadn't even told him where we were. Nevertheless, he perceived that it was the LDS hospital and was the first one there. Soon after came President Romney and then Sister Lee and the family.<br><br>It was on this sad occasion that I learned a great fundamental lesson in priesthood and Church government. As you know, President Romney was then a member of the First Presidency, while President Kimball was the President of the Council of the Twelve. As soon as President Romney arrived, President Kimball turned to him and said, "President Romney, what would you like me to do?" President Romney said, "I'm afraid there's nothing much we can do." At the moment there seemed to be little that any of us could do, except to pray and wait. A short time later, the doctor came out and shook his head and gave us the awful news that the Lord had spoken and that President Lee was dead. Quietly, President Romney, knowing that the First Presidency had now been dissolved, at the very moment that President Lee drew his last breath and that the mantle had now fallen upon President Kimball, turned to President Kimball and said, "President Kimball, what would you like me to do?"<br><br>In a recent conference President Kimball said:<br><br><i>We believe that we have in this Church the answers to all questions, for the Lord is at the head of the Church, and He has given us the program. Our message is what it has always been, and our hope is that our people will live the commandments of the Lord. They have been revealed in the holy scriptures and by living prophets throughout many years</i>.<br><br>No, President Kimball is not an ordinary man. He is the prophet of the Lord.<br><br>Yesterday, September 8, marked the completion of forty-two years since I started working in the Church offices under President Heber J. Grant. I have served with six Presidents of the Church and have been personal secretary to four of them. With that experience, I bear witness to you, my young friends, that I know that the Lord has called and prepared President Kimball, that He loves him, that He supports and sustains him and inspires and blesses him. President Kimball could not possibly do the work that he does and carry the heavy load and responsibility that he does were it not that the Lord is hearing and answering the prayers of the millions of members of the Church and that those prayers are made manifest in blessings upon the head of President Kimball. May the Lord continue to bless him and his dear wife and prolong their lives, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>D. Arthur Haycock was serving as secretary to Spencer W.

<h1>g Spiritual Literacy - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, it is a delightful experience to be with you again today in this spacious building. As remarks were made at the beginning of this meeting concerning cleaning up our home and grounds, I thought of something that Brigham Young is reputed to have said. He had been to St. George and was traveling back to Salt Lake City when he stopped in a town he had visited on his was to St. George and in which he had instructed the people to clean up their yards. He said, "I told you when I went down that I wouldn't call on you again if you didn't take care of your yardwork." And he said, "Now I am back, and it hasn't been done so I am not going to stop." That, of course, was rather disappointing to the people.<br><br>I want to tell you an experience about my BYU days. You didn't know I was a BYU student, did you? When the time came for me to begin my schooling here, I settled all the arrangements and came on the train from Arizona up to Salt Lake. From Salt Lake I took the inter-urban railroad to Provo and to the school I planned to attend. As I got off this inter-urban and got my suitcases about me, I looked around and saw a great white building on the hill in the distance. I thought, "Well, that's the BYU, all right." So I gathered my things together, and I walked all that distance from Center Street up to this white building that was so attractive. When I got close to the building, I saw many men in their overalls working in the yards. So I walked on up straight into the building, and got me a drink at the water fountain, but at about this time I realized I was in the wrong place. So I turned around and went out the door and came down into town where I found people who directed me to the BYU campus. At any rate, that was the first of my BYU days. After I finally found the school, I remember that we went to class for one week, and then we went to the peach orchards for the second and third and fourth weeks. But by that time, the man in charge of the military in my home town sent me a telegram from Safford, Arizona, and said, "Please get down here in a hurry. Your turn for the Army has come." So I rushed back to Safford to take care of my responsibility as it was outlined for me.<br><br>I have always loved BYU and have always been very, very proud of it. It is a great institution; it has influenced and shaped many, many wonderful people. I should like to say just a few words this morning to tell you that I love each of you. I love you as I love all the people of this Church, some four and one-half million of them. I have enjoyed my associations with BYU and have watched with great eagerness as the time has come for me to visit this school at different times. I am very happy to be with you today and to be able to talk to you good folks at the beginning of this academic year at Brigham Young University.<br><br>There is no way that anyone can fully appreciate all the dreams, hopes, plans, and sacrifices that have preceded this moment in your lives. Whether you have come for the first time to this campus or are continuing your studies, I am sure you are appreciative of the sacrifices of your parents and others who are largely responsible for sustaining you at the BYU.<br><br>I am sure you are aware, too, of the sacrifice that they and the other tithepayers of the Church gladly make to sustain and support this important university. As you know, your contribution in the form of tuition and fees covers only about a third of the cost of your education here. I mention that fact not to make you anxious, but to help you appreciate the special blessings that are yours.<br><br>In the years ahead, a smaller and smaller percentage of the college students of the Church will be able to attend this university. More and more of our youth will be attending their local institutions of learning where they also will be well served by participation in our institute programs throughout the world. As I look at this vast audience today, I realized that although you appear to be many, you are in reality a very select few.<br><br>You have already been well instructed by President Holland and others on the importance of maintaining the special standards that go with attending this university. There is no need, therefore, for me to add to that, except to assure you that I endorse wholeheartedly all that President Holland said to you last Tuesday and then to remind you that you have voluntarily and freely committed yourselves to a code of conduct that we fully and confidently expect you to live up to. To do otherwise would be to break faith not only with yourselves, but with the trustees, administration, faculty, and staff of this university, at which we endeavor to maintain a very special climate. We know you will honor the commitments you have made to come to this great university.<br><br>We will have an opportunity to welcome President Holland more officially at his inauguration, but we commend to you your wonderful new president along with his able colleagues in the administration of this university. Not only are the students assembled on this campus special, but so are the men and women who comprise its administration, its faculty, and its staff. They, too, have dreamed, hoped, prayed, and sacrificed, just as you have, to be a part of this very special community of scholars and students. Draw upon their knowledge and fellowship in both school and Church capacities during the special time you are privileged to be on this campus. Be ever mindful, however, that in reality the world is your campus and that you have come here to learn so that you may go forth to serve! You are trustees of your talents--use them wisely and gloriously.<br><br>I am mindful of the fact that this is Student Life Week, with the theme of "Reaching Out." That is a good theme, not just for a week, but for the whole year. Everyone needs to reach out, and we all need to be reached. Everyone benefits when we extend our concerns beyond ourselves--then our reach is lengthened, as well as our stride.<br><br>Be serious about your studies. This is a university. Your minds need to be filled and stretched and trained. Adequate social opportunities are available, and these are important in terms of balance in your life, but do not subordinate your studies to the fleeting things of the moment.<br><br>Speaking of things of the moment and social diversions, let me add one word of caution. The other night, Sister Kimball and I watched, by means of video cassette, an older movie,<i>The Sound of Music</i>. It was delightful. The music was beautiful, the acting superb, the scenery magnificent. It was wholesome and entertaining in every way. We had a wonderful, relaxing evening together. However, as you well know, it is difficult nowadays to find such entertainment. I would warn you against the R- and X-rated movies that unfortunately seem to be so prevalent these days. For the most part, they are filled with violence, sex, profanity, and crime. I can hardly imagine that any young man at the BYU, or elsewhere in the Church, would ever think of taking his lovely date to such a movie.<br><br>Again, I urge you to work hard while you are here. The information, attitudes, and training you receive here will permit you to serve hundreds of others during the balance of your lives. So, in a very real sense, those who are not here today to speak for themselves need to be spoken for--by way of urging you to be true to your trust in this privileged learning adventure that carries with it special duties and obligations. Do not join the parade of pleasure seekers; it is too large already! Do not seek selfish fulfillment, for it will leave you desolate.<br><br>I am pleased Sister Kimball could be with me and speak today. I want you to know how grateful I have been, so many times, for the wonderful education she received at BYU. It has helped her to be a most delightful and brilliant eternal companion, a wonderful mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother; and excellent leader in the Church; and a wonderful neighbor. Her basic training, of course, came in her early family life, but her years here were significant, and I hope you will ponder her words. She is an educated woman--both intellectually and spiritually--and this has made her a significant woman and, frankly, a delightful and interesting person to be with, in addition to all the other reasons I have for loving her.<br><br>You, too, will be someone's companion, and that special one deserves to have you be a prepared companion, not only in this life, but forever. In the Church, we continue to believe in "education for eternity." You should approach your studies in that grand and vigorous way.<br><br>Though my message to you today is brief, it is from my heart. In your pursuit of truth, remember that while some truths matter more than others, all true principles are a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There is no true principle that we need to fear. For example, the great leader for whom this university is named said:<br><br><i>Our religion measures, weighs, and circumscribes all the wisdom in the world--all that God has ever revealed to man. God has revealed all the truth that is now in the possession of the world, whether it be scientific or religious. The whole world are under obligation to him for what they know and enjoy; they are indebted to him for it all, and I acknowledge him in all things</i>. [<i>Discourses of Brigham Young,</i>comp. John A. Widtsoe (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1941), p. 2]<br><br>However, there is a lot in the world that attempts to pass itself off as truth when it is not. A good education will help you to distinguish between sense and nonsense. As you also receive real literacy in things spiritual, you will have added discernment with which to weigh and test ideas and assertions as you make decisions and judgments.<br><br>In addition to being serious about your scholarship, do not be unduly fearful about conditions in the world. Be noticing. Be aware. But be of good cheer, and also be about your Father's business. The Lord has promised us, again and again, that He will watch over His people and lead them along.<br><br>This is the Lord's work. He knows the end from the beginning. His work will surely triumph. Strive, my brothers and sisters, to be an educated and effective part of this great work. May God be with you! I love you and give you my blessings in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W.

<h1> Powers - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In harmony with the spirit and fever of this football season, I thought you might want to hear of an experience I had some two years ago.<br><br>I looked at my stake conference schedule and discovered that I had what is called a "firm free" weekend. This meant that my assignment was to remain at home and to attend to my family responsibilities. This freedom pleased me very much because on that particular weekend, Brigham Young University was scheduled to play a very crucial football game; and, inasmuch as I've learned to appreciate the finer things in life, I promptly made arrangements to attend that game.<br><br>The Monday preceding that special Saturday, I told my wife how pleased I was with the prospects of the forthcoming weekend. Friday of that week I told her that I had it made because I was certain that they wouldn't touch me with an assignment and that I would be able to see BYU play.<br><br>Ten minutes after I arrived at my office on the Friday morning, the telephone rang. It was President Benson's secretary. She informed me that President Benson had an emergency, and she wondered if I would accept his weekend stake conference assignment. I told her that I supposed I would. I then called home and said something like this to my wife: "Honey, there goes my football game. Pack my bags. I have an assignment; I must leave at three o'clock this afternoon." Colleen detected a ring of disappointment in my voice; and in her usual diplomatic way she said, "Carlos, you weren't called to go to football games."<br><br>Well, you may be interested in knowing that her statement was refuted two weeks ago. I was actually called or assigned to attend that Ricks College football game; and since I was already in that vicinity, I also dedicated the Viking Stadium.<br><br>It's a thrill to be with you, my young friends, and to speak to you about a very serious subject. Not too long ago, I received a letter from the office of the Council of the Twelve authorizing me to interview a man to determine whether he was worthy to receive a restoration of blessings. Attached to that assignment letter were two pages of information about this individual. In reading these pages, I learned, among other things, that the man was a former Melchizedek Priesthood holder; that he had received his temple endowment years before; and that he had once been sealed to his wife and family. Moreover, I learned that the man had transgressed seriously several years ago and that, because of his transgressions, he had been excommunicated from the Church. Such excommunication resulted in his loss of membership, baptism, gift of the Holy Ghost, holy priesthood, endowment, and temple sealing. All of these sacred privileges and blessings had either been cancelled or withdrawn.<br><br>On the appointed day and hour, I met with the man. With him was his lovely wife. Once the greetings and niceties had been exchanged, I invited my fried to tell me his story. He told me of his conversion and of his varied activities in the Church. He told me about his first wife, his first marriage, and the subsequent birth of three children. He also told me of his love for his family and his desire to provide them with security and with the luxuries of life. Then, with some display of emotion, he told me how his strong urge to gather these material things had caused him to neglect his wife and children. In time serious problems had developed between the man and his mate, and she had asked for a divorce.<br><br>The divorce was obtained. Feeling that his world had collapsed around him, the man lost all interest in life. He therefore sold his business, moved to a new location, and began to live after the way of the world. He drowned himself in drink, he turned to the use of tobacco, and he became heavily involved in sex. One affair led to another. Each nefarious incident caused him to sink deeper and deeper into the mire of sin.<br><br>Then he met a woman who was different. She had principles and standards and lived accordingly. He courted her for a brief time, and they were married.<br><br>A month or so after their marriage, the wife startled her husband by asking, "Why is it that I catch glimpses of goodness and greatness in you and then they're gone?" She added, "Sometimes I feel as if I'm married to only half a man." The husband was moved by what his wife had said and replied, "I suppose it is time I leveled with you. I am a Mormon--a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." He then explained to his wife what that Church membership had once meant to him. He spoke also of the basic principles and ordinances of the gospel. He described the priesthood and his temple marriage and sealing to his former companion.<br><br>When the explanations were over, the wife was crying. She told her husband that she had never heard anything quite so beautiful. She asked, "How can we bring those blessings back into your life so that they will remain?" He told her he would need to seek out a bishop, confess his sins, submit to court proceedings, and undergo a rather lengthy period of repentance. The woman said, "Whatever the price, we will pay it. And we will begin right now."<br><br>As the man had predicted, once a bishop had been located, a court was held, and he was stripped of all of his blessings. But as this good woman had committed, they climbed together the long path back. They had struggled for four years before he was rebaptized and finally given the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>At the conclusion of this successful interview, I restored the man's blessings, including the priesthood, an office within that priesthood, the temple endowment, and the temple sealing. As soon as I had pronounced the "Amen," the woman rushed into her husband's arms and declared, "Now I have a complete man--a whole man!"<br><br>Too often, I fear we fail to appreciate the worth of something until it is either lost or taken away. We are prone to take health for granted until illness strikes. The heat of summer gives rise to complaint until the first snow flies. Even heavenly gifts and powers receive casual treatment until needs and urgencies arise to remind us of our utter dependence upon the God who gave us life.<br><br>Such had been the case with my friend. Sin by sin he had suffered a dissipation of powers. The process had been too slow for him to recognize and to really understand what was being drained from his soul. It started with a leak in conscience; it continued as Church membership and entitlement to the gift of the Holy Ghost were revoked; it accelerated as priesthood powers were withdrawn; and it progressed almost to the point of no return as his temple endowment and sealing were cancelled.<br><br>Still, a glimmer of that once-held power was observed by his wife. Though she was unacquainted with heavenly powers, she saw that spark and felt of its uniqueness. What a blessing it was that she made the discovery she did and caused her husband to reflect upon what he had lost! And how blessed he was to find a companion who wanted him to be a complete man and who was willing to assist him in the struggle to regain precious powers.<br><br>Why is it that so many of us insist on learning the hard way? Should we not take a lesson from those who have stumbled and suffered, and choose our steps more wisely? The school of hard knocks, I suspect, has its place. However, when it comes to spiritual things, the risk of trial and error is much too high. One knock, one trial, one error may be fatal; or, in the vernacular of the day, it may blow the prospects of eternity.<br><br>I wonder if we recognize and appreciate the endowments of power associated with Christ, the priesthood, and his kingdom upon the earth. Do we fully understand what can be ours if we live in accord with divine law and draw upon the true source of light and truth? Permit me to refer to five powers--five precious powers--that are available to all of us. All of these powers make<i>complete</i>men and woman or<i>whole</i>men and women in Christ.<br><h2><b>Conscience</b></h2><br>I speak first of the power associated with conscience. According to the scripture, every person born into this world is endowed with the light of Christ (see D&amp;amp;C 84:45–48). Elder Bruce R. McConkie explains:<br><br><i>By virtue of this endowment all men automatically and intuitively know right from wrong and are encouraged and enticed to do what is right</i>(Moroni 7:16)<i>. The recognizable operation of this spirit in enlightening the mind and striving to lead men to do right is called conscience</i>. [<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 156]<br><br>How grateful we should be for that endowment, and how carefully we should guard against any loss of its quiet direction. The Apostle Paul warned that disobedience and sin stifle the voice of conscience. He wrote of sinners having their consciences "seared with a hot iron" (1 Tim. 4:2), and he also referred to the wicked and the unbelieving as having defiled minds and consciences (Titus 1:15). Is not the defiled mind a reprobate mind? And is not the reprobate mind void of judgment? (See Romans 1:28.)<br><br>Many of us have been exposed to individuals who seem to be void--completely void--of conscience. They wheel and deal and offend laws and principles left and right. Their speech is offensive, and their actions are expedient. They justify a little sin, a little lie, taking advantage of one because of his word, and digging pits for their neighbors. And in so doing, they allow the devil to cheat their souls. (See 2 Ne. 28:8, 21.)<br><br>One of the saddest commentaries ever made about a people is recorded in the Book of Mormon. It was said of a degenerate group that they were "without principle, and past feeling" (Moro. 9:20). Apparently, all conscience--all light of Christ--had been lost.<br><br>In your quest for knowledge and truth, whether you be a student or a missionary, you must cling to this essential endowment of power. You need those instinctive feelings of rightness and wrongness to lead you. You need the enlightenment of Jesus Christ. Bear in mind that peace of conscience is synonymous with joy (Alma 29:5). And remember also that a clear conscience gives birth to confidence, a quality that we cannot live successfully without.<br><h2><b>Holy Ghost</b></h2><br>I speak second of the power associated with the gift of the Holy Ghost. This gift is extended to all who have faith and are willing to repent and be baptized. As you know, it is given by the laying on of hands; it is received and retained through righteousness and circumspect living.<br><br>We should not forget that we, the members of the Church, are added upon when we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. We are added upon because this additional endowment of power provides our conscience with guidance and leads us in all truth, added upon because multiple gifts of the Spirit are made available to us through this marvelous power.<br><br>One Church leader describes this power in these words:<br><br><i>He [the Holy Ghost] teaches and guides, testifies of the Father and the Son, reproves for sin, speaks, commands, and commissions, makes intercessions for sinners, is grieved, searches and investigates, entices, and knows all things</i>. [James E. Talmage,<i>The Articles of Faith</i>, 12 ed. (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1924), pp. 159–60]<br><br>I love that which President Romney has written. He said concerning the Holy Ghost:<br><br><i>I tell you that you can make every decision in your life correctly if you can learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This you can do if you will discipline yourself to yield your own feelings to the promptings of the Spirit. Study your problems and prayerfully make a decision. Then take that decision and say to him, in a simple, honest supplication, "Father, I want to make the right decision. I want to do the right thing. This is what I think I should do; let me know if it is the right course." Doing this, you can get the burning in your bosom, if your decision is right. If you do not get the burning, then change your decision and submit a new one.</i>When you learn to walk by the Spirit, you never need to make a mistake. [Marion G. Romney, "Seek the Spirit,"<i>Improvement Era</i>, Dec. 1961, p. 947; emphasis added]<br><br>Like the Spirit of Christ, the power of the Holy Ghost is enjoyed by those who are clean and worthy to receive its companionship. It was said of one man that "he conducted a lifelong courtship with the Holy Ghost." What a tribute!<br><br>Is this power--this enlightenment--this endowment--operative in your life? Can you testify that the Holy Spirit has been upon you continually as you have studied at this university? I would hope so, for that power should be yours as you read, speak, write, and consider truths found in the various disciplines. Would that all of you could testify of your experience here as Parley P. Pratt did of his experience in the Sandwich Islands. He said:<br><br><i>Since I have arrived here I have been diligent in the duties of my calling [and my studies] every hour, and have called upon God for His Spirit to help me with all the energy I possessed, and without ceasing. The result is, the Spirit of the Lord God has been upon me continually, in such light, and joy, and testimony as I have seldom experienced</i>. [<i>Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1964), p. 386]<br><br>Your professors, I think, would rejoice also if you could so testify.<br><h2><b>Priesthood</b></h2><br>I speak third of the power associated with the holy priesthood. As you know, "priesthood is the eternal power and authority of Deity by which all things exist; by which they are created, governed, and controlled. . . . It is the power of God." (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 594.)<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball provides this definition of priesthood:<br><br><i>The priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man on earth to act in all things pertaining to the salvation of men. It is the means whereby the Lord acts through men to save souls. Without this priesthood power, men are lost</i>. ["The Example of Abraham,"<i>Ensign</i>, June 1975, p. 3]<br><br>We might add that without this power, men are incomplete.<br><br>The longer I live and serve, the more I appreciate the reality of priesthood power. For many years, as a young man, I marveled at the accounts of Peter and his fellow fishermen who were transformed into mighty men of God after receiving priesthood commissions. In more recent years, I have witnessed firsthand the expression of marvelous priesthood powers in the lives of modern Apostles and in many of my associates. Moreover, I have observed changes in the lives of other men in wards and stakes who have received, honored, and magnified priesthood callings. Priesthood power is real; it does exist!<br><br>We learn from modern revelations that through the priesthood and priesthood ordinances the power of godliness is manifest (see D&amp;amp;C 84:19–21). We are also told that "the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness" (D&amp;amp;C 121:36).<br><br>Students, you must not place this priesthood power on the shelf during your university years. It must not be allowed to diminish or atrophy through lack of exercise. Use your priesthood powers to bless the lives of family members and others about you. Use that power to declare the truth and to save souls. Make absolutely certain that the power of godliness is manifest through you.<br><h2><b>The Temple Endowment</b></h2><br>Fourth, I speak of the power associated with the temple endowment. To endow, we're told, is to enrich, to bestow power or ability, to give to another something long-lasting and of much worth. It is said of the temple endowment that (1) the one receiving the ordinance is given power from God. "Recipients are endowed with power from on high" (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 227). And (2) the recipients of the temple endowment are also endowed with information and knowledge. "They receive an education relative to the Lord's purposes and plans" (lbid.).<br><br>One Church publication contains this statement about the endowment:<br><br><i>No jot, iota, or tittle of the temple rites is otherwise than uplifting and sanctifying. In every detail the endowment ceremony contributes to covenants or morality of life, consecration of person to high ideals, devotion to truth, patriotism to nation, and allegiance to God.</i>[<i>The House of the Lord</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1968), pp. 83–84]<br><br>The endowment is a most important and significant blessing that God desires to share with his worthy children. We need the fullness of power found in these holy ordinances. Why do we locate the Missionary Training Center so close to a temple? Because in that temple, missionaries are given an endowment of power. And with that power, they go into the world to bring souls to Christ.<br><h2><b>Temple Sealing</b></h2><br>Finally, I speak of the power associated with celestial marriage. Whenever I participate or officiate in a temple marriage, I am overawed by the power given to bind on earth and seal eternally in heaven. I am reminded of a power and work that, if not effected, would result in utter waste--waste beyond our understanding.<br><br>A living Apostle informs us:<br><br><i>So comprehensive is this power that it embraces ordinances preformed for the living and the dead, seals the children on earth up to their fathers who went before, and forms the enduring patriarchal chain that will exist eternally among exalted beings</i>. [<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 683]<br><br>Knowing what we know about celestial marriage and its attendant powers and blessings, I cannot picture any Latter-day Saint entertaining the thought of another form of marriage. Nor can I understand why people who have been sealed for time and all eternity will place themselves in compromising situations wherein they might forfeit the promises and blessings of temple sealings. Esau's sale of his birthright for some "pottage" pales in comparison with the loss of the eternal prospects associated with celestial marriage.<br><br>In conclusion, may I urge you to keep in mind the reservoirs of power extended to you through the gospel of Jesus Christ and through his kingdom on earth. Do not take for granted the powers of conscience, Holy Ghost, priesthood, temple endowment, and celestial marriage. Do not allow any influence to enter your life here or elsewhere that would rob you of your heavenly powers.<br><br>I hope you do not think that my thoughts concerning spiritual or heavenly powers run counter to the avowed purposes of this institution of higher learning. For I know, as you know, that the quest for knowledge and the powers related to knowledge are most important. All of us understand that the gaining of knowledge and intelligence through the best books and with the help of the best instructors is a vital part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. However, the quest for knowledge must not be conducted at the expense of spiritual things. The two must be intertwined and perfectly balanced, as is so beautifully done at this institution.<br><br>When I think of this school and its special mandate, I am reminded of the challenging prophecy found in the Book of Mormon. One prophet, privileged to see the events of the latter days, saw the nations of the world gathered to fight against the people of God. In the prophecy, the Saints were seen as few in number; the opposition was seen as a multitude of nations. Note these words:<br><br><i>I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory</i>. [1 Nephi 14:14]<br><br>Whenever I read that scripture, I think particularly of the youth. And I think particularly of the challenge which is ours to clothe our youth with power and righteousness so that future battles may be won.<br><br>This is a place of power. Brigham Young University if one of the most powerful institutions on earth, and I am referring to more than just the football team. Not only is its academic program laden with power, but the faculty is endowed with power. If you apply yourselves properly, in conformity with the standards of the school and the standards of the sponsoring Church, you will go forward from this place with the powers of knowledge and with the powers of righteousness--yes, even with heavenly powers.<br><br>It is my sincere prayer that all of you will do what is necessary to become complete and whole in the Lord Jesus Christ. May you draw claim upon heavenly powers and do all that is necessary to keep those powers with you throughout all your lives. I testify of the reality of their importance, and I pray humbly that you will do what is necessary and required to make those powers yours, for your benefit and for the benefit of those around you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Carlos E.

<br>
I am deeply touched, my young brothers and sisters, by the spirit that is here and by your presence and the purpose for which you are here. I am grateful for the presence of President Holland and his lovely wife. I am grateful also for President Wheelwright, who, as he says, has been a lifelong friend. My wife and I met him and his wife accidentally in Palestine one time, and he escorted us through the Holy Land and did it like the expert that he is. We love the Wheelwrights; we love you all.<br><br>I was tremendously impressed when President Joe Christensen, the president of our Missionary Training Center, told me that here tonight there are 2,211 missionaries preparing to go on missions, the largest number of missionaries ever to be assembled under one roof. May I have permission, President Wheelwright, to ask these missionaries to stand so that we may see them? We are grateful for your marvelous dedication and grateful for your response to our calls to go to the various parts of the world. We wish you Godspeed in all of the work you have before you. May I ask also that President Christensen stand? I would like to express again the great appreciation we feel for President Joe Christensen and his wife and all of those associated with them in this missionary training school.<br><br>This morning at seven o'clock, the Counsel of the Twelve met in their fourth-floor assembly room in the Salt Lake Temple. We were there from seven until twelve in a very moving, spiritual meeting. The sacrament was passed, and we all partook of it in a most solemn manner and were grateful for the privilege. We were glad that we could again renew our covenants with Almighty God, and with his beloved son, Jesus Christ, to serve him and keep his commandments; we were glad for the great opportunity of having his Spirit to be with us. And we had the Spirit in rich measure.<br><br>Behind the pulpit in that little meeting room is a beautiful mural depicting the Savior in the Garden of Gethsemane. We talked about Gethsemane and about the Savior. Brother Bruce R. McConkie spoke at length about the tremendous suffering that the Savior went through. He did it in a very touching way and with great solemnity, reminding us how the Savior went into the Garden of Gethsemane, took three of the disciples with him, and asked them to watch and pray, and then went further away to pray alone.<br><br>Most of the pictures that depict the Savior in the Garden of Gethsemane show him kneeling in prayer. The one in the room in which we met shows him kneeling at an olive tree. It was painted by Harry Anderson. (You have seen a number of other paintings by Harry Anderson; he has done a magnificent work painting for us a series of murals of the life of Christ.) In this mural he has the Savior in a kneeling pose. Brother McConkie called our attention to the fact that the suffering incident to the atonement started there in Gethsemane and that the Savior suffered so dreadfully that drops of blood came from his pores.<br><br>Brother McConkie then told us that the Savior was not kneeling in that prayer. The suffering the he endured was so infinite, so much beyond our understanding, that even he fell prostrate upon the ground. He didn't try to kneel, and as he lay prostrate upon the ground he cried out to his father that if it were possible, "Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt"(Matt. 26: 39).<br><br>Attention was called to the fact that he had prayed three times in this way; and then came Judas, the betrayer, who had probably been possessed by a devil and who, for thirty pieces of silver, was willing to sell the Son of God. He came up and gave the Lord the traitor's kiss. Brother McConkie mentioned that according to the scholars' definition of the traitor's kiss it was not just an ordinary kiss on the cheek, but something very effusive. If Judas had followed the usual custom he would have come up to the Savior and embraced him vigorously and then kissed him affectionately.<br><br>You remember that Peter, who loved the Lord so much, raised a sword. It seems unusual that any of the Lord's disciples would have had a sword, doesn't it? But he had a sword, and he pulled it out and in self defense of the Savior struck at the servant of the high priest, a man named Malchus, and cut off his ear. The Savior then healed this man. That was the last miracle of healing that the Savior performed. Then he turned to Peter and told him to put away his sword, for he that raises the sword shall die by the sword.<br><br>Then the Savior, who had prayed so earnestly in the Garden that the cup might pass by if it were the will of the Father, turned to Peter as he rebuked him for using the sword and said, "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11).<br><br>Those words have been impressed on my mind all my life as I have realized what the Savior was talking about. Here he was enduring the terrible suffering of the Atonement. He had prayed to be relieved, if it were possible, but God's will was that he go through with it because the salvation of each of us depends on the Atonement of the Savior. Without the Savior there is no Atonement. There is no salvation. Without the Savior we wouldn't be alive; we wouldn't even exist. But there he was willing to take upon himself the suffering of all mankind. And he in his infinite mind knew what infinite suffering would be; he had already partaken of it in the Garden, and now he was to face the cross and have more of it. But he said, humbly and apparently gently, "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"<br><br>I would like to read the Savior's own description of his suffering as it appears in one of the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. You remember that in this revelation the Savior taught the great doctrine of repentance and that his saving blood relieves us of the terrible sins that we have committed. We also learn that if we will repent, the suffering that normally would be exacted from us for our sins will be paid for by the blood of the Savior on the cross. Therefore, he cried out and said, "Repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not" (D&amp;amp;C 19:15).<br><br>We are taught in the Bible that with every law there is a punishment attached. If we break a divine law, punishment is required. But if we really repent and serve the Lord and keep his commandments from then on, the suffering of Christ pays that penalty. He took our sins upon himself and thus became our Savior. The Lord went on to say,<br><br><i>Behold, I God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</i><br><br><i>But if they would not repent, they must suffer even as I; Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit--and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink--</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 19:16–19]<br><br>The Savior's persecutors took him to the cross after the experience in Gethsemane and nailed him to it. For about three hours, according to the scripture, he was suspended from the cross, still suffering the pain of the sins of all men that started in Gethsemane and continued and concluded on the cross. There he died for everybody if they would but serve him and keep his commandments.<br><br>You remember that this doctrine was also taught when we were given the sacramental prayers. I would like to read one of these prayers, if I may do so with the proper solemnity and reverence.<br><br><i>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 20:77]<br><br>Do you read that prayer in the scripture and then analyze it and come to understand what it means to each of us?<br><br>Every member of the Church in this room has probably partaken of the sacrament this very day. You have partaken of the bread that was broken in remembrance of the broken flesh and have drunk of the cup in remembrance of the blood spilt on the cross. What went through your mind as you did so? Did you listen carefully to the prayer on the bread? What does it say? It says that we "witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father," that we not only take upon ourselves his name, the name of Christ, and really become his, but that we pledge to high heaven, by the very crucifixion, that we will always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given us. Could there be a more solemn covenant than that?<br><br>I believe that the two most sacred ordinances in the Church are the sacrament of the Lord's Supper and baptism by immersion for the remission of sins. The reason I believe they are the most sacred is that they both relate directly to the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. The sacrament of the Lord's Supper reminds us of the terrible crucifixion and of his terrible death and suffering as described in the scriptures.<br><br>The world at large has the idea that the symbol of Christianity is the cross, but it's no such thing. The cross is the symbol of the cruelest form of torture and execution that the Romans could devise; that is what the cross is for. Christ did not give us the cross as the symbol of his great Atonement. He gave us, instead, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper and told us to partake of that bread and drink of that cup in remembrance of his blood and his broken flesh. Did he not give us that great ordinance emblematic of the suffering on the cross? Of course he did. We get it from no other place. He did not say to venerate the cross, he said to partake of the sacrament and always remember him and pledge to high heaven that we will always keep the commandments of Almighty God.<br><br>What was the other part of the Atonement? It was the breaking of the bands of death to bring about the resurrection. After his death the Lord Jesus Christ went to the spirits in prison, but his body went into the grave of Joseph of Arimathaea and was there until the third day. And then what happened? He was resurrected. His full life came back to his body, just as our full life will come back to our bodies.<br><br>In the resurrection every one of us will be raised up, no longer subject to death. We will have the very same body that we now have; it will be a physical resurrection of flesh and bones; we will not be resurrected in some other way. That is the kind of resurrection we will have, and that is the kind of resurrection Jesus Christ had.<br><br>Do you remember what happened when Christ appeared to his disciples after the resurrection? They thought that they were seeing a spirit or a ghost. He tried to convince them that he was real and physical, a corporeal being, saying, "Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke 24:39).<br><br>Do you remember when he came to the American continent and appeared before 2,500 Nephites and announced that he was the resurrected Christ? He had been resurrected in Palestine; now he came and visited the Americas. We have recorded in the Book of Mormon that 2,500 people lined up and approached him, and he allowed them to handle the marks of the crucifixion in his hands and feet and side.<br><br>This resurrection was a reality. And baptism by immersion for the remission of sins performed by somebody having the proper authority was the symbol of that resurrection. Why baptism by immersion? Was he not placed in the grave? And did he not come forth from the grave? We are buried with him in baptism, as Paul said to the Romans, and we come forth out of the watery grave in baptism just as he came forth out of the tomb in his resurrection (see Romans 6:3–4).<br><br>Baptism is always performed by immersion, and no other form of baptism<i>is</i>baptism because immersion represents the burial of the Christ in the tomb and his coming forth in resurrection. That is why these two ordinances are so significant. Both are directly related to the Atonement, and both have saving power.<br><br>There is a covenant in baptism too, and it is a most serious covenant. Here is what we read in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the Church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his Church</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 20:37]<br><br>So we enter into a covenant when we are baptized, do we not? And every member of the Church here has entered into that covenant. And in that covenant we took upon ourselves that name of Christ for the first time, later to take it upon us each time we partake of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. As we took upon ourselves his name in baptism we made a pledge, we determined--the scripture uses the word "determination"--to serve him to the end and truly manifest by our works that we have received of the Spirit of Christ.<br><br>My point is that the Latter-day Saints are the covenant people of God. We often say that the Jews are the covenant people of God, and they are in one sense. They are the covenant people in that they are descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob through Judah, one of the twelve sons. But they have not made personal covenants with God, as far as we know. Their covenant is the covenant of Abraham, that through Abraham they shall be blessed. In that respect, we are just as much the covenant people of God as the Jews are because we are descended through Joseph of Egypt.<br><br>Our covenants with God are greater than those of the Jews for two reasons. First, when Jacob laid his hands upon Joseph and his two sons, he gave them a patriarchal blessing that far exceeded anything that ever went to Judah or any of the others. He gave to Joseph and Ephraim and Manasseh a patriarchal blessing that they would "grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth" (Gen. 48:16).<br><br>Ephraim was given the birthright of the tribes of Israel; that is why we are of Ephraim today. We are descendants of Ephraim; we have been gathered out of the world as the children of Ephraim; and we hold the priesthood of God. We stand at the head of the twelve tribes of Israel. They are not all gathered yet; ten are still lost, and the Jews are just now beginning to gather in Palestine. I do not know whether many more of them will go there or not. More are leaving now than are going, and there are more Jews in New York City than there are in Jerusalem. But there will be a large body of Jews in Jerusalem at the time of the second coming of Christ.<br><br>You will remember that when he comes he will appear in several places, and one place will be Palestine. There will be the great battle of Armageddon at Palestine before the second coming of Christ, and Jerusalem will be besieged by the armies that will be gathered there. Then Almighty God will come to their rescue, and will pour down fire and brimstone upon those soldiers who are trying to destroy the Jews and drive them into the sea. And then what? He will descend and stand upon the Mount of Olives, and the mount will cleave in twain. The besieged Jews will rush into the valley thus formed and will meet him there and will come to him and say, "What are these wounds in thy hands and in thy feet?" And he will say, "These are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends" (D&amp;amp;C 45:51,52).<br><br>Second, we have been given the job of receiving the restored gospel. It was declared in scripture that not only would there be a great falling away from the truth but that in the hour of God's judgment the Church would be restored. That is one reason I call your attention to the fact that if any of you are looking for the true Church of Christ, you must look for a modern church. None of the old ones will do because none of them are modern. And the reason that the restored Church must be modern is that the angel who was to fly through the midst of heaven and restore the gospel to the earth was to come in the very hour of God's judgment. So the true Church could not be anything but a modern church; none of the old-line churches would do.<br><br>After the angel brought back the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, other angels came with the holy priesthood, the apostleship, and the power to organize the Church again. Then came the commission from the Savior himself to "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned" (Mark 16:15–16).<br><br>We have that commission. We are of Ephraim. We stand at the head of the work of God in these last days because Jacob blessed Ephraim many centuries ago that he should do this very thing. The Church is on the earth, and we are fulfilling the commission to take it into all the world. But we Latter-day Saints who are here at home must never allow ourselves to be casual about our religion--never. We must realize that God expects enthusiasm from us, enthusiastic support of his program, a great determination to carry it forward, and determination to be missionaries, and a determination to live every principle of the gospel here at home. What did the Lord say? You shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. Are we doing that? We are under covenant to do so.<br><br>Every one of us is under covenant by virtue of our baptism, that we will be determined to do just that as we take upon ourselves the name of Christ. Every one of us declares to high heaven that we will serve him and keep his commandments. To bind that covenant, we eat of the broken bread in remembrance of the torn flesh of the Savior; we drink of the cup in remembrance of his saving blood. But to do so will not do us any good unless we keep the commandments. I repeat, the saving blood of Christ will not save us in our wickedness. The saving blood of Christ will only save us in our righteousness, in our state of repentance. That is why the Lord puts us under covenant, to remind us of this great fact, so that whenever we are tempted to sin we will remember the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. We will remember our baptism, and that will remind us that we are under covenant with Almighty God to free ourselves from sin and to live righteously.<br><br>Do you see why the Lord said we should be in the world but not of the world? How do we know he expects enthusiasm from us? Did he not say that we were to love him with all our heart, might, mind, and soul? Is that not enthusiasm? And when he talked about love of God, he talked in terms of service to God: "O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind, and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day" (D&amp;amp;C 4:2).<br><br>He expects us to put our priorities in order, too. What is to come first in our lives? Pleasure? Even work here at this university? You remember what the Savior said in the Sermon on the Mount. He was talking about shelter and food and raiment, what I call the bread-and-butter blessings, but he did not put them first. He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matt. 6:33).<br><br>Do we have the faith and the courage to be Latter-day Saints first, last, and always, and to put the gospel of Jesus Christ first in our lives, knowing that if we do God will bless us and prosper us in all of our righteous activities? He gives many illustrations, but I mention only one. What did Malachi say would happen if we pay our tithes and offerings? The windows of heaven would be opened to such an extent that we could hardly receive the blessings (see Mal. 3:8–10). Do we believe Almighty God? Do we really accept Jesus as the Christ? He said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. . . . He that hath my commandments and keepth them, he it is that loveth me" (John 14:15, 21).<br><br>I pray earnestly that we will love him and serve him and honor him by our righteous lives, in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Mark E.

<h1>ievers in Christ - Neal A. Maxwell - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am delighted to be with you brothers and sisters today. It is not difficult for those of us who have admired President Holland for so long to anticipate joyfully the things he will bring to this new assignment. Among them will be his personal, small-town warmth, which will shrink the size of this big campus, and I foresee that his literacy will prove to be as contagious as is his laughter. If Mark Twain, one focus of Jeffrey Holland's graduate work, could have experienced Jeffrey's effective teaching of the Book of Mormon, Twain would not have made his uninformed and unkind remark about that book. At least Jeff would not have let him start reading in the book of Ether. And perhaps Jeff could even have put Twain "under," but not in the sense Twain meant, rather in the best missionary meaning of those words.<br><br>In our time, the words "true believer" have come to mean the manipulable and mindless who are part of political mass movements, seeking to escape from the burdens of freedom. Many years ago, a similar phrase was used, but with major definitional distinctions. The Apostle Nephi, and, even earlier, Alma, wrote of the "true believers in Christ." (see Alma 46:14 and 4 Ne. 1:36.) It is a concept too precious not to bring to the fore simply because of the current connotations of those two words. Someday, perhaps, we can rescue still other words even more sadly abused and inverted, such as "gay" and "welfare."<br><br>There are some sobering parallels between our times and these earlier groups of "true believers" in Christ who were "faithful" members of the Church, including the Three Nephites, and who had "gladly" taken upon themselves the name of Christ (see Alma 46:15). They were persecuted by the disbelievers and irreligionists of their time, but they did not retaliate because of their commitment to Christ and because of their humility (see 4 Ne. 1:29–37). Theirs, too, was a time of polarities, for there was a "great division among the people" (4 Ne. 1:35).<br><br>So much for the background of today's theme. The "true believers in Christ" will be spoken of for the sake of convenience throughout my discussion in terms of "he," but, of course, this group includes both women and men.<br><br>Jesus, of course, knows who His true believers are. Others may know who His disciples are by the central characteristic of love, as we were so well taught by today's lovely choral hymn, "Love One Another."<br><br>To begin with, the true believer, notwithstanding his weaknesses, is settled in his basic spirituality. He is settled, to use another of Alma's phrases, in his "views of Christ" (Alma 27:28), so his views of everything else are put in that precious perspective.<br><br>There are, of course, other kinds of believers who are not "true believers." In the parable of the seeds, one outcome was when the seed had no root, typifying those who "for a while believe" but who "in time of temptation fall away" (Luke 8:13). Alma warned us (in his own seed analogy) about the withering effect when the "heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth" the undernourished tree of shallow root (Alma 32). Other observations of Jesus add the insight about how tribulation and persecution cause the weak to be offended and to fall away (Matt. 13:6, 21).<br><br>Most of us here have had the sad experience of seeing some wither because they cannot stand the heat. They are not likely to acknowledge that as the real reason for their failures but will conveniently choose an issue over which they can become offended. Another dynamic operates, too. In racing marathons, one does not see the dropouts make fun of those who continue; failed runners actually cheer on those who continue the race, wishing they were still in it. Not so with the marathon of discipleship in which some dropouts then make fun of the spiritual enterprise of which they were so recently a part!<br><br>In the Joseph Smith translation of the Bible, Jesus comments about bearing one's cross and the demands of discipleship and then adds, "Wherefore, settle this in your hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command you" (Inspired Version, Luke 14:28). Being so settled is a part of becoming a true believer.<br><br>The need for such deep determination fits well with other scriptural descriptions in which words like these are used: "stablished," "settled," "grounded," "rooted." When we are so situated, then let the heat of the sun come. (see, Col. 2:7; Col. 1:23; 1 Pet. 5:10.)<br><br>Getting settled also includes achieving a comfortableness with the behavioral standards of the Savior. When we do this, said Paul in an intriguing verse, we will then know the love of Christ "which passeth knowledge" (Phil. 4:7), and we can truly "comprehend . . . the breadth, and length, and depth, and height" of things (Eph. 3:17, 18). We can size things up spiritually because added perceptivity actually comes to us when we live righteously. Should it surprise us that behaving leads to further knowing? Could the scripture about particular blessings coming from particular obedience to laws be any more plain?<br><br>Those, however, who "for a while believe" never have these adventures which are reserved for the "true believers of Christ." Those who "almost" believe will never know these joys, for they are far too easily satisfied. Those who believe for a while make only a brief tour in the kingdom, though, thereafter, they often feel qualified to inform those who know even less about the Church; but the fact is they were really only tourists--not natives who really knew the kingdom's countryside.<br><br>The true believers are helped in keeping the basic commandments by gladly performing their specific duties in the kingdom. These duties, brothers and sisters, are usually measurable and straightforward. They include: partaking of the sacrament, receiving the gospel ordinances, attending meetings and the temple, praying , fasting, studying the scriptures, rendering Christian service, attending to all family duties, being involved in missionary work and reactivation, doing genealogical work, paying tithes and offerings, and being temporally prepared. The true believer willing does these things because he sees their clear connection to keeping the commandments. For instance, proper participation in the Lord's welfare program carries with it this significant blessing:<i>"For the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day</i>, . . . I would that ye should<i>impart of your substance to the poor</i>" (Mos. 4:26; italics added).<br><br>These duties are practical and specific expressions of keeping the first two great commandments--the love of God and the love of neighbor. Clearly, we cannot become true believers in Christ merely by keeping the sixth commandment--"Thou shalt not kill."<br><br>Discipleship, therefore, means being drawn by seemingly small and routine duties toward the fulfillment of the two great and most challenging commandments.<br><br>Of the Ten Commandments,<i>as originally given</i>, eight were stated as "thou shalt nots" and two were required affirmations. (See Ex. 20, Deut. 5, but also Lev. 19:18.) Jesus' later statement cast the two great commandments as grand affirmatives (see Matt. 22:34–40). Brothers and sisters, our duties involve implementing ways of keeping the two great commandments because they require us to "do" rather than to merely "abstain." Abstentions do not necessarily move us on to affirmative actions, and our duties constitute the "thou shalts" in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>True enough, the highly developed disciple will have no difficulty translating his devotion to the Savior into loving his neighbor; he will find a hundred quality ways to implement the truths in today's choral hymn, "Love One Another," but most of us need specific steppingstones.<br><br>While we resist being driven by quotas into doing temple work or scolded into achieving convert baptisms, at the same time, reminders are relevant. As we grow and develop, a particular reminder may become necessary--but only "in that thing."<br><br>Moreover, the duty least enjoyed by us, like the doctrine least understood, may be the one we need the most. Furthermore, our reminders to do these specific duties are often a call to an unkept rendezvous, to an experience we would not want to miss. The true believer understands this; he does his duties even though they are seemingly repetitious, but he is never surprised if duty develops into a new adventure.<br><br>Great care must be exercised, however, so that in all of this, we do not pass off our personal preferences as the Lord's program; we must not confuse our personal religious hobbies with His orthodoxy. Nor must we ever pass off a personal obsession as a spiritual impression.<br><br>Because true believers are "meek and lowly of heart," they are ready to be taught things they "never had supposed" as was Moses, the most meek man upon the earth (see Moses 1:7–11; Num. 12:3). Let the intellectually proud pace up and down in their tight conceptual cells if they choose, but the humble find such too confining.<br><br>Two other virtues of the meek are that they are not easily offended and they do not resist counsel. Nor are these lowly in heart inclined to see themselves as being "above" all the seemingly routine duties of discipleship. Duties are not to be rejected on the basis of "I've done all that before," as if God were required to supply us with new thrills. Mortality has been described by the Lord as being like working in a vineyard--never as an afternoon at a carnival. Besides, how could we pretend to be true believers of Christ, if we shunned the chores of the kingdom!<br><br>Furthermore, brothers and sisters, we will find that when we have personal spiritual experience--which keep us close to the Lord--these will almost always occur in the course of our carrying out the specific duties named earlier, since it is not enough for us to have once been close to the Savior. (So was Sidney Rigdon.) Alma said, it we have once "felt to sing the song of redeeming love," can we "feel so now?" (Alma 5:26). Dutiful discipleship creates many happy memories, but it does not make nostalgia a substitute for fresh achievement.<br><br>Instead of having a "woeful countenance," the true believer in Christ has a<i>disciplined enthusiasm</i>to work righteousness. As, week after week, he tries to help people who "droop in sin" (see 2 Ne. 4:28), the electricity of his enthusiasm for righteousness helps to brace and to straighten the sad.<br><br>Becoming a true believer, however, means trusting not only in the Lord's plan for all of mankind but especially trusting in His unfolding and particularized plan for each of us. This means much more than merely acknowledging that God is in charge. Alma's warning that living without God in the world is "contrary to the nature of happiness" (Alma 41:11) was not just for agnostics but also for passive believers. Putting first things first is vital, as these eloquent words of Malcolm Muggeridge attest:<br><br><i>When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about it is that what seemed at the time most significant and seductive, seems now futile and absurd. For instance, success in all of its various guises; being known and being praised, ostensible pleasures, like acquiring money or seducing women, or traveling, going to and fro in the world and up and down in it like Satan, exploring and experiencing whatever Vanity Fair has to offer. In retrospect all these exercises in self-gratification seem pure fantasy, what Pascal called "licking the earth." They are diversions designed to distract in this world, which is, quite simply, to look for God, and, in looking, to find Him, and, having found Him, to love Him, thereby establishing a harmonious relationship with His purposes for His creation.</i>[Thomas Nelson,<i>A Twentieth Century Testimony</i>(New York, 1978)]<br><br>Our fully "harmonious relationship" with God must also reckon, however, with the episode of the young man who told the Savior that he had kept all the commandments from his youth. Jesus then gave him a very customized challenge: to go and sell all that he had, giving the proceeds to the poor and then taking up the cross and following the Savior. Doing so, indicated the Savior to the young man, would take care of the "one thing thou lackest" (Mark 10:21). The good and decent young man went away sorrowing because he could not meet that customized challenge; he was clearly an admirer of Jesus, but not a true believer in Christ. Nor are we, if we shrink from our customized challenges.<br><br>Indeed, would that some of us, like the young man, lacked just one thing. But having a healthy awareness of that which we yet "lack" can be a needed spur. We may have proved, for instance, that we can play checkers, but are we now ready to play chess? Are we willing to let the Lord lead us into further developmental experiences? Or do we shrink back? The things which "greatly enlarge the soul" inevitably involve stretching.<br><br>Tactical tests to help us measure how we are doing in developing the spirituality that characterizes the true believers in Christ might include the following:<br><br>1. The true believer has struck a balance between being too content with himself and being caught up in the equally dangerous human tendency of wishing for an enlarged and more important role. Alma said, "I ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me" (Alma 29:3). Often ignored is the tutoring sixth verse which follows: "Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?" To develop careful contentment by using our existing opportunities is obviously one of our great challenges, particularly so when we seem to be in a "flat" period of life. We may feel underused, underwhelmed, and underappreciated, even as we ironically ignore unused opportunities for service which are all about us.<br><br>2. The true believer has some Jethros in his life to give him needed and sometimes hard counsel.<br><br><i>And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</i><br><br><i>Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou are not able to perform it thyself alone.</i>[Ex. 18:17–18]<br><br>Do we have Jethros who can speak to us with that kind of directness and yet be humbly received by us?<br><br>Furthermore, since a Jethro may be anywhere, do we listen "down" and "sideways" as well as "up"?<br><br><i>And</i>[Naaman's]<i>servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</i>[2 Kings 5:13]<br><br>Naaman, fortunately, decided not to overlook "underlings." Notably, though Naaman expected a dramatic display of healing, he was cleansed by doing a seemingly routine thing.<br><br>3. The true believer has a sense of proportion so that Martha-like anxieties do not crowd out the Mary-like choices.<br><br><i>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things:</i><br><br><i>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</i>[Luke 10:41–42; see also verses 38–40]<br><br>Martha was not the last conscientious Church member who was confused about priorities.<br><br>4. His personal prayers are not the easy, casual petitions--like the one of which the Lord said, "Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7). The true believer's prayers, at least some of the time, are<i>inspired</i>petitions.<br><br><i>But know this, it shall be given you what you shall ask.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 50:30]<br><br><i>He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 46:30]<br><br>The Lord said commandingly to a true believer in another age:<br><br><i>And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee</i>according to thy word,<i>for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.</i>[Hel. 10:5; emphasis added]<br><br>5. The true believer has both right conduct<i>and</i>right reasons for that conduct. He is so secure in his relationship with the Lord that his goodness would continue even if he were not seen of men. He would fill his role in the Church even if there were no mortal taking of the roll:<br><br><i>Take heed that ye do not alms before men,</i>to be seen of them. [<i>Matt. 6:1;</i>emphasis added]<br><br><i>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,</i>and not to please ourselves. [Rom. 15:1; emphasis added]<br><br><i>Not with eyeservice,</i>as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. [Eph. 6:6; emphasis added]<br><br>6. When professionally, associationally, or even in Church service, he may seem to have been "put out to pasture," the true believer can still say of the Lord (and mean it), "He maketh me to lie down in green pasture" (Ps. 23:2).<br><br>7. When he is misrepresented, misquoted, or misused, he still loves and prays sincerely for those who despitefully use him.<br><br>8. When someone seems to surpass him spiritually and does his "thing" even better than he, he genuinely rejoices and gives them heartfelt and sincere praise. He never regards colleagues as competitors.<br><br>9. The true believer remembers that forgetting is a dimension of forgiving. It is Lordlike: "I [will] remember [their sins] no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). He really helps others to get deservingly reclassified, and, like the Lord, does not "mention" their past mistakes to them (Ex. 18:22).<br><br>His generosity reassures the repentant and also beckons the almost-repentant who warily probe the possibility of both fellowship and forgiveness.<br><br>He can, to use Alma's phrase, "give place" for the spiritual growth of others. He is truly ready to receive not only the repentant but to recognize the frail who have, happily, grown strong. He knows that in the City of Zion there will be many "new kids on the block."<br><br>10. The true believer is careful about giving offense or causing others to stumble.<br><br>In writing about the City of Enoch a few years ago a true believer was used to say these things about how shortcomings beget shortcomings:<br><br><i>How often the weakness in one man becomes a temptation to another man! My desire for wealth and gems can cause another man's envy; my temper has at time, dissolved your patience. One man's incontinence destroys what little is left of a righteous woman's resolve. One person's lust becomes another's way to wealth. A man's drunkenness becomes another man's excuse for Sabbath-breaking to enlarge his vineyards.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Of One Heart</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975), p. 28]<br><br>11. The true believer insists that within deprivation there may be opportunity. He can wait for the unfolding of opportunity hidden within tragedy, as did Joseph anciently. When in their later Egyptian rendezvous, Joseph lovingly reassured his anxious brothers, "But as for you, ye thought evil against me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive" (Gen. 50:20). So often, before we can save others, however, we must first be shaped and refined.<br><br>12. The true believer is growing in his patience, including being patient in following the living prophets. He knows that trying to get ahead of the Brethren is a sure way of falling behind.<br><br>13. He is ready to follow the Lord into soul-stretching experiences even if it means enrolling the schooling of suffering and paying his tuition.<br><br>These words from a sobering, sweet letter written to me by a gallant, but modest, student now at BYU attest to a significant spirituality in one so young--one who rejoices in the many blessings he now has without brooding over those that are temporarily withheld from him.<br><br><i>I have now had leukemia diagnosed for fifteen months, although few people even know about it. My goal has been to lead as normal a life as is possible; hence, the subject rarely gets mentioned because most people I have encountered, doctors, included, tend to treat it as a tragedy rather than as an incentive to get one's affairs in order promptly.</i><br><br><i>My parents took the news quite hard, perhaps because my brother died unexpectedly eleven years ago of undiagnosed causes. Most people are pessimistic; however, I have failed to see how pessimism would help me make the best use of my time which is of unknown length, not only for me, but for everyone.</i><br><br><i>Against medical and parental advice, I have since been married and am at BYU and we're expecting a baby in July. I feel great and am truly enjoying the blessings that are coming from being married in the temple, studying the scriptures, working hard in school, and living each day rather than simply waiting to die.</i><br><br><i>Fifteen months ago, my then fiancée and I thought that if I could live long enough for us to be sealed, that would be all we would ask for. Therefore, we consider everything since then as a great gift from the Lord. We still dream and plan for a long family life together, and it gives us a certain comfort to know that our situation is in the Lord's hands and is not bound by man's limitations.</i><br><br>Like Job, this remarkable young man has avoided the usual human tendency when under stress to charge God foolishly (see Job 1:22).<br><br>Along with the attributes already noted in the tests cited, the true believer in Christ may be further characterized.<br><br>He is innocent as to sin, but he is not naïve about worldly things. He is kind but he is candid. He is harmless because he keeps the second commandment. But he is powerful because his righteousness permits him access to the powers of heaven, which cannot be handled in any other way.<br><br>The true believer is serious about the living of his life, but he is of good cheer. His humor is the humor of hope and his mirth is the mirth of modesty--not the hollow laughter or the cutting cleverness of despair. Unlike those of a celebrated "devil-<i>may</i>-care" lifestyle, his is the quiet "heaven-<i>does</i>-care" attitude.<br><br>He understands the difference between ends and means and sees that some Church aids are, in a sense, scaffolding for the soul, which scaffolding one day will be removed--like waterwings or training wheels.<br><br>He is humble enough to "serve tables" but is sensible enough to share his time and talents on the basis of priorities--doing the "things of most worth."<br><br>Like his Master, the true believer loves his life but is willing to lay it down or to see it slip slowly away through affliction. If he is given a "thorn in the flesh," he does not demand to see the rose garden.<br><br>Let the kaleidoscope of life's circumstances be shaken, again and again, and the "true believer of Christ" will still see "with the eye of faith" divine design and purpose in his life.<br><br>There is a quiet regalness about the true believer in Christ, however humble in appearance he may be. Hence, the true believer's light has become more than a little one; however, he is apt to be quite innocent of his growing incandescence. The true believer's "<i>cris de coeur</i>," or "cry of the heart," is heard--not always over tragedy as the world measures tragedy--but when observing the tragedy of sin; for in seeing "things as they really are," he also sees what might have been.<br><br>Being settled in his soul, he has a serenity even in the midst of war and tumult. If he lives, he lives unto the Lord, if he dies, he dies unto the Lord, just as President Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>I say to the brethren who are leaving home . . . when you pray for your families . . . you must feel--if they live, all right; if they die, all right; if I die, all right; if I live, all right; for we are the Lords' and we shall soon meet again.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>6:273]<br><br>The true believer can read the depressing signs of the times without being depressed because he has a particularized and "perfect brightness of hope" (2 Ne. 31:20). He knows that "Christ will lift [us] up" (Mor. 9:25). He does not naively depend on mortal rulers, assemblies, congresses, or parliaments to lift him up, though he is genuinely grateful for any true success by these. Rather, he has the precious perspective of Joseph Smith who observed:<br><br><i>The laws of men may guarantee to a people protection in the honorable pursuits of this life, and the temporal happiness arising from a protection against unjust insults and injuries; and when this is said, all is said, that can be in truth, of the power, extent, and influence of the laws of men, exclusive of the laws of God.</i>[<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1972) p. 50]<br><br>Besides, the true believer knows that in the awful winding-up scenes human deterioration will be finally and decisively and mercifully met by divine intervention. He understands, therefore, that in such conditions the sooner he renounces the world, the sooner he can help to save some souls in it.<br><br>Let us, brothers and sisters, seek to become such true believers in Christ. Let us make our way, righteously and resolutely, notwithstanding our weaknesses, to the beckoning City of God. There, the sole and self-assigned gatekeeper is Jesus Christ. He awaits us at the gate not only to<i>certify</i>us--but because His deep, divine desire brings Him there to<i>welcome</i>us. "He employeth no servant there" (2 Ne. 9:41). If we acknowledge Him now, He will lovingly acknowledge us then.<br><br>May God bless you as a generation with a continuing sense of impending rendezvous with tasks you know not of yet, but for which you must be prepared. I see you, frankly, as a generation further along the path than your parents' generation was at your same age, settling in sooner on the way to becoming "true believers in Christ." I see you as a generation fitted before you came here, measured for the challenge to be given to you, and as adequate for all that you will be asked to do. I plead with you, therefore, with some sense of trembling and awe for you collectively, in anticipation of that which you will be called upon to do. My pleading is that you determine to settle in spiritually--even more so by moving along in the pathway to becoming "true believers in Christ." Then as the heat comes, having been stablished, settled, grounded, and rooted in Christ, you can withstand the heat of the sun when it comes to scorch; you can be of good cheer and lift others up. Such can be your blessings, such are surely your promises, for the fulfillment of which I pray in love as I once again bear my witness to you as to the validity of the work in which we are engaged.<br><br>Nothing else is even in the same solar system of significance. God bless you to keep your rendezvous, to be true believers in Christ, and to be so settled that others can look to you for constancy amid turmoil and for truth amid falsehood. And in the powers of my office I bless you so that you shall be accelerated in this quest and do so, knowing of my accountability for that which I have said to you this day, but knowing also of your accountability for what has been said to you.

<h1> the Light of the Gospel - M. Russell Ballard - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's nice to be with you students once again at Brigham Young University. It is a humbling experience, I'm sure, for all of the Brethren who come here, but I don't suppose any have been more humbled in this assignment than I have as a result of an activity I engaged in yesterday with the Brigham Young University golf team. I had the opportunity, with three of the Brethren, to play golf with your team. I watched as the members of the team hit drive after drive three hundred yards out--always straight down the fairway--while I kept pattering back and forth, in and out of the rough and the sand. Finally, one of the members of the team suggested that the objective was to hit the ball into the little hole in the center of the green, not into the sand that lies by the side. And so I had an experience with humility. That was the longest eighteen holes I have ever played or ever expect to play. And I would suggest to President Holland that anytime anybody on the faculty needs to be brought back to reality, have them play just a few holes with your great golf team.<br><br>We are here to talk about a very important subject, one that requires that I have the help of the Lord so that I can speak the words he would have you hear through me. And I supplicate our Heavenly Father for that blessing. Lately I have been impressed more and more with the importance of the teachings in the scriptures pertaining to our ability to secure light in our lives, and with the difference between walking through life with light, the light of the gospel, and walking through life in darkness.<br><br>There is much said in the scriptures about this great and blessed attribute of having the light of the gospel in our lives. It would seem to me that as you struggle with your education here at this great university, you would benefit greatly from doing those things in your daily lives and in your studies that will increase the light of the gospel in your lives. The Savior made this statement in the book of John: "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness" (John 12:46). Darkness is all about us, my brothers and sisters. As a result of being exposed to the world through assignments to stake conferences and through other assignments, I have an overwhelming concern for the darkness that is in the lives of most of our Father's children.<br><br>Darkness is referred to in the scriptures as the source of evil, with the primary source of darkness being the devil or Satan. He has the power to lead people into darkness, and his every effort is designed to shut them off, if he can, from the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, thus destroying souls by virtue of darkness. The Savior said in the book of John, in the twelfth chapter, "Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light." (Verses 35–36.) That was an admonition given by the Son of God in his early ministry to those who were closely connected with him.<br><br>It is always an awesome thing to me to take your time or the time of any audience because I feel something has to happen in these next few minutes that will cause you to want to be better tomorrow than you've ever been before in your lives. We come together in assemblies like this for a very specific purpose. And the Lord has outlined that purpose in very clear terms in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants. I am going to spend a few minutes in the Doctrine and Covenants with you this morning in the hope that I might be able to teach the importance of this matter of gaining light in our lives. Beginning with verse 74 of section 88 the Lord gave this instruction through his prophet Joseph:<br><br><i>And I give unto you, who are the first laborers in this last kingdom, a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean;</i><br><br><i>That I may testify unto your Father, and your God, and my God, that you are clean from the blood of this wicked generation, that I may fulfill this promise, this great and last promise, which I have made unto you, when I will.</i><br><br><i>Also, I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth. And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</i><br><br><i>Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:74–78]<br><br>We gather together in assemblies like this to sanctify one another, to cleanse one another, so that the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ somehow might penetrate into the core, the very heart, and the depths of our souls, thereby enabling us to walk every day in the light of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>In the eleventh verse of the same section, the Lord states:<br><br><i>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings,</i><br><br><i>Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensities of space--</i><br><br><i>The light which is in all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:11–13]<br><br>I came to an understanding and perhaps a vision of what it means to have the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ as our companion and as our guide as we sojourn here on the earth when I was assigned, prior to my assignment now in the presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy, to supervise missionary work and the other Church work in the southeastern part of the United States. In that capacity I had the great opportunity to meet with missionaries in zone conferences. While sitting on the stand in a zone conference at one time in the Columbia, South Carolina, Mission I noticed a missionary and his companion come in, walk across the back of the hall, and down the aisle. Then I watched as the senior companion, with great empathy and love, gently arranged for the seating of his junior companion. As I watched, I turned to President Ronald Knighton and inquired, "Is that elder blind?" Upon learning that he was, I made a confession to President Knighton when I said, "I didn't know that we sent totally blind young men or women on full-time missions."<br><br>I had a great spiritual experience as I met that young man after the meeting. I don't know whether he recalls or not, but I embraced him and told him how proud I was of him and how sure I was that the Lord was blessing him. This great young man sits on the stand with me at my invitation. He served a glorious mission surrounded by physical darkness, but filled to overflowing with the spirit of the gospel and the light of the Lord. He touched many, many lives. There was no missionary who served in the South Carolina Mission who brought more people into the Church than did this young man. He served as zone leader and finished his mission as the assistant to the president of the mission, despite his blindness.<br><br>I put my arm around him as we walked in this morning and asked him, "Do I have your permission to talk about you for a minute or two?" He embarrassedly gave me that permission. I want to read a statement from a letter I received from one of his companions. I took the time to ask all of this young man's companions what they felt were some of the outstanding things in his life. I quote from one letter:<br><br><i>Elder Crabb always radiates the Spirit of the Lord because of his faithfulness to his testimony of the Lord's Church. Because of this he keeps the commandments, lives the gospel, and loves his fellowmen. I honestly mean it when I say that I have never associated with one who carries the Spirit of the Lord like he does.</i><br><br>Another companion wrote to me:<br><br><i>To show how one who is blind can help those who have their sight to see spiritually, let me recount an experience. We were working in the poorer section of a town without much success. The last family on the street invited us into their home. It was a run-down house with a wooden porch that had a few boards missing from it, hard wooden floors, a pot-bellied stove for warmth, and two bedrooms where a father and mother and five children slept on homemade cots. In general it was a place I had only read about in such novels as</i>Huckleberry Finn<i>by Mark Twain. It was a hot, sultry afternoon, and it was time to head back to our apartment for dinner and then go on exchanges with ward members in the evening. I was thinking more about the coming evening's activities than I was about this family. After all, we had been in dozens of such homes with no apparent success. At the conclusion of the discussion with the family, I was surprised that we were invited back for a visit a few nights later. As my companion and I were walking down the street after we finished our meeting, Elder Crabb indicated how strongly he felt about the family. He said, "Elder Schultz, I think we can baptize that family." Those words stuck with me until our next meeting with the family when I made sure that I was more spiritually in tune than I had been at the first meeting. After one short month, the family was living the Word of Wisdom, paying their tithing, and they were then baptized by myself and confirmed by Elder Crabb.</i><br><br>May I read this from a letter that I received from this good young man who is on the stand with me today.<br><br><i>The following year</i>[he has told me of his history and now comes to his experience on this great campus]<i>found me walking with one hand on my cane handle and the other hand in the Lord's, walking from class to class at BYU. I have learned humility. I have learned that which is going to have to be learned by everyone sooner or later, that no blessing comes without sacrifice. I wish everyone in the Church could spend a year or two blind so they could have the doors opened to them that have been opened to me. And if I had this life to live over, I would never trade the chance of having vision with any of the experiences I have found without it.</i><br><br>My brothers and sisters, you who are blessed with all of your faculties, love the Lord. Get to know Him. Make Him your constant friend and companion. Counsel with Him. I pray that you will be close enough to Him in your quest for your degree here that when you take your diploma and walk into life to establish your own family and your own set of circumstances, you will also take with you the most precious part of your education. It is far more precious, I believe, than anything you will earn in any laboratory or classroom. It is the testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the son of the living God, that He is the source of all light, that by His light we can walk fearlessly with head held high, despite all kinds of obstacles, and enjoy great success.<br><br>Now, with your permission, and with butterflies in Elder Nolan Crabb's stomach, I would like him to come up and bear his testimony to you. He is one of your fellow students. If you have the opportunity to get to know him, take it. I think you will have a spiritual experience just shaking this wonderful young man's hand and feeling his greatness. Nolan, would you come up and address your fellow students.<br><h2><b>Nolan Crabb</b></h2><br>The Lord once counseled the Church, "If ye are prepared, ye shall not fear." Perhaps a Nolan Crabb-revised edition of that scripture might read, "If you can't see the congregation, it's easier to talk." To illustrate very briefly (because this is Elder Ballard's time and the Lord's time and not mine) what the light of the gospel can do, may I share with you just one experience. Upon arriving home from my mission, I was called into the office of a great bishop in Ogden, Utah, where hands were laid upon my head and a very special blessing was given me. Three months later I was walking on this campus. I have been blessed by our Father in Heaven to such a degree that I have been able to learn, I would say, 95 or 98 percent of it. The mobility instructor who taught me the campus did not show me where the girls' dorms are (I guess that is fortunate for some of you, particularly for my wife, who sits behind me here today), but I would say 98 percent of the campus is within my grasp thanks to the light of the gospel.<br><br>On one occasion when I was in a hurry to get to class, a good brother whom I know well came along and said, "I'll take you with me." As we were running along--wouldn't you know it--he took a short cut I had never been through before, one of the two-percent areas; and then he stopped in the middle and said, "I've got to take off to my class now, but you can make it; it's really easy." I said, "I wish I had as much faith in me as you do," and I proceeded to move. It was like being flown over to Tokyo, dropped out of the plane, and told, "Walk to the temple site." I thought, "Right. How?" But I began to move, and as I did so I began to talk to the Lord. With the full power of my spirit I said, "Now, Father, the nearest person is about three hundred feet away, and this is BYU, where you don't ruin your reputation by hollering, 'Hey, come and help.'" People would think I was some kind of a freak, and I couldn't afford that, so I said, "You're the only one who can hear me at this point. Can you please get me out of this jam? I'm not exactly sure where I am." As I began to move again, I began to hear a voice as clearly as I speak to you that said "turn left here" or "go right" or "stay straight." I also felt a hand on my shoulder, and so real was that force and feeling that I turned around to see who was back there. I did not see anyone, obviously, but more significantly, I did not hear any footsteps either, nor did anyone speak. Within two minutes, brethren and sisters, I heard the sound of a familiar landmark. (The blind find their way by sound here at BYU. Hollywood counts steps in those movies about the blind, but can you imagine doing that on this campus? "Three thousand two hundred and forty-one, three thousand two hundred and forty-two"--we would go crazy. That would not work at all here; we have to use sounds and landmarks.) At any rate, when I heard that sound I knew where I was, and I was able to turn and enter the building where my class was.<br><br>As I did so, there were tears in my eyes because I heard another voice, and I thought, "My goodness, what's my bishop doing down here?" Well, it wasn't him. It was his voice, but he wasn't here on campus that morning; I was merely hearing his voice as it was recalled from memory by the Spirit, repeating what he had said three months earlier in that blessing after my mission: "I bless you that in your time of trial the angels of God will come and encamp round about you. And though they will be unseen, they will serve as your guide lights, as your beacons, and as your friends to guide you in areas throughout this earth wherein you need their help." That guidance comes physically as well as spiritually.<br><br>I know that Christ lives. I thank God for great parents and for a family who gave me that knowledge early. I know that He lives. I testify to you that revelation is real. Jesus is the Christ, and He lives. I know it, for on one sacred occasion I heard the voice of the Spirit declare it to me. And though I saw no great visions of glory at that time, surely I know as I stand here that He lives. I share that witness with you with all the power of my being, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2><b>Elder Ballard</b></h2><br>Thank you, Nolan. Your story shows how we can walk through this life, really learning to know our Heavenly Father and really learning to know the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now where is it that we are trying to walk, young people? Where are we trying to get? When all is said and done, why do we have devotionals, why do we have Brigham Young University, why do we have stakes, why do we have wards, why do we have missions? Why do we have a Church? We have them for only one purpose, when all is said and done, and God has stated what that purpose is: "This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). We seek to qualify someday to walk into his sacred presence. We seek to have our lives sanctified, purified, and cleansed to the point where we can be found worthy to walk into the presence of our heavenly parents and Jesus Christ, our Savior and our Redeemer.<br><br>I don't believe there is any question that your primary objective is to reach the highest degree of the celestial kingdom. But it seems to me that if we really want that blessing, we ought to familiarize ourselves very carefully with the commandments of the gospel; we ought to understand what the road map is; we ought to know it so well that we, like Nolan, can be led by the Lord's Spirit so that we will be able to continue toward the celestial kingdom.<br><br>May God bless you and me that we might ever be sensitive, that our antennas will always be up, that we will realize when we are walking in the wrong direction, that we will sense when the light of the gospel is being forced out by the darkness of the evil one. Sin, of course, is the best means the devil has of placing a blanket of darkness over us, and when we are doing anything that is less than perfect, that is unworthy of the celestial kingdom, we do not feel as comfortable and as warm inside as we should. Have you noticed that? I do not suppose there is anyone here who is perfect, who has walked this far through life without making some mistakes. And I do not suppose any of us, especially you younger members, are through making mistakes; indeed, some of us will continue to make mistakes as we sojourn through life. But let us hope that we make little mistakes and not big ones. And if we do make mistakes, let us hope that we have the good judgment and sensitivity to realize that the Lord loves us so much and wants us back in his sacred presence so much that he has provided repentance. He has provided ways for us to correct and adjust our course and to get back on the right path that will lead us into his sacred presence.<br><br>Oh, my brothers and sisters, as I understand the celestial kingdom and what it is going to be like, I see that being there would be worth anything. I have had a glimpse of that through my grandfather Melvin J. Ballard, who was a personal friend of the Lord Jesus Christ like unto Nephi of old. He knew Him. He had been embraced by Him. He had fallen at His feet and wept tears of joy in His presence. I have read his testimony of that experience with the Lord many, many, many times, and witness has been borne to my soul that my grandfather was in very deed a close personal friend of the Savior of this world. And my grandfather has testified that if we had any idea what a feeling it is to be with Him we would give all we have or ever hope to have to qualify to walk into His sacred presence.<br><br>I would ask our Heavenly Father to bless you through all the burdens of midterms, through all of the pressures that are placed upon you, through all the problems you missionaries are having in learning the discussions, or through whatever else is troubling you. Do not lose sight of your glorious objective. As far as I can tell, everyone who sits here still has the possibility of qualifying to walk into His sacred presence. But this will only occur when we have developed and built into our being the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the light of the Lord, so strongly that we radiate it and that it will purge from us all darkness.<br><br>The scriptures tell us that when we become candidates for the celestial kingdom and are invited to go into that sacred glorious place to live through the eternities, our bodies and our spirits will be quickened and we will be filled with light. The Prophet Joseph Smith provided an insight into what it must be like to become celestial when he wrote, "I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--<i>This is My Beloved Son."</i>(Joseph Smith 2:17.) Further on in his testimony, he wrote:<br><br><i>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.</i><br><br><i>He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. . . .</i><br><br><i>Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him I was afraid; but the fear soon left me.</i>[Joseph Smith 2:30–31, 32]<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters and fellow members of the Church, we seek to become worthy of that glorious blessing through sanctification and purification and service and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, walking every day in His light. Now may His peace be in your lives. May peace come into your hearts. May you feel at peace and be comfortable in your relationship with the Savior. May you missionaries carry into the world the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for I testify to you in the name of Jesus Christ that when you realize fully that you are indeed his ambassadors, that you<i>do</i>speak for him, you will have experiences when the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of the Lord will speak through you. And by that Spirit, lives will change, and you will put forth the hand of fellowship and lead many of our Father's children out of darkness and into the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. May each one of us take every opportunity we can to stretch forth that hand to lead our Father's children safely back into His presence.<br><br>I would like to leave my blessing with you. I know that President Kimball would have me leave his blessing. He is far off in Japan, preparing to dedicate a temple so that the full light of the gospel with all of its glorious ordinances, blessings, and endowments might be shed upon our Father's children in that part of the world. We bless you that in your quest for education you will never lose sight of the fact that seeking the educated Spirit filled with light is your most important quest. May this blessing be yours and mine for now and for always, I pray humbly in the sacred and beloved name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>M.

<h1>oncepts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As I pondered what I should discuss with you tonight, I asked myself the question, "If I were you sitting where you are, and you were me standing where I am, what would I like to have you talk about?" I concluded that I would like you to talk about a principle that you understand now that you did not understand (but wish you had) when you were a student. That thought has prompted my subject this evening.<br><br>Years ago, Dr. Asael Woodruff, who at the time was the dean of the College of Education here at BYU, addressed the Sunday School General Board on the subject of concepts.<br><br>He told us about Johnny, who when born into the world had no concepts. Johnny walked down the street and it was raining. Someone said, "Johnny, this is rain." And thus, Johnny learned his first primary concept.<br><br>Soon the rain turned to sleet. Johnny was told, "This is sleet," and thus, he learned his second primary concept. Following that, Johnny experienced blizzard, wind, cold, heat, clouds, sun, and other meteorological phenomena, each of which for him was a new primary concept. Then he was told, "Now Johnny, you put all these things together and you have weather." This was Johnny's first secondary concept. As Johnny grew in understanding, secondary concepts were combined to form higher concepts. His intelligence grew as his ability increased to put lower concepts together to form higher and higher concepts.<br><br>Until our family moved a few weeks ago, we had a neighbor who has become an expert at putting concepts together to form higher and higher concepts. You have probably heard of him. His name is Dr. Henry Eyring. He is considered by many to be the world's greatest physical chemist. He has received at least fifteen honorary degrees from universities throughout the world, and likely he has received more because he doesn't always tell his secretary when he is so honored, and she does the counting.<br><br>In addition, he has received twenty-eight distinguished honorary awards and medals. One of the most recent was the Wolf Award from the Israeli government, which is more coveted than the Nobel Prize because the selection is from a broader field and is made by an international body, which is considered to be more objective. Dr. Eyring has written more than six hundred scientific papers, which is ten times the number written by many distinguished scientists. His ability to produce meaningful papers is staggering.<br><br>Incidentally, he has consistently fulfilled his home teaching assignments each month over the years. When I was the high priests group leader in his ward, I held a home teaching report interview with him each month. I would schedule appointments on Sunday at twenty-minute intervals. One Sunday I scheduled an appointment at four o'clock with one of the high priests. He didn't show and later explained that his family had dropped in and he couldn't get away. At twenty after four, Dr. Eyring arrived to keep his scheduled appointment. We knelt in prayer before the report and then discussed each family without any extraneous conversation. We completed the report in fifteen minutes, and Dr. Eyring promptly said, "Will you please excuse me? I have four renowned scientists from Paris, France, waiting in my front room. They have come from France to visit with me, and I really shouldn't keep them waiting any longer than is necessary." That is the kind of man he is--great in the sight of man and great in the sight of God.<br><br>Intelligence is the ability to use knowledge effectively. To say that in another way, intelligence is the ability to put established concepts together and formulate higher concepts. Dr. Eyring has mastered the art of doing so in a most effective way, which has resulted in his making important contributions not only to basic research, but to applied research in various fields of endeavor for the benefit of mankind.<br><br>Did you ever realize that it is not men who rule the world, but it is concepts that rule the world. For example, let's take a look at the great American patriot, Benjamin Franklin. Mr. Franklin developed the concept of establishing a nation predicated upon the freedom of the individual. Freedom of the individual was not a new concept, but to establish a nation predicated upon and committed to the freedom of the individual was. Ben Franklin convinced Thomas Jefferson and John Adams of the merit of the concept. They convinced the Continental Congress to adopt it, and they used it in writing the Constitution of the United States.<br><br>That concept outlived old Ben Franklin, and even today, two hundred years later, it is revolutionizing the world. It cost the British nation her colonial empire, but, with greatness in their veins, her people say, "Nevertheless, it was the right thing to do."<br><br>Several years ago, a Russian ship drew alongside a ship from the United States. A Russian soldier jumped aboard the U.S. ship and requested political asylum. The captain of the U.S. ship returned the sailor to the Russians. When the incident was reported in the United States, many of our leaders became irate because the United States captain had not upheld the concept of the freedom of the individual that is so deeply ingrained in our way of life.<br><br>One of the most effective ways to discern the intent of a person is to determine what concepts he espouses. Last October I received a telephone call from a former Utahn who is the administrative assistant to Chief Justice Burger of the United States Supreme Court. He said he had been assigned to host the chairman of the chief justices of the Soviet Union during a visit to the United States. He asked if arrangements could be made for Chairman Smirnov to tour the Church's Genealogical Library. You already know of his visit to this area. His first stop in Utah was here at BYU. He saw the well-mannered and well-groomed students with beaming faces and clear eyes, and he was impressed. I understand he spoke to you in this building, and, among other things, said, "You see, we are not monsters. We are humans."<br><br>That evening he toured the prison at the Point of the Mountain. It was family night. Families from nearby communities are assigned to prisoners whom they visit regularly so that each prisoner can share the love of family life. The program has been so successful that the number who return to prison after their release is but a fraction of what it was before the program began. When Chairman Smirnov saw the children of the families run to the prisoners and give them a loving embrace, he thought it was staged for his benefit.<br><br>The next morning I met Chairman Smirnov in front of the Church Office Building. I asked what his reaction was to his visit at the prison. I soon found that he was the chief architect for the Soviet penal system. He gave a rather lengthy response, during which he said, "The family is weak, but the government is powerful." Concept number one!<br><br>Chairman Smirnov was an interesting person. Wherever he went he was the center of attention. He had a magnetic personality and a brilliant and well-disciplined mind. He was well informed and had the earmarks of one who had earned his high position.<br><br>We toured the Genealogical Library. As we were leaving he complimented us on its excellence. We responded that it was unfortunate we didn't have names from the Soviet Union in the Library. "No reason you can't get them," he said. We asked him if he would talk with the chief archivist of the Soviet Union. He was most agreeable.<br><br>The following day he was being hosted by a renowned family in Illinois. A friend of mine was in the group. Chairman Smirnov said to him, "If I had my way [and remember he had been to the BYU campus], I would force every man, woman, and child in the Soviet Union to become a Mormon [concept number two]--even at gunpoint [concept number three]."<br><br>Quite frankly, Mr. Smirnov, we're not so concerned about whether you look like a monster or a human, whether your nose is crooked or straight, or how you cut or part your hair. But we are sincerely interested in what concepts you espouse.<br><br>* Do you espouse the concept of freedom of choice, or do you espouse the concept of force?<br><br>* Do you espouse the concept of government for the people, or people for the government?<br><br>* Do you espouse the concept of integrity, or do you believe that the end justifies the means?<br><br>* Do you espouse the concept of freedom of the individual, or the concept of enslavement?<br><br>* Do you espouse the concept of free agency, or do you seek to control the minds of men?<br><br>* Do you espouse the concept of a God-fearing society, or do you espouse the concept of a godless society?<br><br>You can usually determine how a man will react in a given situation if you know what concepts he supports.<br><br>One of the most difficult problems any government faces today is the temporal welfare of its people. In 1954, Sister Derrick and I attended the Second International Conference of Manufacturers in Paris, France. The effects of World War II were still evident in Germany, where some of us toured for ten days, meeting with industrial and government leaders.<br><br>We then met in Paris for three days and were joined by those who had toured other nations. A paper was drawn up, representing the conclusions of the conference.<br><br>I remember well two conclusions in particular: (1) Governments have the responsibility to create a climate in which business can prosper, thus creating job opportunities so that people can feed themselves. (2) Governments cannot assume the responsibility for the temporal welfare of the people.<br><br>This is a concept that has not been accepted by the Western nations, and the result has been a major contributing factor to the current economic problems we face today.<br><br>In 1964, Dr. Daryl Chase, who at the time was the president of the Utah State University, and I were invited by the State Department to go to Bolivia to establish a relationship between the people of Bolivia and the people of Utah. We arrived in La Paz, Bolivia, on 1 March 1964. A C-47 plane was made available to us, piloted by President Paz Estenssoro's personal pilot. We flew to various cities and were escorted in a van to the nearby villages on the Altiplano. After three weeks we returned home and began wondering what we could do to establish a meaningful program. We had many requests from the people of Bolivia for help. The problem was that they all wanted something for nothing, which we could not support.<br><br>Dr. Chase assigned his responsibility in the program to Dr. B. Austin Haws. Dr. Haws and I sat down one afternoon and established the criteria upon which the program should operate. We adapted the concepts of Church welfare for the Utah-Bolivia Partner's Program. For example, the program should operate both ways. We would learn from them, and they would learn from us. We would do nothing for them that they could and should do for themselves. We would do nothing that would tend to weaken character; we would not support a program that would develop dependency, but rather we would support those programs that result in self-sufficiency.<br><br>Dr. Chase arranged for Dr. Matthews, from the College of Southern Utah at Cedar City, to go to Bolivia under the USAID Program. He found that people were not shearing their sheep. He found that they were using them as status symbols and were making yarn only from the wool caught by barbed wire fences or plucked from the animal's backs. He taught them how they could shear their sheep and still have their sheep--something they never supposed could be done. He held sheep-shearing contests throughout Bolivia, which resulted in the shearing concept being quickly adopted. We raised $1,500 and sent it to Dr. Matthews. He purchased prize sheep in Peru, brought them to Bolivia, and traded the 4-H Clubs' prize rams for the poor ones--first one for one, then one for two, until he was trading one prize ram for four poor rams, at which time the trading became a self-sustaining concept.<br><br>We organized committees and sent our educational committee chairman to Bolivia to establish a school building program in the villages of Bolivia where the children had never before had the opportunity for an education. The minister of education agreed to furnish a school teacher for every classroom that was constructed under the program. The people of the villages did everything they could for themselves: they dug the foundations, baked adobe brick, poured the concrete foundations, laid the brick, and then stuccoed the walls. School children from Utah furnished funds to purchase the timbers and aluminum for the roofs and the wood for the doors and window frames. When the schools were completed, they contained from one to four rooms. They were attractive and of typical Spanish architecture.<br><br>One day I was invited to the McMillan Elementary School on 53rd South and 3rd East in Salt Lake City. I was advised that over a six-month period the students had gathered old newspapers, magazines, pop bottles, and rags to raise funds for the school building program. When I walked into the room there were five hundred students in the auditorium from five to twelve years of age. Every eye was riveted on me. They had worked for six months--and they had a real stake in this program. A short Bolivian skit was presented. Then they invited me to the podium and handed me a check for $1,101.01 to complete a school in Bolivia. As I looked into the faces of those children, I couldn't hold back the tears, nor could I speak a single word. It was truly an emotional experience.<br><br>One day I was invited to the American Fork Junior High School. As Kay Allen and I entered the auditorium, the A Cappella choir began to sing the song," Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me. Let there be peace on earth, the peace that was meant to be." A short program ensued, and we were invited to the podium. A check for $1,425 was presented to us to complete a high school in a Bolivian village. The students had earned the money by promoting a variety of projects. We thanked them. The student body then arose and with gusto sang again, "Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me. Let there be peace on earth, the peace that was meant to be." I thought I felt the timbers shake as they sang. Instead of those students spending their time creating problems for the community, they were spending their time helping their nation improve its foreign relations.<br><br>Last year, Sister Derrick and I visited Bolivia and participated in the dedication of the ninety-ninth school built under this program. This is but one example of the many programs that were instituted, all of which were consistent with the concepts of the Church welfare program. The success that came following these concepts resulted in the Utah program being an example for other states, and today that national program is the most successful self-help program in America.<br><br>The Lord knows all. He knows the pitfalls of unsound concepts. He also knows the results of sound concepts properly implemented.<br><br>We are advised to have a year's supply of food in our homes. Can you imagine the tremendous storage capacity we would have as a nation if every family in America were to follow that counsel? We could store in times of plenty, and we could consume in times of shortage, thus minimizing the problems created by supply and demand variations. Working together we could meet our needs in case of famine and shortages, problems with which other lands of the world are much more familiar than we are.<br><br>In 1974 there was an oil embargo. In Great Britain they depend on ocean transport for food. The grocery shelves were quickly emptied. Margaret Thatcher, who is not prime minister of England, announced that she was prepared because she had food storage in her home. She was immediately criticized publicly because there was a law on the books against the hoarding of food. Can you see the fallacy in the concepts of men and the wisdom in the concepts of God?<br><br>The concept of the welfare system, which holds each of us responsible, first, for our own welfare; second, for the welfare of our family; and third, for the welfare of our neighbors, removes the waste, inefficiency, greed, and selfishness that plague our government welfare programs. The concept within the program of developing self-sufficiency builds self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-discipline, which puts us in the people-building business in a meaningful way.<br><br>If higher concepts are formed from and built upon unsound concepts, the pyramid has a weak foundation and will crumble. When it crumbles, it takes with it all the concepts it has supported, and the fall thereof can be great. The welfare program of our nation is based upon unsound concepts, which today are threatening us with economic disaster.<br><br>In the year of 1820, when the Prophet Joseph Smith received his first vision, the world believed that God was a spirit that filled the universe. Joseph Smith saw God, the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, and they were personages of flesh and bones. He saw that they had eyes to see, ears to hear, and voices to speak. They were not deaf, dumb, and blind as the world at that time imagined God to be. They spoke to Joseph in intelligent conversation. This is the same concept of God that the Bible teaches. In the book of Genesis we read, "And God said, let us make man in<i>our</i>image, after<i>our</i>likeness. ... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him." (Gen. 1:26–27; emphasis added.)<br><br>Following the Savior's crucifixion, he was resurrected and showed "himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God" (Acts 1:3).<br><br>Man could not have been created in the image and likeness of God unless God has a body as we have. If Jesus Christ arose from the grave with a body and was seen for forty days thereafter with a body, isn't that a witness of his true nature?<br><br>This brings us to another point in our discussion of concepts. The Savior said, "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). How can we know the only true God when we have the wrong concept of what he is and what he looks like? Yet our eternal life is dependent upon our knowing him.<br><br>There is a very special concept the Lord has given us that all Latter-day Saint students should understand. It will improve your grades and bring you self-assurance as you come to understand and apply it. (Now you should be interested in that, shouldn't you?) It is found in section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 36. The Lord said, "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth."<br><br>The concept that the glory of God is intelligence is an important contribution that Joseph Smith made to the theology of the world. But there is much more; intelligence is light and truth. We might write a formula from that statement. Truth plus light equals intelligence, or T + L = I.<br><br>The Lord said, "Truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24).<br><br>He also said,<br><br><i>I am the true</i>light<i>and</i>lighteth<i>every man that cometh into the world.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:2; emphasis added]<br><br><i>And the</i>light<i>which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who</i>enlighteneth<i>your eyes, which is the same</i>light<i>that quickeneth your understandings;</i><br><br><i>Which</i>light<i>proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:11–12; emphasis added]<br><br>And then he speaks of the reward for obedience:<br><br><i>And no man receiveth a fullness unless he keepeth his commandments.</i><br><br><i>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth</i>truth<i>and</i>light<i>, until he is glorified in</i>truth<i>and knoweth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:27–28; emphasis added]<br><br><i>For he will give unto you the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:12]<i>here a little, and there a little.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 128:21]<br><br><i>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with</i>light<i>, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with</i>light<i>comprehendeth all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:67; emphasis added]<br><br>And then the Lord said,<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Now I want to demonstrate to you one of the greatest concepts of all. Perhaps I could get one of you young men to help me. Will you [pointing to a young man on the first row] please come forward? What is your name?<br><br>"David Larson."<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this is David Larson. David, will you please read Genesis, chapter 1, verse 26, to the congregation?<br><br>"'And God said ...'"<br><br>Who said?<br><br>"God said."<br><br>That's a pretty good source of information, isn't it?<br><br>"Sure is. 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.'"<br><br>In whose image?<br><br>"In God's image."<br><br>In God's image. Now read verse 27, will you please?<br><br>"'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.'"<br><br>"So God created man in his own image." Now you learned in elementary mathematics that if A = B, then B = A. Do you understand that?<br><br>"I think so."<br><br>Or in other words, if I said to you that ten pennies is equal to a dime, then I could say that a dime is equal to ten pennies, couldn't I?<br><br>"Sure could."<br><br>Now, if you were created in the image of God, that means you look like whom?<br><br>"Like God."<br><br>Like God. Now applying our little formula, if you look like God, who does God look like?<br><br>"Like me."<br><br>Now, I want you to stand over there where everyone can see you. Brethren and sisters, here is God's greatest creation. I want you to look at him closely. Do you notice that he has hair that grows. Isn't that remarkable? Barbers have been trying to accomplish that for centuries and have never yet succeeded. He has eyes that see; he has ears that hear. Isn't that remarkable? He has teeth that chew and a face that smiles, I think. Yes, he has. And he has hands that clasp and arms that hold--to which his girlfriend can attest. He has legs that walk, a heart that beats, and a nervous system that is the most delicate thing that has ever been created. And he has a brain that thinks. Man has created many marvelous things, but never has he created anything as marvelous as what you see before you. God has withheld for himself the miracle of creating life.<br><br>Now, David, will you come back here by the microphone? I want to ask you some questions. How many temples do we have operating throughout the world? We won't count Tokyo because that comes the week after next. If I name them, you count them, will you?<br><br>"Sure will."<br><br>New Zealand; Hawaii; Oakland; Los Angeles; Mesa; St. George; Manti; Provo; Ogden; Salt Lake; Idaho Falls; Logan; Alberta, Canada; Washington, D.C.; London, England; Bern, Switzerland; and Brazil. Seattle isn't operating yet. How many do we have?<br><br>"Seventeen."<br><br>Seventeen, you say. Do we have any more?<br><br>"Those are the ones you counted."<br><br>David, what does it say on the front of the temple here in Provo?<br><br>"I'm not sure."<br><br>It says "Holiness to the Lord." And then it says something else. It says "House of the Lord." If I pass by where you live and said, this is David's house, one would conclude that this is where you live, would he not? David, will you please read D&amp;amp;C 97:15–17?<br><br>"'And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it; yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come unto it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God. But if it be defiled I will not come into it, and my glory shall not be there; for I will not come into unholy temples.'"<br><br>Now, do you believe what the Lord says?<br><br>"Yes, I do."<br><br>Do you believe what the prophets of God say?<br><br>"I do."<br><br>Do you believe what the Apostle Paul says?<br><br>"Yes, I do."<br><br>Then I want you to read what he says in First Corinthians, chapter 3, verse 16.<br><br>"'Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?'"<br><br>Now what do we mean by the Spirit of God? Let's turn over there to the same author; he tells us what he means, starting with this verse:<br><br>"'Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you?'" (1 Cor. 6:19).<br><br>How many temples are there, David?<br><br>"Many."<br><br>Yes. Countless. So, the Spirit of God of which Paul speaks is the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost dwells within us. Now, will you please read chapter 3, verse 17?<br><br>"'If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.'" (1 Cor. 3:17).<br><br>"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." Now what do we mean when we say "defile the temple of God"?<br><br>"Do anything that would disgrace."<br><br>Yes. Now, may I say it in my own words?<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>By taking things into our body that we should not take in; doing things with our bodies that we shouldn't do; thinking thoughts we shouldn't think; and speaking words we shouldn't speak, we defile our bodies. Did it ever occur to you that there is no other way to sin? What does Paul mean when he says, "him shall God destroy." It means his body will no longer be a temple of God. It means that when we defile our body, the Holy Ghost leaves our body and our body is no longer a temple of God--until we cleanse and purify it.<br><br>When the Holy Ghost leaves our bodies, ofttimes he leaves the door ajar--leaving it open for strange spirits to enter. Did you ever wonder why some people are so cantankerous? It's the spirit within them.<br><br>Thank you so much, David.<br><br>Now let me mention a few more important concepts briefly. We have the concept of the Word of Wisdom. The Lord gave it to Joseph Smith 150 years ago. Now after all this time of abuse and ridicule, many periodicals today contain articles on the adverse effects that Word of Wisdom don'ts have on our bodies.<br><br>We have the concept of tithing. The Lord says concerning the payment of tithes, "And prove me now herewith, ... if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it." (Mal. 3:10).<br><br>Do you believe what the Lord says? He further said, "I the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10).<br><br>I noticed an article in the editorial portion of the<i>Church News</i>that illustrates another conflict between concepts of man and concepts of God. A mother and her five children went grocery shopping. Pushing their cart from aisle to aisle, they all took part, apparently having a good time doing the shopping. Some wanted to buy one thing, others something else, but the list was in mother's hands, and she kept everything under control. But a disturbed bystander looked disdainfully at the children and then assailed the mother with an intense verbal onslaught. "What right do you have in this enlightened day to have so many children? Don't you know that a family should be limited to no more than two? What do you mean having so many children?" The mother, of course, was amazed, to say the least. She had no desire to debate with this angry stranger, so, turning away, she entered another aisle and left her assailant behind. But the incident started her on a serious line of thought. What if she had limited her family to two children? She looked at her two eldest. They were a boy and a girl. She was deeply grateful for them, but what of the other three? There were Susan and Jerry, the twins. As she looked at them and contemplated their short five years in the family, her youngest child, Jenny, took hold of her hand. Jenny was the most affectionate of them all. If she were to do it all over again, knowing the children as she did, which of them would she have preferred to do without? The thought horrified her. Had she stopped with only two children, Jeanine, her loving little one, now but three years old, would never have graced their home. And neither would Jerry, a boy--every inch of him--and a good one. How could she ever think of being without Susan? There was a complete bond of love and fellowship among those children. They made a happy family circle. Then she thought of her husband and herself completing that circle. Would they wish to change it or reduce it if they could?<br><br>A good family is the highest expression of human life, more to be desired than riches or prestige or anything else the world has to offer. And why? Because it is the Lord's way. And did not the Psalmist say, "The Lord is righteous in all his ways"? (Ps. 145:17). But this bystander who assailed the little group in the grocery store, what of her point of view? It was man's way and reflected the philosophy of zero growth, completely contrary to the Lord's way. No wonder Isaiah, speaking under inspiration, said, "Neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord" (Isa. 55:8).<br><br>So there are the two philosophies--the Lord's and man's. We have a choice. Which way shall we go? True Christians are under covenant to serve the Lord. Those covenants provide that we shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. (See D&amp;amp;C 84:44.) His divine word provides that we shall enter honorable marriages, that we shall have children, that we shall rear them in faith and make every effort to save their souls. We are to conduct our family life in harmony with the gospel plan. We bring the commandments and the true gospel spirit into our homes, living them and doing to each other as we would be done to. When we live the gospel in the home, we exclude the contentions that arise in some families as well as selfishness, cruelty, wrongful indulgence, and vulgarity. And as we live the gospel we bring into our homes the influence of the Holy Ghost as well as love, harmony, patience, consideration, and true worship that helps us to become like our Father in Heaven. Living the Christlike life within our home makes for the highest level of human existence. (See<i>Church News</i>, 13 Sept. 1980, p.20.)<br><br>Elder Marvin J. Ashton recently said concerning the payment of tithing and living gospel principles:<br><br><i>How long has it been since you reflected upon the fact that active members of the Church do not have to pay for christenings; sacraments; baptisms; temple attendance; confessions; weddings; funerals; prostitution; mistresses; evilly-inspired magazines, books, tapes, and records; abortions; alimony; tobacco; beer; wine; champagne; drugs; tea; coffee; hard liquors of all kinds; court costs for defending misconduct; X-rated movies; and so on?</i>[Unpublished address delivered to General Authorities]<br><br>The Lord gave us a concept that is a very simple statement of conduct. It contains but three words: "Keep my commandments."<br><br>"If you love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15)<br><br>If we keep his commandments, we accept and promote his concept and build on a solid foundation.<br><br><i>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.</i><br><br><i>And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</i>[Matt. 7:24-27]<br><br><i>For if ye keep my commandments you shall receive of his fullness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace [until you receive a fullness].</i>[D&amp;amp;C 93:20]<br><br>The concepts of men are too often made of sand. The concepts of God are eternal and everlasting. The pyramid of concepts upon which you build your life should be as the house that is built upon the rock that can withstand the rains, floods, and winds.<br><br>Have you heard the story of the wise old philosopher? One day a young man wanted to match his wits with a wise old philosopher. He said, "I'll take a bird in my hands and ask the old man if the bird is dead or alive. If he says the bird is dead, I'll open my hands and the bird will fly away. If he says the bird is alive, I will squeeze my hands together and crush it to death."<br><br>And so he went to the top of the mountain where the wise old philosopher lived. "Old man," he said, "I hold a bird in my hands. Tell me, is it alive or is it dead?" And for a long moment the wise old philosopher looked deep into the eyes of the young man and then said, "That, my son, is up to you." And so it was. And so it is with you and me, it is up to us whether we build our lives on the concepts of men, or whether we build our lives on the concepts of God.<br><br>That our pyramid of concepts may be built on a rock with Jesus Christ as the chief cornerstone, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Royden G.

<h1>a Proclamation - J. Thomas Fyans - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I was so delighted with that beautiful music. Someone has suggested that music washes away the dust of everyday living. And we have surely been cleansed by your sharing of your talents with us today. Thank you very, very much.<br><br>I have had a long association with your president, President Holland, and I admire, love, respect, and sustain him with all my heart. I am thrilled, with you, that he is directing this university.<br><br>There is one slight question I should like to raise, however. There seems to be a problem of role identification on the part of part of your athletic program, President Holland. It is this: it appears as though the football team is passing and scoring as though they were the basketball team. Now this won't be too serious unless the basketball team plays and scores as if they were the football team. Well, role definition is so important, and that's what I'd like to talk about today: our roles in life.<br><br>Because of some very special kindnesses of President Holland and his sweetheart, Pat, when you were celebrating your Homecoming, I caught a deeper feeling of what you really are. I thrilled with you in watching the "Spectacular." The magnificence of the music, the adroitness of the dance, the cleverness of the presentation lifted us as we contemplated your painstaking efforts of rehearsing, practicing, timing, perfecting, repeating, and changing.<br><br>What lessons are learned by those who participate in the giving of one's self completely, in cooperation with others, to attain a harmonious presentation that would gladden the observer. This is the process of building character. It is true whether on the playing field of the stadium, or on the baseball diamond, or when wearing the blue and white on the basketball floor, or when inspiring audiences around the world as ambassadors of this great university.<br><br>The challenges and problems of today are a schooling for tomorrow. Finding solutions to these problems prepares you for the future. Being true to the little things of today will prepare you to be true to the big things of tomorrow. Power comes from adversity.<br><br>What are some of the growth opportunities that you face today? Are you having roommate problems? Is your roommate staying out too late? (Of course, it would be your roommate who is doing this and not you.) Do you have to work long hours so that you can afford to stay in school? Do you have some dating situations that are particularly challenging? (The missionaries do, of course.) How you handle these situations is what you are.<br><br>Today you cope with the circumstances here on campus. Tomorrow you will experience the challenges of the world. You have a certain environment here at Brigham Young University. What will be the environment as you move from this campus?<br><br>James A. Michener, in looking at the decade of the 80s, makes this insightful observation:<br><br><i>We should witness some fantastic developments, quite in line with men walking on the moon. Imaginative men well-versed in scientific capabilities will be able to spell out the wonders we shall see in medicine, space, invention of new devices, and creation of new substances.</i><br><br><i>At the same time men and women will see with increasing clarity that the more science produces, the more humanity requires moral guidance, and this cannot come from science. It can come only from minds trained in the appreciation of the previous history of mankind, his struggles to achieve an orderly society, his constant seeking to attain a just world. The real frontier in the next decade will lie in the fields of moral judgment.</i><br><br><i>As for the individual, I see even more leisure time, even more emphasis on travel and sport, even more years of prolonged health. I foresee a pattern on which 70 percent of our people learn principally from television, with only 30 percent learning from books. But I judge that, whereas our presidents and senators may come from the charismatic 70 percent, the basic work of the world--the designing of aircraft, the building of a good sewer system, the editing of newspapers, the running of a good church--will still be done by those men and women who have been trained in books and who know something of the traditions of mankind.</i>[<i>Parade Magazine</i>]<br><br>In these words, titled "Our Unfinished World," we receive an interesting insight into the challenges that face us.<br><br><i>God gave us a world unfinished, so that we might share in the joys and satisfactions of creation.</i><br><br><i>He left oil in the ground. He left electricity in the clouds. He left the rivers unbridged and the mountains untrailed. He left forests unfilled and cities unbuilt. He left the laboratories unopened. He left diamonds uncut. He gave us the challenge of raw materials, not the satisfaction of perfect, finished things. He left the music unsung and the dramas unplayed. He left the poetry undreamed, in order that men and women might not become bored, but engage in stimulating, exciting, creative activities that keep them thinking, working, experimenting, and experiencing all the joys and durable satisfactions of achievement.</i>[By Allen A. Stockdale]<br><br>Life is a journey. Part of that life was lived before we came to mortality, another part will be lived after we leave mortality. Now, that we won't look beyond the mark, let's consider what is at hand--mortal life. A journey assumes moving to a destination. We would set a course; and if we were excited about this event in our lives, we would share it with anyone who would listen.<br><br>We proclaim those things about which we have some pride. Really we<i>proclaim</i>what<i>we are</i>.<br><br>The Church in this Sesquicentennial year has issued a proclamation. What is a proclamation? To proclaim is to "make known by announcing in a public place--to publish abroad," according to Webster. So a proclamation is the act of proclaiming--an official proclamation. A proclamation consists of words--important words. The kingdom of God consists of deeds and people.<i>You are the Church</i>--as you<i>are</i>, the Church<i>is</i>.<br><br>What is the content of the proclamation issued by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve on 6 April of this year?<br><br>First, the opening statement deals with the growth of the Church. From six members who participated in the formal organization procedures, this stone, cut out of the mountain without hands to roll forth until it will fill the earth, has grown to nearly four and one-half million members. Let's look at the growth pattern.<br><br>At the end of the first 50 years, there were 160,000 members of the Church. During the second 50 years there were 512,000 added to the rolls of the Church. Three times as many members joined the Church in the second 50-year period as in the first 50 years. In the third 50 years, 3,766,552 came into the fold--almost seven times as many came in the third fifty years as in the second 50 years.<br><br>It is anticipated that the Church will increase in membership by approximately one million in the next three years. This three-year growth is nearly equal to the total population of the church in 1947. Another way of stating this is that in the next three years, we will grow almost as much as we did in the first 117 years. The major growth of the Church will occur in your lifetime.<br><br>Church statistics really are not just figures. They are people. They are you. They are the person to your right, the one to your left, the one in front of you, the one behind you. You are an important part of that growth of the past, but you also have in your hands and hearts the future heights of growth to be attained. You will be instrumental in arriving at the ten-million mark. You will lift this kingdom to the fifty-million level and beyond.<br><br>Let your creative imagination and contribution determine the heights to which the kingdom will have arrived when you have been laid to rest. This is the kingdom of God upon the earth.<br><br>Let's look at some other elements in this proclamation to the world. It contains also a witness that the Father and the Son appeared to the boy prophet, Joseph Smith. We all thrill when we vicariously walk into the Sacred Grove and feel the magnificence of this occasion.<br><br>And third, this proclamation bears testimony that the power, authority, and organization of the Church of Jesus Christ relating to apostles and prophets have been restored.<br><br>Fourth, it declares that the Book of Mormon was brought forth by the gift and power of God and that it stands beside the Bible as another witness of Jesus the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. Together these books of scripture, the Bible and the Book of Mormon, testify of his divine sonship.<br><br>Fifth, it gives a witness that the doctrines and practices of the Church can provide salvation and exaltation not only for those who are living but also for the dead, and that in sacred temples built for this purpose a great vicarious work is going forward in behalf of those who have died.<br><br>Sixth, it affirms that the family is a divine creation and that the most sacred of all relationships--husbands and wives, parents and children--may continue eternally.<br><br>Seventh, it bears witness that our lives here on earth are part of an eternal plan--that death is not the end but rather a transition.<br><br>Eighth, it testifies that the spirit of prophecy and revelation is among us; that the heavens are not sealed; that god continues to speak through a prophet.<br><br>Ninth, it declares that the mission of the Church is to act in<i>authority</i>and teach the gospel of Christ to all the world.<br><br>Tenth, it announces our responsibility to espouse and follow an inspired program of instruction.<br><br>Eleventh, it calls upon all men and women to work together to build a brotherhood in which we can know that God is our Father, that we are His children, and that we will worship Him and His Son.<br><br>And finally, in the authority of the holy priesthood, seekers of truth in all the world are extended a blessing. This proclamation can't come to pass without you.<br><br>You are a proclamation. What kind of a proclamation will you be? Look deeply inside your soul, and don't be satisfied by superficial evidence. May I illustrate this with a story.<br><br>There were four people in a compartment of a passenger train. As you know, such compartments have seats that face each other. In this compartment there was a very beautiful young woman (I could point out many examples of that here today), a young woman just in the prime of life. Beside her was seated a middle-aged woman, one who was just about to go over the hill (and as I look around I see no examples of that). Opposite them was seated an army sergeant, and you could tell from all the ribbons he had on him that he had been on the battlefields of the world. He had also been on other battlefields; here was a man of the world in ever sense. And beside him was seated a meek little army private who looked as though he had just left Provo the week before.<br><br>As the train went on its journey, suddenly that compartment turned pitch black. The train passed through a tunnel, and someone had forgotten to turn on the lights. In the silence of that darkness, this is what was heard (kissing sound and slap of the hand). When the train came out of the tunnel and there was light in the compartment, this was the evidence: there was the clear imprint of a hand on the face of the army sergeant. The middle-aged woman thought, "Well, it serves him right for taking advantage of that pretty young girl in the dark." The pretty young girl thought, "Hmmm, how come he kissed her rather than me?" The army sergeant thought, "Well, he got the kiss and I got the slap." Only one person there had all the facts. You see, what had really happened was that the private had kissed the back of his hand and slapped the sergeant.<br><br>Now I suggest to you: don't look at superficial evidence. Look inside yourself deeply. Put your life and its roots deep into spiritual soil. You'll find many circumstances in life where at first glance it will seem as if the circumstances are one way, but as you get down to the facts, you will find that the facts are somewhat different than they had appeared. The truths of the scriptures are the base upon which you must plan.<br><br>As I look at you, I have a feeling of belonging because a thread of brotherhood and sisterhood binds us together. Will you allow me the privilege of sharing a very personal experience with you that took place prior to my being honored with the invitation to join the ranks of the General Authorities?<br><br>In business, I was with an organization that represented some very large international business machine manufacturers. One of these very large international corporations invited me to represent the distributors of their products in the western part of the United States, to go east periodically at their expense, and to review and evaluate their advertising and sales promotion program.<br><br>At the end of one of these meetings, the top sales executive invited me to go to dinner with him one evening and said he was going to invite some others as well. We went to the restaurant. We were seated, and he had me to his right. Soon the waitress came to pick up our drink orders. I said I'd have nothing, and he put a lot of pressure on me that night. He said, "Look, you've been in two days of long, arduous meetings; now relax, have some fun." I said, "I'll take a 7-Up." The waitress went around the table picking up the orders of the others, all of whom ordered intoxicating liquors, until she came back to the host. He said he'd have a 7-Up.<br><br>I had known that man for a number of years. Whenever I had walked into the hospitality room of his organization, always, without any comment, I had been given an orange juice or a 7-Up, and I wondered why he had applied the pressure that night.<br><br>I returned to Salt Lake City. A couple of weeks passed, and a telephone call came from my friend in the East. He said, "I'm coming out West and I'd like to visit with you if you'll be in town."<br><br>I said, "Yes, I'll be in town."<br><br>He came and brought his wife. After a period of time, he said, "Tom, I want to tell you now why I'm really here. I'd like to offer you an executive position with our organization. In fact, I'd like you to be my assistant."<br><br>I was highly complimented, and after we had talked about the content of the offer he said, "Now take a couple of weeks and think it through carefully if you'd like."<br><br>Just as he was ready to leave, I said, "Do you remember the dinner back east you invited me to the last night of our meetings?"<br><br>He said, "Yes."<br><br>I said, "Tell me, if you will, why you applied such pressure on me to take an intoxicating drink."<br><br>He smiled and said, "Tom, we are trying to build into the top echelons of our organization men of integrity, men who will not buckle under pressure. We would like to have men who think that spending Saturday night in their family rooms reading the<i>National Geographic</i>is exciting, rather than being out carousing in all the places where they ought not to be."<br><br>Helen and I considered carefully this offer, which was such a compliment to us, but we decided not to accept it. I called back east and told them of my decision and was told, "Well, that won't change our relationship. We want it to continue in a very cordial way." And I thanked them for that consideration. That was chapter one.<br><br>Chapter two: A year passed. Another invitation came to go east to attend that same meeting, which we did. As soon as we had checked into our hotel and gone to our room, we heard the telephone ringing. I went in, and it was the operator. She said, "Mr. Fyans, there is a party in Salt Lake who has been trying to get in touch with you for some time. They would like to make an appointment call. Will you be in your room at 2:00 this afternoon?"<br><br>It was then about 12:00. I said, "Yes. But by the way, operator, who is calling?", thinking it would be someone, of course, from our business organization in Salt Lake.<br><br>She said, "It's a Mr. Moyle."<br><br>Helen and I asked each other, "What Mr. Moyle do we know?" The only one we could think of was President Henry D. Moyle of the First Presidency, but we knew he surely wouldn't be calling us.<br><br>At 2:00 the telephone rang, and, much to our surprise, it was President Moyle. He asked us if we'd leave almost immediately and go to Uruguay to preside over a mission. We said, "We'll do whatever the Brethren ask."<br><br>A short time later another telephone call came, this one also from Salt Lake. It happened to be from the president of the organization with which I was associated. He said, "Tom, did you get a telephone call from Salt Lake in the last little while?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, sir."<br><br>He said, "What did you tell them?"<br><br>"Well, I told them what you would have told them."<br><br>"Well then you'd better return to Salt Lake immediately because we'll have to do some major reorganizing prior to your departure."<br><br>I hung up that telephone and then thought, "Now, I'm back here in the East at the invitation and expense of this large international organization. What do I do?" So I called the company and told them I had an emergency that necessitated my returning to Salt Lake City immediately. "In fact," I said, 'I'll be unable to continue coming east to these annual meetings" and explained that I would be going to South America. They said, "We don't understand. A year ago we offered you a very important business opportunity, and you decided you wouldn't bring your family to the East. You thought about it for two weeks. Now you get a telephone call, asking you to move halfway around the world, and you immediately respond. We don't understand. Actually, we do understand. Please get in touch with us upon your return."<br><br>Well now, what has been suggested in these few moments this morning? One thing, at least in part, is a role definition. Today you live in a particular and unusual environment here on campus. It includes football, basketball, Homecoming, the Spectacular, and the Young Ambassadors. There are the challenging, energy-draining studies that occupy so much of your time, and the everyday things that you do as you attend this great university. All of this is a learning and preparing experience.<br><br>Tomorrow, as you move into the world, you will experience a somewhat different environment, and you can have a distinct influence on this newly-encountered condition as you journey through life. You see, after all, we proclaim what we are. You, as a vital influencer, will carry the spirit of proclamation with you wherever you go. Bear it courageously, bear it effectively, because your proclamation will have eternal consequences for you and for all those who are warmed by the glow of the gospel as it radiates from your soul to theirs.<br><br>Remember, you are the Church. As you are, the Church is. And in the final analysis, you recognize that whatever principle of intelligence you attain unto in this life, it will rise with you in the resurrection. (See D&amp;amp;C 130:18.)<br><br>I bear you my witness that Jesus is the Christ. This is his church. This is the kingdom of God upon the earth. You have been and will be a great influence as you proclaim what you really are. There is a prophet of God in the world today. I witness that to you in all humility and with every fiber of my being. And I leave a blessing with you that you will be actuated to build solidly on firm spiritual ground, that you will proclaim what you are and thereby bring to pass what the Lord has already seen--the establishment of his kingdom in all the earth. And I pray for this humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>J.

<br>
<br>
I greet each one of you individually and feel proud to think that you would have enough interest to come here to this devotional and listen to the oldest living General Authority of the Church. I have outlived them all by many years.<br><br>I enjoyed the opening prayer, the beautiful music of the choir, the introduction given by your wonderful president, and your presence here this morning. What a beautiful day. What a glorious opportunity to be able to meet and worship in the name of the Lord, our God.<br><br>I have talked here so many times, I've almost run out of subjects. In trying to decide what I might say to you today that would be appropriate, I was reminded that next week we will celebrate Thanksgiving Day all over this great land of freedom and liberty in which we are privileged to live. And I thought of the words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph contained in the Doctrine and Covenants where the Lord said that "against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 52:21). If we stop to think about it, there isn't one thing that we have in this world that we are not indebted to the Lord for. He created the earth and placed everything upon it--the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, the animals, the trees, the flowers, the fruit, the vegetables, the seeds with power to reproduce themselves. And then he created man and put him upon the earth and gave him dominion over it all. Isn't that wonderful? And then he enabled man and the animals and those other forms of life to reproduce themselves.<br><br>I like the first chapter of John in the New Testament, which reads like this:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i><br><br><i>All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men . . .</i><br><br><i>Which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</i><br><br><i>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</i>[John 1:1, 3–4, 9, 14]<br><br>After God had created man and everything in the world, he showed his love for the world by sending his Only Begotten Son to atone for the sins of the world and to bring about the resurrection of the dead, and by restoring the everlasting gospel to this earth after centuries of darkness. The gospel gives us a pattern to live by and teaches us where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. If we understand the answers to these three questions, then life really has meaning for us.<br><br>We are indebted to the Lord, and I trust that as we approach Thanksgiving Day, we will make it more than a day of recreation and pleasure by reflecting on what we owe the Lord for the blessings that are ours.<br><br>While I was president of the mission in Atlanta, Georgia, one of our citizens, a Dr. Fisher, built a beautiful rose garden that covered acres. He opened it to the public without any charge, and there were mottoes hanging on the trees. One of the mottoes was a verse called "A Packet of Seeds"; and I liked it, so I copied it and memorized it. It goes like this:<br><br><i>I paid a dime for a packet of seeds</i><br><br><i>And the clerk tossed them out with a flip.</i><br><br><i>"We have them assorted for every man's needs,"</i><br><br><i>He said with a smile on his lips.</i><br><br><i>"Pansies and poppies, asters and peas,</i><br><br><i>Ten cents a packet, now pick as you please."</i><br><br><i>Now seeds are just dimes to the man in the store,</i><br><br><i>And the dimes are the things that he needs.</i><br><br><i>And I have been to purchase them in seasons before</i><br><br><i>And have thought of them merely as seeds.</i><br><br><i>But as I purchased this package this time it occurred to me,</i><br><br><i>"You have purchased a miracle here for a dime.</i><br><br><i>You have a dime's worth of mystery, destiny, fate.</i><br><br><i>You've a dime's worth of something no man can</i><br><br><i>create.</i><br><br><i>In this bright little package, isn't it odd,</i><br><br><i>You've a dime's worth of something known only to</i><br><br><i>God."</i><br><br>You should realize that despite all the scientific knowledge in the world, even after the landing of the astronauts on the moon, the scientists can't make a seed and put in it the germ of life so that when it's put in the soil it will grow and have branches and leaves and flowers that are colored and perfumed, or that give you a fruit or a seed to reproduce itself. Think about it as you hold that little seed in your hand and realize the power that it has. No wonder the Lord said that "against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hands in all things" (D&amp;amp;C 59:21). And as we approach Thanksgiving Day, I'm sure our thoughts all turn back to our Pilgrim fathers who came to this land of America. They probably didn't name their first celebration "Thanksgiving Day"; that came, I think, in the time of George Washington. But they did have their feast day, and they did engage in prayer.<br><br>I had the privilege of filling a couple of missions in Holland, which is where the Pilgrims went when they left England, seeking a place where they could worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. I preached in the little city of Leiden where they had lived. And I've been in the little church at Delft's Hoven outside of Rotterdam where the Pilgrims held their last meeting before setting sail for America. We met there with nearly a hundred missionaries when President Grant was president of the European mission, and he sang "The Flag Without a Stain." I will never forget that. It was wonderful to be in that place from which the Pilgrims left in the<i>Speedwell</i>. When they went to England they transferred onto the<i>Mayflower</i>and sailed across the Atlantic and landed on Plymouth Rock, which is another place I've been. And that country around Plymouth Rock is so stony I wonder how they could ever eke out an existence. I remember seeing a rock in front of one home that was so large it filled the whole front lot. But there were 122 of them who endured the first winter; 51 died; and 4 families were wiped out entirely.<br><br>You remember the little story about Miles Standish who sent John Alden to Priscilla Mullins to propose marriage for him; and Priscilla listened to John Alden and said, "John, why don't you speak for yourself?" Now I am proud to tell you that on my mother's side I'm a descendant of John Alden and Priscilla who landed with the<i>Mayflower</i>on Plymouth Rock. I've a little grandson sitting down there who is a descendant too. (He doesn't know it, but now I've told him.)<br><br>Now, did they have the spirit of thanksgiving when they found themselves here in this land where they could start all over again? Let me just read you a few words: "They had landed at last on a frozen shore, bleak and dread. But they were so glad that as they knelt in prayer the very stones seemed warm and the snowflakes on their cheeks melted into tears of gratitude." Did they not have the spirit of thanksgiving when they landed here in America? The account then says, "Oh call it holy ground, the soil where first they stood. They have left unstained what there they found, freedom to worship God." That is what they have bequeathed to us, and I think Thanksgiving is a good time to recall what they did to open the way for this great nation to come forth.<br><br>The Book of Mormon tells us that America is a land of promise, a land choice above all other lands. Nephi said that whosoever should possess it must serve the God of the land or they would be swept off. And we have read in the Book of Mormon of the nations that have been swept off because they ceased to worship the God who had led them and their forefathers here to this land. We have a great responsibility as citizens in this land, for the Lord said that he would fight its battles and be its king, if we will just serve him. So it's appropriate at this time that we express our appreciation for this great land.<br><br>I like the words Moses used when he gave a blessing to the twelve tribes of Israel. When he blessed Joseph he promised him a new land in the utmost bowels of the everlasting hills (see Deut. 33:15). Now that isn't in Jerusalem because they don't have everlasting hills over there, and the prophets have never predicted a regathering of all nations to the land of Israel. But they have predicted the gathering of Israel to this land of America, which is the land of Joseph. And we are the only people in the world who know what that land is that Moses promised to Joseph. It was so great in his eyes as he received the revelations of the Holy Spirit that in describing the land he used the word "precious" five times in just four verses.<br><br>My daughter, who is sitting here with me, has been reading a book that one of your professors, Eugene England, just wrote on the life of Brigham Young. You will be impressed if you follow what the pioneers went through and learn of the courage that they had. Talk about miracles. Think how they left their lovely homes in Nauvoo and that beautiful temple for which they had sacrificed so much to head into a wilderness with no one at the other end of the journey to provide for them and no storage houses. When you consider what they suffered crossing the plains as they settled here in these valleys of the mountains, it is no wonder that the prophet Jeremiah said that the day would come when it should no longer be said, "The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; But, the Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them" (Jeremiah 16:14–15). He also saw the day when the Lord should call for many fishers and many hunters who would fish them and hunt them from the hills and the mountains and the holes in the rocks. (see Jeremiah 16:16.) This refers to that great army of Mormon missionaries who travel all over the world, gathering the descendants of Israel. And then the Lord, through Jeremiah, said that he would bring them one of a city and two of a family to Zion and would give them pastors after his own heart who would find them with knowledge and understanding.<br><br>We have so much to be grateful for. We are not here by chance. We are here because of the sacrifices of our pioneer fathers who came to this choice land that the Lord, according to the Book of Mormon, had hidden away from the eyes of the world that it should not be overrun. He preserved it for us, for the day and time in which we now live here in these valleys of the mountains.<br><br>Just after the last World War, Brother Walter Stover, who worked on our welfare committee, and with whom I've filled many assignments, presided over one of the German missions where our people were nearly starved to death. We sent welfare supplies to them. Later he was called to talk in one of our general conferences. As he stood up and reminisced about the conditions he had left behind in that land, he thanked God for this land of freedom and liberty in which he was privileged to live. He said, "I don't even object to paying my high taxes." We do a lot of grumbling sometimes. But if we'd stop, in the words of the song, and count our many blessings, we wouldn't be too concerned about the little dark clouds that arise occasionally, knowing that the God of heaven is watching over this land. He has decreed that upon this land shall be established the New Jerusalem, and he will come to his people here. And so we have a lot to be grateful for.<br><br>I want to read you a little statement that appeared in the<i>Los Angeles Times,</i>regarding the great achievements of this Church in settling here in these valleys of the mountains. "Just as the Saints once made the desert bloom through honeybee-like enterprise, so they have made their Church into the biggest, richest, strongest faith ever born on United States soil. It has grown fourfold since World War II to four million members, including one million outside of the United States." The pioneers came where there was no one to welcome them and built the Church that is now growing so rapidly.<br><br>I am on the committee for the approval of new stakes of Zion. When I became the Presiding Bishop in 1938, we had 126 stakes in the entire Church. This year already we have approved over 130 new stakes. The work is rolling forth. We are lengthening our stride, as President Kimball has admonished us, and we are sending out more and more missionaries all the time.<br><br>And then I think of a statement made by President Wilford Woodruff in general conference--I think it was in 1898--when he told about the time when he first met the Prophet Joseph Smith and a group of brethren who were bearing testimony. After they were through, the Prophet Joseph said, "I have been very much interested and edified in your testimonies here tonight. But you know no more about the future destiny of this people than a babe upon its mother's lap. We're only a handful of Priesthood here tonight [compare that group to our last general priesthood meeting that was broadcast to over 2,200 different stations], but this Church will fill North and South America. It will fill the world, it will fill the Rocky Mountains and there will be tens of thousands go to the Rocky Mountains and they will open the door for the gospel to be preached unto the Lamanites."<br><br>We can see the fulfillment of that prophecy as we watch the many stakes of Zion being organized in Mexico and South America. There is one temple there, another being built in Mexico, and another approved to be built in Chile. Truly the prophecy of the Prophet Joseph is being fulfilled, and we are becoming a mighty people.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord tells us that he has blessed us with commandments not a few. Some people don't like commandments; they want to do what they want to do. They're like a stream of water without anything to guide it; it just runs wild. That's the way some people like to live. But the Lord said he has blessed us with commandments not a few. And I like that because as I study the holy scriptures I find that wherever the Lord has given us a commandment he has also promised us a blessing we can obtain by obeying the commandment he gives. For instance, in the book of Malachi the Lord said:<br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith . . . if I will not open you the windows of heaven,and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i><br><br><i>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field. . . .</i><br><br><i>And all nations shall call you blessed.</i>[Mal. 3:10–12]<br><br>That's where we usually stop. But you will find a lot more in that chapter if you will read it. I'll put it in my own words: The people began arguing among themselves, saying, "Well, look at John over there. He's not a member of the Church, and he has more land and herds and stocks and bonds than any of us. And here's Brother Smith; he pays his tithing and fast offerings and helps to build meeting houses and sends his boys on missions and helps with the welfare program, and look what a time he is having getting along financially." The Lord listens to that kind of argument. We've listened to it. And I've found that the ones who complain about tithing are the ones who don't pay it. The men who pay their tithing don't complain. Now what did the Lord say he'd do about it? He caused that a book of remembrance should be written before him, and in that book should be recorded the names of those who serve the Lord. And I think he was referring to those who obey the law of tithing, among other things. Then he said, "They shall be mine . . . in that day when I make up my jewels . . . . Then shall ye return, and discern between . . . him that serveth God and him that serveth him not." (Mal. 3:17–18.)<br><br>When I was the Presiding Bishop of the Church and we had the award program for the boys of the Aaronic Priesthood and for the girls in that age group, we required them to be full tithe payers in order to get their awards. We weren't thinking of increasing the money in the coffers of the Church; we wanted every boy and girl in Israel to have his or her name recorded in that book of remembrance to be numbered among the Lord's jewels when he should come and claim them. If you have faith, is it any job to pay your tithes and offerings?<br><br>I always liked the little story President Grant used to tell about a woman who taught a Sunday School class. She took ten big red apples to Sunday School class and said to the students, "If I were willing to give you all of these apples, you'd be willing to give one back, wouldn't you?" They all agreed that they would. And I can still hear President Grant say, "But we have some Latter-day Saints who wouldn't give theirs back until they had taken a few big bites out of it."<br><br>Do we believe it when the Lord invites us to "turn unto me and I will turn unto you"? I shouldn't tell you this, I guess, but one good brother in Salt Lake has, four times now, brought me a check for $2,500. This is money out of his business that he turns in in addition to his tithing. He said he does it because he wants the Lord to be on his side. The Lord said to his prophet of old, "Gather my Saints unto me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."<br><br>Now let us talk for just a minute about the Word of Wisdom. A lot of people fuss about it and do not like us to preach about it, but think of the promises the Lord made to those who will observe and keep the Word of Wisdom. They are promised that they "shall walk and not faint," that the destroying angel should pass them by and not slay them as he did the children of Israel, and that they "shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures" (D&amp;amp;C 89:19–21). That promise is worth more than money.<br><br>I think of my experience through the years, traveling through the various missions where we've had youth firesides. I'm going to refer to one that was held in Carthage, Illinois, where the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum were martyred. We held a fireside there on Sunday morning. We had it in the biggest chapel on the university campus. There were about 1,500 young people there; some of them had traveled for over a thousand miles to be there at that youth conference and to attend that fireside. We had a couple of benches down in front kept vacant for the young people who wanted to bear their testimonies. We met from eight in the morning until twelve noon, and there was not a minute's time lost. When one young person was nearly through bearing testimony, another would be standing right there by that microphone ready to take over. And there those young people who were gathered from all over the area, thousands of miles, would stand with tears in their voices and tears in their eyes bearing their testimonies, thanking God for the Mormon missionaries who had come to their homes and brought the gospel. I said to myself, "Talk about hidden knowledge; what more could you ask than that?"<br><br>I have a lot of rich friends and I enjoy them. Through them I can enjoy some of the comforts of life without having to pay for them. But I have never seen a tear of joy fall from the eyes of any of my rich friends because of anything they could buy with their money. However, I will tell you I've sat through many a meeting where tears of joy flowed from the eyes of those who were touched by the influence and power of the Spirit of the Lord. That's why we're worshiping here today--that we might feel that Spirit.<br><br>In closing, I'd like to read you something to show you what the reward is for this missionary work. This is a testimony I've copied from a letter that came from an airplane captain who had studied for the ministry and who then decided to be a pilot. We brought him into the Church, though, while we were grounded for a couple of hours. And this is from his letter:<br><br><i>The happiness I have experienced in my heart and soul since joining the Church is indescribable. I feel that meeting I had with you and President Kimball</i>[but President Kimball didn't do any of the preaching; I did all the preaching]<i>really set things in motion for me. Prior to that I had just been spinning my wheels and searching. Now I know that through the discovery of the restored truth of our Lord, my life has meaning and direction. I want to work for him and do his will.</i><br><br>Now let me read you one more testimony from a good woman who wrote in for information about the Church and who was sent a copy of<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>. When she first wrote, she said, "Will you please inform me about your church, its aims and objectives. If your church is what I have been seeking for fifty-three years and never found in any church organization, I might be able to contribute. I am not a curiosity-seeking person nor a habitual joiner." Then after reading the book she wrote this: "I find your Church interesting. It quickens within me a feeling--what shall I call it--like a beautiful song I had known long, long ago but had forgotten." She described her feelings after having joined the Church: "I now have a serenity and composure and inner strength and inward joy which I never before possessed."<br><br>I could read you some more, but now it's time to close. Brothers and sisters, it is no wonder I like the name<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>. Now remember that we don't have anything for which we're not indebted to the Lord. With all my heart and soul I thank him for my membership in this Church, for the holy priesthood that I bear, for every opportunity of service that I've enjoyed in my life, for the love and confidence of the Saints of God throughout this world. I pray that God will bless each one of you. And as you approach your Thanksgiving next week, may you realize what you owe the Lord, I pray, and leave you my blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richards was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 18 November 1980.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>or the Things that Count - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is with a sense of thanksgiving that I acknowledge the privilege of being a part of this great university. I feel deeply that all of us associated with BYU--as students, as faculty, as staff, and as administrators--are blessed with special privileges, and those privileges carry with them special responsibilities.<br><br>May I share with you a privilege I enjoyed late last Saturday afternoon. Far more impressive than anything I observed in a very impressive football game between BYU and the University of Utah was the scene I witnessed in the happy postgame locker room. Now, I have enjoyed the sense of victory and championship in many locker rooms before; and while this occasion was typical in many respects, it took on a different appearance as these champions knelt in prayer, led by their own coach LaVell Edwards. The act of praying after the game was not so unique; many teams do this. What was unique was the spirit that was felt and the humble words that Coach Edwards uttered:<br><br><i>We are thankful, Lord, for the love, admiration, and respect we have for each other, for the association we enjoy, and for the dedication and efforts of the coaches and players. We are thankful that there were no serious injuries to either team and that we performed to the level of our capability and preparation. We thank thee, Father, for the privilege of representing thee and our great university. May we always remember who we are and who we represent that our lives and our performance will be consistent with thy will.</i>[And then he added, almost as an afterthought:]<i>And we are thankful for this championship.</i><br><br>As I contemplate this Thanksgiving week I add this experience to my list of things for which I am thankful.<br><br>Speaking of Thanksgiving, I am reminded, as we all should be, that Thanksgiving Day, as such,<br><br><i>Began with that little band of Pilgrims who in 1621 expressed their thanks to God in a great harvest feast. History tells us that of the 102 immigrants who landed on the bleak, rocky coast of Cape Cod, nearly half died before their first winter was over. In December, 6 died; in January, 8 more passed away; in February, 17; in March, 13; a total of 44 in four months.</i><br><br><i>Today in our comfortable homes surrounded with plenty it is well for us to pause and remember with deep appreciation the sufferings of the survivors. One account tells us that most of these brave people were not used to hardships; among them were delicately nurtured and elite men and women, who during that first year built more caskets for the dead than homes for the living. Notwithstanding all their trials and hardships, these brave founders of a great and glorious nation had so much to be thankful for that they had to appoint "an especial day on which to give thanks," thanks to God for all of his mercies and blessings to them,</i>thanks to God for things that count. [Earl Nightingale; emphasis added]<br><br>There are obviously many things that count for which we should express thanks, but I would like to focus on thanks for three things that count:<br><br>*Thanks for our friends<br>*Thanks for our freedoms<br>*Thanks for our families<br><br>I was blessed with a marvelous friend through the years of my youth. His example saved me in many precarious moments. Just ten years ago an untimely and tragic airplane accident snuffed out this dynamic and productive life. A short time ago I was thrilled by the visit of his handsome young returned-missionary son, who had traveled many miles to ask me to write a chapter for the biography of his father. What a joy that task was--to tell his family, among other things, that my greatest wish for them was that they find friends possessing the qualities their father had possessed and that they strive to be that kind of a friend to those with whom they associated.<br><br>What is a friend? Someone has said:<br><br><i>A friend is a source of celebration when you feel there is nothing to celebrate.</i><br><i>A friend is simply one who answers when you call, and who often answers before you call.</i><br><i>A friend is one who makes your grief less painful, your adversity more bearable.</i><br><i>A friend is one who makes your disappointments less hurtful, your problems more solvable.</i><br><i>A true friend is an earthly treasure whom God lends you to help prepare your eyes, heart, mind and soul for the glories He has prepared for you.</i><br><i>A friend is one with whom you are comfortable, to whom you are loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are grateful.</i><br><i>A friend is one who warms you by his/her presence, trusts you with his/her secrets, and remembers you in his/her prayers.</i>[Anonymous]<br><br>Thanks for our friends.<br><br>We enjoy many freedoms in this life, but one for which we should be especially thankful is our freedom to learn. How effectively are we using this great privilege? A prominent educator and businessman in this state wrote a letter to his mother when he was a university student in 1922. He said:<br><br><i>I often wonder how I will reach the heights of which I dream, but I always reach the same conclusion. That is: the extent of my ultimate success will depend on my successes in each one of my classes every day; it will depend on how hard I study every night, and on how I appreciate my religion. In other words,</i>my success in the future will depend in proportion to my success in the present.<br><br>Richard Ballantine, the founder of our Sunday School, wrote the following to his son and daughter who were away from home attending a university:<br><br><i>In conclusion let me express the hope that in the midst of your intellectual pursuits you will both remember to cultivate towards God, our Heavenly Father, that true piety of habit and deportment which should pre-eminently distinguish the children of Zion and which will give to your characters a grace, a beauty which mere literary culture can never impart.</i>[21 January 1871]<br><br>How well we learn counts so very much.<br><br><i>"At a given instant, everything the surgeon knows suddenly becomes important to the solution of the problem. You can't do it an hour later or tomorrow. Nor can you go to the library to look it up. In other words, shallow education is not enough.</i><br><br><i>"School isn't a time simply for acquiring credits or surviving certain subjects, but is a time for acquiring knowledge and character and competence that can be counted on and called upon as needed.</i><br><br><i>"In many ways we put our lives, our health, our solvency, our safety, our very survival in the hands of other people, and we have to be assured that they have the required knowledge, the character, and the</i>competence.<i>" (Sunshine Magazine) This is one reason why cheating is so hazardous, and why shallow, shoddy learning--the spirit of just getting by--is so altogether unacceptable</i>. [Earl Nightengale]<br><br>Thanks for our freedoms--particularly our freedom to learn.<br><br>The scriptures tell us of the importance of our families. The Savior said,<br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do; for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</i><br><br><i>For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth; and he will shew him greater works than these.</i>[John 5:19–20]<br><br>He also said: "I speak that which I have seen with my father, and ye do that which ye had seen with your Father" (John 8:38).<br><br>I was blessed with exemplary parents who both showed and led the way. My journal entry on 11 May 1980--Mother's Day--records my impression of some lessons for life taught me by my mother:<br><br><i>Selflessness is a mark of greatness.</i><br><i>Complainers gain little sympathy.</i><br><i>Creative hobbies enrich the life of the creator and the observer.</i><br><i>Others' feelings deserve genuine concern.</i><br><i>Time wasted is time lost.</i><br><i>Doing things for and with your family will never be a sacrifice.</i><br><i>Interest in people brings life's richest rewards.</i><br><br>On 15 June 1980--Father's Day--I recorded a similar entry regarding my father:<br><br><i>Superior performance will be noted and rewarded.</i><br><i>Personal example will be followed, whether good or bad.</i><br><i>Anticipation of the next task greatly increases effectiveness.</i><br><i>Effective fathers are available, approachable, and affectionate.</i><br><i>Busy lives must take time for family and fun.</i><br><i>Love for the gospel is essential to the good life.</i><br><i>A mission brings strength and eternal joy.</i><br><br>A lovely woman came upon a little boy, hungry and shivering in the cold. Her motherly instincts prompted her to take the child in and warm and feed him. After the shivers had stopped and the boy had eaten, he looked up appreciatively at the woman and said, "Are you Heavenly Father's wife?" The question penetrated her soul and rendered her nearly speechless, but then in inspiration a thought came and she answered, "No, I'm not his wife, but I am his daughter."<br><br>I am blessed with a wife who is a true daughter of God, who learned well in both her heavenly home and her earthly home the lessons for life that are now exemplified in our home and family. We just recently added the sixth child to our family. I attended my wife in the delivery room as a loving witness to the miracle of this great partnership with God.<br><br>I thank the Lord this day and every day for my family.<br><br>You have all heard the often-quoted truth expressed by Harold B. Lee: "The most important part of the Lord's work that you will do is the work that you do within the walls of your own home."<br><br>I would follow that truth with another. The two most important decisions you will make in this life are the kind of person you choose for a mate and the kind of person you choose to be as a mate. Both of these decisions--and they are of equal importance--will determine the quality of what you do within the walls of your own home.<br><br>This reminds me of the young groom of two months who felt rather sure of himself as he said to his bride, "We've now lived together for two months and I've noticed a few of your defects. Do you mind if I discuss them with you?" To which she sweetly responded, "I would be happy to have you do that; it was those defects that prevented me from getting a better husband."<br><br>Of all the things that really count, our Father in Heaven's love and watchful care for us count most of all. I'm thankful for my knowledge of him and pray that we will take a renewed look at the importance of our friends, our freedoms, and our families.<br><br>Thanks for our friends--for friends are fortunes.<br><br>Thanks for our freedoms--for freedoms cast the future.<br><br>Thanks for our families--for families are forever.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Wm. Rolfe Kerr was executive vice president of Brigham Young University when this devotional address was given on 25 November 1980.</i></i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>r Fruits Ye Shall Know Them” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President and Sister Holland, President Dalton and all stake presidents, President and Sister Joe Christensen of the Missionary Training Center, it is a joy and privilege to meet with you this evening. What an impressive sight to look upon this vast assembly of students, stake and ward leaders, and missionaries.<br><br>President Kimball made a special request that I extend to each of you his love and greetings.<br><br>I pray for divine inspiration that I may say--that you may hear--the thoughts that are in my heart; that we may be spiritually in tune as we discuss eternal principles and obligations, truths that do not change as do worldly fashions or the short-lived ideas of men, which are popular for a season then replaced by others.<br><br>Though we live in a day of wickedness and evil when a sizable portion of mankind have forgotten God, have drifted away from His teachings, and some even fight against Him and the gospel of His Son, our responsibility as believers in Christ and members of His Church does not change.<br><br>A few days ago we listened to President Spencer W. Kimball's lofty challenge to your new university president, Jeffrey R. Holland, to make Brigham Young University an "educational Mt. Everest, ... [to] tower above other universities--not simply because of, ... [the size or beauty of campus or] size of its student body ... but by the unique light BYU can send forth into the educational world." ("Installation and Charge to Dr. Jeffrey R. Holland, Ninth President of Brigham Young University," Nov. 14, 1980.)<br><br>He continued, "You will do many things ... that are done elsewhere, but you must do them better. ... We expect you to do some special things ... that are left undone by other institutions."<br><br>This university, President Kimball said, "deliberately and persistently must concern itself with 'education for eternity,' not just for mortal time. ... BYU must continue to resist false and capricious fashions in education, holding fast to those basic principles which have proved true and right and have guided good men and women and good universities over the centuries."<br><br>As our prophet reminds President Holland of these standards and goals, is he not reestablishing in your hearts a personal commitment or excellence in mastering divine truths? When he holds aloft to President Holland his belief that this university will produce "brilliant stars in drama, literature, music, art, science, and all the scholarly graces," is he not admonishing you to not be talent wasters? The Savior taught that "by their fruits ye shall know them" (Matt. 7:20).<br><br>"Until we have climbed the hills just ahead, we cannot glimpse what lies beyond," the President said, "hills ... [that] are higher than we think." And then our prophet gives us the secret: "You will not always be able to see the future, but by drawing close to our Heavenly Father you will be guided"--guided by the light of truth.<br><br>The Lord teaches us in the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants that the light of truth is the light of Christ--"the light ... which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes ... and quickeneth your understandings," that you may know (D&amp;amp;C 88:11).<br><br>We draw close to our Heavenly Father through obedience to His laws and ordinances of the gospel. As we earnestly seek to draw close to Him, He has promised we will find Him.<br><br><i>Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:63]<br><br>President Kimball's recent message to this university counseled you to seek " ... vital and revealed truths that ... [come] from heaven," reminding us of this constant source of spiritual blessing.<br><br>You are here so you may become more faithful and knowledgeable in God's laws, and then to become a power for good in proclaiming and living and teaching those holy principles with determination somewhere out in the world where you will live.<br><br>Joshua understood the challenge and decisions to be made by us all when he proclaimed, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; ... but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15).<br><br>Aren't we--you and I--the teachers, the examples, the protectors of Christ's true gospel teachings? You are the leaders of the future. You will show by your example, the light you hold high for all to see, that you believe the principles of life's true joy and have made them part of your life. The gospel is the message of peace and salvation for all men.<br><br>How honored we are to have nearly 1,600 missionaries here tonight. They are preparing to take the message of the Restoration to the corners of the earth. We want you to know we remember you in our prayers. We pray for your parents and families. We pray for your success in proclaiming--<br><br>* That God is our Eternal Father, that He lives,<br>* That Jesus Christ is His Begotten Son, the Redeemer of the world, and that salvation is available only through Him,<br>* That Joseph Smith is the prophet of the Restoration, and<br>* That this Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is God's kingdomon earth.<br><br>In May 1829 the Lord said:<br><br><i>A great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men....</i><br><br><i>And no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 12:1,8]<br><br>Recently, workers at the Mesa Temple welcomed a busload of Church members from the interior of Mexico. They had been traveling for five days. The bus had broken down. These humble families had been sacrificing and saving their pesos for many months to buy the roundtrip tickets. They had slept on the floor of the crowded bus. President Wright of the temple said their leaders were rather embarrassed and even apologetic for their ravenous hunger, especially that of the children. After paying for the bus, there was no money for food. But that didn't matter--they were going to the temple, and they made it!<br><br>Faith? Devotion? Humble belief in God's eternal love? Can you imagine the special love Christ must have for those with such faith!<br><br>This year's Nobel Prize was given to India's seventy-year-old Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who ministers to the "poorest of the poor"--India's homeless beggars, sick, and dying, many of whom live their whole lives on city sidewalks, eating what they can find from garbage cans and sleeping in doorways. Mother Teresa herself lives in absolute poverty, clothes in a white cotton sari, eating only the simple food prepared for the destitute. Her "Order of the Missionaries of Charity" now assists 70 schools, 258 clinics, 58 leprosy centers, 25 homes for abnormal children, and 25 homes for the dying. Mother Teresa says it is not how much we do, but the love we give that really matters. She refused the traditional Nobel Prize dinner, saying she would rather the money--several thousand dollars--be given to the poor.<br><br>When honored by the Calcutta Rotary Club, Mother Teresa said, "Now I am a Rotarian. If you join Rotary to say you are a Rotarian, and come for fellowship and a meal, don't join. Become a Rotarian only if you are willing to serve (<i>serve</i>) until it hurts" (<i>The Rotarian,</i>Dec. 1980, p. 42).<br><br>Remember the words, "no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love" (D&amp;amp;C 12:8).<br><br><i>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matt. 25:40]<br><br>We are now preparing for the happiest season of the year when, hopefully, there is worldwide tribute to the birth of the Son of Man and is universal joy.<br><br>Why such a joyous time? Because we think of others. Reindeer, Santa Claus, music, bells, big packages, small packages, "Silent Night," "Oh, Come All Ye Faithful," "Joy to the World," cookies, mistletoe, happy family reunions. These have become part of the celebrations of Christmas. They represent our desire to share, to give, to serve, to show love and appreciation. We desire to make somebody else happy. Selfishness is replaced by a feeling to do good, ill feelings replaced by friendliness and trust. At this season, as our hearts turn to others, we get a glimpse that peace can come to earth--but only through "good will to men."<br><br>Can you who are here tonight give up selfish, petty, uncharitable feelings and attitudes and replace them with sincere concern, kindness, and helpfulness? If we believe and our actions reflect Jesus' teaching--that the greatest commandments of the law require love and that upon these two commandments hang all the other laws--we will again sing "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men" (Luke 2:15).<br><br>Suppose someone living in Salt Lake City, or Provo, or Phoenix, or Washington, D.C., or Beverly Hills, happened one day to open the Bible and by that mysterious process known only to angels, chanced to read these verses in the Gospel of Luke:<br><br><i>Then saith he also to him that bade him, when thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.</i><br><br><i>But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</i><br><br><i>And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</i>[Luke 14:12–14]<br><br>Suppose that man concluded that these words, probably spoken in Aramaic long ago, were just as applicable in the 1980s. Suppose that person believed that the blessings Jesus mentioned were worth having and decided to claim them. Suppose he had the courage and the love that would be required to take Jesus at His word. What do you think would happen?<br><br>One bitterly cold night, when the city was covered with a blanket of snow and ice, a man sat alone in his home. The house was very comfortable;... a crackling log fire in the fireplace threw dancing shadows on the paneled walls. The wind outside was moaning softly like someone in pain, and the reading lamp cast a soft warm glow on the book this man was reading.<br><br>He was alone, for the children had gone out and his wife had retired early. He read the passage of Luke, and then could read no more. Somehow he could not get away from those simple words. He had read the Bible often, for he was a good man, but never before did the words seem printed in flame.<br><br>He closed the Bible, and sat meditating, conscious for the first time in his life of the true challenge of Christ. He felt as though someone were standing behind him; he knew he was no longer alone. What strange fancy was this? Why was it that he kept hearing--in a whisper--the words he had just read?<br><br>"I must be sleepy and dreamy," he thought to himself. "It is time I went to bed." But it was long before he fell asleep, for still the voice whispered, and still he was conscious of the feeling of a Presence in the room. He could not shake it off. Never before had he been so challenged. He thought of the dinners and parties that they had given in this beautiful home. He thought of those whom he usually invited. Most of them were listed in "Who's Who"; and there were those whose names were household names in business, finance, clubs, and in government circles. There were men with the power to grant political and social favors. But they were not poor ... or maimed ... or lame ... or blind.<br><br>What had put this absurd thought into his head anyhow? He tried to sleep, but somehow he could not close the door of his mind to the procession that shuffled and tapped its way down the corridors of his soul.<br><br>There were beggars with trembling lips. There were sightless eyes that stared straight in front and faces blue with cold. There were sticks tapping on the pavement. There were crutches that creaked with the weight of a twisted body.<br><br>As he watched them pass, he felt his own heart touched. He whispered a prayer that if the Lord would give him courage, he would take Him at His word and do what He wanted him to do. Only then did he find peace and fall asleep.<br><br>When the morning came, his determination gave him new strength and zest for the day. He must begin his preparations and he was impatient to go downtown. His first call was on the engraver, who knew him well. At the counter he drafted the card he wished engraved, chuckling now and then as he wrote, his eyes shining.<br><br>The clerk who read the card looked somewhat puzzled but made no comment. The card read:<br><br><i>Jesus of Nazareth</i><br><i>Requests the Honor of your presence</i><br><i>at a banquet honoring</i><br><i>The Sons of Want</i><br><i>on Friday evening, in a home in this city</i><br><i>Cars will be waiting</i><br><br>Then, printed at the bottom of the invitation:<br><br><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i>[Matthew 11:28]<br><br>In the engraving room, they did not know what to make of it; but the conclusion they reached was that someone has more money than sense, but that it was none of their business.<br><br>A few days later, with the cards of invitation in his hand, he walked downtown and gave them out, and within an hour there were several people wondering what could be the meaning of the card that a kindly, happy, well-dressed man had placed in their hands.<br><br>There was the old man seated on a box trying to sell pencils, and another on the corner with a racking cough and a bundle of papers under his arms. There was a blind man saying over and over to himself, "Jesus of Nazareth requests the honor of your presence." A fellow who was fingering a gun in his pocket and bitterly thinking of suicide wondered whether he should wait until night.<br><br>At six o'clock, a strange group of men stood waiting at the appointed corner, talking softly together.<br><br>"What is the catch in this, anyhow?" asked one cynical fellow.<br><br>"What's the game?"<br><br>"Who's throwing this feed? Anybody know the bird what gave out the tickets?"<br><br>"Well, what difference does it make? I'd stand almost anything for a feed."<br><br>And the blind man, with a little boy at his side, ventured to remark: "Maybe it's part of the government welfare program." And the cynic was saying, "Aw, somebody's kiddin' us, as if we weren't wretched enough already."<br><br>Just then someone came over and announced that the cars were there. Without a word, they got in.<br><br>Perhaps there was something strange about it all, seeing these men, clutching their thin coats tightly around their thin bodies, huddling together, their faces pinched and wan, blue with cold and unshaven, toes sticking out of shoes--climbing into two shiny limousines. It was touching to see the lame get in, dragging one foot, swinging up with a twitch of pain; and to see the blind man fumbling for the strap. At last they were all inside, and the cars glided off with the strangest and most puzzled load of passengers they had ever carried.<br><br>When they dismounted, they stood gazing at the house, its broad steps and lamps, its thick-piled carpets. They entered slowly, trying to take it all in. They were met by the host, a little nervous, but smiling. He was a quiet man, and they liked him--these guests of his whose names he did not know. He did not say much, only, "I am so glad you came."<br><br>By and by, they were seated at the table. They had looked at the tapestries that hung on the walls. They had seen the illuminated pictures in their massive frames, and the huge crystal chandelier, the concert grand piano that stood across the hall, the spotless linen, and the gleaming silver on the table. They were silent now; even the cynic had nothing to say. It seemed as if the banquet would be held in frozen silence.<br><br>The host rose in his place, and in a voice that trembled slightly, said: "My friends, let us ask the blessing." He prayed--<br><br><i>If this is pleasing to Thee, O Lord, bless us as we sit around this table, and bless the food that we are about to receive.</i><br><br><i>Bless these men. You know who they are, and what they need.</i><br><br><i>And help us to do what you want us to do. Accept our thanks, in Jesus' name. Amen.</i><br><br>The blind man was smiling now. He turned to the man seated next to him and asked him about the host. "What does he look like?" And so the ice was broken; conversation began to stir around the table, and soon the first course was laid. "My friends, I hope you will enjoy the dinner. I would suggest that we waste no time, for I have no doubt that you are hungry. Go right ahead."<br><br>It was a strange party, rather fantastic in a way, thought the host, as he surveyed his guests. There they were--men who otherwise might be still loitering on the back streets of the city, crouched in doorways or huddled over some watchman's fire. What an amazing thing--he didn't know the name of a single man! His guests had no credentials, no social recommendations, no particular graces--so far as he could see. But, my, they were hungry!<br><br>As he sat there talking, the stories in the Gospels kept coming back to him, and he could almost imagine that the house was one in Jerusalem. It seemed to him that these men would be the very ones that Jesus would have gathered around Him--the legion of the world's wounded, a group of friendless pieces of broken human earthenware.<br><br>He remembered what his family had said, how they had insisted on demanding, "Why? Why are you doing such a thing?" Well, why was it, anyway? Wasn't it plain? His reason was the same glorious reason that Jesus had for every miracle, for every gesture of love, for every touch of healing. It was simply because he was sorry for these people, and because he wanted to do this one thing on an impulse of love. Yet there was not a trace of condescension in his attitude. He was treating them as brothers, talking to them as though they had a right to be sitting where they were. It was a grand feeling. Never before in his life had he felt this way. These men could not pay him back! What had they to give him?<br><br>He watched each plate and directed the servant with a nod or a glance. He encouraged them to eat; he laughed at their thinly disguised reluctance, until they laughed too. As he sat there, it suddenly occurred to him how different was the conversation! There were no off-color stories, no whisperings of scandal, no one saying, "Well, I have it on good authority." They were talking about their friends in misfortune, wishing they were here too ... wondering whether Charlie had managed to get a bed in the charity ward, whether Dick had stuck it out when he wanted to end it all, whether the little woman with the baby had gotten a job.<br><br>Wasn't the steak delicious! And they marveled that they still remembered how different foods tasted. They wondered, most of them, who this man was, and why he had invited them all here.<br><br>When the meal was over, there was music. Someone came in and sat down at the piano. He began to play softly, familiar melodies, old songs; and then in a soft but understanding voice, he began to sing. They listened to "Love's Old Sweet Song," "Silver Threads Among the Gold," and then a march by Sousa, and then "Traumerei," and then "The Sidewalks of New York."<br><br>Someone else joined in--a cracked, wheezing voice, but it started the others. Men who had not sung for years, men who had no reason to sing--there they were, joining in. Now some old favorites: "A Bicycle Built for Two," "Suwannee River." Soon they began to request this and that, and before they knew it, they were singing hymns: "What a Friend We Have in Jesus."<br><br>The pianist stopped, and the guests grouped themselves in soft, comfortable chairs around the log fire. The host moved among them, smiling, his eyes shining. Then when he had settled himself again, and his guests were comfortable, he said: "I know you men are wondering what all this means. I can tell you very simply. But, first, let me read you something."<br><br>He read from the Gospels stories of One who moved among the sick, the outcasts, the despised, and the friendless; how He healed this one, cured that one, spoke kindly words of infinite meaning to another, how He visited the ostracized and what He promised to all who believed in Him.<br><br>"Now I haven't done much tonight for you," the host said, "but it has made me very happy to have you here in my home. I hope you have enjoyed it half as much as I have. If I have given you one evening of happiness, I shall be forever glad to remember it, and you are under no obligation to me. This is not my party. It is His! I have merely lent Him this house. He was your Host. He is your Friend. And He has given me the honor of speaking for Him.<br><br>"He wants you all to have a good time. He is sad when you are. He hurts when you do. He weeps when you weep. He wants to help you, if you will let Him.<br><br>"I'm going to give each of you a Bible, His book of instructions. I have marked certain passages in it that you will find helpful when you are sick and in pain, when you are lonely and discouraged, when you are blue and bitter and hopeless, and when you lose a loved one. He will speak a message of hope and courage and faith.<br><br>"Then I shall see each one of you tomorrow where I saw you today, and we'll have a talk together to see just how I can help you most. I have made arrangements for each one of you to get back to your homes, and those who have nowhere to go I invite to spend the night here."<br><br>They shuffled out into the night, a different group from what they had been. There was a new light in their eyes--a smile where there had not been even interest before. The blind man was smiling still, and as he stood on the doorstep, waiting, he turned to where his host stood. "God bless you, my friend, whoever you are." A little wizened fellow who had not spoken all night paused to say, "I'm going to try again, mister; there's somethin' worth livin' for." The cynic turned back and said, "Mister, you're the first man who ever gave me anything. And you've given me hope."<br><br>"That is because I was doing it for Him," said the host, and he stood and waved good night as the cars moved off into the darkness.<br><br>When they had gone, he sat again by the fire and looked at the dying embers, until the feeling became overwhelming again that there was someone in the room. He could never tell anyone how he knew this, but he knew that He was smiling and that He approved. And that night, this good man smiled in his sleep. And One who stood in the shadows smiled too, because some of the "least of these" had been treated like brothers for His sake. (Adaptations from a story by Peter Marshall.)<br><br>Of course, that never happened. It is only a piece of imagination. But why shouldn't it happen? in Salt Lake City? in Washington, D.C.? on Park Avenue in New York City? at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah?<br><br>I wonder what would happen if we all agreed to read one of the Gospels until we came to a place that told us to do something, then went out to do it, and only after we had done it began reading again?<br><br>Why don't we do what Jesus says? How exciting life would become were we to begin living according to His way of life!<br><br>Some acquaintances would say we were "peculiar." But someone else, who had these same things said about Him, would smile, and the joy and peace in our own hearts would tell us who was right.<br><br>There are aspects of the gospel that are different and sometimes difficult to understand. But our problems are not centered around the things we don't understand, but in the things we do understand, the things we could not possibly misunderstand.<br><br>This, after all, is but an illustration of the fact that our problem is not so much that we don't know what we should do. We know perfectly well.<br><br><i>If you are willing to believe that love is the strongest thing in the world, that the blessed life which began in Bethlehem is the image of Eternal Love, then you can have the true spirit of Christmas.</i>[Henry van Dyke]<br><br>Love--as taught by the Savior--is the foundation for righteousness, salvation, and peace.<br><br>I share with you my witness--my personal, intimate witness--that Jesus is the Christ, the Only Begotten Son of our living God, our Savior and our Redeemer, the only name under heaven whereby we might be saved. I testify that He lives. The accounts found in the Gospels are true. And, as promised by the "two men ... in white apparel" when He was "taken up" in a cloud, He will "come (again) in like manner." (See Acts 1:10–11.)<br><br>May each of you bless your own homes--your children, your families--with your testimony of Him this Christmas season, I pray as I leave you my blessings, in the holy name of Jesus Christ.

<h1> Love: A Christmas Message - Henry B. Eyring - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, President Holland. I am delighted to be here with you. I pray that I may have the blessings of the Spirit so that I can say something useful to you.<br><br>A father asked me yesterday to advise him about giving a Christmas gift to his daughter. He just can't decide whether or not to give this gift, or how to give it. His daughter is a college student; she may even be listening today. Her hectic life of school activities is made even harder because she doesn't have a car. She begs rides, and she sometimes misses appointments. Her dad doesn't have enough money for another car, at least not without some real sacrifice by his family. But he's found a used car he might buy for her if he cuts enough corners on the family budget. And now he's wondering. He asked me, "Will that car really be good for her, or will it be a problem? I love her, and she really could use it, but do you think it will help her or spoil her?" Let me guess. I can hear you rooting for the car: "Go for it! Go for it!"<br><br>I didn't try to answer his question then, but I could sense his worry and sympathize with him. You ought to have sympathy for both givers and getters at Christmastime. Last night my sons, Matthew and John, and I spent time at a toy store. Above us a red Santa Claus spun slowly as the sound of a mother whispering with clenched teeth floated over the stacks of toys to our aisle: "Don't tell me what your brother did to you. I saw<i>everything.</i>Do you want me to hit you right here in the store? Now you go outside and sit on that bench. And you stay there. And if you don't I won't get you a thing." John and I shrugged and smiled at each other as we moved on, and I hummed inwardly, "'Tis the season to be jolly...."<br><br>Gift giving isn't easy. It's<i>hard</i>to give a gift with confidence. There are so many things that can go wrong. You wonder if the person on the other end will want it. My batting average on that is low. At least I think it is. You can't really tell what gets returned after Christmas, but I am cautious enough that I always wrap the gift in the box from the store where I bought it.<br><br>I've always daydreamed of being a great gift giver. I picture people opening my gifts and showing with tears of joy and a smile that the giving, not just the gift, has touched their hearts. You must have that daydream, too. Many of you are probably already experts in gift giving. But even the experts may share some of my curiosity about what makes a gift great. I've been surrounded by expert gift givers all my life. None of them has ever told me how to do it, but I've been watching and I've been building a theory. I think it's finally ready to be shared, at least among friends at this university. Here it is: The Eyring Theory of Gift Giving and Receiving. I call it a theory because it is surely incomplete. And calling it a theory means I expect you will change and improve it. I hope so, because then it will be yours. But at least I can help your theory building along.<br><br>My theory comes from thinking about many gifts and many holidays, but one day and one gift can illustrate it. The day was not Christmas nor even close to it. It was a summer day. My mother had died in the early afternoon. My father, my brother, and I had been at the hospital. As we walked out, my brother and I went to the car together, smiled, and looked up at the mountains. We remembered how Mother had always said she loved the mountains so much. He and I laughed and guessed that if the celestial worlds are really flat, like a sea of glass, she would be eager to get away to build her own worlds, and the first thing she'd build would be mountains. With that we smiled and got into the car and drove home. We went to the family home, and Dad met us there. There were just the three of us.<br><br>Friends and family came and went. In a lull, we fixed ourselves a snack. Then we visited with more callers. It grew late and dusk fell; I remember we still had not turned on the lights.<br><br>Then Dad answered the doorbell again. It was Aunt Catherine and Uncle Bill. When they'd walked just a few feet past the vestibule, Uncle Bill extended his hand, and I could see that he was holding a bottle of cherries. I can still see the deep red, almost purple, cherries and the shining gold cap on the mason jar. He said, "You might enjoy these. You probably haven't had dessert."<br><br>We hadn't. The three of us sat around the kitchen table and put some cherries in bowls and ate them as Uncle Bill and Aunt Catherine cleared some dishes. Uncle Bill then asked, "Are there people you haven't had time to call? Just give me some names, and I'll do it." We mentioned a few relatives who would want to know of Mother's death. And then Aunt Catherine and Uncle Bill were gone. They could not have been with us more than twenty minutes.<br><br>Now, you can understand my theory best if you focus on one gift: the bottle of cherries. And let me explain this theory from the point of view of one person who received the gift: me. As we'll see, that is crucial. What matters in what the giver does is what the receiver feels. You may not believe that yet, but trust me for the moment. So let's start from inside me and with the gift of the bottle of cherries.<br><br>As near as I can tell, the giving and receiving of a great gift always has three parts. Here they are, illustrated by that gift on a summer evening.<br><br>First, I knew that Uncle Bill and Aunt Catherine had felt what I was feeling and had been touched. I'm not over the thrill of that yet. They must have felt we'd be too tired to fix much food. They must have felt that a bowl of home-canned cherries would make us, for a moment, feel like a family again. And not only did they feel what I felt, they were touched by it. Just knowing that someone had understood meant far more to me than the cherries themselves. I can't remember the taste of the cherries, but I remember that someone knew my heart and cared.<br><br>Second, I felt the gift was free. I knew Uncle Bill and Aunt Catherine had chosen freely to bring a gift. I knew they weren't doing so to compel a response from us. The gift seemed, at least to me, to provide them with joy just by their giving it.<br><br>And third, there was sacrifice. Now you might say, "Wait. How could they give for the joy of it and yet make a sacrifice?" Well, I could see the sacrifice because the cherries were home bottled. That meant Aunt Catherine had prepared them for her family. They must have liked cherries. But she took that possible pleasure from them and gave it to us. That's sacrifice. However, I have realized since then this marvelous fact: It must have seemed to Uncle Bill and Aunt Catherine that they would have more pleasure if we had the cherries than if they did. There was sacrifice, but they made it for a greater return: our happiness. Most people feel deprived as they sacrifice to give another person a gift, and then they let that person know it. But only expert givers let the receiver sense that their sacrifice brings them joy.<br><br>Well, there it is--a simple theory. When you're on the receiving end, you will discover three things in great gift givers: (1) they felt what you felt and were touched, (2) they gave freely, and (3) they counted sacrifice a bargain.<br><br>Now you can see it won't be easy to use this theory to make big strides in your gift giving this Christmas. I don't expect you'll all rush out now and buy gifts brilliantly. It will take some practice--more than one holiday--to learn how to feel and be touched by what is inside someone else. And giving freely and counting sacrifice as joy will take a while. But you could start this Christmas being a good receiver. You might notice and you might appreciate. My theory suggests that you have the power to make others great gift givers by what you notice. You could make any gift better by what you choose to see, and you could, by failing to notice, make any gift a failure.<br><br>You can guess the advice I might have given my friend--the one with the careless daughter. Would a car be a good gift? Of course it could be, but something very special must happen in the eyes of that daughter. On Christmas morning, her eyes would need to see past the car to Dad and to the family. If she saw that he had read her heart and really cared, if she saw that she'd not wheedled the car from the family nor that they had given it to extract some performance, and if she really saw the sacrifice and the joy with which it was made for her, then the gift would be more than wheels. In fact, the gift would still be carrying her long after the wheels no longer turned. (And from the dad's description of the car's age, that time could come fairly soon.) Her appreciation, if it lasts, will make a great gift of whatever awaits her on Christmas morning.<br><br>Gift giving requires a sensitive giver and receiver. I hope we will use this little theory not to criticize the gifts that come our way this year, but to see how often our hearts are understood and gifts are given joyfully, even with sacrifice.<br><br>There is something you could do this Christmas to start becoming a better gift giver yourself. In fact, as students, you have some special chances. You could begin to put some gifts--great gifts--on layaway for future Christmases. Let me tell you about them.<br><br>You could start back in your room today. Is there an unfinished paper somewhere in the stacks? (I assume there are stacks there; I think I know your room.) Perhaps it is typed and apparently ready to turn in. Why bother more with it? I learned why during a religion class I taught once at Ricks College. I was teaching from section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants. In that section Emma Smith is told that she should give her time to "writing and to learning much" (verse 8). About three rows back sat a blonde girl whose brow wrinkled as I urged the class to be diligent in developing writing skills. She raised her hand and said, "That doesn't seem reasonable to me. All I'll ever write are letters to my children." That brought laughter all around the class. I felt chagrined to have applied that scripture to her. Just looking at her I could imagine a full quiver of children around her, and I could even see the letters she'd write in purple ink, with handwriting slanting backwards; neat, round loops; and circles for the tops of the<i>i'</i>s. Maybe writing powerfully wouldn't matter to her.<br><br>Then a young man stood up, near the back. He'd said little during the term; I'm not sure he'd ever spoken before. He was older than the other students, and he was shy. He asked if he could speak. He told in a quiet voice of having been a soldier in Vietnam. One day, in what he thought would be a lull, he had left his rifle and walked across his fortified compound to mail call. Just as he got a letter in his hand, he heard a bugle blowing and shouts and mortar and rifle fire coming ahead of the swarming enemy. He fought his way back to his rifle, using his hands as weapons. With the men who survived, he drove the enemy out. The wounded were evacuated. Then he sat down among the living, and some of the dead, and he opened his letter. It was from his mother. She wrote that she'd had a spiritual experience that assured her that he would live to come home if he were righteous. In my class, the boy said quietly, "That letter was scripture to me. I kept it." And he sat down.<br><br>You may have a child someday, perhaps a son. Can you see his face? Can you see him somewhere, sometime, in mortal danger? Can you feel the fear in his heart? Does it touch you? Would you like to give freely? What sacrifice will it take to write the letter your heart will want to send? You won't do it in the hour before the postman comes. Nor will it be possible in a day or even in a week. It may take years. Start the practice this afternoon. Go back to your room and write and read and rewrite that paper again and again. It won't seem like sacrifice if you picture that boy, feel his heart, and think of the letters he'll need someday.<br><br>Now, some of you may not have a paper waiting for you. It may be a textbook with a math problem hidden in it. (They hide them these days; the math is often tucked away in a special section that you can skip. And so many of you do.) Let me tell you about a Christmas in your future. You'll have a teenage son or daughter who'll say, "I hate school." After some careful listening, you'll find it is not school or even mathematics he or she hates--it's the feeling of failure.<br><br>You'll correctly discern those feelings and you'll be touched; you'll want to freely give. So you'll open the text and say, "Let's look at one of the problems together." Think of the shock you will feel when you see that the same rowboat is still going downstream in two hours and back in five hours, and the questions are still how fast the current is and how far the boat traveled. Just think what a shock it will be when you remember you've seen that problem before. Why, that rowboat has been in the water for generations! You might think, "Well, I'll make my children feel better by showing them that I can't do math either." Let me give you some advice: They will see that as a poor gift.<br><br>There is a better gift, but it will take effort now. My dad, when he was a boy, must have tackled the rowboat problem and lots of others. That was part of the equipment he needed to become a scientist who would make a difference to chemistry. But he also made a difference to me. Our family room didn't look as elegant as some. It had one kind of furniture--chairs--and one wall decoration--a green chalkboard. I came to the age your boy or girl will reach. I didn't wonder if I could work the math problems; I'd proved to my satisfaction that I couldn't. And some of my teachers were satisfied that that was true, too.<br><br>But Dad wasn't satisfied. He thought I could do it. So we took turns at that chalkboard. I can't remember the gifts my dad wrapped and helped put under a tree. But I remember the chalkboard and his quiet voice. In fact, there were some times when his voice was not quiet at all--he did shout, I'll have to admit in his presence--but he built up my mathematics, and he built up me. To do this took more than knowing what I needed and caring. It took more than being willing to give his time then, precious as it was. It took time he had spent earlier when he had the chances you have now. Because he had spent time then, he and I could have that time at the chalkboard and he could help me. And because he gave me that, I've got a boy who has let me sit down with him this year. We've rowed that same boat up and down. And his teacher wrote "much improved" on his report card. But I'll tell you what's improved most: the feelings of a fine boy about himself. Nothing I will put under the tree for Stuart this year has half the chance of becoming a family heirloom that his pride of accomplishment does.<br><br>Now I see some art (or are they music?) majors smiling. They're thinking, "He surely can't convince me there's a gift hidden in my unfinished assignments." Let me try. Last week I went to an Eagle Scout court of honor. I've been to dozens, but this one had something I won't forget. Before the Eagle badge was given, there was a slide and sound show. The lights went down, and I recognized two voices on the tape. One was a famous singer in the background, and the other, the narrator, was the father of the new Eagle Scout. The slides were of eagles soaring and of mountains and of moon landings. I don't know if the Eagle Scout had a lump in his throat quite the size of mine, but I know he'll remember the gift. His dad must have spent hours preparing slides, writing words that soared, and then somehow getting music and words coordinated for the right volume and timing. You'll have a boy someday who will be honored at such an event, with all his cousins and aunts and uncles looking on. And with your whole heart, you'll want to tell him what he is and what he can be. Whether you can give that gift then depends on whether you feel his heart now and are touched and start building the creative skills you'll need. And it will mean more than you now can dream, I promise you.<br><br>There is yet another gift some of you may want to give that takes starting early. I saw it started once when I was a bishop. A student sat across my desk from me. He talked about mistakes he had made. And he talked about how much he wanted the children he might have someday to have a dad who could use his priesthood and to whom they could be sealed forever. He said he knew that the price and pain of repentance might be great. And then he said something I will not forget: "Bishop, I am coming back. I will do whatever it takes. I am coming back." He felt sorrow. And he had faith in Christ. And still it took months of painful effort. Finally, he asked if it were enough. And he said he didn't want me to guess; he wanted to be sure.<br><br>About that time a kind priesthood leader took me aside and asked me if I had any questions. I said that I did, and I asked how I could know when a person has done what it takes to be forgiven. To my surprise, he didn't give me a lecture on repentance or on revelation. He just asked some questions. They weren't what I had expected. They were questions like these: "Does he attend all his meetings?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Does he come on time?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Does he do what he is asked?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Does he do it promptly?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>The questions went on that way for a few minutes. And all the answers were the same. Then he said "Do you have your answer?"<br><br>And I said, "Yes."<br><br>And so somewhere this Christmas there is a family with a righteous priesthood bearer at its head. They have eternal hopes and peace on earth. He'll probably give his family all sorts of gifts wrapped brightly, but nothing will matter quite so much as the one he started a long time ago in my office and has never stopped giving. He felt then the needs of children he'd only dreamed of, and he gave early and freely. He sacrificed his pride and sloth and numbed feelings. I am sure it doesn't seem like sacrifice now.<br><br>He could give that gift because of another one given long ago. God, the Father, gave his Son, and Jesus Christ gave us the Atonement, the greatest of all gifts and all giving. They somehow felt all the pain and sorrow of sin that would fall on all of us and everyone else who would ever live. I testify that what Paul said is true:<br><br><i>We have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.</i><br><br><i>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</i><br><br><i>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</i>[Hebrews 4:14–16]<br><br>I bear you my testimony that Jesus gave the gift freely, willingly, to us all. He said, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself" (John 10:17–18). All men and women come into this life with that gift. They will live again, and if they will, they may live with him.<br><br>And I bear you testimony that as you accept that gift, given through infinite sacrifice, it brings joy to the giver. Jesus taught, "I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance" (Luke 15:7).<br><br>If that warms you as it does me, you may well want to give a gift to the Savior. Others did at his birth. Knowing what we do, how much more do we want to give him something. But he seems to have everything. Well, not quite. He doesn't have you with him again forever, not yet. I hope you are touched by the feelings of his heart enough to sense how much he wants to know you are coming home to him. You can't give that gift to him in one day, or one Christmas, but you could show him today that you are on the way. You could pray. You could read a page of scripture. You could keep a commandment.<br><br>If you have already done these things, there is still something left to give. All around you are people he loves and can only help through you and me. One of the sure signs that a person has accepted the gift of the Savior's Atonement is gift giving. The process of cleansing seems to make us more sensitive, more gracious, more pleased to share what means so much to us. I suppose that's why the Savior spoke of giving in describing who would finally come home.<br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</i><br><br><i>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</i><br><br><i>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</i><br><br><i>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:34–40]<br><br>And that, I suppose, is the nicest effect of receiving great gifts. It makes us want to give, and give well. I've been blessed all my life by such gifts. I acknowledge that. I'm sure you do, too. Many of those gifts were given long ago. We're near the birthday of the Prophet Joseph Smith. He gave his great talent, and his life, that the gospel of Jesus Christ might be restored for me and for you. Ancestors of mine from Switzerland and Germany and Yorkshire and Wales left home and familiar ways to embrace the restored gospel, as much for me as for them, perhaps more. It was ten years after the Saints came into these mountains before my great-grandfather's journal shows one reference to so much as a Christmas meal. One entry reads, in its entirety: "December 25, 1855: Fixed a shed and went to the cedars. Four sheep died last night. Froze." I acknowledge such gifts, which I only hope I am capable of sending along to people I have not yet seen.<br><br>And so shall we do what we can to appreciate and to give a merry Christmas?<br><br>"Freely ye have received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8). I pray that we will freely give. I pray that we will be touched by the feelings of others, that we will give without feelings of compulsion or expectation of gain, and that we will know that sacrifice is made sweet to us when we treasure the joy it brings to another heart. For this I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Henry B.
