<h1>er Cup and the Bloody Baptism - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>The Duration of the War</b></h2><br>In the final few weeks of 1944 I was bundled up and taken, at about six in the morning as I recall, down to the Big Hand Cafe on the corner of Main Street and Highway 91 in St. George, Utah. That's where the Greyhound bus stopped in our little town, and that morning my Uncle Herb, all of seventeen years of age, was leaving for San Diego, California--wherever that was. Apparently in 1944 there was a war on somewhere, and he was now deemed old enough to go and do his part. He had joined the United States Navy, and we were there to say goodbye.<br><br>Actually, I had a rather formal part in this bus stop program. I had practiced and was now supposed to sing in my four-year-old solo voice a little ditty that celebrated sailors with lyrics beginning "Bell-bottom trousers / Coat of navy blue. / She loves her sailor boy / And he loves her too." However, as with other assignments later in my life, I panicked in the public eye and went stone silent. I refused to sing a note.<br><br>But my silence seemed to work out all right anyway because my mother and my grandmother and my aunts were all crying and nobody cared much whether I sang or not. I asked why they were crying, and they said it was because Uncle Herb was going to war. I asked, "How long will he be gone?"--not knowing then that some of the boys were never coming home. Through her tears my grandmother said, "He will be gone as long as it takes. He will be gone for the duration of the war."<br><br>Well, I had no idea whatsoever of her meaning. "As long as it takes to do what?" for crying out loud--which is exactly what they were doing. And what was "the duration of the war"? I was totally confused and very glad I didn't sing my song. That would only have added to the confusion, and the Big Hand Cafe never could stand much confusion.<br><br>As you might suppose, I have thought a lot more about my grandmother's words later in my life than I ever thought about them in my youth. Lately they have been on my mind again, and I hope they might have some significance for you this morning.<br><br>The longer I live the more I come to realize that some things in life are very true and very permanent and very important. They are, I suppose, matters that might collectively be labeled "eternal" things. Without listing a whole catalog of these good and permanent possessions, let me say that all of them are included collectively, in some way or another, in the gospel of Jesus Christ. As Mormon told his son, "In Christ there ... come[s]" every good thing" (Moroni 7:22). So, as time goes by, we ought--as a matter of personal maturity and growth in the gospel--to spend more of our time with and devote more of our energy to the good things, the best things, the things that endure and bless and prevail.<br><br>This is why, I believe, family and true friends become increasingly important the older we get, and so does knowledge and so do simple acts of kindness and concern for the circumstances of others. Peter lists a whole handful of these virtues and calls them "the divine nature," and he promises us "divine power" in possessing and sharing them (see 2 Peter 1:3–8). These gospel qualities and principles, as I understand them, are the most important as well as the most permanent of life's acquisitions. But there is a war going on over such personal possessions, and there will yet be a bazooka shell or two falling into your life that will prompt--indeed, will require--careful examination of what you say you believe, what you assume you hold dear, and what you trust is of permanent worth.<br><br>When difficult times come upon us or when temptation seems all around, will we be--are we now?--prepared to stand our ground and outlast the intruder? Are we equipped for combat, to stay loyal for as long as it takes, to stay true for the duration of the war? Can we hold fast to the principles and the people who truly matter eternally to us?<br><br>It is, I suppose, this quality of your faith, the determination of your purpose, that I wish so much to stress this morning. I am asking you to reexamine and more clearly understand the commitment you made when you were baptized not only into Christ's church, but into his life and his death and his resurrection, into all that he is and stands for in time and in eternity. Nearly 98 percent. of this audience are baptized and confirmed members of the LDS Church. Virtually that same percentage of the men are also ordained priesthood bearers, and many of the men and women here have already taken upon themselves the highest covenants and holiest ordinances available in mortality--those of the holy temple.<br><br>So surely we have as a congregation already thrust ourselves into the most serious and most eternal of issues. The war is on, and we have conspicuously enlisted. And certainly it is a war worth waging. But we are foolish, fatally foolish, if we believe it will be a casual or convenient thing. We are foolish if we think it will demand nothing of us. Indeed, as the chief figure, the great commander in this struggle, Christ has warned us about treating the new testament of his body and his blood trivially. We are told emphatically<i>not</i>to pilfer and profane, prevaricate and fornicate, satiate ourselves in every indulgence or violation that strikes our fancy and then suppose that we are still "pretty darn good soldiers." No, not in this army, not in defending the kingdom of God.<br><br>More is expected than that.<i>Much</i>more is needed. And in a very real sense eternity hangs in the balance. I truly believe there can be no casual Christians, for if we are not watchful and resolute, we will become in the heat of battle a Christian "casualty." And each of us knows some of those. Perhaps we ourselves have at sometime been wounded. We weren't strong enough. We hadn't cared enough. We didn't stop to think. The war was more dangerous than we had supposed. The temptation to transgress, to compromise, is all around us, and too many of us, even as members of the Church, have fallen victim. We partook of Christ's "flesh and blood unworthily," and we ate and drank damnation to our soul (3 Nephi 18:28–29).<br><br>Some of us may<i>still</i>be taking such transgression lightly, but at least the Master understands the significance of the side we say we have chosen. Let me use just one example."<br><h2><b>"Are Ye Able?"</b></h2><br>At the conclusion of his Perean ministry, Jesus and the Twelve were making their way back to Jerusalem for that last, prophetically foretold week leading up to his arrest, trial, and crucifixion. In that most sober and foreboding sequence of events, the Savior–who singly and solitarily alone knew what lay ahead of him and just how difficult the commitments of his final hours would be--was approached by the mother of two of his chief disciples, James and John. She rather straightforwardly asked a favor of the Son of God. She said, "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom" (Matthew 20:21).<br><br>This good mother, and perhaps most of the little band who had faithfully followed Jesus, were obviously preoccupied by the dream and expectation of that time when this, their Messiah, would rule and reign in splendor, when, as the scripture says, "the kingdom of God should immediately appear" (Luke 19:11). The question was one more of ignorance than impropriety, and Christ uttered not a word of rebuke. He gently answered as one who always considered the consequence of any commitment.<br><br>"Ye know not," he said quietly, "what ye ask.<i>Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?</i>" (Matthew 20:22; emphasis added). This startling question did not seem to take James and John by surprise. Promptly and firmly they replied, "We are able." And Jesus's response to them was, "Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with" (Matthew 20:23).<br><br>Without any reference to the glory or special privilege they seem to have been seeking, this may strike one as a strange favor the Lord was granting James and John. But he was not mocking them by offering the cup of his suffering rather than a throne in his kingdom. No, he had never been more serious.<i>The cup and the throne were inextricably linked and could not be given separately.</i><br><br>I am sure that you and I, being not only less worthy than Christ but also less worthy than apostles like James and John, would leave such troublesome issues alone if they would only leave us alone. As a rule we usually do not seek the bitter cup and the bloody baptism, but sometimes they seek us. The fact of the matter is God<i>does</i>draft men and women into the spiritual warfare of this world, and if any of us come to genuine religious faith and conviction as a result of that--as many a drafted soldier has done--it will nevertheless be a faith and a conviction that in the first flames of the battle we did not enjoy and certainly did not expect. (See A. B. Bruce,<i>The Training of the Twelve</i>[New York: Richard R. Smith, 1930].)<br><h2><b>Stand Firmly By Your Faith</b></h2><br>I am asking this morning that we put ourselves in the place of James and John, put ourselves in the place of seemingly committed, believing, faithful Latter-day Saints, and ask ourselves, "If we are Christ's and he is ours, are we willing to stand firm forever? Are we in this church for keeps, for the duration, until it's over? Are we in it through the bitter cup, the bloody baptism, and all?" And please understand that I am<i>not</i>asking if you can simply endure your years at BYU or serve out your term as gospel doctrine teacher. I am asking questions of a far deeper and more fundamental sort. I am asking about the purity of your heart. How cherished are our covenants? Have we--perhaps beginning our life in the Church as a result of parental insistence or geographic happenstance--have we yet thought about a life that is ultimately to be tempted and tried and purified by fire? Have we cared about our convictions enough and are we regularly reinforcing them in a way that will help us do the right thing at the right time for the right reason, especially when it is unpopular or unprofitable or nearly unbearable to do so?<br><br>Indeed, you may one day be released as the glamorous gospel doctrine teacher and be called to that much vacated post of gospel doctrine believer and obeyer. That will test your strength! Surely our sometimes clichéd expressions of testimony and latter-day privilege don't amount to much until we have had open invitation to test them in the heat of battle and have in such spiritual combat found ourselves to be faithful. We may speak glibly in those Sunday services of<i>having</i>the truth or even of<i>knowing</i>the truth, but only one who is confronting error and conquering it, however painfully or however slowly, can properly speak of<i>loving</i>the truth. And I believe Christ intends us someday to truly, honestly<i>love</i>him--the way, the truth, and the life.<br><br>Tragically enough, the temptation to compromise standards or be less valiant before God often comes from another member of the Church. Elder Grant Bangerter wrote of his experience years ago in the military shortly after he had returned from his mission. "I realized," he concluded, "throughout those years that I was considered different. ... [But] I never found it necessary to break my standards, to remove my garments, or to apologize for being a Latter-day Saint." Then came this very telling observation.<br><br><i>I can honestly say that no nonmember of the Church has ever tried to induce me to discard my</i>[LDS]<i>standards. The only people I remember trying to coerce me to abandon my principles or who ridiculed me for my standards have been non-practicing members of</i>[my own]<i>Church.</i>[Wm. Grant Bangerter, "Don't Mind Being Square,"<i>The New Era,</i>July 1982, p. 6]<br><br>What a painful observation if we were to apply it at a place like BYU, where the temptation to compromise may come from a "practicing" member of the Church.<br><br>Even here--maybe especially here, because we have been given so much--we must be prepared to stand by principle and act on conviction, even if that seems to leave us standing alone. Remember these lines from<i>Paradise Lost:</i><br><br><i>I alone</i><br><i>Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent</i><br><i>From all; my sect thou seest. Now learn to late</i><br><i>How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.</i>[Book VI, lines 145–48]<br><br>I do not think thousands err at BYU, but some do, and I believe that you will leave here to work and live in a world where<i>many</i>do,<i>more</i>than Milton's thousands. So my call--especially while we are in an environment that requires and expects it--is to live by the highest principles and to stand firmly by your faith. I ask it however difficult or lonely that may seem, even at a place as beautiful as BYU. You may be tempted, you undoubtedly are tempted. But be strong. The cup and the throne are inextricably linked.<br><h2><b>Our Christian Challenge</b></h2><br>I think perhaps so far I have made you think only of the rather obvious transgressions young Latter-day Saints face, the temptations Satan never seems to keep very subtle. But what about the gospel-living that isn't so obvious and may be of a higher order still? Let me shift both the tone<i>and</i>the temptations just slightly and cite other examples of our Christian challenge.<br><br>On the night of March 24, 1832, a dozen men stormed the Hiram, Ohio, home where Joseph and Emma Smith were staying. Both were physically and emotionally spent, not only from all the travails of the young Church at the time but also because on this particular evening they had been up caring for their two adopted twins, born eleven months earlier on the same day that Emma had given birth to--and then lost--their own twins. Emma had gone to bed first while Joseph stayed up with the children; then she had arisen to take her turn, encouraging her husband to get some sleep. No sooner had he begun to doze than he heard his wife give a terrifying scream and found himself being torn from the house and very nearly being torn limb from limb.<br><br>Cursing as they went, the mob that had seized him were swearing to kill Joseph if he resisted. One man grabbed him by the throat until he lost consciousness from lack of breath. He came to only to overhear part of their conversation on whether he should be murdered. It was determined that for now he would simply be stripped naked, beaten senseless, tarred and feathered, and left to fend for himself in the bitter March night. Stripped of his clothing, fighting off fists and tar paddles on every side, and resisting a vial of some liquid--perhaps poison--which he shattered with his teeth as it was forced into his mouth, he miraculously managed to fight off the entire mob and eventually made his way back to the house. In the dim light his wife thought the tar stains covering his body were blood stains, and she fainted at the sight.<br><br>Friends spent the entire night scraping and removing the tar and applying liniments to his scratched and battered body. I now quote directly from the Prophet Joseph's record:<br><br><i>By morning I was ready to be clothed again. This being the Sabbath morning, the people assembled for meeting at the usual hour of worship, and among them came also the mobbers</i>[of the night before. Then he names them.]<i>With my flesh all scarified and defaced, I preached to the congregation as usual, and in the afternoon of the same day baptized three individuals.</i>[<i>HC</i>1:264]<br><br>Unfortunately, one of the adopted twins, growing worse from the exposure and turmoil of the night, died the following Friday. "With my flesh all scarified and defaced, I preached to the congregation as usual"! To that slimy band of cowards who by Friday next will quite literally be the murderers of your child? Stand there hurting from the hair of your head that was pulled and then tarred into a mat, hurting right down to your foot that was nearly torn off being wrenched out the door of your own home? Preach the gospel to that damnable bunch of sniveling reprobates? Surely this is no time to stand by principle. It is daylight now and the odds aren't twelve to one anymore. Let's just conclude this Sunday service right now and go outside to finish last evening's business. It was, after all, a fairly long night for Joseph and Emma; maybe it should be an equally short morning for this dirty dozen who have snickeringly shown up for church.<br><br>But those feelings that I have even now just reading about this experience 150 years later--and feelings I know that would have raged in my Irish blood that morning--mark only one of the differences between me and the Prophet Joseph Smith. You see, a disciple of Christ--which I testify to you Joseph was and is--always has to be a disciple; the judge does not give any time off for bad behavior. A Christian always stands on principle, even as old Holland is out there swinging a pitchfork and screaming an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth--forgetting, as dispensation after dispensation has forgotten, that this only leaves everyone blind and toothless.<br><br>No, the good people, the strong people, dig down deeper and find a better way. Like Christ, they know that when it is hardest to be so is<i>precisely</i>the time you have to be at your best. As another confession to you, I have always feared that<i>I</i>could not have said at Calvary's cross, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do." Not after the spitting, and the cursing, and the thorns, and the nails. Not if they don't care or understand that this horrible price in personal pain is being paid for them. But that's just the time when the fiercest kind of integrity and loyalty to high purpose must take over. That's just the time when it matters the very most and when everything else hangs in the balance--for surely it did that day. You and I won't ever find ourselves on that cross, but we repeatedly find ourselves at the foot of it. And how we act there will speak volumes about what we think of Christ's character and his call for us to be his disciples.<br><h2><b>Tested in the Heat of Battle</b></h2><br>Yes, our challenges will be a lot less dramatic than a tar-and-feathering; certainly they won't involve a crucifixion. And maybe they won't even be very personal matters at all. Maybe they will involve someone else--perhaps an injustice done to a neighbor, a person much less popular and privileged than yourself.<br><br>In cataloging life's little battles, this may be the least attractive kind of war for you, a bitter cup you especially don't wish to drink because there seems to be so little advantage in it for you. After all, it's really someone else's problem, and like Hamlet you may well lament that "time is out of joint; O cursed spite, / That ever [you were] born to set it right!" (William Shakespeare,<i>Hamlet,</i>act 1, sc. 5, lines 187–88). But set it right you must, for "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matthew 25:40). And in times of such Doniphan-like defense, it may be risky, even dangerous, to stand true.<br><br>Martin Luther King once said,<br><br><i>The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. The true neighbor will risk his position, his prestige, and even his life for the welfare of others. In dangerous valleys and hazardous pathways, he will lift some bruised and beaten brother</i>to<i>a higher and more noble life.</i>[Martin Luther King, Jr.,<i>Strength to Love</i>(New York: Harper and Row, 1963)]<br><br>But what if in this war it is neither a neighbor nor yourself at risk, but someone desperately, dearly loved by you who is hurt or defamed or perhaps even taken in death? How might we prepare for that distant day when our own child, or our own spouse, is found in mortal danger? One marvelously gifted man, a convert to Christianity, slowly watched his wife dying of cancer. As he observed her slipping away from him with all that she had meant and had given him, his newfound faith about which he had written so much and with which he had strengthened so many others now began to waver. In times of such grief, C. S. Lewis wrote, one runs the risk of asking:<br><br><i>Where is God? ... When you are happy</i>... [you]<i>turn to Him with gratitude and praise,</i>[and]<i>you will be ... welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence. You</i>[might]<i>as well turn away. The longer you wait, the more emphatic the silence will become. There are no lights in the windows. It might be an empty house....</i>[Yet he was once there.]<i>What can this mean? Why is</i>[God]<i>so present a commander in our time of prosperity and so very absent a help in time of trouble?</i>[C. S. Lewis,<i>A Grief Observed</i>(New York: Seabury Press, Inc., 1961), pp. 4–5]<br><br>Those feelings of abandonment, written in the midst of a terrible grief, slowly passed, and the comfort of Lewis' faith returned, stronger and purer for the test. But note what self-revelation this bitter cup, this bloody baptism, had for him. In an obligation of quite a different kind, he, too, now realized that enlisting for the duration of the war is not a trivial matter, and in the heat of battle he hadn't been so heroic as he had encouraged millions of his readers to be.<br><br>"You never know how much you really believe anything," he confesses,<br><br><i>until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you. It is easy to say you believe a rope to be strong and sound as long as you are merely using it to</i>[tie]<i>a box. But suppose you had to hang by that rope over a precipice. Wouldn't you then first discover how much you really trusted it?</i>...<i>Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief.</i>[Lewis, p. 25]<br><br>...<i>Your</i>[view of] ...<i>eternal life ... will not be</i>[very]<i>serious if nothing much</i>[is at]<i>stake.... A man ... has to be knocked silly before he comes</i>to<i>his senses.</i>[p. 43]<br><br><i>... I had been warned--</i>[indeed,]<i>I had warned myself. ...</i>[I knew]<i>we were ... promised sufferings. ...</i>[That was]<i>part of the program. We were even told, "Blessed are they that mourn," and I accepted it. I've got nothing that I hadn't</i>[agreed to]. ... [So]<i>if my house ... collapsed at one blow, that is because it was a house of cards. The faith which "took these things into account" was not</i>[an adequate]<i>faith. ... If I had really cared, as I thought I did</i>[care],<i>about the sorrows of</i>[others in this]<i>world,</i>[then]<i>I should not have been so overwhelmed when my own sorrow came. ... I thought I trusted the rope until it mattered....</i>[And when it indeed mattered, I found that it wasn't strong enough.]<br><br><i>... You will never discover how serious it</i>[is]<i>until the stakes are raised horribly high;</i>[and God has a way of raising the stakes] ... [sometimes]<i>only suffering</i>[can]<i>do</i>[that]. [pp. 41–43]<br><br>[So God is, then, something like a divine physician.]<i>A cruel man might be bribed--might grow tired of his vile sport--might have a temporary fit of mercy, as alcoholics have</i>[temporary]<i>fits of sobriety. But suppose that what you are up against is a</i>[wonderfully skilled]<i>surgeon whose intentions are</i>[solely and absolutely] good. [Then],<i>the kinder and more conscientious he is,</i>[the more he cares about you,]<i>the more inexorably he will go on cutting</i>[in spite of the suffering it may cause. And]<i>if he yielded to your entreaties, if he stopped before the operation was complete, all the pain up to that point would have been useless....</i>[pp. 49–50]<br><br>[So I am, you see, one]<i>of God's patients, not yet cured. I know there are not only tears</i>[yet]<i>to be dried but stains</i>[yet]<i>to be scoured.</i>[My]<i>sword will be made even brighter.</i>[p. 49]<br><br>God wants us to be stronger than we are--more fixed in our purpose, more certain of our commitments, eventually needing less coddling from him, showing more willingness to shoulder some of the burden of his heavy load. In short, he wants us to be more like he is and, if you haven't noticed, some of us are not like that yet.<br><br>The question then, for all of us milling around the Greyhound bus depot about to report for duty, is: When gospel principles get unpopular or unprofitable or very difficult to live, will we stand by them "for the duration"? That is the question our experiences in Latter-day Saint life seem most determined to answer. What do we really believe, and how true to that are we really willing to live? As university students--bright and blessed and eager and prosperous--do we yet know what faith--specifically, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ--really is, what it requires in human behavior, and what it may yet demand of us before our souls are finally saved?<br><br>May I close by telling you how much I love you and how much I care about what you become at BYU and beyond. I think about you day and night, and I pray for your brightest possible future. My testimony to you this morning is that God does live and good does triumph. This<i>is</i>the true and living Church of the true and living Christ. And because of him and the restored gospel and the work of living prophets--including President Ezra Taft Benson--there is for each of us individually and for all of us collectively, if we stay fixed and faithful in our purpose, a great final moment somewhere when we will stand with the angels "in the presence of God, on a globe like a sea of glass and fire, where all things for [our] glory are manifest, past, present, and future" (D&amp;amp;C 130:7). That is a triumphant day for which I dearly long, and for which I earnestly pray for all of you. To earn the right to be there may we, as Alma said, "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:9), I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey R.

<h1>&#039;s Center: The Inner Woman - Patricia T. Holland - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Feeding the Inner Self</b></h2><br>I wish to assume a special prerogative this morning and speak to the<i>women</i>in the audience, my "sisters" if you will. Not only are the women on this campus of very special interest to me, but if I know men--and I think I do--they will now be listening with even more than normal interest. So let me greet you at the start of this new year and new semester with a bit of straight "girl talk."<br><br>For several years now I have had what has been both an exhilarating and sobering opportunity to observe rather closely the sisters of my own sex. That has included seven wonderful and event-filled years on this campus with you--including two of those years when I also served in the General Young Women Presidency of the Church. During this time I have, like other Church leaders and mothers and sisters, worried over the statistics on teenage pregnancies, drug abuse, and the spread of disorders like anorexia and bulimia. At the same time I have been reading those statistics, I have also seen data showing that six million women in this country, with children under six years of age, have hung up their aprons, picked up their briefcases, and marched into the career world.<br><br>I also read of a new and very real illness called the Epstein-Barr syndrome, which has come into our popular medical jargon as the malady of the eighties. Its symptoms are low-grade fevers, aching joints, and other flulike symptoms--but it isn't the flu. It carries with it overwhelming exhaustion, muscular weakness, and physical debilitation--but it isn't the dreaded AIDS. Its victims are often confused and forgetful but, no, it isn't Alzheimer's. Many feel suicidal, but this disease lacks the traditional characteristics of clinical depression. And yes, it can strike men, but three times out of four it doesn't. This illness is primarily a<i>women's</i>disease, and those most vulnerable are the so-called "fast-track" women in high-stress, conflicting roles.<br><br>Is it appropriate to pause now, right here in safe and sane Happy Valley, USA, and ask woman-to-woman, "What are we doing to ourselves?" Is this that female curse Isaiah spoke of in his prophecies? Is this some special last days' dilemma into which we are entering and from which we may find it near-fatally difficult to withdraw?<br><br>I believe that as women we are becoming so concerned about having perfect figures, or straight A's, or professional status, or even absolute motherly success, that we are being torn from our true selves. We often worry so much about pleasing and performing for others that we lose our own uniqueness, that full and relaxed acceptance of ourselves as a person of worth and individuality. Too many women watch helplessly as their lives unravel from the core that centers and sustains them. Too many are like a ship at sea without sail or rudder, tossed to and fro (as the Apostle Paul said) until more and more of us are genuinely, rail-grabbingly seasick.<br><br>Where is the sureness that allows us to sail our ship--whatever winds may blow--with the master seaman's triumphant cry, "Steady as she goes"? Where is the inner stillness we so cherish and for which our sex traditionally has been known? In the shadow of the twenty-first century can we find what Charles Morgan once described as "the stilling of the soul within the activities of the mind and body [as] still as [the center] of a revolving wheel is still"? (cited by Anne Morrow Lindbergh,<i>Gift from the Sea</i>[New York: Pantheon, 1955], pp. 50–51).<br><br>I believe we<i>can</i>find it--the steady footing and the stilling of the soul--by turning away from the<i>fragmentation</i>of physical preoccupations (whether it be thin or fat) of superwoman careers or endless popularity contests and returning instead to the<i>wholeness</i>of our soul.<br><br>One woman not of our faith but whose writings I love is Anne Morrow Lindbergh. In commenting on the female despair and general torment of our times she writes:<br><br><i>The Feminists did not look ... far</i>[enough]<i>ahead; they laid down no rules of conduct. For them it was enough to demand the privileges. ... And</i>[so]<i>woman today is still searching. We are aware of our hunger and needs, but still ignorant of what will satisfy them. With our garnered free time, we are more apt to drain our creative springs than to refill them. With our pitchers</i>[in hand],<i>we attempt ... to water a field,</i>[instead of]<i>a garden. We throw ourselves indiscriminately into committees and causes. Not knowing how to feed the spirit, we try to muffle its demands in distractions. Instead of stilling the center, the axis of the wheel, we add more centrifugal activities to our lives--which tend to throw us</i>[yet more]<i>off balance.</i><br><br><i>Mechanically we have gained, in the last generation, but spiritually we have ... lost.</i>[<i>Gift from the Sea,</i>p. 52]<br><br>[For women]<i>the problem is</i>[<i>still</i>]<i>how to feed the soul.</i>[p. 51]<br><br>I have pondered long and hard about the feeding of our inner self. It is no coincidence that we speak of "feeding the spirit" just as we would speak of feeding the body. We need constant nourishment for both. The root word<i>hale</i>(as in hale and hearty) is the common root to words like<i>whole, health, heal, and holy.</i>Our health and our wholeness are unquestionably linked with our holiness. We need very much for body, mind, and spirit to come together, to unite in one healthy, stable soul.<br><h2><b>Finding the Inner Stillness</b></h2><br>May I give you my own analogy of something I read years ago, a process that helped me then, and helps me still, in my examination of inner strength and spiritual growth. The analogy is of a soul--a human soul, with all of its splendor--being placed in a beautifully carved but very tightly locked box. This box is then placed and locked inside another, larger one, and so on until five beautifully carved but very securely locked boxes await the woman who is skillful and wise enough to open them. Success will reveal to her the beauty and divinity of her own soul, her gifts and her grace as a daughter of God.<br><br>Prayer is the key to the first box. We kneel to ask help for the tasks and then arise to find that quite miraculously the first lock is now already open. Our excitement upon gaining entrance to a new dimension of our divinity leads us readily to the next box. But here our prayers alone do not seem to be sufficient. We turn to the scriptures for God's teachings about our soul. And we find that the second box now yields its own mysteries and rewards to the probing key of revelation.<br><br>But with the beginning of such success in emancipating the soul, Lucifer becomes more anxious, especially as we approach box number three. He knows that to truly find ourselves we must lose ourselves, so he begins to block our increased efforts to love--to love God, our neighbor, and ourselves. True charity takes us into the beauty of box number three.<br><br>Real growth and genuine insight are coming now, but the lid to box number four seems nearly impossible to penetrate, for we are climbing, too, in this story, and the way inward is also the way upward. Unfortunately, the faint-hearted and fearful often turn back here--the going seems too difficult, the lock too secure. This is a time for self-evaluation. To see ourselves as we really are often brings pain; but true humility, which comes from that process,<i>is</i>a godly virtue. We must be patient with ourselves as we overcome weaknesses and remember to rejoice over all that is good in us. This will strengthen the<i>inner</i>woman and leave her less dependent on outward acclaim. When the soul reaches the stage that it pays less attention to praise, it then cares very little when the public disapproves. These feelings of strength and the quiet triumph of faith carry us into an even brighter sphere. This fourth box, unlike the others, bursts open like a flower blooms, and the earth is reborn.<br><br>The opening of the fifth and final box can only be portrayed symbolically, and perhaps the temple is the best symbol of all. There, in a setting not of this world, where fashions and position and professions go unrecognized, we have our chance to meet God face-to-face. For those who, like the brother of Jared, have the courage and faith to break through the veil into that sacred center of existence, we will find the brightness of the final box brighter than the noonday sun. There we will find peace and serenity and a stillness that will anchor our soul forever, for there we will find God.<br><br>Wholeness. Holiness. That is what it says over the entrance to the fifth box. Holiness to the Lord. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" (1 Corinthians 3:16). I testify that you are holy, that just by being born, divinity is abiding within you, waiting to be uncovered--to be<i>re</i>born. God bless you in your search for the sacred center of your soul, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Patricia T. Holland, wife of Jeffrey R.

<br>
<h2><b>How Do We Respond?</b></h2><br>Tonight I would like to talk with you about your rightful inheritance--that which you are heir to, your birthright. Some months ago I visited a sacrament meeting in another ward. It was a missionary farewell for a friend of mine. After a few words of greeting and the opening song and prayer, the bishop attended to some ward business. Then, looking out across the audience as though there was only one of his flock he cared for at that moment, he asked, "Chad, are you here?"<br><br>Immediately the sound of a folding chair knocking noisily against another could be heard. A young boy a few rows ahead of me made his way awkwardly into the aisle. As he turned to maneuver past the chairs, I observed that his facial features showed some abnormality. It appeared that he may not have the same mental abilities as other young people his age. He was facing life with obvious handicaps, or so it seemed.<br><br>I watched with others as this young man, with great enthusiasm, literally ran in his awkward way, making his short legs move as fast as possible from the back where he was sitting, up the full length of the chapel.<br><br>As the bishop put his protective arm around Chad and drew him close for only a moment, the two looked at each other as though it were a private exchange only they understood. With Chad nestled securely in the fold of his arm, the bishop announced with pride to the audience, "Chad has earned his Duty to God Award. He has qualified in every way." Then, glancing down at the young man, he said with deep feeling, "We're all proud of you, Chad."<br><br>Following the presentation there was the usual handshake and an additional warm and sustained embrace. As Chad turned to leave, he broke with tradition and raised his hand high in the air. The bishop understood the signal and responded to Chad's invitation by raising his hand to meet Chad's, giving a resounding clap in the air. Outside the meeting he would likely have added the words, "Give 'em five."<br><br>Chad then turned from the bishop, but before leaving the stand moved enthusiastically toward the chorister, who stood and wrapped him in his arms. I learned later that the man was his father.<br><br>The young boy then left the podium, making his way down the aisle wearing a broad smile with his arm raised high in the air as if to "give "'em five" to every ward member who had helped him along and now shared in his victory.<br><br>It has been months since that memorable Sunday, but in my mind I keep replaying that scene over and over again. What struggles and challenges preceded that day for Chad? Were there times when he might have wanted to give up? Certainly some of the requirements must have been harder for him than they were for others his age. Were there times of discouragement and maybe disappointment? He was smiling when the bishop called him forward to receive his Duty to God Award, but there must have been many times when even duty to God was difficult. I wonder if there were times when Chad, in the privacy of his own heart, asked the Father why--why does it have to be so hard; it doesn't seem fair. And while he waited for the answer, he kept going.<br><br>Each of us has some circumstances that might seem like handicaps, not necessarily like Chad's, but challenges that test our courage and strength, our commitment, and ultimately our faith in a loving Heavenly Father. And how do we respond? It goes on every day.<br><br>A bishop calls. The call is heard, and thousands of you are responding. You who have learned to listen for the call are prepared and ready to respond--you don't wait, you don't walk, you don't stop to explain, you don't ask why. However wearisome the test or whatever the circumstances, however severe the handicaps or steep the road, still you prepare to come running when called.<br><br>As we learn to listen and follow the counsel of the Lord, both written and spoken, we prepare for that day when there will be a call for each of us--a call to come home--not later when we are better prepared, but now. We might hear the words, "Come, my son, my daughter. Come as you are, but come now."<br><br>With unwavering faith in our ultimate reward and our divine inheritance as rightful heirs, will we, like Chad, be prepared to run forward with confidence when we hear that call?<br><br>Alma in the Book of Mormon invites us to envision the alternative:<br><br><i>Can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth? . . .</i><br><br><i>Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?</i><br><br><i>I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.16,18,19?lang=eng#15">Alma 5:16, 18–19</a>]<br><br>The answer to that question is found in the choices we make each and every day. Every choice counts one way or the other. We are free to choose to follow or not to follow, to abide by the law or to disregard it, to have freedom or to forfeit our freedom, to claim our inheritance or to leave it unclaimed.<br><h2><b>Exercising Our Agency</b></h2><br>Several weeks ago, during the time I was giving thought to this message, I was asked to participate in an institute program and speak to a gathering of men in a small chapel. These men had an understanding of law, agency, freedom, blessings, choice, and accountability. To reach the chapel I had to go through tight security, present identification, and be escorted by an officer of the law down a long corridor through sets of metal doors with bars that sounded a haunting echo as the metal clanged against metal. As each door in sequence closed tightly behind me, I knew I was locked in. There was no doubt in my mind about that. As I, with a friend, proceeded down the long corridor, there were odors revealing habits of enslavement. As we approached the chapel we heard a sound that seemed foreign to that setting--beautiful male voices harmonizing with feeling. Entering the meeting that was already in session, I observed each man wearing the same uniform. It wasn't a dark suit and white shirt, although I learned that more than one of them had worn a missionary suit. Their uniforms each had an identification number across their hearts.<br><br>Looking at their numbers I wondered, "Who are they really?" Almost everyone was holding one of the new green hymnbooks. Would you be interested in knowing what song these men who had made choices that robbed them of their freedom and put them behind bars were singing? I wish you could hear that song sung by these men--"How Gentle God's Commands." I'll never hear that song again without reliving that experience. Listen with me to the words:<br><br><i>How gentle God's commands!</i><br><i>How kind his precepts are!</i><br><i>Come, cast your burdens on the Lord</i><br><i>And trust his constant care.</i><br><br><i>Beneath his watchful eye,</i><br><i>His Saints securely dwell;</i><br><i>That hand which bears all nature up</i><br><i>Shall guard his children well.</i><br><br><i>Why should this anxious load</i><br><i>Press down your weary mind?</i><br><i>Haste to your Heav'nly Father's throne</i><br><i>And sweet refreshment find.</i><br><br><i>His goodness stands approved,</i><br><i>Unchanged from day to day;</i><br><i>I'll drop my burden at his feet</i><br><i>And bear a song away.</i><br>["How Gentle God's Commands,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 125]<br><br>Shaking hands with one of the inmates, I introduced myself. "I'm Sister Kapp," I said. "I'm Brother So-and-So," he said. As I looked into his sad eyes, the feeling came over me: My brother, when did you begin to exercise your agency, your freedom, and begin little by little to move from freedom to enslavement and finally imprisonment? Did you not know that you were an heir with a birthright, a divine inheritance? Did you realize you were moving in this direction? Did it begin in high school when the influence of peers spoke louder than the wisdom of parents? Or was it the freedom from parents in the environment of college that opened a door that appeared to lead to freedom and that has now closed and locked behind you? When did the chains that bind begin to form just one small link at a time? Who else shares in the responsibility? Is it perhaps that I am not only my brother's keeper but also my brother's maker? What is the impact of my influence on those around me?<br><br>As children of God we are his heirs, but first we must be tested before we can be trusted with our inheritance--the power and blessings of God our Eternal Father. We can become joint heirs with Jesus Christ with glory added upon our heads forever and ever. Think of it.<br><h2><b>Being Tried and Tempered</b></h2><br>When we come to fully understand our promised blessings, our inheritance, and the mission of the Savior and the price he paid in our behalf to help us claim it, I believe, with that spiritual perspective, that even on our hardest days our tests will hardly seem severe enough. It seems unfathomable that after the price paid by our Savior because of his great love for us, we are still free to choose whether or not that sacrifice in our behalf is accepted or rejected. We are given our agency. "Why?" we ask.<br><br>President Lorenzo Snow taught that<br><br><i>The Lord has determined in His heart that He will try us until He knows what He can do with us. He tried His Son Jesus. Thousands of years before He came upon the earth the Father had watched His course and knew He could depend upon Him when the salvation of worlds should be at stake; and He was not disappointed. So in regard to ourselves, He will try us, and continue to try us, in order that He may place us in the highest positions in life and put upon us the most sacred responsibilities.</i>[<i>The Millennial Star,</i>August 24, 1899, p. 532]<br><br>As we are tried and tempered in the furnace of affliction, it is not to consume us but to refine us, to qualify us, to prove us. Our severe tests are designed to try us "even as Abraham" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.4?lang=eng#p3">D&amp;amp;C 101:4</a>). And if you're not experiencing any tests, I would recommend that you pray for a few, though I suspect that you have enough. It's possible that some of you may even have some to spare or at least swap if you could.<br><br>The temptations and testing begin very early in life and continue so long as we dwell in this mortal state. It begins something like this:<br><br>My little nephew, Kent, was pleading with his mom just before dinnertime to go over to his friend's to play. His mother denied his request. "No," was the answer, "not now." He went outside in his sandpile to ponder. Something in the inherent nature of everyone reaches out for freedom and a desire to exercise agency. Kent's mom looked out the kitchen window and observed this little boy not playing but in thoughtful meditation. All of a sudden he came running to the house. Coming into the kitchen he posed a question: "Mom, what if I go to Dougie's anyway?"<br><br>She said, "Then I guess I would have to discipline you for disobeying."<br><br>He said, "What would you do?"<br><br>Being pressed for an answer without having much time to ponder the magnitude of the disobedience, she said, "I guess I'd have to spank you."<br><br>He thought momentarily and then inquired further concerning the consequence before making his decision: "Would it be with my pants up or on my bare bottom?"<br><br>His mom was not quite prepared for this interrogation but responded, "I guess it would be with your pants up."<br><br>And then he pressed further, "How many times?"<br><br>"Five," she said.<br><br>"Five!" he exclaimed. "Five for just going to Dougie's? That's not fair."<br><br>"It might not seem fair," she explained, "but that's how it is. You suit yourself."<br><br>He needed more information before he made a decision. "Can I go after lunch?" he asked.<br><br>"Kent, if you choose to be obedient and not go over to Dougie's, then after lunch we'll do something even better. You can go with me to pick up your daddy."<br><br>Kent had not known of that alternative. With that in the plan the desire to go to his friend's house was of little consequence. He used his agency, was spared the spanking, and participated in an even more desirable activity.<br><h2><b>Laws and Commandments</b></h2><br>Sometimes we are shortsighted and are not aware of what awaits us just around the corner following our obedience. We do not "receive a witness until after the trial of [our] faith" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6?lang=eng#p5">Ether 12:6</a>). We don't negotiate with our Father in Heaven on these matters. The laws are in place. We know that "there is a law. . . upon which all blessings are predicated," and we know that when we receive any blessing "it is by obedience to that law" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.20?lang=eng#p19">D&amp;amp;C 130:20</a>).<br><br>And so our Father, wanting us to qualify for all of the blessings, has given us laws and commandments. These commandments are given not to restrict us but to redeem us--not to just reform us but to exalt us. Therefore, as Nephi said, "Cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves--to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10.23?lang=eng#p22">2 Nephi 10:23</a>).<br><br>Some of us will resent, resist, even recoil from the apparent restrictions imposed upon us. And so it was in the Savior's time. There were those who didn't like what he taught. "This is an hard saying; who can hear it?" they said. "When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.60-61?lang=eng#p59">John 6:60–61</a>). And we read that "From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.66?lang=eng#p65">John 6:66</a>).<br><br>There are, at least in the minds of some, too many rules, too many commandments, honor codes, housing rules, all kinds of regulations, standards, and restrictions. In the springtime of the year there are even signs that say, "Keep off the grass." These serve as constant reminders. And leaders who love us and believe in us will give of their time to meet with us at regular intervals and help remind us of what we have the capacity to become. Especially in times of discouragement, trials, and tests, leaders will help us, carry our burdens, and believe in us when we may otherwise not even believe in ourselves. Obedience is the key that unlocks the door and sets us free.<br><br>I am reminded of a short, stocky Bolivian woman who roamed the altiplano driving her llama herds day after day with little direction or purpose. It didn't matter too much the direction in which they wandered until one day she was drawn into the gospel net and her spirit responded to truth.<br><br>When she was learning of the mission of the Savior, the meaning of the Atonement and his ultimate sacrifice, and the purpose of her earth life, with her dark eyes now opened wide, she whispered, "You mean he did that for me?" And then, more as a testimony than a question, contemplating the reality of the Atonement, she repeated, "You mean he did that for me?" And he did, brothers and sisters, for you and for me. But if we are to claim our inheritance, we must individually find him.<br><br>Consider how Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, must have felt when he found his brother and told him, "We have found . . . the Christ" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.41?lang=eng#p40">John 1:41</a>), and Philip, too, who told Nathanael, "We have found him. . . . Come and see" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/1.45-46?lang=eng#p44">John 1:45–46</a>).<br><br>Have you found him? Because of the Atonement and by obedience to gospel law, we can find him and become joint heirs with him in the fullness of our Father's kingdom. With this knowledge, what could possibly threaten or put in jeopardy our inheritance? Agency plays a major part. It is with our agency that we cast our vote; and make no mistake, there are influences of an unseen enemy that seek relentlessly to entice us to what appear to be attractive alternatives and will lobby for our vote. Throughout the scriptures we read, "Satan did stir up [their] hearts" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.21?lang=eng#p20">Helaman 6:21</a>)--that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to "carry on the work of darkness" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.29?lang=eng#p28">Helaman 6:29</a>). "It is he who is the author of all sin. . . from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.30?lang=eng#p29">Helaman 6:30</a>), "And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/6.35?lang=eng#p34">Helaman 6:35</a>). We read "that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.39?lang=eng#p38">D&amp;amp;C 29:39</a>).<br><br>Nephi, in concern for his people, asked, "How could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless woe? . . . Why will ye die?" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/7.16-17?lang=eng#p15">Helaman 7:16–17</a>).<br><br>On occasion I hear someone try to excuse themselves of the responsibility of wrong decisions saying, "But the devil made me do it." Such a thought is foolishness. The teachings of President Brigham Young help us better understand our responsibility. He taught that<br><br><i>God is the author of all good; and yet, if you rightly understood yourselves, you would not directly attribute every good act you perform to our Father in heaven, nor to his Son Jesus Christ, nor to the Holy Ghost; neither would you attribute every evil act of a man or a woman to the Devil or his spirits or influences; for man is organized by his Creator to act perfectly independently of all influences there are above or beneath. Those influences are always attending him, and are ready to dictate and direct--to lead him into truth or to lead him to destruction. But is he always guided by those influences in every act? He is not. It is ordained of God that we should act independently in and of ourselves, and the good is present when we need it. If we will ask for it, it is with us.</i>[<i>JD</i>9:122]<br><h2><b>Battling with the Adversary</b></h2><br>Our time is the time spoken of by the prophets when the adversary is aggressively marshalling his forces as never before in the last great battle against righteousness. And he is using the same tactics he employed in his attempts to distract the Savior from his appointed mission. The first was a temptation of the appetite, an inherent craving to satisfy hunger and the demands of the flesh. An uncontrolled appetite attacks one's reasoning. It begins with rationalization, then justification, and finally the actual use of artificial stimulants such as drugs and alcohol and the addicting influence of pornography. When out of hand the result is personal devastation--not freedom, but enslavement. The question, then: "Do I have an appetite for anything that could be enslaving?"<br><br>The second temptation is to have us yield to pride, fashion, vanity, the praises of men, peer influence, and those things that separate us from the things of God. Our hearts become centered on the things of the world rather than on things of the spirit. Popularity, prestige, power, and positions become more important than humility, meekness, and teachability. Does your passion for popularity affect how you dress, where you go, what you do and do not do, publicly and privately, in your apartments and at your parties, on and off campus? Is your inheritance ever in jeopardy?<br><br>As a trustee of this remarkable institution, and one who cares deeply about you young people, I not only wonder but worry about these things. I want you to know that you are on my mind and in my prayers.<br><br>The third temptation is to gratify the hungering for the riches of the world. Some of you will remember the statement of Jeb Stuart McGruder, sentenced to a federal prison for his part in Watergate. He told Judge Sirica, "My ambition obscured my judgment. . . . I know what I have done and your honor knows what I have done." He said that somewhere between his ambition and ideals, he lost his ethical compass (see "McGruder Gets Jail on Watergate,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>Wednesday, May 22, 1974, p. A1).<br><br>Is your ethical compass useful and visible and dependable? Can you say with Job, "till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me"? (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/27.5?lang=eng#p4">Job 27:5</a>). It is true that some people seem to have more temptations than others, and some have greater power of resistance than others. "But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10.13?lang=eng#p12">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).<br><h2><b>Getting the Gospel on the Inside</b></h2><br>There could be no condemnation for our doing what we can't help, but we can help doing the things that violate the laws and commandments. God has given us power to resist these things, and we can call upon him for the strength we lack. And by our habits we gain control. It works like this.<br><br><i>I am your constant companion. I am your greatest helper or heaviest burden. I will push you onward or drag you down to failure. I am completely at your command. Half the things you do, you might just as well turn over to me and I will be able to do them quickly and correctly.</i><br><br><i>I am easily managed. You must merely be firm with me. Show me exactly how you want something done and after a few minutes I will do it automatically. I am the servant of all great men, and alas, of failures as well. Those who are great, I have made great. Those who are failures, I have made failures.</i><br><br><i>I am not a machine, though I work with all the precision of a machine plus the intelligence of man. You may run me for profit or run me for ruin--it makes no difference to me.</i><br><br><i>Take me, train me, be firm with me, and I will place the world at your feet. Be easy with me, and I will destroy you. Who am I? I am habit!</i>[Anonymous]<br><br>It is our habits in relation to the gospel of Jesus Christ that bind us or free us. It is our habits that determine whether our inheritance is to be claimed or unclaimed. We are what we are because of our habits. The habit of striving to keep all of the commandments will change us from what we are to what we are to become. It is a process that changes our souls, our appetites, our desires. When we get the gospel on the inside and make it part of our very being, we have not just changed our habits; our habits have literally changed us--a mighty change.<br><br>We can have the gift of the Holy Ghost with us always, and that gift is more than a prompting to do right and wrong. As Elder Parley P. Pratt wrote,<br><br><i>It quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases, enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections. . . . It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness, and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends to health, vigor, animation and social feeling. It . . . invigorates all the faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, . . . and gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life to the whole being . . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Such is the gift of the Holy Spirit, and such are its operations when received through the lawful channel, the divine, eternal Priesthood.</i>[<i>Key to the Science of Theology</i>(Salt Lake City: George Q. Cannon and Sons, 1891), p. 101]<br><br>One evening last year, just before Christmas, my husband, Heber, and I made our way through the deep snow of an unshoveled walk and rang the door-bell. We were immediately greeted by Brent, an eight-year-old boy. He invited us in. We exchanged greetings with others while Brent stood by, anxiously waiting for the first opportunity to pose a question. In a most forthright and direct way, he simply asked, "Have you ever shaken hands with the prophet?"<br><br>His eagerness gave me reason to believe that he may have rehearsed that question in his mind several times in anticipation of our visit. "Yes, Brent," I said, "I have shaken the hand of the prophet."<br><br>"Oh," he said, "if I could just shake the hand of the prophet."<br><br>Sensing the love and respect Brent obviously felt for our prophet-leader, and wanting to somehow provide a tie between the prophet and the young boy, I reached out my hand. "Brent," I said, "this hand has shaken the hand of the prophet." To that offer he grabbed my hand and shook it vigorously. Then, letting go, he turned his right hand over from front to back to examine it thoroughly. "I'll never wash my hand," he said.<br><br>I suggested that he probably should wash his hand and just keep the memory in his mind. This suggestion was not acceptable to Brent. He had a better idea. "Okay," he said, "I'll wash my hand, but I'll save the water." That seemed like a good suggestion, although I supposed he was only joking.<br><br>A few minutes later, he came into the room carrying a plastic bag dripping with water. Before anyone could question him, he proudly announced, "I washed my hand," holding the bag full of water for all to see. Brent sat on the floor facing the Christmas tree, his knees poking through his faded blue jeans. From the corner of my eye I watched him examine the bag full of water as if he were expecting to see some evidence that it was holy water.<br><br>As we continued visiting, Brent got up and, taking his treasure with him, left the room. He returned again, this time without the plastic bag full of water. He had determined a better solution. Brent stood there in the doorway with his faded gray T-shirt wet all the way down the front. Without hesitation he gave a complete explanation. "I drank the water," he said.<br><br>Brent's creative solution was not to be viewed as a joke or something to make fun of. He was serious. He was carrying something important--not on the outside where he could lay it down, but on the inside. The water from the hand that he had washed that had shaken the hand of someone who had shaken the hand of the prophet was now part of him, on the inside, and he wanted to keep it there. He seemed very pleased with his solution.<br><br>Would it really make any difference? I wondered. What did it really mean to Brent? It was much more than water I was sure. It was in sacrament meeting the Sunday before Christmas that I received a deeper understanding of what I felt this young boy, just recently baptized, was feeling and wanting. The sacramental prayer had been offered, and the sacred ordinances were being passed quietly and reverently. It was a time of recommitment and rededication, sorrow for wrongdoings, and resolve and hope with the beginning of a new year to do better.<br><br>The sister on my right passed the sacrament tray and held it while I raised the small cup of water to my lips. Into my mind came the thought, "I want to get this water on the inside." I remembered the baptismal covenant; I thought of the symbolism of the water and the covenants made.<br><br>I remembered what President Marion G. Romney had said:<br><br><i>Now there is a doctrine abroad in the world today which teaches that the physical emblems of the sacrament are transformed into the flesh and blood of Jesus. We do not teach such a doctrine, for we know that any transformation which comes from the administration of the sacrament takes place in the souls of those who understandingly partake of it. It is the participating individuals who are affected, and they are affected in a most marvelous way, for they are given the Spirit of the Lord to be with them.</i>[<i>CR,</i>April 5, 1946, p. 40]<br><br>When we find ourselves out of control for a time, out of harmony, and disappointed in our actions in relation to our desires, we need not despair. There is a place of spiritual repair. We can take our wounded spirit faithfully and regularly to the sacrament altar and there renew our covenants, our commitments, by offering a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Then we begin, in part at least, to feel the healing, the peace, the deep, abiding love when we ponder the meaning of the Atonement in our personal lives. There we will feel what Andrew and Nathanael must have felt and say with them, "We have found Christ. We have found him. Come and see."<br><h2><b>Holding on to the Lifeline</b></h2><br>Come with me if you will, in your mind's eye, to an experience I had while participating in a survival camp with a group of youth in the High Sierras a couple of years ago. After three days of physically challenging and spiritually strengthening experiences, we faced one of the last activities--that of rappelling down an eighty-foot cliff, which from the top looking down appeared to be more like an enormously high mountain. Some of the youth had gone before and some would follow, but now it was my turn.<br><br>I surveyed the setting. Overhead the sky was blue and clear. Looking over the edge of the cliff, it was a long, long way down. The edge of the cliff jutted out so I could not see the landing place at the bottom or the people who would welcome me or pick up the pieces down below. I quickly looked to the sky again to catch my breath. The instructor securely wrapped a strap around my legs and waist, placed the rappelling rope in my hand, and proceeded with instructions. It's fascinating how much better you can listen and concentrate when you know it really matters. He had explained the skill of rappelling and the importance of the safety rope with individual instruction as each took their turn; but when it was my turn, I listened more intently. I wanted to know all that he knew. I didn't want any of the rules of rappelling overlooked or minimized. He told me that the safety rope would secure me, but if I was to get to my destination safely, I had a few things I must do. If I followed the instructions I'd get there safely; if not, I would suffer varying degrees of discomfort according to my ability to follow the instructions. I learned right away that his instructions were accurate as I experienced some discomforting rope burn on my hands.<br><br>Without looking down, but always looking up and straining to listen for instructions, advice, and encouragement, I began to ponder at that halfway position, forty feet from the top and forty feet from the bottom, about this experience.<br><br>Holding onto the rope, I was reminded of the teachings of President George Q. Cannon.<br><br><i>When we went forth into the waters of baptism and covenanted with our Father in heaven to serve Him and keep His commandments, He bound Himself also by covenant to us that He would never desert us, never leave us to ourselves, never forget us, that in the midst of trials and hardships, when everything was arrayed against us, He would be near unto us and would sustain us. That was His covenant.</i>[<i>Gospel Truth; Discourses and Writings of President George</i>Q.<i>Cannon,</i>sel. Jerrald L. Newquist, vol. 1 (Salt Lake City: Zion's Book Store, 1957), August 6, 1893, p. 170]<br><br>The Savior, I thought, bound himself to us. He is our safety rope. He throws out the lifeline--literally, our lifeline. Through obedience to the laws and the commandments, we tie ourselves securely to him. The rope I held was the safety rope. I had my agency. I could hang on or I could let go. Or if I wanted, I could take my pocketknife, exercise my agency, and cut just one fine strand at a time. Surely one strand at a time would be no risk. I likened the rope to the commandments. I can break one commandment at a time. Surely one commandment at a time won't hurt. Would you ever consider letting go of a rope and challenging your ability to survive against the law of gravity? Would you ignore the commandments of God and pit your resistance against the power of the adversary?<br><br>If we choose to hold onto the rope, we are limited, restricted, curtailed, but through that very process our Father in Heaven has said he will make us free. Only after we are tried and tested can we be trusted with our inheritance as heirs to the kingdom of God, joint heirs of Jesus Christ. If you choose to let go of the rope and release yourself from the laws and commandments, you also choose the consequences, because even God obeys the law. Through disobedience to laws we will fall.<br><br>Those men, your brothers and mine, in the prison chose to let go of the rope. They cut themselves free of the laws, they rejected the "hard sayings," and now, within their prison walls, they sing, "How Gentle God's Commands."<br><br>Let us protect ourselves from enslavement and release ourselves from those prison walls of our own making that weaken our grasp on the safety rope--the lifeline, the iron rod. The Savior taught that should one choose to willfully leave his father and waste his inheritance in sin, his repentant return should be treated with rejoicing and acceptance. Thus he illustrated the worth of souls to the Father and the love his disciples should have for each other. Through the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son, Jesus taught that every soul is of great worth in the kingdom of God.<br><br>When we want what he wants, we will have all that we desire and a thousand times more. It was Mary, the mother of the Savior, who exemplified in the most glorious way her preparation and submission to the will of God when she responded to the angel Gabriel, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/1.38?lang=eng#p37">Luke 1:38</a>).<br><br>The Lord said, "Come . . . follow me" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/19.21?lang=eng#p20">Matthew 19:21</a>). I know from my own experience that on those occasions when we follow with full purpose of heart, acting with integrity--no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with all intent, repenting of our sins (see <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.13?lang=eng#p12">2 Nephi 31:13</a>)--we can feel that quiet assurance that we are free, free from the chains that bind; free from darkness, unbelief; free from depression, anger, hatred; free from jealousies, envy, cravings of the appetite, hungering for the riches of the world; free from fear; and free to claim our inheritance.<br><br>The way is simple.<br><br><i>"Come, follow me," the Savior said.</i><br><i>Then let us in his footsteps tread,</i><br><i>For thus alone can we be one</i><br><i>With God's own loved, begotten Son.</i><br><br><i>Not only shall we emulate</i><br><i>His course while in this earthly state,</i><br><i>But when we're freed from present cares,</i><br><i>If with our Lord we would be heirs.</i><br><br><i>For thrones, dominions, kingdoms, pow'rs,</i><br><i>And glory great and bliss are ours,</i><br><i>If we, throughout eternity,</i><br><i>Obey his words, "Come, follow me."</i><br>["Come, Follow Me,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 116]<br><br>As we consider that day when the bishop called, "Chad, are you here?" and he came running, we can anticipate a similar day for each of us. As Latter-day Saints, let us keep ever in our minds an anticipation of that glorious day. President George Q. Cannon helps us envision that event with these words:<br><br><i>We are the children of God, and as His children there is no attribute we ascribe to Him that we do not possess, though they may be dormant or in embryo. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . we existed with Him in the family relationship as His children.</i><br><br><i>. . . when we see our Father in heaven</i>[again]<i>we shall know Him; and the recollection that we were once with Him and that He was our Father will come back to us, and we will fall upon His neck, and He will fall upon us, and we will kiss each other. We will know our Mother, also.</i>[<i>Gospel Truth,</i>vol. 1, pp. 1, 3]<br><br>I can believe that with outstretched arms our Father will say, "My son, my daughter, I have you again." And we will respond, "Oh, my father, my mother, I am home again." Then we will, when prepared, receive our inheritance and become the sons and daughters of God--heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ--to this I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>True Greatness? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am happy to be with you today. Over the years the Brethren have had dreams and visions regarding Brigham Young University, yet such hopes and prophetic utterances are not self-executing. They are fulfilled by righteous and devoted people who make the prophecies come true. Your generation now shares in this responsibility. Part of your privilege while you are at BYU is not only to become acquainted with some of humanity's noblest knowledge and achievements, but to participate in personal and spiritual development in this ideal setting.<br><br>President David O. McKay once observed that<br><br><i>"the university is not a dictionary, a dispensary, nor is it a department store. It is more than a storehouse of knowledge and more than a community of scholars. The University life is essentially an exercise in thinking, preparing, and living." ... It must concern itself with not only the dispensing of facts, but with the preparation of its students</i>to<i>take their place in society as thinking, thoughtful, and sensitive individuals who ... come here dedicated to love of God, pursuit of truth, and service</i>to<i>mankind.</i>[Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1975</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1976), p. 250]<br><br>For many of you, these years invested at BYU will be among the most challenging and rigorous, yet rewarding of your life. Many of you presently are happy and enjoying the opportunities given to you. Some of you are even ready for your next exam.<br><br>Yet I am concerned that some among us today are undoubtedly unhappy. Some of us feel we are falling short of our expected ideals. I have particular concern for those who have lived righteously, but think--because they haven't achieved in the world or in the Church what others have achieved--that they have failed. Each of us desires to achieve a measure of greatness in this life. And why shouldn't we? As someone once noted, there is within each of us a giant struggling with celestial homesickness.<br><br>Realizing who we are and what we may become assures us that with God nothing really is impossible. From the time we learn that Jesus wants us for a Sunbeam until we learn more fully the basic principles of the gospel, we are taught to strive for perfection. It is not new to us then to talk of the importance of achievement. The difficulty arises when inflated expectations of the world alter our definition of greatness.<br><br>What is true greatness? What is it that makes a person great?<br><h2><b>The World's Heroes</b></h2><br>We live in a world that seems to worship its own kind of greatness and produce its own kind of heroes. A<i>U.S. News and World Report</i>survey of young people ages 18 through 24 revealed that today's youth prefer the "strong, go-it-alone, conquer-against-all-odds individuals," and clearly seek to pattern their lives after the glamorous and "boundlessly rich." During the 1950s, heroes included Winston Churchill, missionary Albert Schweitzer, President Harry Truman, Queen Elizabeth II, and Helen Keller, the blind and deaf writer-lecturer. These were figures who either helped shape history or were noted for inspiring sacrifice. Today among the top ten heroes are Clint Eastwood, Eddie Murphy, and Jane Fonda (see "Heroes Are Back,"<i>U.S. News and World Report,</i>April 22, 1985, pp. 44–48). That brief list suggests something of a shift in our attitudes.<br><br>It's true that most of the world's heroes don't last very long in the public mind, but, nevertheless, there is never a lack of champions and great achievers. We hear almost daily of athletes breaking records; scientists inventing marvelous new devices, machines, and processes; and doctors saving lives in new ways. We are constantly being exposed to exceptionally gifted musicians and entertainers, also to the work of unusually talented artists, architects, and builders. Magazines, billboards, and television commercials bombard us with pictures of individuals with perfect teeth and flawless features, wearing stylish clothes, and doing whatever it is that successful people do.<br><br>Because we are being constantly exposed to the world's definition of greatness, it is understandable that we might find ourselves making comparisons between what we are and what others are, or seem to be, and also between what we have and what others have. Although it is true that making comparisons can be beneficial and may motivate us to accomplish much good and improve our lives, yet we often allow unfair and improper comparisons to destroy our happiness when they cause us to feel unfulfilled or inadequate or unsuccessful. Sometimes, because of these feelings, we are led into error, and we dwell on our failures while ignoring aspects of our lives that may contain elements of true greatness.<br><br>In a short editorial written by President Joseph F. Smith in 1905, he made this most profound statement about what true greatness really is. These are his words:<br><br><i>Those things which we call extraordinary, remarkable, or unusual may make history, but they do not make real life.</i><br><br><i>After all, to do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all mankind, is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman.</i>[<i>Juvenile Instructor,</i>15 Dec. 1905, p. 752]<br><br>This statement raises a query as to what are the things God has ordained to be the common lot of all mankind. Surely they include the things that must be done in order to be a good father or a good mother, a good son or a good daughter, a good student or good roommate or good neighbor.<br><h2><b>Thousands of Little Deeds</b></h2><br>Pablo Casals, the world's greatest cellist, spent the morning of the day he died, at the age of 95, practicing scales on his cello. Giving consistent effort in the little things in day-to-day life leads to true greatness. Specifically, it is the thousands of little deeds and tasks of service and sacrifice that constitute the giving or losing of one's life for others and for the Lord. They include gaining a knowledge of our Father in Heaven and of the gospel. They also include bringing others into the faith and fellowship of his kingdom. These things do not usually receive the attention or the adulation of the world.<br><br>Joseph Smith is not generally remembered as a general, mayor, architect, editor, or presidential candidate. We remember him as a prophet of the Restoration, a man committed to the love of God and the furthering of his work. Joseph was an everyday Christian. He was concerned about the small things, the daily tasks of service and caring for others. Elder Lyman O. Littlefield was a thirteen-year-old boy who accompanied the camp of Zion when it went up to Missouri. He later narrated this incident of a small, yet personally significant act of service in the life of the Prophet. He said:<br><br><i>The journey was extremely toilsome for all, and the physical suffering, coupled with the knowledge of the persecutions endured by our brethren whom we were traveling to succor, caused me to lapse one day into a state of melancholy. As the camp was making ready to depart I sat tired and brooding by the roadside. The Prophet was the busiest man of the camp; and yet when he saw me, he turned from the great press of other duties to say a word of comfort to a child. Placing his hand upon my head, he said, "Is there no place for you, my boy? If not, we must make one." This circumstance made an impression upon my mind which long lapse of time and cares of riper years have not effaced.</i>[George Q. Cannon,<i>Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1986), p. 344]<br><br>On another occasion, when Governor Carlin of Illinois sent Thomas King, sheriff of Adams County and several others as a posse to apprehend the Prophet and deliver him to the scandalous emissaries of Governor Boggs of Missouri, Sheriff King became deathly ill. At Nauvoo the Prophet took the sheriff to his home and nursed him like a brother for four days (Cannon, p. 373). Small, kind, and significant acts of service were not occasional to the Prophet.<br><br>Writing about the opening of the store in Nauvoo, George Q. Cannon records:<br><br><i>The Prophet himself did not hesitate to engage in mercantile and industrial pursuits; the gospel which he preached was one of temporal salvation as well as spiritual exaltation; and he was willing to perform his share of the practical labor</i>.<i>This he did with no thought of personal gain.</i>[Cannon, p. 385–86]<br><br>And in a letter, the Prophet said:<br><br><i>The store has been filled to overflowing and I have stood behind the counter all day, distributing goods as steadily as any clerk you ever saw, to oblige those who were compelled to go without their Christmas and New Year's dinners for the want of a little sugar, molasses, raisins, etc.; and to please myself also, for I love to wait upon the Saints and to be a servant to all, hoping that I may be exalted in the due time of the Lord.</i>[Cannon, p. 386]<br><br>George Q. Cannon then comments:<br><br><i>What a picture is presented here! A man chosen by the Lord to lay the foundation of His Church and to be its Prophet and President, takes joy and pride in waiting upon his brethren and sisters like a servant. The self-elected ministers of Christ in the world are forever jealous of their dignity and fearful of showing disrespect to their cloth; but Joseph never saw the day when he did not feel that he was serving God and obtaining favor in the sight of Jesus Christ by showing kindness and attention "even unto the least of these."</i>[Cannon, p. 386]<br><br>To be a successful elders quorum secretary or Relief Society teacher or loving neighbor or listening friend is much of what true greatness is all about. To do one's best in the face of the commonplace struggles of life, and possibly in the face of failures, and to continue to endure and persevere with the ongoing difficulties of life--when those struggles and tasks contribute to the progress and happiness of others and the eternal salvation of one's self--this is true greatness.<br><h2><b>Things of the Greatest Worth</b></h2><br>I am reasonably assured all of you want to achieve a measure of greatness in this life. Many of you want to be leaders in your chosen fields--corporate presidents, statesmen, musicians, or artists. We encourage you to achieve. At the same time we encourage you to remember who you are. Don't let the illusion of fleeting worldly greatness overcome you. Many people are losing their souls to such temptations. All one needs to do is look at the recent scandals uncovered on Wall Street. Your good name is not worth selling for any price. True greatness is to remain true--"True to the faith that our parents have cherished, true to the truth for which martyrs have perished" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 254).<br><br>I am confident that there are many great, unnoticed, and forgotten heroes among us today. I am speaking of those of you who quietly and consistently do the things you ought to do. I am talking about those who are always there and always willing. I am referring to the uncommon valor of the mother who--hour after hour, day and night--will stay with and care for a sick child while her husband is off to school. I'm including those who always volunteer to give blood or volunteer to work with the elderly. I am thinking about those of you who faithfully fulfill your priesthood and church responsibilities. I am thinking of the student who writes home regularly to thank Mom and Dad for their support.<br><br>I am also talking about teachers and administrators who teach and instill faith and a desire to learn in the hearts of their students--who actively work to build and mold the lives of others physically, socially, and spiritually. I am referring to those who are honest and kind and hardworking in their daily work, but who are also servants of the Master and shepherds of his sheep.<br><br>Now, I do not mean to discount the great accomplishments of the world that have given us so many opportunities and provide culture and order and excitement to our lives. I am merely suggesting that we try to focus more clearly on the things in life that will be of greatest worth. You will remember that it was the Savior who said, "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant" (Matthew 23:11).<br><br>Each of us has seen individuals become wealthy or successful almost instantaneously, almost overnight. But I believe that even though this kind of success may come to some without prolonged struggle, there is no such thing as instant greatness. This is because the achievement of true greatness is a long-term process. It may involve occasional setbacks. The end result may not always be clearly visible, but it seems that it always requires regular, consistent, small, and sometimes ordinary and mundane steps over a long period of time. We should remember that it was the Lord who said: "Out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>True greatness is never a result of a chance occurrence or a one-time effort or achievement. It requires the development of character. It requires a multitude of correct decisions for the everyday choices between good and evil that Elder Boyd K. Packer spoke about when he said, "Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value" (<i>Ensign,</i>Nov. 1980, p. 21). Those choices will also show clearly what we are.<br><br>As we evaluate our lives, it is important that we look, not only at our accomplishments, but also at the conditions under which we have labored. We are all different and unique individuals. We have each had different starting points in the race of life. We each have a unique mixture of talents and skills. We each have our own set of challenges and constraints to contend with. Therefore, our judgment of ourselves and our achievements should not merely include the size or magnitude and number of our accomplishments; it should also include the conditions that have existed and the effect that our efforts have had on others.<br><br>It is this last aspect of our self-evaluation--the effect of our lives on the lives of others--that will help us understand why some of the common, ordinary work of life should be valued so highly. Frequently it is the commonplace tasks that have the greatest positive effect on the lives of others, as compared with the things that the world so often relates to greatness.<br><br>It appears to me that the kind of greatness our Father in Heaven would have us pursue is within the grasp of all who are within the gospel net. We have an unlimited number of opportunities to do the many simple and minor things that will ultimately make us great. To those who have devoted their lives to service and sacrifice for their families, for others and for the Lord, the best counsel is simply to do more of the same.<br><br>To those who are furthering the work of the Lord in so many quiet but significant ways, to those who are the salt of the earth and the strength of the world and the backbone of each nation--to you we would simply express our admiration. If you endure to the end, and if you are valiant in the testimony of Jesus, you will achieve true greatness and will live in the presence of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>As President Joseph F. Smith has said, "Let us not be trying to substitute an artificial life for the true one" (<i>Juvenile Instructor,</i>15 Dec. 1905, p. 753). Let us remember that doing the things that have been ordained by God to be important and needful and necessary, even though the world may view them as unimportant and insignificant, will eventually lead to true greatness.<br><br>We should strive to remember the words of the Apostle Paul, especially if we are unhappy with our lives, feeling that we have not achieved some form of greatness. He wrote:<br><br><i>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</i><br><br><i>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal</i>. [2 Corinthians 4:17–18]<br><br>The small things are significant. We remember not the amount offered by the Pharisee, but the widow's mite, not the power and strength of the Philistine army, but the courage and conviction of David.<br><br>That we may never be discouraged in doing those daily tasks that God has ordained to the common lot of man is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Howard W. Hunter was Acting President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 10 February 1987.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ing Power” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I will never lose the feeling of awe that comes over me when I enter this great building and gaze upon this vast sea of faces, the students of Brigham Young University. To me it is overwhelming to see all of you gathered here together and realize the great responsibility we both have--you, to your committed course of study and everything else that goes with being on your own in a college setting, and me, to help provide useful guidance and counsel to you. I hope you know of my love for each of you. I hope you feel of my concern for your welfare. I do care about you and want the best out of life for each of you.<br><br>As I pondered this assignment, I discovered in my raw materials file an article entitled, "On Staying Power." It was written by John Wooden, the legendary coach for UCLA, and printed in the<i>Wall Street Journal</i>on April 23, 1986. It reads in part:<br><br><i>Like most coaches, my program revolved around fundamentals, conditioning, and teamwork. But I differ radically in several respects. I never tried to get my team "up" for a game emotionally, I never worried about how our opponents would play us, and I never talked about winning.</i><br><br><i>I believe that for every artificial peak you create, you also create valleys. When you get too high for anything, emotion takes over and consistency of performance is lost and you will be unduly affected when adversity comes. I emphasized constant improvement and steady performance.</i><br><br><i>I have often said, "The mark of a true champion is to always perform near your own level of competency." We were able to do that by never being satisfied with the past and always planning for what was to come. I believe that failure to prepare is preparing to fail. This constant focus on the future is one reason we continued staying near the top once we got there.</i><br><br><i>I probably scouted opponents less than any coach in the country. Less than most high school coaches. I don't need to know that this forward likes to drive the outside. You're not supposed to give the outside to any forward whenever he tries it. Sound offensive and defensive principles apply to any style of play.</i><br><br><i>Rather than having my teams prepare to play a certain team each week, I prepared to play anybody. I didn't want my players worrying about the other fellows. I wanted them executing the sound offensive and defensive principles we taught in practice.</i><br><br><i>To me, success isn't outscoring someone, it's the peace of mind that comes from self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best. That's something each individual must determine for himself. You can fool others, but you can't fool yourself.</i>[<i>Wall Street Journal,</i>April 23, 1986, p. 39]<br><br>From the philosophy of this great coach, John Wooden, there are three principles I would like to discuss with you here today. The<i>first</i>is to develop a pattern in your life of consistently doing the best with the talents given you by our Father in Heaven.<i>Second,</i>subscribe to basic principles that are always appropriate for any situation or season of life.<i>Third,</i>develop character, rather than worry about your reputation.<br><h2><b>Principle Number One</b></h2><br>Develop a consistency in your lives of always trying to do the best with the talents you have. One of my favorite scriptures is found in the eighth chapter of Psalms.<br><br><i>O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who has set thy glory above the heavens. . . .</i><br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</i>[Psalms 8:1, 3–5]<br><br>I guess this scripture appeals to me because I like to think of myself as a junior angel with the power and opportunity of an eternal being. I am absolutely amazed as I watch the growth and development of the next generation in our family. I study the emergence of each of our grandchildren, and I marvel at how different each one is in appearance and personality, even though they all come from a common heritage and a similar environment.<br><br>Let me describe my three oldest grandsons from each of the families of my three children. The son of my eldest daughter is a student. He leads his class, he is very disciplined, he schedules himself very carefully. He is consistently goal-oriented. I remember how frustrated I used to become when I would baby-sit. I would gather the children around me and read them a story before they retired to bed. The clock would strike eight o'clock, and my grandson would announce to the others that it was time to go to bed. He wouldn't allow me to even finish the page, not even a sentence. Eight o'clock is the established bedtime, and that was it.<br><br>My son's eldest boy is our great debater. He has a sound argument supported by numerous facts for everything he doesn't want to do. His reasoning is often brilliant. He also has an attention span for things he enjoys doing that is most uncommon for a child his age. He is unusually fascinated with animal and insect life. I have watched him sit by the hour observing a spider disposing of a fly entrapped in its web.<br><br>The son of my youngest daughter has a fascination for anything mechanical. A screwdriver in his hand is almost a lethal weapon. When he had just learned to walk, I took him on a tour of Temple Square to show him the beautiful flowers, trees, and buildings. He had no interest in them whatsoever. He wanted to spend his time trying to find every sprinkler head on the grounds to test them and see if they were screwed in tightly.<br><br>All three grandsons spring from the same family tree, but, oh, how different each of them will be in appearance and talent as they grow to maturity.<br><br>It is the same with each of us as creations of our Father in Heaven. We have been given an abundance of talent, beauty, and ability. Lack of progress can never be blamed on the lack of raw material. Richard L. Evans once wrote:<br><br><i>We know of no one in life who isn't an Important Person. We know of no man on the street (or in the gutter, for that matter) who isn't a child of God with the same rights and with the same relationship to his Father in heaven as all the rest of us have.</i><br><br><i>We know of no one, young or old, from infants to elderly individuals, whose past or whose potential we would want to appraise as being unimportant. We know of no one we might see in any public place--on subways or busses, or walking in shabby shoes--or any boy selling papers,</i>. . .<i>who doesn't have an inestimable, unknown potential, here and in the hereafter.</i>[Richard L. Evans, Jr.,<i>Richard L. Evans--The Man and the Message</i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, Inc., 1973), p. 304]<br><br>What is needed, then, is for us to make this mortal experience one that is rewarding and fulfilling by developing a consistency in doing our best with whatever talents the Lord has blessed us with. I was thrilled with the talk Peter Vidmar gave in the priesthood session of general conference after he had successfully won his Olympic gold medals. His theme was that the Lord had blessed him with a talent. It was his responsibility to make himself a champion. His formula was simple. He spent fifteen minutes longer each day perfecting his routines than any of those competing against him. The multiplication of those extra fifteen minutes daily gave him the edge and prepared him for winning the gold medals in the Olympics.<br><h2><b>Principle Number Two</b></h2><br>Subscribe to basic, tried-and-true principles. Just as Coach Wooden taught that it was fundamental never to give the outside to any forward who tries to drive around you, there are basic principles of life we can always live by. One of these principles is integrity. Integrity is tantamount to good character. It is the one trait that reaches all facets of our life and touches each aspect of our personality.<br><br>The Lord loves those who have integrity. He said about the Prophet's brother Hyrum Smith, "And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 124:15).<br><br>What is the meaning of integrity? We can find several definitions in the dictionary: (1) rigid adherence to a code or standard of values; (2) moral soundness, especially as it relates to steadfastness to truth, purpose, responsibility, or trust; (3) moral and ethical strength; (4) the quality of being honest; (5) the quality of being whole, complete, undivided.<br><br>We can describe a person of integrity, therefore, as a person who is honest and genuine, trustworthy and honorable. He is loyal, truthful, upright, virtuous, fair, and consistent. A person with integrity is faithful, incorruptible, praiseworthy, reliable, and steadfast.<br><br>We have not been left without abundant evidence of the blessings that follow those who have integrity. In the Old Testament there was Job, described by the Lord as a man who was perfect and upright.<br><br>As Job suffered untold trials and tribulations, his wife said to him, "Dost thou still retain thine integrity?" (Job 2:9). Even with all of his problems and challenges, Job sinned not (see Job 1:22). And the Lord still described him thus: "There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil. . . and still he holdeth fast his integrity" (Job 2:3).<br><br>When Job's friends complained of all the hardships he suffered, he said:<br><br><i>All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</i><br><br><i>My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</i><br><br><i>God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</i><br><br><i>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go.</i>[Job 27:3–6]<br><br>Job invited judgment from God so "that God may know mine integrity" (Job 31:6). Job's conscience was clear, for he knew he was honest and upright in all of his endeavors. He would never compromise his integrity.<br><br>It was the Savior, himself, who declared, "He that doeth truth cometh to the light" (John 3:21). Throughout our history we have honored those who would serve with honesty and integrity. Every American applauds the honesty and integrity of Abraham Lincoln when he trudged miles to return a customer's change.<br><br>Lincoln said at one time, "I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true; I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have" (Spencer W. Kimball,<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>[Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1972], p. 246).<br><br>Lincoln also said, "Stand with anybody that stands right. . . . And part with him when he goes wrong" (<i>Speech,</i>Peoria, Illinois, 16 October 1854). Lincoln was so wise that he knew there was no freedom for any man while another man was held a slave. No man today could doubt the honesty and heart of this great man. He charmed men with his integrity and nobility of soul. His life was spent in serving humanity, and his example bears record that honor is an essential element in building a great nation.<br><br>There are times when we have watched with alarm as leaders in our community, state, and nation have lost their popularity and their ability to function because of their failure to be honest and honorable.<br><br>Our thirteenth article of faith begins with the statement, "We believe in being honest." We do not believe in honesty merely as a matter of policy. It is far more important than that. Honesty is a principle of salvation in the kingdom of God.<br><br>I will always be grateful that my tenure as a General Authority reaches back to the time when N. Eldon Tanner was a member of the First Presidency. He was recognized throughout the United States and Canada as "Mr. Integrity." There was never any question about a Church contract being valid so long as President Tanner had approved the action. Many times I sat in financial meetings where staff members proposed questionable actions that might be considered common practice in a country in which we were doing business. President Tanner quickly and absolutely turned them down because they did not conform to his definition of honesty. And that's what he expected in all of our Church dealings.<br><br>He said this:<br><br><i>The integrity of which we speak is not impossible to attain. In fact, we should all be convinced that it is far easier to emulate the example of our Savior than it is to follow Satan, whose path leads us away from integrity and into darkness and misery. There is no happiness in sin, and when we depart from the path of righteousness we begin to do those things which will inevitably lead us to unhappiness and misery and loss of freedom.</i>["Integrity,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1977, p. 17]<br><br>Elder Faust describes integrity as "the light that shines from a disciplined conscience. It is the strength of duty within us" (James E. Faust, "lntegrity, the Mother of Many Virtues,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1982, p. 47).<br><br>Moses gave us the following counsel: "If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth" (Numbers 30:2).<br><br>And Elder Faust reminds us that<br><br><i>The power of keeping an oath was manifested by Nephi, who held Zoram, the frightened servant of Laban, to keep him from fleeing. Dr. Hugh Nibley has written: "Nephi, a powerful fellow, held the terrified Zoram in a vise-like grip long enough to swear a solemn oath in his ear, 'as the Lord liveth, and as I live' (1 Ne. 4:32), that he would not harm him if he would listen. Zoram immediately relaxed, and Nephi swore another oath to him that he would be a free man if he would join the party. . . .</i><br><br><i>". . . As soon as Zoram made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth . . . our fears did cease concerning him."</i>[Faust, p. 47]<br><br>I learned early in my business career that dishonesty is almost like a disease. It requires a great deal of medication to effect a cure. I hate to admit it, but in my earlier business experience, every time I exercised compassion in giving a person a second chance after catching them in a dishonest act, I caught them later in a repeat performance. It almost seemed as if they had to hit the bottom and suffer severe punishment before there was any hope of administering a cure.<br><br>I am sure that one of the great blessings of enrollment in this university is that you have committed yourself to live by a prescribed Code of Honor. Each of you, as you enroll at Brigham Young University, promises by signing your good name on an entrance application that you will keep all of the requirements of the school's Honor Code. You promise that:<br><br><i>I will live the law of chastity. I will live the Word of Wisdom. I will respect the property rights of others. I will not become involved in drug abuse. I will comply with all university regulations. I will respect the personal rights of others. I will be honest in all my behavior. I will live the standards of the Church. I will observe the high standards of taste and decency. I will help others fulfill their responsibilities under the Code of Honor. I will observe standards of dress and grooming.</i><br><br>It is vitally important that we are honest in our acts and adhere to these standards. You signed a pledge! Your integrity is now at stake. Most of you will have the courage to live by the high standards required here. You will emerge with a habit of being honest and trustworthy. It will be the highest distinction you can achieve from your schooling at Brigham Young University. You will distinguish yourself along all avenues of life as one who can be trusted without question. This integrity, which you can develop and strengthen here, is of infinite and eternal value.<br><br>A few of you will violate the Code of Honor and either be discovered or voluntarily confess to the violation. Either course will be hard to handle, but how much better off you will be than those who lie and cheat their way through school. They will leave here with a disease. Someday it will be discovered. The longer it takes, the more devastating it will be to them. If you have a problem, correct it now! The longer you wait, the more deeply the disease of dishonesty infects your soul, and the greater its damage can be to your eternal nature.<br><br>It was Brigham Young who said:<br><br><i>Simple truth, simplicity, honesty, uprightness, justice, mercy, love, kindness, do good to all and evil to none, how easy it is to live by such principles! A thousand times easier than to practice deception!</i>[<i>DBY,</i>p. 232]<br><br>May we all live to say as Job said, "Till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me" (Job 27:5).<br><h2><b>Principle Number Three</b></h2><br>Develop character.<i>Webster's Dictionary</i>defines character as three distinctive traits: behavior typical of a group or person, moral strength, and reputation. President David O. McKay relates an experience of standing in a sculptor's yard in Florence, Italy. There he observed unbroken, irregular pieces of granite from which the sculptor would create a work of art. In the yard he also observed a magnificent figure, a statue of David, carved over 400 years ago from pieces of stone as crude as those seen around the yard. He then compared the carving of the stone to the carving of a soul and asked the question, "Is it going to be a deformed one, or is it going to be something admired and beautiful for time and throughout all eternity?"<br><br>He reminds us that it is our responsibility to carve out our own lives, to carve out the character we would like to have, and that our tools are our ideas and our thoughts.<br><br>It has often been said:<br><br><i>Sow a thought, and you reap an act;</i><br><i>Sow an act, and you reap a habit;</i><br><i>Sow a habit, and you reap a character;</i><br><i>Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.</i><br>[Quoted by Samuel Smiles in<i>Life and Labor,</i>1887]<br><br>Man becomes ultimately what he thinks and does. Habits become the vehicle molding his character. What kind of character and destiny are you after? Our acts are the outgrowth of our beliefs and our thoughts. Good habits are not acquired by just resolves, but are developed in the workshop of our daily lives. They are fashioned in often uneventful, commonplace routines of life, and acquired by practice.<br><br>President Ernest L. Wilkinson once said:<br><br><i>Good character is not something to be obtained by ease and indulgence, or by something socially agreeable. It cannot be acquired by absorption or by proxy, or on the auction block. It is a reward derived from honest trial in overcoming difficulties. We grow by mastering tasks which others consider to be impossible.</i><br><br>Thus, every day you are forming habits that will be part of your life forever. The principles of morality, sincerity, honesty, and integrity are worth all of the effort it takes to make them an integral part of your personality and character. Samuel Johnson, one of England's famous authors, wrote, "The chains of habit are generally too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken"<i>(International Dictionary of Thoughts</i>[Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969], p. 348).<br><br>Habits are not made or broken easily. It takes desire, repetition, and time to form them, whether they be good or bad.<br><br>Many years ago, when the railroad was finally crossing the country regularly, President Brigham Young said to a group of Church members:<br><br><i>We want the Saints to increase in goodness, until our mechanics. . . are so honest and reliable that this Railroad Company will say, "Give us a Mormon elder for an engineer, then none need have the least fear to ride, for if he knows there is danger he will take every measure necessary to preserve the lives of those entrusted to his care." I want to see our elders so full of integrity that they will be preferred by this Company for their engine builders, watchmen, engineers, clerks and business managers.</i>[<i>JD</i>12:300]<br><br>The prophets through the ages have counseled us and encouraged us to build the type of character that would be entirely trustworthy and responsible in anything we do. Paul warned the Galatians:<br><br><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i><br><br><i>For he that soweth</i>to<i>his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</i><br><br><i>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</i>[Galatians 6:7–9]<br><br>John Wooden concludes his article in this way:<br><br><i>I always taught players that the main ingredient of stardom is the rest of the team. It's amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit. That's why I was as concerned with a player's character as I was with his ability.</i><br><br><i>While it may be possible to reach the top of one's profession on sheer ability, it is impossible to stay there without hard work and character. One's character may be quite different from one's reputation.</i><br><br><i>Your character is what you really are. Your reputation is only what others think you are. I made a determined effort to evaluate character. I looked for young men who would play the game hard, but clean, and who would always be trying to improve themselves to help the team. Then, if their ability warranted it, the championships would take care of themselves.</i>[Wooden, p. 39]<br><br>And so, my dear friends, the message I would like to leave with you today is to hold fast to those basic principles that are tried and true. Consistently develop your talents, hold fast to your integrity, and build your character. These are principles that will not depreciate with time. Why? Because they are God-given principles founded on eternal truths, and will endure through time and for all eternity.<br><br>It is as certain as life itself that real joy comes from partaking of the fruit that will never perish. Real tragedy comes from following a path that only leads to heartache and misery. God has revealed his will to mankind. He has charted a course that will lead us back to the joy of his eternal presence. Of this I bear solemn witness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1> Spirit: The Magnificence of Man - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I invite you to ponder things magnificent. To assist, let us define the word<i>magnificent.</i>It is derived from two Latin roots. The prefix<i>magni</i>comes from a term meaning "great." The suffix comes from the Latin<i>facere,</i>meaning "to make" or "to do." A simple definition of<i>magnificent</i>then might be "great deed" or "greatly made."<br><br>Think, if you will, of the most magnificent sight you have ever seen. It could be a meadow in springtime filled with beautiful wildflowers. Or perhaps you have been awestruck, as I have, at the magnificence of a single rose with its special beauty and perfume. I have come to appreciate the magnificence of an orange--each droplet of juice neatly packaged in an edible container, joined with many other packets, grouped in sections, and all neatly wrapped in a disposable, biodegradable peel.<br><br>Some would say the most magnificent sight they have ever beheld is looking heavenward on a summer night, seeing stars beyond number dotting the sky. Those who have traveled in orbit through space say that their view of planet earth was one of the most magnificent sights ever observed by man.<br><br>Some might choose the view of the Grand Canyon at sunrise--others, the beauty of a mountain lake, river, waterfall, or desert.<br><br>Some might select a peacock with its tail in full fan or a handsome horse. Others would nominate the beauty of butterfly wings, or a hummingbird seemingly suspended in midair while feeding.<br><br>These magnificent sights are wondrous beyond measure. They are all "great deeds" of our divine Creator.<br><br>You may be surprised at what I am going to suggest now. Ponder the magnificence of all you see when you look in the mirror. Ignore the freckles, unruly hair, or blemishes, and look beyond to see the real you--a child of God created by him, in his image.<br><br>Tonight I would like to peek beyond the surface we see in the mirror, lift the lid on the treasure chest of understanding the marvelous attributes of your body, and discover, at least in part, the magnificence of man.<br><br>Time won't permit us to do more than sample some of the glittering jewels of magnificence in this treasure chest, but we might reach in and look at some of the gems awaiting our view.<br><h2><b>Embryonic Development</b></h2><br>In the first compartment of the treasure chest, we might look at the magnificence of our creation itself.<br><br>We don't know precisely how two germ cells unite to become a human embryo, but we do know that both the female cell and the male cell contain all the new individual's total hereditary material and information, stored in a space so small it cannot be seen by the naked eye. Twenty-three chromosomes from both the father and the mother unite in one new cell. These chromosomes contain thousands of genes. A marvelous process of genetic coding is established by which all the basic human characteristics of the unborn person are determined. A new DNA complex is thus formed. A continuum of growth is instituted that results in a new human being. Approximately twenty-two days after those two germ cells have united, a little heart begins to beat. At twenty-six days the circulation of blood begins. Cells multiply and divide, some becoming differentiated to become eyes that see, or ears that hear, while others are destined to become fingers that feel the wonderful things about us. Yes, awareness of the magnificence of man begins with the miracles of conception and our creation.<br><h2><b>Specific Organs</b></h2><br>In our treasure chest of understanding, we can look to the compartment of capability of selected organs. Time won't permit complete consideration, but each jewel merits admiration, appreciation, and awe.<br><br>Let's mention the magnificence of the eyes with which we see. No doubt you have stood before the mirror, as have I, watching pupils react to changes in the intensity of light--dilating to let more light in, constricting to reduce the light allowed to reach the sensitive retina of the eye. A self-focusing lens is at the front of each eye. Nerves and muscles synchronize the function of two separate eyes to produce one three-dimensional image. Eyes are connected to the brain, ready to record sights seen. No cords, no batteries, no external connections are needed; our visual apparatus is marvelous--infinitely more priceless than any camera money can buy.<br><br>As we admire good stereophonic equipment for sensing sound, ponder the magnificence of the human ear. It is so remarkable. Compacted into an area about the size of a marble is all the equipment needed to perceive sound. A tiny tympanic membrane serves as the diaphragm. Minute ossicles amplify the signal that is then transmitted along nerve lines to the brain, which registers the result of hearing. This marvelous sound system is also connected to the recording instrument of the brain.<br><br>A large portion of my life's study and research has been focused on the jewel of the human heart--a pump so magnificent that its power is almost beyond our comprehension. To control the direction of the blood's flow through the heart, there are four important valves, each pliable as a parachute and delicate as a dainty silk scarf. They open and close over 100,000 times a day--over 36 million times a year. Yet, unless altered by disease, they are so rugged that they stand this kind of wear seemingly indefinitely. No man-made material developed thus far can be flexed this frequently and for so long without breaking.<br><br>The amount of work done by the heart is most amazing. Each day it pumps enough fluid to fill a 2,000-gallon tank car. The work it performs daily is equivalent to lifting a 150-pound man to the top of the Empire State Building, consuming only about four watts of energy--less than that used by a small light bulb in your home.<br><br>At the crest of the heart is an electrical generator transmitting energy down special lines, causing myriads of muscle fibers to beat in coordination and in rhythm. This synchrony would be the envy of the conductor of any orchestra.<br><br>All this power is condensed in this faithful pump--the human heart--about the size of one's fist, energized from within by an endowment from on high.<br><br>One of the most wondrous of all jewels in this treasure chest is the human brain with its intricate combination of power cells, recording, memory, storage, and retrieval systems. It serves as headquarters for the personality and character of each human being. As I observe the lives of great individuals, I sense that the capacity of the brain is seemingly infinite. Wise men can become even wiser as each experience builds upon previous experience. Indeed, continuing exercise of the intellect brings forth increased intellectual capacity.<br><br>Each time I marvel at a computer and admire the work it can do, I respect even more the mind of man that developed the computer. The human brain is certainly a recording instrument that will participate in our judgment one day as we stand before the Lord. The Book of Mormon speaks of a "bright recollection" (see Alma 11:43) and of a "perfect remembrance" (see Alma 5:18) that will be with us at that time. Each one of us carries that recording instrument guarded within the vault of the human skull.<br><br>As we symbolically sift through the treasure chest of understanding, we could spend hours, even a lifetime, studying the incredible chemical capacity of the liver, the kidneys, and any or all of the endocrine and exocrine glands of the body. Each is a shimmering jewel, worthy of our study and our deepest gratitude.<br><h2><b>Conceptual Considerations</b></h2><br>Now let us turn our attention to jewels in another compartment in the treasure chest of understanding, leaving behind those representing the marvelous functions of each specific organ. Let us consider some concepts that bridge beyond individual organ systems.<br><br>The first concept that I would mention is that of reserve, or backup. In the theater, major actors have understudies. In electrical instruments, backup in the event of power failure may be provided by batteries. In the body, think of the backup provided by a number of organs that are paired, such as the eyes, ears, lungs, adrenal glands, kidneys, and more. In the event of illness, injury, or loss of one, the other is there ready to keep our bodily functions intact. In the event of loss of sight or hearing altogether, other sensory powers become augmented in a miraculous manner.<br><br>Some backup systems are not so apparent. For example, crucial single organs like the brain, the heart, and the liver have a double blood supply. They are all nourished by<i>two</i>routes of circulation, minimizing damage in the event of loss of blood flow through any<i>single</i>blood vessel.<br><br>Another dimension of backup I shall describe as collateral pathways. For example, if our nasal passageways are obstructed by a "stuffy nose," we may breathe through our mouths. Similarly, collateral pathways may grow in the event of obstruction or severance of blood vessels or nerves.<br><br>Consider another concept--that of self-defense of the body. I watched some three-year-old children playing one day. I saw them lapping water from the sidewalk after it had spilled through a neighbor's garden. I suppose the germs they ingested were incalculable in number, but not one of those children became ill. They were defended by their bodies. As soon as that dirty drink reached their stomachs, hydrochloric acid went to work to purify the water and protect the lives of those innocent children.<br><br>Think of the protection provided by the skin. Could you make, or even conjure in your mind how to create a cloak that would protect you and yet, at the same time, perceive and warn against injuries that excessive heat or cold might cause? That is what the skin does. It even gives signals indicating when another part of the body is ailing. The skin can flush and sweat with fever. When one is frightened or ill, the skin pales. When one is embarrassed, the skin blushes. And it is replete with nerve fibers that communicate and often limit possible harm through perception of pain.<br><br>Pain itself is part of the body's defense mechanism. For example, protection is provided by sensory areas of the mouth guarding the delicate esophagus, which has very few nerve fibers. Like a sentinel, the mouth receives warnings to protect the tender esophagus from becoming burned by drinks that are too hot.<br><br>The defense of the body includes chemical antibodies manufactured in response to infections acquired along life's way. Each time we are exposed to bacterial or viral infections, antibodies are made that not only combat infection but persist with memory to strengthen resistance in days to come. When military conscription was required during World War II, soldiers who had come from isolated rural areas had much less immunity and were more prone to infections than were those from more highly populated urban areas whose resistance was better developed.<br><br>Closely related to the concept of self-defense is that of self-repair. Consider the fact that broken bones mend and become strong once again. If I were to break one of the legs of the chair I was just sitting on, how long would we have to wait for that chair leg to heal itself? It would never happen. Yet many here tonight walk on legs that once were broken. Lacerations in the skin heal themselves. A leak in the circulation system will seal itself, but circulatory systems outside the body do not have this power. I gained appreciation for this miracle early in my research career when I was working in the laboratory to create an artificial heart-lung machine. Whenever tubing in that machine would spring a leak, it meant long hours cleaning up the lab, and I came home late for dinner. Never did a leak in the artificial heart-lung machine ever seal itself.<br><br>The concept of self-renewal is remarkable. Each cell in the body is created and then regenerated from elements of the earth according to the recipe or formula contained within genes unique to us. The average red blood corpuscle, for example, lives about 120 days. It then dies and is replaced by another. Each time you bathe, thousands of dead and dying cells are scrubbed away to be replaced by a younger crop. To my thinking, this process of self-renewal prefigures the process of resurrection.<br><br>Another concept that is truly remarkable is that of autoregulation. In spite of wide fluctuations in the temperature of man's environment, the temperature of the body is carefully controlled within very narrow bounds.<br><br>Have you wondered why you can't swim under water very long? Autoregulation limits the time you can hold your breath. As breath is held, carbon dioxide accumulates. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide is monitored continuously by two carotid bodies situated in the neck. They transmit signals up nerves to the brain. The brain then sends stimuli to muscles of respiration, causing them to work so that we might inhale a fresh supply of oxygen and eliminate retained carbon dioxide. This is but one of many, many servomechanisms that autoregulate individual ingredients in our bodies.<br><br>The number of these systems exceeds our ability to enumerate them. Sodium, potassium, water, glucose, protein, nitrogen are but a few of the many constituents continuously monitored by chemical regulators within our bodies.<br><br>Consider the concept of adaptation. People on the earth dwell amidst climatic and dietary differences of vast scope. Eskimos in the Arctic Circle consume a diet with a large component of fat that is acceptable and even necessary to sustain life in a very cold climate. The Polynesian, on the other hand, eats a diet provided by a tropical environment. Yet these different groups work and adapt to varying conditions and diet available to them.<br><br>The concept of identity in reproduction is marvelous to contemplate. Each one of us possesses seeds carrying our unique chromosomes and genes that control our own specific cellular identity. For this reason, tissues surgically transplanted from one person to another can only survive by suppressing the host's immune response that clearly recognizes tissues foreign to one's own inherited genetic formula. Truly we are blessed with the power to have children born in the likeness of parents on earth as well as in heaven.<br><br>As we consider self-defense, self-repair, and self-renewal, an interesting paradox emerges. Limitless life could result if these marvelous qualities of the body continued in perpetuity. Just think, if you could create anything that could defend itself, repair itself, and renew itself without limit, you could create perpetual life. That our Creator did with the bodies he created for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. If they had continued to be nourished from the tree of life, they would have lived forever. According to the Lord, as revealed through his prophets, the fall of Adam instituted the aging process, which results ultimately in physical death. Of course, we do not understand all the chemistry, but we are witnesses of the consequences of growing old. This, and other pathways of release, assure that there is a limit to the length of life upon the earth.<br><br>Yes, troubles do develop in our bodies that do not repair themselves with time. To the skilled physician, this profound question is posed by each sick patient seen: "Will this illness get better, or will it get worse, with the passage of time?" The former needs only supportive care. The latter requires significant help to convert the process of progressive deterioration to one that might improve with time.<br><br>Death, when it comes, generally seems to be untimely to the mortal mind. Then we need to have the larger view that death is part of life.<br><br><i>It was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</i>[Alma 42:8; see also D&amp;amp;C 29:43]<br><br>When severe illness or tragic injuries claim an individual in the flowering prime of life, we can take comfort in this fact: The very laws that could not allow life to persist here are the same eternal laws that will be implemented at the time of the resurrection, when that body "shall be restored to [its] proper and perfect frame" (Alma 40:23).<br><br>Thoughts of life, death, and resurrection bring us to face crucial questions. How were we made? By whom? And why?<br><h2><b>Created by God</b></h2><br>Through the ages, some without scriptural understanding have tried to explain our existence by pretentious words such as<i>ex nihilo</i>(out of nothing). Others have deduced that, because of certain similarities between different forms of life, there has been a natural selection of the species, or organic evolution from one form to another. Still others have concluded that man came as a consequence of a "big bang" that resulted in the creation of our planet and life upon it.<br><br>To me, such theories are unbelievable! Could an explosion in a printing shop produce a dictionary? It's unthinkable! But it could be argued to be within a remote realm of possibility. Even if that could happen, such a dictionary could certainly not heal its own torn pages, or renew its own worn corners, or reproduce its own subsequent editions!<br><br>We are children of God, created by him and formed in his image. Recently I studied the scriptures simply to find how many times they testify of the divine creation of man. Looking up references that referred either to<i>create</i>or<i>form</i>(or their derivatives) with either<i>man, men, male,</i>or<i>female</i>in the same verse, I found that there are at least fifty-five verses of scripture that attest to our divine creation (Genesis 1:27; 2:7, 8; 5:1, 2; 6:7; Deuteronomy 4:32; Isaiah 45:12; Malachi 2:10; Mark 10:6; Romans 9:20; Ephesians 3:9; Colossians 3:10; 2 Nephi 1:10; 2:15; 9:6; 29:7; Jacob 4:9; Mosiah 4:2, 9; 7:27; Alma 1:4; 18:32, 34, 36; 22:12, 13; Mormon 9:12, 17; Ether 1:3; 3:15, 16; Moroni 10:3; D&amp;amp;C 20:18; 29:30, 34; 77:2; 77:12; 93:29; Moses 1:8; 2:27; 3:5, 7, 8, 9; 6:8, 9; 7:32; 8:26; Abraham 4:26, 27; 5:7, 8, 14, 16). I have selected one to represent all those verses that convey the same conclusion:<br><br><i>And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness. . . .</i><br><br><i>So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them.</i>[Abraham 4:26, 27]<br><h2><b>Spiritual Discernment</b></h2><br>I believe all of those scriptures pertaining to the creation of man. But the decision to believe is a spiritual one, not born solely by an understanding of things physical:<br><br><i>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</i>[1 Corinthians 2:14]<br><br>It is incumbent upon each informed and spiritually attuned person to help overcome such foolishness of men who would deny divine creation or think that man simply evolved. By the spirit we perceive the truer and more believable wisdom of God.<br><br>With great conviction I add my testimony to that of my fellow apostle, Paul, who said:<br><br><i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</i><br><br><i>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</i>[1 Corinthians 3:16, 17]<br><h2><b>Duality of Man</b></h2><br>The Lord said that "the spirit and the body are the soul of man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:15). Each one of us therefore is a dual being--a biological (physical) entity, and an intellectual (spiritual) entity. The combination of both is intimate throughout mortality.<br><br>In the beginning, man, as that intellectual entity, was with God. Our intelligence was not created or made, nor can it be (see D&amp;amp;C 93:29).<br><br>That spirit, joined with a physical body of such remarkable qualities, becomes a living soul of supernal worth. The Psalmist so expressed this thought:<br><br><i>When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</i><br><br><i>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? . . .</i><br><br><i>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour,</i>[Psalms 8:3–5]<br><br>Why were we created? Why are we here? Why are we upon the earth?<br><br>God has made it plain over and over again that the world was made for mankind to exist. We are here to work out our divine destiny, according to an eternal plan presented to us in the great council of heaven. Our bodies have been created to accommodate our spirits, to allow us to experience the challenges of mortality.<br><h2><b>Avoid Desecration of the Physical Temple</b></h2><br>With this understanding, it is pure sacrilege to let anything enter the body that might defile this physical temple of God. It is irreverent to let even the gaze of our precious eyesight or the sensors of our touch or hearing supply the brain with memories that are unclean and unworthy. Could any of us lightly regard precious seeds of reproduction--specifically and uniquely ours--or disregard the moral laws of God, who gave divine rules governing their sacred use?<br><br>Knowing we are created as children of God, and by him given agency to choose, we must also know that we are accountable to him. He has defined the truth and prescribed commandments. Obedience to his law will bring us joy. Disobedience of those commandments is defined as sin. While we live in a world that seems increasingly reluctant to designate dishonorable deeds as sinful, a scripture so warns: "Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour" (Proverbs 14:9).<br><br>No one is perfect. Some may have sinned grievously in transgressing God's laws. Mercifully, we can repent. That is an important part of life's opportunity as well.<br><br>Repentance requires spiritual dominion over appetites of the flesh. Every physical system has appetites. Our desires to eat, drink, see, hear, and feel respond to those appetites. But all appetites must be controlled by the intellect for us to attain true joy. On the other hand, whenever we allow uncontrolled appetites of the body to determine behavior opposed to nobler promptings of the Spirit, the stage is set for misery and grief.<br><br>Substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and harmful drugs are forbidden by the Lord. We have similarly been warned about the evils of pornography and unclean thoughts. Appetites for these degrading forces can become addictive. Physical or mental addictions become doubly serious because, in time, they enslave<i>both</i>the body and the spirit. Full repentance from these shackles, or any other yokes to sin, must be accomplished in this life while we still have the aid of a mortal body to help us develop self-mastery.<br><br>When we truly know our divine nature, our thoughts and behavior will be more appropriate. Then we will control our appetites. We will focus our eyes on sights, our ears on sounds, and our minds on thoughts that are a credit to our physical creation as a temple of our Father in Heaven.<br><br>In daily prayer we may gratefully acknowledge God as our Creator, thank him for the magnificence of our physical temple, and then heed his counsel.<br><h2><b>More Yet to Learn</b></h2><br>Though we cannot fully comprehend the magnificence of man, in faith we can continue our reverent quest. We may join with Jacob in this marvelous declaration:<br><br><i>Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways.</i>. . .<br><br><i>For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. . . .</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand.</i>[Jacob 4:8–10]<br><br>For years I have attended scientific meetings of learned societies. Medical scientists and practitioners by the thousands participate in such assemblies annually from all over the world. The quest for knowledge is endless. It seems that the more we know, the more there is yet to learn. It is impossible that man may learn all the ways of God. But as we are faithful and are deeply rooted in scriptural accounts of God's magnificent creations, we will be well prepared for future discoveries. All truth is compatible because it all emanates from God.<br><h2><b>Beware of False Doctrine</b></h2><br>Of course, we know that "there is an opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11). In the world even many so-called "educators" teach contrary to divine truth. Be mindful of this prophetic counsel:<br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–29]<br><br>You need not be reminded that the work and glory of the Lord are opposed by forces of Satan, who is the master of deceit. Many follow his teachings. Remember,<br><br><i>Man may deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception, and the children of the wicked one may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught, till naught but fiction feeds the many, and the fruit of falsehood carries in its current the giddy to the grave.</i>[JS–H 1:71 footnote]<br><br>Be wise and keep away from temptations and snares. Cautiously avoid "foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition" (1 Timothy 6:9).<br><br><i>Flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</i><br><br><i>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.</i>[1 Timothy 6:11–12]<br><h2><b>Spiritual Dominion</b></h2><br>The magnificence of man is matchless. Remember, glorious as this physical tabernacle is, the body is designed to support something even<i>more</i>glorious--the eternal spirit that dwells in each of our mortal frames. The great accomplishments of this life are rarely physical. Those attributes by which we shall be judged one day are spiritual. With the blessing of our bodies to assist us, we may develop spiritual qualities of honesty, integrity, compassion, and love. Only with the development of the spirit may we acquire "faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, [and] diligence" (D&amp;amp;C 4:6).<br><br>Pattern your lives after our great Exemplar, even Jesus the Christ, whose parting words among men included this eternal challenge: "What manner of men ought ye to be? . . . even as I am" (3 Nephi 27:27).<br><br>We are sons and daughters of God. He is our Father; we are his children. Our divine inheritance is the magnificence of man. May we honor it and magnify it, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Russell M. Nelson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 29 March 1987.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ur Cross - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Why don't you have crosses on your buildings of worship? Why aren't your chapels built in the shape of a cross? Why don't you encourage your people to wear and display crosses? What is the Church's policy toward crosses?<br><br>From Matthew 16:24–25:<br><br><i>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</i><br><br><i>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</i><br><br>We in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in response to these questions, try to teach our people to carry their crosses rather than display or wear them. Over the centuries the cross has been recognized as a symbol of Christianity in the minds of millions. The Savior himself has given us the bread and water as emblems of his sacrifice and death.<br><br>My message to you this day is take up your cross. Take yourself the way you are and lift yourself in the direction of the better. Regardless of where you have been, what you have done, or what you haven't done, trust God, believe on him, relate to him, worship him as you carry your cross with dignity and determination.<br><br>We save our lives by losing them for his sake. As you find yourself, you will find God. This is true. I declare that to you. It is his promise. Take up the real cross of Jesus Christ.<br><br>What kind of cross do you bear? What is its shape, weight, size, or dimension? We all have them. Some are very visible, while others are not always evident. Sometimes the heaviest personal cross could be to carry no cross at all. Some crosses we bear are these (maybe you will relate to one or more): the cross of loneliness; the cross of physical limitations--the loss of a leg, an arm, hearing, seeing, mobility--obvious crosses (we see people with these crosses and admire their strength in carrying them with dignity); the cross of poor health; the cross of transgression; the cross of success; the cross of temptation; the cross of beauty, fame, or wealth; the cross of financial burdens; the cross of criticism; the cross of peer rejection.<br><br>What if we are challenged with more than one cross? A beautiful young lady once said to me, "Elder Ashton, it just isn't time for me to have another cross. I'm not quite used to the one I'm carrying now. How can I handle both?" Truly, suffering is part of our mortal existence, and suffering is not all bad.<br><h2><b>Hidden Crosses</b></h2><br>Today I'd like to talk in more detail about certain crosses in life that are real, but that are not always recognized or visible. Number one is the cross of the violated trust--on the part of a parent, a family member, a teacher, a bishop, a stake presidency member, a boyfriend, a classmate, a returned missionary, a girlfriend, and so on. Some of us let an act of mistrust on the part of someone close to us shatter our todays and tomorrows. A friend of mine said, "When my endowed father left Mom for a scheming secretary, it was more than I could bear." She was bitter. This cross was causing her to crumble. She had never looked upon it as a cross, but it was a cross of hatred and resentment: "I can't believe my father would let us down! What is the use?"<br><br>Another one: "When my boyfriend talked me into a couple of drinks and then took advantage of me morally, it caused me to never trust anyone again." This cross is breaking her because she has not decided that with God's help she can carry it. Another one I heard from a broken-hearted wife of a year and a half: "My husband, a returned missionary, told me it was okay, so I did it&amp;amp;rdqou;--compromising immoral intimacies.<br><br>And I received this in a letter from the father of two BYU coeds who were the victims of improper conduct on the part of imperfect people on campus--the father and mother were shattered: "We can't stand to believe and know that that could happen to our students at Brigham Young University!"<br><br>We're proud of BYU, but it is made up of imperfect people, and sometimes very imperfect things happen even though we thank God they are fewer here than at any other university we know of.<br><br>Can even these hidden crosses be carried for future strength instead of causing us to fall and not get back up? "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). Sometimes it is easier for the Lord not to remember our sins than it is for us. They become crosses because we will not do ourselves the favor of carrying on. "By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold, he will confess them and forsake them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:43). Can you carry appropriately the cross of forgiveness? Some of us would rather carry a cross than confess and start anew.<br><br>George Q. Cannon, in his wonderful book<i>The Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet,</i>points out repeatedly that the greatest cross that Joseph Smith had to bear--and he had many--was the cross of trusted friends who were not worthy of the word<i>trust.</i>His heartaches, his death, his inconveniences were caused by those in whom his trust had been misplaced.<br><h2><b>A Heavy Cross</b></h2><br>Number two, another cross that isn't always visible but on occasion can be very heavy and worrisome, is the cross of self-unacceptance--a continuing rejection of oneself through self-condemnation and low self-appraisal. Can you find it in your heart to once in a while give yourself a good grade on your behavior? Or do you give yourself low marks no matter what you do because you carry the cross of self-unacceptance?<br><br>An unannounced, but obviously self-imposed, personal-enemy-number-one status in regard to ourselves is a heavy cross. Sometimes in solitude and in humility there is only one person on earth that can be your advocate, and that must be you--someone who will not condemn you under that cross and cause you to fail.<br><br>Being down on ourselves is destructive. As we bear this kind of a cross we have a tendency to reach only the low levels we expect of ourselves. What a cross it is to convince yourself, "I'm no good. I can't do it. I can't make it." What a cross! It doesn't even show. But by lifting that cross we can become more than we would have been had we not been required to carry the cross. Some of us spend too much time protecting our wounded selves.<br><br>Always wishing you were some other person with greater talents and greater strengths is a handicap--it's a cross that is not visible, but it is so real. Is it a cross to bear when we realize that with God's help we can overcome, we can be victorious, and we can accomplish much?<br><br>I love the following quotation. I suppose I use it more than any other one when I try to give encouragement to family and friends like you:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.</i><br><br><i>But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.</i><br><br><i>Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things.</i>[Alma 26:10–12]<br><br>I wish we believed that. I wish we practiced that. I wish we knew that. There are days when people who have been called to positions of responsibility, as I have been, have to humbly say, "God, I'm weak, but with your help I can do it," and give him a chance to help lift that cross of inadequate strength.<br><br><i>Yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.</i><br><br><i>Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?</i>[Alma 26:12–13]<br><br>It is a fact of life that God can make our crosses easier to bear if we are but willing to admit we have them and then seek his help. In D&amp;amp;C 56:2 we read, "And he that will not take up his cross and follow me, and keep my commandments, the same shall not be saved."<br><br>A willingness to take yourself as you are and build from there is pleasing to God. If you have more than one cross--three or four--maybe you could build a ladder out of them and use them to climb to new heights. Sometimes becoming is more important than achieving or arriving. I'm not talking about self-indulgence. I'm talking about self-acceptance. All tomorrows can be in our favor if we carry on in a spirit of commitment and self-encouragement.<br><h2><b>Resisting Counsel</b></h2><br>Number three is the cross of resisting counsel. Some of us have a tendency to resent, resist, rebel, and delay, and to debate worthy direction, supervision, and communication. I plead with you to avoid the ranks of professional counsel resisters, who make such statements as, "Who are you to tell me?" "I didn't come here to be babysat." "Why all the restrictions?" "Where does the free agency come in?" "Why don't you just leave us alone?" Some carry that heavy cross of wanting to rebel or to resist counsel from friends. They reject that counsel because it may cause inconvenience, or because they may not be able to see far enough ahead to see its value.<br><br>In D&amp;amp;C 23:6, Joseph Knight was counseled to pray:<br><br><i>Behold, I manifest unto you, Joseph Knight, by these words, that you must take up your cross, in the which you must pray vocally before the world as well as in secret, and in your family, and among your friends, and in all places.</i><br><br>Sometimes we are given crosses so we can be taught to pray. Crosses become lighter and more manageable when we learn to pray and when we learn to patiently wait for the answers to our prayers.<br><br>An unwillingness to listen and learn can be a silent cross of considerable weight. Carry the cross of constant prayer even when answers are slow in coming or are difficult to accept.<br><h2><b>The Cross of Complacency</b></h2><br>Number four is the cross of living among many Mormons. Did you ever think of it as a cross? Having many Mormons for many Church assignments may not be as rewarding and developing as situations in which there are few Mormons to do many Church responsibilities. You may come from a location where your strength, commitment, and attendance made the difference. Sometimes it's easy to let the cross of many Mormons make us weak because we feel in our hearts that someone else will do what needs to be done. Complacency, lack of enthusiasm and involvement, can be the fruit of having too many of us together. Often there is great strength and development where Mormons are in the minority. It's like being the deacon (one of two in a small branch) who said, "I must be awfully important because I'm 50 percent."<br><br>How sad, and I hope untrue, is the statement, "There aren't enough Church jobs to go around." Beware of the cross of complacency and an attitude of not being needed. It is a cross when you say, "Someone else can do that. I'll wait for another assignment."<br><h2><b>A Destructive Cross</b></h2><br>Number five is the cross of caustic comments--taking pleasure in constantly putting people down, in murmuring, ridicule, contention, slander, gossip, and even putting yourself down and enjoying it. Avoid being a rumor reservoir. If you're part of a rumor reservoir, you're entitled to drown. Some people enjoy being caustic. Some have careless and sharp tongues as crosses. Our job is not to live with them, but to reshape and manage our own tongue and mind if we enjoy being caustic.<br><br>A home of contention is more than a cross, it is a curse. Some homes without decoration and rehearsal train the inhabitants to be critical. This is an invisible cross of tremendous power, and it is destructive if we carry it. From 2 Nephi 26:32: "The Lord God hath commanded that men should not . . . contend one with another." A caustic tongue can construct additional crosses that are so unnecessary. A critical tongue is a cross easily removed, but only you can do it.<br><h2><b>Too Much Praise</b></h2><br>Cross number six is the cross of adulation. Be careful, be aware, be wise when people speak well of you. When people treat you with great respect and love, be careful, be aware, be wise. When you are honored, pointed out, and recognized, it can be a cross, especially if you believe what is said about you. Being a BYU student, a Mormon, a returned missionary, a member of the BYU faculty or administration, a General Authority, a prophet, temple-married--some people know these identifications for you and, although you might take them for granted, they're lofty. But these can be crosses, and you must bear them well.<br><br>Praise of the world can be a heavy cross. How often I have heard it said over the years, "He was great until he became successful, and then he couldn't handle it." I'm not talking about money and position. I'm talking about recognition, even in Church responsibilities. We should honor callings and responsibilities and realize that what we are and what we do will depend on the strength of the cross.<br><br>I would pray that we would avoid being carried away by praise, success, or even achieving goals that we have set for ourselves. In Mormon 8:38–39 we read:<br><br><i>O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies--because of the praise of the world?</i><br><br><i>Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?</i><br><br>How great, how strong, how pleasing it is to be recognized, honored, and respected, but we must realize in our hearts that true greatness is visiting with the Savior Jesus Christ by helping those who are sick, afflicted, discouraged, homeless, and burdened with crosses.<br><h2><b>Count Your Blessings</b></h2><br>In conclusion, we do not reverence crosses. As stated in the beginning, ours is to carry them with dignity and power. Our right and responsibility is to carry our crosses, and while we are doing so to have the good sense and judgment to count our blessings. These phrases you'll recognize:<br><br><i>When upon life's billows you are tempest-tossed,</i><br><i>When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,</i><br><i>Count your many blessings; name them one by one,</i><br><i>And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</i><br><br><i>Count your blessings; Name them one by one.</i><br><i>Count your blessings; See what God hath done.</i><br><i>Count your blessings; Name them one by one</i>[as you carry your cross].<br><i>Count your many blessings; See what God hath done.</i><br><br><i>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?</i><br><i>Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?</i><br><i>Count your many blessings; every doubt will fly,</i><br><i>And you will be singing as the days go by.</i><br><br><i>Count your blessings; Name them one by one.</i><br><i>Count your blessings; See what God hath done.</i><br><i>Count your blessings; Name them one by one.</i><br><i>Count your many blessings; See what God hath done.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 241]<br><br>There is an aid, there is a strength, there is a power when we count our blessings as we labor under crosses that sometimes seem unreasonable and unfair but that can be for our good and for our strength. I bear special witness to you that carrying our crosses and following our Lord will bring strength, peace, and purpose in our quest for the abundant life. God has made this promise. Carry your crosses with strength, with purpose, and while you do, count the blessings of God's strength. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Marvin J.

<h1> Teachable - Kate L. Kirkham - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>On Being Learners</b></h2><br>In the Book of Mormon we read: "And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls" (Moroni 6:5).<br><br>This also seems like an important time to meet together often to fast and to pray and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of our souls. Some of us may experience too many meetings--are we not meeting and talking together all the time?<br><br>But there is in this scripture, and in others, a particular spirit of meeting one with another--a mutual caretaking, a spiritual reciprocity--even as the Apostle Paul entreated: a kindness, a desire to be tenderhearted one to another (Ephesians 4:32).<br><br>In preparing for today, I felt I should focus on what readies us to learn of the welfare of other souls. What readies us to be taught? And why, when we as a people are engaged in teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, should we also be concerned with being teachable?<br><br>Several years ago, a theme of the General Relief Society meeting was "Learn, Then Teach." However, we sometimes only think about learning when we are in a classroom. We associate being teachable with being in attendance. In a campus setting we can further link learning to a required curriculum, specified prerequisites, sequenced electives, and defined areas of study. We develop beliefs about who can and should be teaching us. So as students, when we finally get into the classes we want, it is fairly easy to adopt the attitude "Well, I'm here, the rest is up to you."<br><br>As a teacher, I share with any of you who have faced a classroom the challenge of looking at faces, watching body postures, listening to questions, and trying to determine each person's "readiness to learn." I accept there is a responsibility and a requirement to be ready to teach; but today I want to focus on that powerful part of the interaction we influence as<i>learners</i>.<br><br>What are we like as learners? Over the years I've watched and had students describe to me (usually after the grades were in) their roles as learners.<br><br>Some would take the posture "Go ahead, get my attention if you can" or "I already know about this subject." Some would say, "I don't want to know about this subject--it's required," or "I need to know exactly what I'm supposed to learn here," or "You've got my attention, but I don't understand you."<br><br>There are also those who come inquiring, ready to risk asking the "dumb question," ready to contribute to the learning of others. My point is: Are we willing and able to look at what we are like as learners? Are we paying attention to how we ready ourselves to learn--our style, assumptions, expectations, attitudes, etc.? Are we aware how much we really influence,<i>if not control,</i>how teachable each of us really is?<br><br>Now, if the place of learning is not the traditional classroom, but a<i>congregation</i>or an interdenominational community, and the curriculum is not math or English, but the gospel of Jesus Christ--the character of our being one with another heretofore, here and hereafter--then what would describe us as learners? Who may instruct us?<br><br>What does it mean to be teachable? This is a difficult concept for me to explain. I have experienced it in myself and in others with more certainty than I can articulate a description. Because of our individuality, the expression varies. The common characteristics seem to be (although listed separately, these form a tangible whole) a sense of one's incompleteness--a gnawing awareness of a desired, divine and future state; a contrite spirit; a humble heart; a knowledge of one's worth; a reverence for the worth of others; the trusting readiness often most apparent in little children; a belief in one's abilities and one's capacity to grow and to contribute; and an acknowledgement of our interdependency as sons and daughters of our heavenly parents.<br><br>Perhaps, fundamentally, being teachable means that we<i>daily</i>open ourselves to the<i>consistency</i>of God's love for us. We accept we<i>are</i>loved and make real in our complex, earthly lives the cornerstone commandments to love our God and our neighbors as ourselves.<br><br>We can acknowledge that no matter who we are or where we are, encoded into each of us are two things: (1) this common language of learning that is love, and (2) a most common bond of purpose: we came to learn and to "speak one with another concerning the welfare of our souls"--in fact, to progress eternally.<br><br>Our capacity to be taught is infinite--whatever our current circumstances, whatever the conditions of our physical abilities, and whatever status we may hold in the eyes of others. It is often easy to move away from such a compelling awareness of our potential. We can both allow and assist others in getting in the way of our being teachable. We can find for a variety of reasons--fear, doubt, convenience, comfort--ways to deny our capacity for learning, to lose faith in ourselves, to lose faith in the love of those around us, or to lose faith in God's love for us. By not believing in our capacity to learn (even from our mistakes), by not believing in our capacity to influence others for good, we attempt to deny the power of God in us.<br><br>I hope I have conveyed to you my belief in our capacity and responsibility to remain ever the learning children of our Heavenly Father and my belief as well that this condition of being teachable is fundamentally linked to God's love for us and ours for him and for one another. Now I would like to suggest five things that can have an impact on this quality of being teachable and comment on three areas where we can currently edify each other as we speak one with another.<br><h2><b>To Improve our Teachableness</b></h2><br>First, let us<i>demonstrate what we say we already know</i>so that our preparation to learn even more is evident to our earthly parents, to our Heavenly Father, and to others around us in the congregation.<br><br>Why are we constantly reminded of things? Why are the basic principles repeated so frequently? Perhaps we have not demonstrated in our daily behavior our ability to do those things. Long ago, King Benjamin advised his congregation "If you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:10).<br><br>If we are demonstrating what we have learned, even a reminder will be heard without offense. When I was sixteen I backed out of our steep driveway directly into the only car parked on the other side of the street. I think that over the decades I've now proven I can navigate my parents' driveway, and because of that their reminders are not heard the same way they were the first few times after the accident when I had not yet "proved myself."<br><br>Sometimes we treat requests to visit teach, home teach, prepare for meetings, or even to be compassionate as things we<i>could do</i>if we really had time or if we really wanted to do them. I have experienced the deception that can come when we confuse<i>thinking about the possible actions</i>with the actual effort required to<i>do them</i>. I don't learn as much from thinking about opportunities to be charitable as I do from exercising charity in my conduct with others and learning from those vary real experiences.<br><br>What if, as a ward or stake congregation, when we next met together, we had all paid our tithes, made clear our love for our neighbors in how we treated them and spoken with each other, had proven obedient to the commandments, and in diverse ways of expression given evidence of the fullness of our faith? What would the speakers say to us? By our efforts wouldn't we have demonstrated a readiness to learn that would call forth even greater instructions?<br><br>In discussing the glory of the city of Enoch, Neal Maxwell presented a narrative progressively illustrating the readiness of a people and included these observations:<br><br><i>Our unity is not the unity born of compulsion or of mindless rapport, but of the realization that such unity is a necessity. . . .</i><br><br><i>It helps greatly to do first things first, not only because these are most important, but because the order of things does matter. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . In our meetings we recount our own blessings, and as we hear the blessings of others, we both feel and see the accumulations of affection from God to his people.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>Of One Heart</i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1975), pp. 44–45]<br><br>As Alma said, "By small and simply things are great things brought to pass" (Alma 37:6). Let us demonstrate our ability to do even "small and simple things."<br><br>Second, we learn about being teachable when we<i>seek to balance being directed and being anxiously engaged</i>. There are absolutes in life--things we are not supposed to do. But there is also ambiguity--several possible ways to do good, to influence others, and multiple avenues to excel. In the face of ambiguity, some of us will be directed and will know for certain what to do; for others of us, it will be up to<i>us</i>to figure out what to do!<br><br>Sometimes what I personally should be learning is painfully obvious to myself and to others. Sometimes I have struggled for years to understand, to discern the meaning of an experience, or to embrace a principle.<br><br>Being receptive and being active are both ways to enhance our teachableness. There is probably a little bit of both Julia Child and MacGyver in each of us. Some of us want the recipe; we want the ingredients explicitly identified and their relationship clarified. On the other hand, some of us just want the basic principles and will make do with whatever "materials" or conditions are around us. (Ask anyone who watched ABC's <em>MacGyver</em> what a MacGyverism is.) Our differences in how we approach learning should invite<i>interest</i>from each other and not judgment.<br><br>If we err in the extreme--either in thinking "if we are not told, we don't have to try" or "I resent being told, I can figure it out myself"--we diminish our ability to be taught.<br><br>Third, we can<i>seek to increase our capacity to discern</i>. Our lives are complex, our circumstances varied. Failure to develop our spiritual capacity to discern could leave us overwhelmed, overdependent on others for meaning, overcommitted, or overreacting to the next thing that pops up. We are here to make choices. This was made evident to me quite powerfully in a priesthood blessing in which I was told in essence, "You will<i>know</i>what is good to do if you do not reason it away." I have often remembered that instruction and thought about the criteria it suggests for discerning what is good to do in my life.<br><br>I believe we develop discernment by exercising it. We can combine our efforts with the guidance of the Spirit. We can compare our experiences with those of others without feeling we are competing. We can rejoice in<i>their</i>excellence and still know there are ways we can also excel.<br><br>We can monitor our own progress and discern the gains we make and the patterns in which we are vulnerable to temptation. I am indebted to a wise old friend (both in years and association) of another faith who taught me to take an active<i>interest</i>in learning about the patterns in my life and how temptations occurred. He struggled a long time with some of his temptations and finally decided to take a pro-active interest. He would try to anticipate where in his life he might encounter that "ole trickster devil" again. He became a good scout. He watched the terrain of his life and could tell where it looked like his own form of quicksand might be. He rerouted and gave up trying to see how close he could get to that quicksand without getting caught.<br><br>Fourth,<i>we are teachable when we can trust in the Lord</i>. Sometimes we won't know in advance; sometimes in our lives we will "wait upon the Lord" for a long time. But we still need to ready ourselves. We need to be learning even though the specific opportunities to express what we are learning may not be as apparent or as exciting as we wish.<br><br>I gained an appreciation of this point a few weeks ago when I accompanied my sister to St. George. Her three children sing in the Utah Valley Children's Choir, and she wanted to hear their concert. I wanted to sleep or read; she convinced me I could do both in the car while she drove.<br><br>The kids had worked hard, paying attention to Beverly Thomas' direction, learning lyrics, rehearsing harmony, and trying to show up at performances in the appropriate outfits. They did a good job. After their last concert the kids had a chance to stop in Zion National Park on the way home. Diane and I pulled up alongside the bus as it unloaded sixty noisy kids who raced up the path to Weeping Rock. We decided it would be safer to wait in the parking lot.<br><br>All of a sudden it was strangely quiet in the canyon. We couldn't see the kids. And then truly angelic sounds filled the canyon. People in the parking lot who were not with our group stopped. We all heard words echoing in the canyon: "We will sing for the Lord is listening. He hears the praise of our hearts. We will sing for the Lord is listening. We lift our voices and start to sing for the Lord" ("Sing for the Lord Is Listening," Steven Kapp Perry, 1986). It was a beautiful moment of clarity and harmony.<br><br>When the song ended there was a joyous shout followed by the more familiar chaotic noises of kids racing back to the bus. When they got back their excitement and joy was tangible. "Did you hear us?" They relayed the story of an older couple who were nearby as they started. When they offered to sing for them, the couple smiled and started to back away, only to stand transfixed as the kids began singing.<br><br>Now when they started choir, nobody promised them a perfect moment in Zion Park on April 29, but there it was. If they had not been ready--individually prepared and collectively willing to participate--they could not have had that experience. It is one thing to arrive at a place like Zion's Weeping Rock and realize, "Yes, this could be a great place for a group of kids to spontaneously experience the product of their learning and the Lord's love through music," and quite another to feel, "Oh,<i>here</i>is the place you have prepared, and having been taught, I am ready."<br><br>Earlier, in describing the qualities that contribute to being teachable, I listed self-worth. How we understand self-worth greatly impacts the degree to which we are teachable. So my fifth point is that<i>self-worth is different from self-importance</i>. God loves us and we are of value to him. If I am teachable I can learn from those who acknowledge their worth without becoming vain, I can assess their strength and talents without becoming boastful, and, when surrounded by the blessings of a loving God, I can remember Alma's caution to his son:<br><br><i>Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy</i>. [Alma 38:14]<br><br>If we do not<i>care</i>much for ourselves, then to love our neighbor as ourself doesn't mean much. Loving ourselves can magnify our charity towards others. If we overvalue or undervalue ourselves, we are less able and ready to learn from others. We either think we can't learn much from them, or we don't trust their motive for interacting with us.<br><br>Helping someone to love himself or herself is harder than just telling that person that you love them. We each have a gift. We can learn how to remind each other of the value of our part and the contribution we can make to the whole.<br><h2><b>Strengthening Our Interactions</b></h2><br>Now, having sought to be more teachable and able to embrace the qualities and to comprehend the challenges, I want to suggest three aspects of our interaction where being teachable seems to be a very needed goal.<br><br>First, that we might<i>better know the experience of being a woman or a man in our congregation</i>. What is it like for someone who is different from us? If we are women, what can we know of the experiences of men as fathers, husbands, siblings, and brothers in the gospel? If we are men, what can we know of the experiences of women?<br><br>If we too quickly assume we know what the experience of someone else is or should be, then we are less prepared to learn from "speaking together concerning the welfare of our souls." I can imagine that Elder Maxwell's description of the quality of conversation in the city of Enoch is instructive to us as both men and women:<br><br><i>You should observe . . . how . . . they listen to each other instead of seeking to display their own learning. They are more willing to be impressed than they are eager to impress</i>. [Maxwell, p. 15]<br><br>I think that description is important no matter if we are "eager to impress" others of our "conservative" or "liberal" values. We have much to learn from one another in living the gospel, and we can best do that by staying in relationship to each other. I know in my own life it is easier to talk<i>about</i>somebody than<i>with</i>them--but my learning is different when we are speaking together. I have learned to listen without fearing that others will think my listening means agreement. And I have learned that being too anxious to tell others where our differences exist hasn't helped me understand them.<br><br>I welcome the opportunities to share the similarities and differences of our experience as sisters in living the gospel. I am interested in how men around us support our sisterhood and our learning. I want to know how they experience women supporting their friendships as men as well as sustaining the priesthood they hold.<br><br>A second area where being teachable can strengthen our interaction has to do with the quality of our service to one another in our congregation and communities. Having heard that where much is given much is expected, I have sometimes allowed my own<i>need to be serving</i>to determine what I did rather than paying close attention to the<i>needs of others</i>. Seeking to meet the needs of others is more of a challenge than doing what is convenient for me to be "helpful."<br><br>Paying attention to others is a powerful factor in how well we serve. Tim Gallwey wrote about the necessity of paying attention to service. Interestingly enough, he was talking about tennis. He was suggesting that to improve our serve we had to learn to love the tennis ball. "What!" I remembered saying. "Love a tennis ball?" But he meant pay attention to it, see how it bounces, see where the seams are when it comes at you--concentrate. When we love, we concentrate our attention.<br><br>By truly paying attention to others around me and concentrating on them, I can place myself in their service and am taught what is needed. I saw a very pragmatic example of this a few semesters ago when a study group member who obviously had better computer skills than the others didn't take the attitude "I learned it, so can they," and didn't say, "I'll do it since you'll never learn this anyway." Instead, he watched, he made himself available, he answered questions, he encouraged. He didn't exaggerate. In his daily interactions with his study group he was taught how he could best teach them, and he did.<br><br>Now, last of all, the best expression of our willingness to be teachable is to be ever ready to say at any moment in our lives, "Nevertheless, not my will, but thine." Elder Maxwell states, "The Lord loves both the teachable and the unteachable, but it is through the obedience of the teachable that God can help these helpers, that all might be benefited thereby" (Maxwell, p. 48).<br><br>For each of us and for myself, I pray that we will realize that our obedience; our agency; our acknowledgment of God's love for us and our love for him, for our neighbor, and for ourselves; our testimony of the truthfulness of his gospel; and our willingness to trust his further instruction are never more evident than when we can echo in a small way in our lives the words of our elder brother: "Here am I, send me." I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Kate L.

<h1>ithout the Struggle - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Everyone Struggles</b></h2><br>Do any of you ever get discouraged? Men, women, fathers, mothers, young and old--discouragement comes to all. Let me share with you a story about a discouraged young college man. This young man couldn't get enthusiastic about anything. He didn't seem to have any sense of responsibility. He lacked motivation. I suppose there was no mission call, no engagement, nothing exciting on the horizon.<br><br>He had a mature friend who came to him and said, "I can help you. Let<i>me</i>accept full responsibility for you, for your worries." He then told him, "I'm going to pay your tuition and I'm going to buy your clothes, and then I'll give you an automobile with a credit card for gas."<br><br>Does that sound like it would take a few of your worries away?<br><br>"And when you marry, I'll look for a wife for you." (I've heard of some cultures where they do that.) "And after you're married, I'll even buy a house for you, and I'll furnish it. Now, what do you think of that? Do you like my offer?"<br><br>I can see some very thoughtful faces right now. And this young man became thoughtful. He looked sober for a few minutes and then replied, "Well, if you did that, what would there be for me to live for?"<br><br>"Exactly. That is what I wanted you to see," said the man. "There is no joy without struggle and the exercise of one's own abilities."<br><br>This story was told in general conference by President Lee in 1972. But, you see, life's struggles go on--whether it is 1972 or 1982 or 1987 they are pretty much the same, aren't they?<br><br>I am impressed each day as I travel, read the newspaper, and hear the news on the radio or see it on television how many problems there are in the world: crime, accidents, sickness, natural and man-made disasters, hunger, and poverty. There seems to be no end to it. All of this may lead us to believe that there is nothing good occurring.<br><br>Of course that isn't true. Every day there are great events happening all around us--acts of heroism, courage, faithfulness, determination, commitment--things that may not seem newsworthy but are significant nonetheless. How wonderful it is when people can overcome discouragement, can rise above personal loss and move forward, gaining a victory where defeat appeared to be certain.<br><br>Each of us becomes discouraged at times. This is normal. But we need to recognize that we are not the only ones who have problems, and we must learn to be supportive of one another. It is easy to look at others and think how serene and trouble free their lives are and to feel sorry for ourselves. I was astonished one day when a neighbor, who had experienced a disappointment in her career, exclaimed angrily to me, as if I had caused her difficulty, "You don't know what it is like to have troubles. Everything has always gone smoothly for you. You've never had any frustrations or rejections in your life." Little did she know that at that time I had great concerns about one of my sons who was afflicted with a life-threatening illness. My problems were as troubling to me as her's were to her.<br><br>When I was working in Lambda Delta Sigma, one of our national officers was a single girl named Diane. One of the young college women with whom Diane had been relating had a lot of problems, and she expressed her feelings to me like this: "Well, none of<i>you</i>have any problems. Diane is perfect and she has everything going for her." As she said those words, I inwardly reflected on Diane's life. She had lost her sister to cancer, and now her only living relatives were this sister's two motherless children. Diane's mother had passed away just a couple of years earlier, and her father had died when she was only a child. So Diane quit her job at the Church Office Building and took care of those preschool children full-time. She lost all her benefits, retirement, seniority--everything--in order to care for them. She mothered those children for a year and a half until her brother-in-law remarried and could again provide nurturing care for them in his own home. I thought, "This girl does not see at all what Diane is going through." Sometimes we have a tendency to think, "I'm the only one that has a mountain to climb, the only one with a problem." We need to know that others also have problems and that the purpose of this life is to be tested, to experience both joy and sorrow.<br><h2><b>Help from the Lord</b></h2><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith cried to the Lord from Liberty Jail, in anguish of soul, at one of the most difficult periods of his life, and received this answer:<br><br><i>If thou art called to pass through tribulation; if thou art in peril among false brethren; if thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in perils by land or by sea;</i><br><br><i>If thou art accused with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why can't you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? And if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;</i><br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</i><br><br><i>. . . Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 122:5–9]<br><br>Few of us will ever pass through such adversity as Joseph Smith endured, but we will all need our Father's comfort and admonition many times in our lives.<br><br>I remember one particular day in the San Diego Mission Home, when my husband was the mission president. It was time to bid one group of missionaries good-bye and welcome and train new ones. The zone leaders were in for training. Food had to be prepared. Linens needed to be changed and laundry done. The home was crowded, full to overflowing; I was supposed to give the missionaries an encouraging, inspirational talk. I felt pressured, even desperate.<br><br>I found a quiet corner among the crowd and prayed almost out loud to Heavenly Father, asking, "What am I to do about all these responsibilities that come so fast? There is no time to prepare. Please help me." I suppose I expected the sympathetic words of a parent to come to me, "You poor, dear child." But instead I heard a voice saying, "This is not your time, but my time." The voice was firm and strong, and from that I knew I should rely on the Lord and I would find help from him.<br><br>I began my scripture study in earnest, first priority. I am so grateful now for that inspiration. I received great solace and comfort as I read the Book of Mormon. A guide came to me when I read Alma 37:35–37.<br><br><i>Learn wisdom . . . to keep the commandments of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and withersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</i><br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day</i>.<br><br>I have put these things to the test and bear witness that they are true. If we rely on the Lord, live his gospel, converse with him daily, and are obedient to his teachings, he will provide the way for us to accomplish his work!<br><br>This lesson continues to bless me and bear me up.<br><h2><b>The Eternal Nature of Things</b></h2><br>Our Heavenly Father<i>is</i>our Father, and he is watching over us, looking after us, guiding us, and directing us. And he will be there to help us if we have questions, problems, or trials if we will but go to him. And then, through the strength we find in him, our lot will not seem so difficult.<br><br>The gospel helps us to put things in their proper perspective, to see the eternal nature of things, and, through faith, to overcome our problems and recognize that many of them are blessings in disguise. Sometimes those who have suffered the greatest tragedies in life are brought to recognize that even those tragedies have been great blessings for growth and development.<br><br>Botanists say that trees need to flex their trunks and main branches so the sap is drawn up to nourish the budding leaves. In a like manner, perhaps we too need the gales of life, as difficult as they are to endure. A blustery period is often the prelude to a new spring of life if we keep steadfast in faith and look to the good.<br><br>Faith to overcome is what we need to help us in our trials. A number of years ago, a man in our community impressed me with his testimony. He was a convert from Ireland, joining the Church against the wishes of his family. They disowned him and never spoke to him again. Tragedy seemed to follow him. His first child developed a serious illness that left him $5,000 in debt (a huge sum at that time). Not long after this, his bishop called in sixty faithful members of his ward, telling them they needed to raise $30,000 immediately. When the bishop called for a show of hands of those who would contribute substantially, his faith wavered momentarily, but his wife quickly held up his hand. He did make his contribution, and the windows of heaven opened. Somehow he was able to pay his debts as well. He recounted what great blessings had come to him because he was faithful.<br><h2><b>Barbara Jayne Richards</b></h2><br>Not long ago we went to a wedding and saw the parents of a girl I knew a number of years ago--a girl who had been a great inspiration to me. I asked these parents, "How is Barbara doing?" They said, "She is doing just fine." Let me share her story with you in her words, which appeared in the<i>Instructor</i>a number of years ago. Barbara was a student at BYU at the time this incident occurred.<br><br><i>It was just a normal, ordinary day. . . . We were driving home from California. It was raining, and the roads were slick. The driver lost control. I remember the sensation of the car turning over and over, shutting my eyes, being tossed about with no control, the banging of my head and arms, the pain and confusion, and then the final, awful silence--it was over. When I opened my eyes it was to a new and frightening world--to the reality of being paralyzed from the waist down.</i><br><br><i>Once I might have thought of paralysis only as a terrible tragedy, but after it became a part of my life I discovered it could also bring blessings. My paralysis introduced me to a whole new way of living, to many wonderful people, to a new assemblage of problems, adjustments, frustrations, tears, laughter, and joy.</i>[I gained an]<i>appreciation for myself as a person and as a child of God, appreciation for other people, and especially a love and appreciation for my Father in heaven.</i><br><br><i>Oh, what a self-image I used to have! I used to feel self-conscious wearing glasses; and now I had to "wear" a wheelchair. I used to be embarrassed if I did a clumsy, awkward thing . . .; and now clumsy was my middle name. I used to think people stared at me before, but now! . . . I had to learn to laugh so others would feel at ease around me and I wouldn't feel so self-conscious. It may seem strange, but I appreciate myself more now than before I was paralyzed.</i><br><br><i>I used to take so many things for granted, things like showering, kneeling for prayers, dressing in a minute, getting places quickly. Now it is a challenge to do these once-simple things. (Just try getting out of a bathtub without using your legs.) I guess it took losing the use of my legs to make me start appreciating the physical body I have. Now I became very grateful for a clear mind with which to think, ears to hear, eyes to see . . ., hands that could do so many things.</i><br><br><i>Although I can't dance, hike, play volleyball or basketball anymore, I have found there are still many things I can do from a wheelchair. I can drive a car, swim better than before, play doubles in tennis, bowl, play catch in softball (nobody dares try to slide home), cook, sew . . ., and do many other enjoyable things.</i><br><br><i>Since that eventful day</i>[of my accident]<i>, I've realized the world is full of special people. How grateful I have become for a family who loves me--for parents who have stood by without a complaint, without a moment's hesitation, willing to give unselfishly of their time, money and love.</i><br><br><i>Going back to the Brigham Young University put me in a position where I had to rely on people to pull me up stairs, open doors, reach books, push me through snow, etc. I became indebted to my understanding, patient, helpful, loving roommates and friends. . . . I was also fortunate to have . . . professors who</i>[helped]<i>me when the physical facilities . . . limited my accomplishments. These instructors encouraged me when I was discouraged, helped me achieve in my studies, and were especially supportive while I worked to earn my degrees and my teaching certificate.</i><br><br><i>Later I was blessed to meet Mr. Alma Edwards, who gave me the opportunity to</i>[be a physical education instructor]<i>at West Lake Junior High School in Salt Lake City. Here at last I proved to myself and others that I could do a useful, productive job in society.</i><br><br><i>Because so many have done so much for me, I have learned how important it is to serve anyone in any way I can.</i><br><br><i>Perhaps the greatest blessing which came from my "tragedy" was the love and appreciation I developed for my Father in heaven. Without the gospel . . . , this life in a wheelchair would be hard to bear. After my accident I had to depend completely on the Lord for the first time in my life. He became a real person with whom I could talk and who would help me to solve the problems and make the adjustments that were to come. Without my understanding of God as my . . . loving, concerned Father, I would be in the same rut I have seen so many others in--that of blaming God for my misfortune.</i><br><br><i>If I had to choose the one thing that has helped me most in my adjustment it would be what Elder Harold B. Lee said in a blessing he gave me one Sunday in the hospital.</i><br><br><i>"Barbara, the Lord loves you," he said. With this knowledge what more did I need (what more does anyone need!) to keep trying, . . . to find reason and purpose in my life, to be happy, joyful and grateful for life, even in a wheelchair!</i>[Barbara Jayne Richards, "A Joyful Life (in a Wheelchair),"<i>Instructor,</i>July 1970, pp. 224–45]<br><br>I am happy to report that Barbara Richards served for many years as a girls' physical education teacher, instructing and influencing for good hundreds and hundreds of young women. She has continued to set goals for herself. She wanted to get a Ph.D., so set the goal and achieved it. Being in a wheelchair presented weight problems. She needed to lose forty pounds. She set the goal and achieved it.<br><br>Barbara is now teaching at the University of Utah. Her story teaches us so many lessons. When she talks about how self-conscious she used to be, worrying about her clumsiness, her looks, and what other people might think of her, I thought about how I felt when I was growing up, having those same kinds of concerns--concerns that each of us has--about our looks, our appearance, and what it takes to make us appealing to those about us. Some young people were asked in a recent survey, "What is it that makes a man successful?" Can you think what those teens replied? According to the survey, it is money. What is the second thing that makes men successful, according to those young people? Their appearance--their looks. And with a woman--what is it that makes her successful? Number one thing: appearance. Number two thing: money. Perhaps our values are not where they ought to be. Barbara learned, through this hard, hard experience, something of the deeper and more meaningful values in life.<br><br>Jesus gave us some instructions about those who worry too much about themselves:<br><br><i>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</i><br><br><i>And why take ye though for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field . . . shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? . . .</i><br><br><i>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you</i>. [Matthew 6:27–33]<br><br>I was impressed by Barbara's recognition of all the good things done for her by her friends, relatives, and particularly her Father in Heaven, and by how she realizes that she must reciprocate and give service to those about her.<br><br>Remember the words of King Benjamin to his people:<br><br><i>Learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of God.</i><br><br><i>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you . . . and is preserving you from day to day . . . I say if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye</i>(still)<i>would be unprofitable servants</i>. [Mosiah 2:17, 21]<br><br>Barbara learned the importance of having a testimony of our Heavenly Father's love from the statement of President Lee as he blessed her, "Barbara, the Lord loves you."<br><br>He love all of us and will help and guide us if we will but let him. How reassuring it is for us to have this knowledge, and how helpful when things are difficult. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). We must know how important each one of us is.<br><h2><b>This Life Is Our Test</b></h2><br>I have another good friend--a contemporary of mine--Geneva Brown. She has also been a great inspiration to me. A number of years ago she became afflicted with multiple sclerosis. Her health steadily deteriorated, confining her to a wheelchair. It would have been an easy thing for her to give up, but it was not her nature. She was a person who was used to doing and being busy in all kinds of things. But she has shown more determination that ever and has kept herself busy.<br><br>We saw her one day just coming out of the temple. I watched as her husband wheeled her across the street from the temple to the car, as he opened the door, and as she lifted herself from the wheelchair into the car. I kept wanting to reach out and help her some way. But she has learned how to manage. She is interested in people and things. How easy it would have been for her to refuse a calling in the Church, even to be a visiting teacher. Certainly she had an excuse. She didn't need to be a visiting teacher, but it was not her nature to quit. She was able to drive a car with special controls, so she would go on her visiting teaching rounds with her companion. When she arrived at the home of the sister to be visited, a beep of the horn would bring the sister out of her home to sit in the back seat of the car and be taught. Neighbors along the street, seeing the fun that was going on, would come out of their homes and join them until the car was full. Many were lifted and edified by this wonderful woman who was willing to push on and go the extra mile.<br><br>We might ask, "If God is a kind, loving father, why would he allow his children to suffer"? We must remember that he does not bring hardships upon us, that this life is our test, and that all of these things "shall give [us] experience and shall be for [our] good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7). We grow and develop spiritually by the things we experience. If there were no sadness we would not know joy; without bitterness we would not recognize the sweetness. We need the contrasts in order to progress.<br><br>I remember President Kimball talking about those who were disgruntled because God didn't do all they asked him to. He pointed out the folly of such thinking. If all our prayers were answered to our satisfaction, there would never be any sickness, no deaths, not unpleasant events, no poverty; but neither would there be growth. There would be no test for any of us. The purpose of our creation would be frustrated.<br><br>Some of our greatest problems can be the most help as we work through to the solution or toward overcoming these obstacles. And it is there in the growth and development of our character that we find great happiness and joy.<br><h2><b>As Happy As We Want To Be</b></h2><br>A couple of summers ago my husband and I went on a trip down the Danube River. We went down into the area around the Black Sea and across to Istanbul. Each day there were excursions into the various Eastern European countries. Some of them were quite taxing and tiring and required a lot of walking. A number of the tourists grumbled about everything. It was too hot or too cold or there was too much walking. It was too far. There was too much time between meals, and when we did get them, the meals weren't very good, and so on. You've seen those kinds of people. But we were very impressed with the cheerful disposition of a particular woman on the ship--a lovely lady. We never heard her complain about anything, and she was always smiling. Each day as we watched her, we would hear her exclaim happily over things that delighted her. She was a joy to be around--lifting the spirits of all who associated with her. And what was even more impressive about her was that this cheerful lady walked with difficulty and with a cane. In visiting with her we learned that she had been in an accident some time ago that required the amputation of a leg. One of her legs was artificial. Certainly she must have gone through many agonizing moments wondering why such a calamity had befallen her. Undoubtedly, at some point she realized she was blessed, that things could have been worse, that she yet had much to offer, and that feeling sorry for herself would not make her happy. She may have even reflected on the statement of the Savior when he said, "Be of good cheer," or perhaps when he said, "Let not your heart be troubled," and recognized that we can be as happy as we want to be.<br><h2><b>We Need To Count Our Blessings</b></h2><br>A great burden to me during my growing-up years was the fact that my folks were not active in the Church. I sensed that I was missing out on many of the things that others were enjoying. The depression was on. Jobs were hard to get. Because of this, our family moved frequently. Though we had to do without many material things, that never seemed a hardship to me. But always there was the longing that my parents would feel the importance of church activity. I loved them dearly and it hurt to see what was happening in our home. The Word of Wisdom was not observed. There was not the closeness and solidarity that appeared to be in the homes of my friends. I craved that peaceful atmosphere that was lacking. Fortunately, each place we moved there were good people who would encourage me and welcome me. I came to know the importance of the Church and the gospel. It hurt so much on the day of my wedding when my parents were not able to enter the temple but remained outside while that special ceremony took place. I am happy to report that later, through the help of caring friends and my loving husband, my parents did become active and were able to enjoy those blessing they had missed for so many years.<br><br>Just recently my mother and I returned to the neighborhood where we had lived when I was baptized. The area is shabby and forlorn. The house where we lived looked so tiny and run down. A great feeling of sadness came over me, not because of the humble circumstances, but because I vividly remembered how I felt as a child, knowing I was missing blessings that could have been mine.<br><br>Life is full of frustrations and challenges. Often we feel inadequate to deal with them. It is important that we recognize where help lies. A courageous divorced sister with the responsibility of raising six children wrote:<br><br><i>Gradually I am coming to realize that God is as close as or closer to us when we don't feel good as when we do . . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . He relates to each of us intimately, personally, and with unwavering attention. We only need to ask. He is unchanging, eternal, and immovable in His tenderness, His forgiveness, His absolute love. . . . We can call upon Him for guidance, comfort, and support, we can feel His arms about us, His smiling eyes encouraging us, at any moment, no matter how stupid or inept or impatient or selfish we may have been</i>. [Frances Warden, "To Always Have His Spirit,"<i>Single Sheet--A Publication of the Utah Valley Program for Single Adults,</i>January 1987, pp. 1–2]<br><br>When we are in the midst of the gale, remember the gospel of Jesus Christ is the good news. We are so blessed to have a knowledge of it. We need to constantly count our blessings. We have the physical things we need: food, clothing, shelter, and, as my dear counselor said the other day, we have plumbing--running water, potable water. What a blessing! We have opportunities for schooling to learn, develop our talents, and progress. We live in a free country. We usually have good health. We have friends and associates whom we love and who love and care about us. We have the knowledge of God's plan for us. What more could we ask?<br><br>I'd like to share with you a poem that was written by Leila Grace Bassford called "Prerequisite."<br><br><i>I prayed for strength when life pulsed low</i><br><i>Until God answered me:</i><br><i>"Go, lift the load of weary ones</i><br><i>Then I will strengthen thee."</i><br><br><i>I asked for courage when hope despaired,</i><br><i>Then came a voice benign:</i><br><i>"Inspire with faith thy brother's soul,</i><br><i>And I'll inspire thine."</i><br><br><i>I longed for light when darkness made</i><br><i>Me stumble through the night:</i><br><i>"Thy lamp held high for others' feet</i><br><i>Will make thy pathway bright."</i><br><br><i>I prayed that wisdom, talent, skill</i><br><i>Increased their meager store:</i><br><i>"First, share the portions that you have,</i><br><i>And I will give thee more."</i><br><br><i>At length I learned that blessings sought,</i><br><i>And help for which I pray,</i><br><i>Are only mine when shed abroad</i><br><i>And given, first, away</i>.<br>[Leila Grace Bassford, in<i>Especially for Mormons,</i>vol. 3, complied by Stan and Sharon Miller (Provo, Utah: Kellirae Arts, 1976), p. 252]<br><br>I'll close with a statement from Philippians that I think is so appropriate for us. "This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 3:13–14). There can be joy in the struggle as we exercise our abilities and press toward the mark.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, our Heavenly Father loves us! Jesus Christ is our hope. As we lose ourselves in their service we will be blessed and helped to overcome our difficulties. I know that our Savior dies for us, that he made it possible for us to have eternal life and exaltation. It is my prayer that each of us finds the testimony of that hope and shares it with others. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Barbara W.

<h1>ervations on the Law of the Harvest - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I would like to share, for your prayerful consideration, some observations on the purpose of our mortal existence--on the point of our coming here to earth. According to scripture, that purpose is to permit us to pass through the death introduced by Adam unto fullness of life everlasting made possible by Jesus Christ. About this purpose, scripture is abundantly clear. Adam fell and introduced death into the world. In doing this he fulfilled the purpose of God in our creation. He "fell that men might be"--that humankind might realize their divine potential. We could not realize that potential if we did not first experience death. Jesus Christ came into the world that all might pass through the experience of death to life and full and everlasting. As he himself said, "He that hearth my word, and believeth on him that sent me . . . is passed from death unto life" (John 5:24). "I have come," he said, "that men may have life, and may have it in all its fullness" (New English Bible, John 10:10).<br><br>So I repeat: to pass from death unto fullness of life everlasting--that is the purpose of our mortal existence, why we came to earth. Without this mortal experience, without Adam's bringing death into the world, and without the saving works of Jesus Christ, we could not attain the very purpose of our being--everlasting fullness of life.<br><br>Thus my aim is to share some observations about the purpose of mortal existence. My desire is that our understanding, our awareness, of our purpose for coming to earth might be renewed or enlarged. To make it easier to follow what I say, I will number each observation I make. Needless to say, there is much that could be said that will not be.<br><h2><b>First Observation</b></h2><br>Consider first the significance of life and death when these terms are used to express our purpose for coming to earth. When Jesus says that whoever receives his word and believes on him who sent him is "pass from death unto life," the term "life"--the Greek term<i>zoe</i>--means everlasting fullness of life. Life in this sense--everlasting fullness of life--constitutes humankind's Highest Possibility, our Ultimate Good, the overall End of our existence. The whole purpose of God in making possible our eternal existence is to bring to pass our never-ending fullness of life (Moses 1:39). That is what God is all about. And what we are all about.<br><br>Death is defined and explained in terms of life as life's opposition--as life's absolute negation. So death means the entire "corruption" (Galatians 6:8) and "destruction" (Matthew 7:13) of all that makes life full and everlasting. Death refers to human existence that is not full. It refers in the final analysis to human existence that is void and empty; existence that is dark, spiritless, and miserable; existence without continuation of lives (2 Nephi 32:4; Alma 12:6; Mosiah 3:25; and D&amp;amp;C 132:22). Scripture teaches that death in this sense is human existence contrary to the nature of a God, existence cut off from his presence (Alma 41:11, 40:26).<br><br>Thus defined, life and death constitute the grand alternatives, the overall possibilities of human existence. Life everlasting and full is our highest possibility; and death is the corruption and destruction of that possibility. Life and death thus defined are our ultimate options, in terms of which all other choices, all other options, are finally to be understood. As Lehi saw, in the final analysis our freedom as human beings has to do with whether we "choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or . . . choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:27).<br><h2><b>Second Observation</b></h2><br>Everlasting fullness of life and its opposite, death, are universal categories, the ultimate possibilities of persons everywhere. Whatever their way of living, whatever their time, place, or culture, all persons finally stand before these grand alternatives--fullness of life or death.<br><br>We do not face these great alternatives from a position outside them--from a neutral position. Because of Adam's fall and the workings of sin in the world, we all face the possibilities of life and death from a place in the world already marked by death. In other words, we stand before our highest possibility and its negation "in a lost and in a fallen state" (1 Nephi 10:6). In brief, all of us face the great alternatives of life and death already in the grip of death, in a mode of existence contrary to the nature of happiness (Alma 41:11)--a mode that, as Lehi told his son Jacob, would naturally result in our perishing from that which is good and in our becoming miserable forever (2 Nephi 2:5).<br><br>In our fallen state, living in the unredeemed world marked by death, we all at some time hunger and thirst for life. Scripture sometimes represents this hunger and thirst for life as a desire to partake of the fruit of the tree of life that stands opposite the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden (2 Nephi 2:15). This fruit alone can everlastingly satisfy our hunger and thirst for life--our desire to realize our highest possibility as human beings. As Alma said of those who reach that tree and eat of its fruit and never become ashamed and depart from it: "And ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst" (Alma 32:42).<br><h2><b>Third Observation</b></h2><br>Our passing from death unto life is something of profound seriousness. Of this the prophets and the heavens are keenly aware. Of course, all of us may recognize intellectually that whether or not we reach our highest possibility is pretty important. But this sort of recognition is not the same thing as the moving awareness that God's prophets and the heavens have of what is ultimately at stake in our passing through death to life full and never ending. For them--both the prophets and the heavens--our purpose for being here truly is a matter of life and death, whereas for many of us the tragedy of eternal death has not yet really dawned on us, and the possibility of our own everlasting fullness of life seems beyond our grasp.<br><br>On this point recall the experience of Enoch. He witnessed the mighty God of the whole universe weeping over those who had embraced the ways of death, and at first Enoch seemingly could not comprehend what he was witnessing. In Moses we read:<br><br><i>And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept, and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains?</i><br><br><i>And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?</i>[Moses 7:28–29]<br><br><i>The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;</i><br><br><i>And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood.</i>[Moses 7:32–33]<br><br><i>Wherefore, for this shall the heavens weep, yea, and all the workmanship of mine hands.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Enoch, and told Enoch all the doings of the children of men; wherefore Enoch knew, and looked upon their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and his heart swelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook</i>. [Moses 7:40–41]<br><br>What makes spiritual death particularly dreadful in the eyes of the prophets and the heavens is that our time for passing from death into life is limited. The time for escaping death is called our probationary period. For those who choose not to take the path from death to life, the time will come when, in the words of Samuel the prophet, the "days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure" (Helaman 13:38).<br><br>Because our probationary period is limited, those in the work of the Lord who are aware of what is at stake in our being here on earth become consumed with the urgent desire to assist their fellow beings in embracing the word of life--the gospel of Christ. The sons of Mosiah, you may recall, experience personally the awful state of those who persist in the ways of death until it is everlastingly too late (Mosiah 27). Accordingly,<br><br><i>they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble</i>. [Mosiah 28:3]<br><br>But we--all humankind--can escape death. None need perish. God offers to all through his son Jesus Christ the way to life everlasting and full. Consider once more the experience of Enoch. After Enoch became profoundly aware of the fate of those who suffer spiritual death, his mind was opened so that he comprehended how all can escape death through Jesus Christ. And his soul rejoiced. Let me read from the text.<br><br><i>And as Enoch saw this</i>[the fate of those who had not escaped sin and death]<i>, he had bitterness of soul, and wept over his brethren, and said unto the heavens: I will refuse to be comforted; but the Lord said unto Enoch: Lift up your heart and be glad; and look.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass the Enoch looked; and from Noah, he beheld all the families of the earth; and he cried unto the Lord, saying: When shall the day of the Lord come? When shall the blood of the Righteous be shed, that all they that mourn may be sanctified and have eternal life?</i><br><br><i>And the Lord said: It shall be in the meridian of time, in the days of wickedness and vengeance.</i><br><br><i>And behold, Enoch saw the day of the coming of the Son of Man, even in the flesh; and his soul rejoiced, saying: The Righteous is lifted up, and the Lamb is slain from the foundation of the world; and through faith I am in the bosom of the Father, and behold, Zion is with me.</i>[Moses 7:44–47]<br><br>Lehi underwent an experience similar to Enoch's. He was deeply troubled by the wickedness of the people of Jerusalem, and so he "prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people" (1 Nephi 1:5). Then he saw in vision the pathway by which all humankind could escape death and enjoy eternal life. And<br><br><i>he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!</i><br><br><i>And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him</i>. [1 Nephi 1:14–15]<br><h2><b>Fourth Observation</b></h2><br>The Passing from death unto life entails an awakening and flowering of our vitality as living beings that result in a fullness of life, which is desirable above all that is desirable. Alma uses an analogy to describe this coming to life (see Alma 32). He likens the word of life to a seed (Philippians 2:16; Alma 32:28) that we can, if we choose, plant in our hearts. The word of life is actually the seed of the tree of life that stood in the Garden of Eden (Alma 32:40–41). Alma says that if we nourish the seed, and do not cast it out by our unbelief, it will begin to grow within us. This growth Alma describes as a very literal, actual, special flourishing of our vitality as living beings. To use Alma's terms, the "word" of life begins to "swell within" our "breasts," begins to "enlarge" the "soul," and "expand" the "mind" until our life as a living being becomes everlastingly full (Alma 32:28, 30, 34, 41). The experience we have of our life enlarging and expanding as we pass from death unto life, Alma says, will be very "delicious" and "desirable" to us. And fullness of life itself he describes as "most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure" (Alma 32:42).<br><h2><b>Fifth Observation</b></h2><br>What is contained in the word of life, the gospel of Jesus Christ, that gives it alone such power to enlarge and expand us until our life is everlastingly full? Much could be said about that. But one thing seems basic to all else that might be said about the power of the word of life literally to give life. It is revealed by the fact that the tree of life symbolizes two things. It symbolizes, of course, everlasting fullness of life. But it also symbolizes, as Nephi tells us, the love of God. Let me quote Nephi's words:<br><br><i>And the angel said unto me: . . . Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</i><br><br><i>And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.</i><br><br><i>And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</i>[1 Nephi 11:21–23]<br><br>When we combine what Alma tells us about the tree of life with what Nephi says, we get the following picture. On the one hand, according to Alma, the tree of life represents life full and never ending. The fruit of that tree is "sweet above all that is sweet" and most delicious (Alma 32:42). Since every seed, Alma says, produces after its own likeness (Alma 32:31), we may describe, as Paul does, the word that grows up in us until our life is full and without end, the "word of life" (Philippians 2:16; Alma 32:28). On the other hand, according to Nephi, the tree of life represents that love of God. This love "sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men" and is "most joyous to the soul" and "most desirable above all things" (1 Nephi 11:22, 23). Again, since every seed produces after its own kind, the seed that grows into the tree of life, which represents, the love of God, must be the word of love. So the word of life is essentially the word of love. In the final analysis, it is the growth of divine love within us that enlarges and expands us until our life is full without end. Fullness of life consists of life full of divine love. Love, in the special divine sense, is the fundamental source of a fullness of living existence that never ends, a fullness that is "sweet above all that is sweet" (Alma 32:42) and "most joyous to the soul" (1 Nephi 11:23).<br><h2><b>Sixth Observation</b></h2><br>To pass from death unto life we must keep the commandments of God. Jesus said that "If thou wilt enter into life, keep my commandments" (Matthew 19:17). As Paul insisted,<br><br>[God]<i>will render to every man according to his deeds:</i><br><br><i>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life</i>. [Romans 2:6–7]<br><br>So Paul tells us "not [to] be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not" (Galatians 6:9).<br><br>But in seeking one's life, there is an important lesson to learn about keeping the commandments just<i>in order to</i>enter into life. Consider the experience of King Benjamin's people. Recall that King Benjamin, from the time he was a young man until he was very old, labored unceasingly to assist his people in passing from death unto life. In his old age, just a few days before he was to deliver his last address to his people as their prophet-king, he said of them that "they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord" (Mosiah 1:11). Please keep in mind this description of King Benjamin's people before he addressed them for the last time: "They have been," he said, "a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord." In a moment I will contrast this description of them with another one that brings out the important lesson to which I just alluded.<br><br>Despite the fact that his people were a diligent people in keeping the Lord's commandments, Benjamin knew that his labors as their prophet and king were not yet finished. He knew, as the record tells us, that his people had not yet become a pure-in-heart people--they had not yet passed through death unto life. So with this in mind, and with the instructions from an angel of the Lord, Benjamin prepared and delivered his final teachings to the people he loved. Let me read now from Mosiah the impact Benjamin's address had on his people.<br><br><i>And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</i><br><br><i>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men</i>. [Mosiah 4:1–2]<br><br>Think of it! Before he gave his last address, King Benjamin described his people as a diligent people in keeping the commandments. But by the end of his address the people themselves could see that they in fact were still in a "carnal state," and they pleaded with the Lord to purify their hearts (Mosiah 4:2).<br><br>As we know, their prayers were answered. Their hearts were purified by the Spirit of the Lord. The record says that they all "cried with one voice saying: . . . the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent . . . has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2). And Benjamin, his lifetime desire as a prophet for his people finally fulfilled, said: "Behold, this day he [the Lord] hath spiritually begotten you; . . . ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters" (Mosiah 5:7). King Benjamin's people had passed from death unto life. For, you see, to pass from death unto life means being born of Christ, being purified, becoming his sons and daughters.<br><br>Why were King Benjamin's people still in a "carnal state" despite the fact that they were a diligent people in keeping the commandments? The carnal mind is one that seeks its own life. So I suspect that part of the answer is that King Benjamin's people diligently kept the commandments<i>in order to</i>save their own lives. Before purification his people were seeking each his own life through good works. But keeping the commandments cannot help save us unless we keep them diligently in a life-losing way. Each must lose his life to find it. That is what the law of the harvest means. Each must plant the seed of divine love in his or her heart and nourish it by faith and good works. Only then can the "Spirit of the Lord" (Mosiah 5:2; Alma 32:28) enlarge our souls and expand our minds until fullness of life never ending is ours.<br><h2><b>Closing Observation</b></h2><br>All of us hunger and thirst for life and want to escape from death. Some of us, for a time, may seek--through fame or fortune, through power or wealth, through education or scholarship, through material and physical satisfactions--the life we do not yet have. But these ways of pursuing life will all fail. The promises of life these ways offer are false promises. To gain life--life full and without end--we must fully embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ and be reborn and become people of pure love. There is no other way. Unless we do this we cannot pass from death unto life, we cannot satisfy our hunger and thirst for life--not fully, not lastingly. Each must come as a little child unto God through Jesus Christ and plant the word of life in his heart and nourish it until it becomes within him the tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and sweet above all that is sweet, and pure above all that is pure.<br><br>My prayer is that the love of God might grow up among us until we enjoy a fullness of life together in the everlasting kingdom of our Father. For this I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>A.

<h1>sons I Learned from Living Sixty Years - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I always feel inadequate when responding to an invitation to speak to a group such a this. I commend you for the interest you have in self-improvement that has brought you to the BYU campus for the special activities associated with Campus Education Week. It has been my sincere desire in preparing for the remarks I will share with you today to deal with matters that will be relevant and of some practical value for you. I recognize the need I have for the blessings of the Spirit, and I have earnestly prayed for that blessing on my own behalf as well as for you.<br><h2><b>We Are Still Short of Perfection</b></h2><br>When I was younger, I used to wonder if I would ever live to be sixty years old. It seemed like a very advanced age not so many years ago. Now that I have passed that milestone, I find myself reflecting more frequently and more seriously upon things that I need to do with the time that is left--improvements that need to be made, weaknesses that need to be overcome. Earlier it always seemed that there would be enough time for dealing with these things. Now I am not so sure. The imperfections I have always been aware of are, in too many instances, still there. I think some progress has occurred as time has passed. But has it really kept pace with the opportunities that have come and the expectations that others have held out for me? How well have I been qualifying myself in the Lord's eyes? I wonder about this frequently. Is there a possibility that I can measure up to his expectations in the time that is left?<br><br>These are sobering reflections.<br><br>When I am conscious of the imperfections in my own life and am aware of the frailties that exist in the lives of others, even men and women for whom I have the greatest love, reverence, and respect--I wonder how the Lord will be able to accomplish his purposes through such weak vessels. I also realize, with increasing awe as my own life passes, how magnificent was that one perfect life--that of the Savior Jesus Christ--and how absolutely dependent all of us are upon the mercy that is extended to us through his atoning sacrifice.<br><br>One of the lessons I have learned from living as long as I have is that all of God's mortal children, save that one perfect Son, are imperfect. God must accomplish his work through those of us who are still struggling toward some degree of perfection. The determination to endure in this struggle is what seems to set some apart from others.<br><br>In my readings of the Book of Mormon I am repeatedly impressed by the greatness of the character and the spiritual powers of Nephi, the son of Lehi. To me, Nephi has always been one of the most valiant, faithful Christians who has ever lived. He seems almost superhuman to me. As I have read of his life and ministry, I have found myself standing up against the enormous spiritual image that he casts and feeling myself a pygmy by comparison. He seems so perfect in so many of the things in which I am grossly imperfect. I find it, for this reason, a little hard to relate to him. He is somewhat beyond me.<br><br>And yet this marvelous man, the spiritual giant, reveals his humanness and imperfection to us in the remarkable soliloquy he pronounces in the fourth chapter of the second book bearing his name in the Book of Mormon. In this recorded outpouring of his soul he makes no attempt at self-justification. He doesn't seek for our sympathy or our empathy. His cry is simply the honest acknowledgement that, notwithstanding the stature to which he has attained in the eyes of God and man and the remarkable success that he has enjoyed in administering the work of the Lord, in his own eyes he is still short of the perfection that his soul longs for. He says,<br><br><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.</i><br><br><i>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</i><br><br><i>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</i><br><br><i>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted</i>. [2 Nephi 4:16-19]<br><br>Nephi then confesses his dependence upon the love and the strength that flow to him from the presence of God, without which he simply is as other men. In the light of this love and the never-failing source of strength, Nephi finds hope and reassurance. He continues,<br><br><i>O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of the mine afflictions? . . .</i><br><br><i>Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul</i>. [2 Nephi 4:26, 28]<br><br>Paul, the indomitable missionary apostle of the New Testament, echoed the feelings of Nephi in acknowledging his own struggles against imperfections. Paul said,<br><br><i>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</i><br><br><i>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</i><br><br><i>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</i><br><br><i>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</i><br><br><i>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</i>[Romans 7:15, 19, 22–24]<br><br>Then Paul, of course, acknowledges the ultimate source of his hope and his strength, just as Nephi has done.<br><br>These acknowledgements of imperfection in the lives of those whom I admire and sustain as the Lord's servants does not cause me to lose faith and confidence in them nor in mankind. It only underlines the fact that we are all engaged in the same effort to make ourselves better and to approach increasingly the prefect model of the Savior. That effort, according to Joseph Smith, will be a continuing one:<br><br><i>It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave</i>. [<i>Teachings,</i>p. 348]<br><br>I have learned that my own progress cannot always be represented by a sustained, constant upward curve. There are ups and downs. I observe this same phenomenon in the lives of those with whom I am well acquainted. The encouraging thing about this movement along the course of life is that in most instances the lows experienced in more recent times are generally higher on the curve toward perfection than some of the highs were in earlier years. Often the greatest challenge is to sustain the effort when some slippage has occurred. It is particularly difficult when we are inclined to measure our own weaknesses against the strengths of others.<br><h2><b>The Determination Not to Succumb</b></h2><br>One lesson life has taught me is that there is absolutely no value or benefit in being critical and judgmental of failings we observe in someone else's life. A sensitivity to our own weakness sometimes seems to create the temptation to note and underscore the imperfections we see in others. Through this process we sometimes try to justify and condone our own failings. It is a deceitful thing to do. It not only impedes our own progress, but it can be hurtful to those whom we judge and often criticize before others.<br><br>I know that I must appeal not only to the mercy of God, through the redemption of his holy Son, but I must also rely upon the forgiveness and compassion of those who know me best and whose lives brush against mine.<br><br>Sometimes those whom I disappoint or offend are those who look to me for leadership and example, who must surely despair at times because of my failings.<br><br>I have learned, perhaps more at times when my own shortcomings are so evident, that it is not always the degree of observable progress that matters so much as the unyielding determination not to succumb finally and irrevocably to the "temptations and sins which do so easily beset me," to use Nephi's vernacular. I have come to believe that<i>enduring,</i>as the term is so frequently used in the scriptures, is as much related to an attitude or a state of mind as it is to a course of overt action. It is manifest in a determination never to yield in the struggle. It causes us to say to ourselves constantly: "I will not give in to my failings. Regardless of how often I lose my footing and slip backward on the path of progress, I will get up and I will move on. I will not quit. I will endure to the end that one day I will quality for eternal life."<br><br>Incumbent in this determination is the absolute faith and confidence that through the infinite atonement of Jesus Christ and the mercies of God there is still hope for me. Nephi said,<br><br><i>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life</i>. [2 Nephi 31:20]<br><h2><b>The Necessary Influence of the Spirit</b></h2><br>Perhaps the most significant lesson of all that I have learned is that I cannot succeed in this struggle alone. I must have the love, compassion, support, and confidence of those who know me best. But most important, I must have the strength, the light, and the spiritual power that only come from a divine source. I must have this help to rise above the human frailties that I possess. Man cannot, by his own resources, even with the love and support of his fellow beings, rise above the limitations of human weakness and imperfection. He is lost if he tries to stand alone.<br><br>King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon understood this great truth when he said,<br><br><i>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father</i>. [Mosiah 3:19]<br><br>I don't believe that we are to understand from Benjamin's statement that mankind is evil by nature. The Savior himself has said, "Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning: and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God" (D&amp;amp;C 93:38).<br><br>The carnal state of man in mortal life comes as a result of man's individual transgressions. Moses made this clear in his description of the consequences that came to the children of Adam as they fell into disobedience after they had been taught the law of God. Moses explains:<br><br><i>And Satan came among them, saying: I am also a son of God; and he commanded them, saying: Believe it not</i>[that is, don't believe the law of God];<i>and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish</i>. [Moses 5:13]<br><br>The fallen state that Benjamin describes for the natural man is one that man brings upon himself through disobedience. His only hope for rising above this state is through the sanctifying, purifying influence of the Spirit of God, which comes into one's life as a result of sincere repentance for sins that are committed and also the adoption of the nature described by Benjamin: submissive, meek, humble, patient, willing to submit to every test without faltering. It is then that the Spirit of God can work its lifting, refining influence in our lives, making spiritual progress possible. I have learned that without this influence we have no prospect of attaining to the perfections that our Eternal Father holds out as a challenge for all of his children.<br><br>It has seemed to me, after sixty years of experience in the mortal struggle, that the single greatest need I have is to nurture those qualities described by Benjamin. I know the Savior has done everything for me I cannot do for myself. I have absolute confidence that his infinite atonement will apply to me if I will endure in my effort to improve and to become more like him. My highest goal in life should be to incorporate into my own nature the qualities that he so perfectly exemplified in his life and ministry. In this way I respond to his invitation to come unto him. Not only will I then feel comfortable with being in his holy presence, but I will discover that I have become more like him and will therefore be more able to assist him in his work and in the blessing of my fellowmen.<br><h2><b>How We Deal with Others</b></h2><br>The Christ-like qualities we need to develop are best demonstrated in the way we relate to others. Perhaps I can illustrate to a degree what I mean by sharing with you something that happened a year or so ago. Sister Larsen and I attended church meetings in the little Idaho town where Sister Larsen was born and where she lived during her girlhood years. During priesthood meeting I was participating in a discussion with the high priest group of the ward. The subject of the lesson being reviewed that morning had to do with honesty and integrity. The discussion had led us into a consideration of how honest, in strictly legalistic sense, may not always be adequate in our dealings with others. There were comments about the need for being fair and equitable also. The men in the group came mostly from farming backgrounds. Their sense of values was basic and unencumbered by some of the subtleties we are so often afflicted with.<br><br>To illustrate a point he was attempting to make, one of the men in the group said, "Let me tell you a story about Uncle Otto." I was immediately alert with interest. I knew the Uncle Otto referred to was my father-in-law. He had passed away more than ten years before. He was actually of no blood relationship to the man who was speaking. He had simply been known as Uncle Otto to some of those whose parents had associated closely with him and who had shared his way of life.<br><br>I must explain that my father-in-law had spent his life working a small farm. He had homesteaded part of the ground as a young man just at the turn of the century. In those early years horses were an essential ingredient in the success of the farmer. Living conditions were very stringent by our present standards. Having a good team had much to do with whether a year's work showed profit or a loss.<br><br>My father-in-law was a quiet man. He was not apt to say much about his inner feelings. He worked hard, and he loved the land he farmed. He was never called upon to carry responsibilities of notoriety in the Church or in the community. But everyone knew the principles upon which he stood. The only sermons he ever preached were those that came unspoken from the way he lived.<br><br>Returning to the discussion in the priesthood group, the man continued with the story about Uncle Otto. He spoke of a long-term negotiation that had gone on between his father and my father-in-law over the possible trade of some horses. Such a transaction was entered into with greatest care because so much was at stake. This was especially the case in matching pairs of horses as teams. An agreement had finally been reached that appeared to be totally acceptable to both the farmers. The trade was made.<br><br>The man relating the story concluded in this way.<br><br><i>It was on the evening of the day the horse trading had taken place. We were sitting around our kitchen table, eating our evening meal. Father had been telling us how pleased he was with the trade he had made with Uncle Otto. Apparently he was totally satisfied with the outcome of the transaction. Suddenly there was a knock at our door, and father went to see who was calling us. It was Uncle Otto. He stood in the doorway to speak to my father, but we at the table could easily overhear the conversation.</i><br><br><i>"I've been thinking about the trade we made today," Uncle Otto said. "I haven't felt exactly right because I think I got a little the best of the deal."</i><br><br><i>His hand went into the pocket of his overalls and came out with a beautiful pocketknife that he obviously treasured.</i><br><br><i>"I've thought it over," Uncle Otto said, "and I'd feel a lot better if you'd take this knife."</i><br><br>The man who shared this story with us told how deeply he had been impressed, even as a boy, by this act of personal integrity that seemed to go beyond basic honesty.<br><br>Developing qualities of this kind helps us to move forward toward greater perfection.<br><h2><b>How Can We Judge?</b></h2><br>One of the things that has greatly concerned me over the years, and perhaps more so in recent times, is the proclivity some have for searching out and advertising imperfections in the lives of Church leaders, particularly those who have now passed on. I spend much of my time in direct association with the leadership of the Church on the general level and in the regions, stakes, and mission as well. It isn't difficult to observe the human qualities in all these people, but I am continually impressed by the great desire and determination they have to do what is right in God's eyes. Sometimes they may do it imperfectly, but I cannot feel that this gives others license to demean them or scorn them. I am generally conscious, when I am associating with these men and women, of a subtly witnessing spirit that they have the Lord's endorsement. I see them as fellow participants in the struggle toward greater excellence and more effectiveness in administering the Lord's work. Sometimes I see the anguish they experience when they know they could have done better. I know that feeling so well myself.<br><br>Once in a great while we see a leader betray the trust that is placed in him, but it is a comparatively rare thing. It is not difficult for me to sustain the ones I know best as the Lord's servants, even though I may not always find myself in total agreement with them, nor they with me.<br><br>The Lord gives a solemn warning to those who make a practice of castigating those whom he has chosen to guide his work.<br><br><i>Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them</i>. [D&amp;amp;C 121:16]<br><br>It is so difficult to us to judge justly when we must judge from a position of imperfection ourselves.<br><br>I have permission from one of my daughters, Kristine Bicker, to share with you today an extract from some of her writings on this subject. Perhaps the spirit of it will convey a feeling to you that will be more meaningful than my own expressions would be. I quote from her writing:<br><br><i>The top drawer of my mother's desk is always untidy. It is filled with unimportant odds and ends that, by nature, accompany a busy life. As I sorted through the clutter I smiled to myself at the treasures this drawer has absorbed through the years. There were old sales slips from Auerbach's, yellow no.2 pencils--some without lead or erasers--a couple of bobby pins, a plastic straw with one end chewed flat, and a little red spiral notebook. The notebook fell open in my hand. The writing, tiny and crimped, looked unfamiliar, and I wondered who had filled these pages with such an unsure hand.</i><br><br><i>After reading a line or two I knew the mystery of the ledger. It had belonged to my late Grandmother Johnson. She had written in crisp, incomplete sentences about visiting some friends in Rexburg. There were a number of paragraphs about a trip to Europe with Uncle Harold. As I skimmed the pages I found some sketchy gardening tips copied from an old issue of</i>Better Homes and Gardens<i>and a recipe for zucchini-oatmeal bread--useless because there were several words I couldn't quite decipher. There was also a shopping list that read, "Two pairs of stockings, one good blouse, five pounds of flour, stamps at post office, twine to tie up roses."</i><br><br><i>Across from each entry was a corresponding price notation, and then subtractions and additions. The noting disclosed obviously that this particular list maker had been mindful of her expenditures and prudent.</i><br><br><i>I had not known this woman, my grandmother, very well. She brought ten spirits into the world--my mother being next to the youngest. It followed then that by the time I was old enough to be aware of Grandma Johnson she was almost too old to be aware of me. I remembered only bits and pieces of experiences shared with her. Riding through the inky blackness of Yellowstone Park at night to get to Grandma's house and then being carried half-asleep up the steep sidewalk, past the profusion of rose bushes, to be put in bed with my sisters in the blue bedroom is one of my recollections.</i><br><br><i>My grandmother fed us peaches, homemade bread with preserves, and lots of soup. Kool-aid was a staple, sodas a luxury. She baked lots of spicy cookies, but hid them very carefully on the top shelf in one of her big china bowls lest we ruin our suppers. Her kitchen door had a very tight spring and always, always banged shut with a resonating smack, after which my grandmother always, always said, "Don't slam the kitchen door." (As if we could have prevented it from closing that way.)</i><br><br><i>In Grandma Johnson's house there was a painting of a forest fire that hung on a shadowy wall of the upstairs landing. The picture was dark and ominous, with brilliant, orange flames licking hungrily at the skeletons of black trees. It terrified all of us children. To keep from becoming too frightened, we ran past it without looking.</i><br><br><i>My grandmother liked to dress in pretty suits with soft, crepe blouses. She loved to wear hats. My sisters and I played with reckless abandon in the bandboxes full of hats on the floor of the closet in the blue bedroom. We would pose in pretty cameos in front of the vanity that had been my mother's when she was a little girl. After an hour or so, Grandma Johnson would call up the stairs: "You girls aren't in my hats, are you?" And we would call back down: "No, Grandma, we aren't in your hats." We knew she was too unsteady to climb up all those steep stairs to find us out.</i><br><br><i>One afternoon, however, without any warning, she appeared in righteous indignation at the bedroom door, catching us in a profusion of organza net and straw flowers. We didn't know how she climbed those stairs so quietly or gotten past that fire painting, but the joy went out of playing dress-up, and we didn't bother her hats again.</i><br><br><i>Grandmother Johnson had a passion for giving and getting pretty cards. She especially like the ones with cutout borders, artfully covered with sketches of flowers. We read and reread the verses inside that intimated thoughts about love and friendship. She kept those cards with messages special to her displayed for months on top of the desk and buffet in her dining room.</i><br><br><i>I caught myself smiling at these fragments of memories, and turned again to the page of the shopping list. In one corner I could make out faintly a date, and realized, after a moment or so, that she had composed a little budget during the semester for which she had paid the money owed for my tuition at college. She had also secured my student housing. I felt a twinge of uneasiness as I remembered how cavalier I had been about her generosity. I had experienced a degree of gratitude, but being young, I suppose, expected good things as a matter of course.</i><br><br><i>I wondered now, studying her ciphering, if perhaps my grandmother had passed up a special little hat, or neglected to put in a new rose hybrid because her spare dollars had been used to purchase my books. I regretted not telling her I was sorry about playing in her Sunday hats and for not catching the kitchen door fast enough. I hope I told her that I loved her because I just discovered how much she must have loved me.</i><br><br><i>I am grateful for that feeling deep inside that she isn't gone forever. I think there are many discoveries we will want to share. Perhaps she will remember the missing words in the zucchini-oatmeal bread recipe, and she can tell me how she got past so quietly that forest fire painting on the landing of her stairs to find us in her hats.</i>[Kristine L. Bicker,<i>Memories of My Grandmother,</i>used by author's permission]<br><h2><b>Taking the Challenge</b></h2><br>I have some sensibility of the price that is paid regularly by those who are attempting to administer the Lord's work. But I am confident that I cannot begin to understand at my present stage of development the love and willingness to sacrifice for the good of others that filled the soul of Joseph Smith, and certainly not that of the Savior of Mankind. But, perhaps through my continued experience, I will learn better and will one day be able to share my feelings more comfortably with them.<br><br>In summary, I have learned from living sixty years that imperfections are challenges all of us must deal with. We cannot overcome them nor their consequential effects in our lives without the Lord's help. We cannot permit ourselves to be overcome by them, and there is absolutely no benefit to be gained by detecting and advertising those we see in the lives of others.<br><br>May the Lord help all of us to move purposefully forward along the path to a greater perfection with a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunities he provides us--challenging though they may be at times--to become more like him.<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dean L.

<h1> Commandments, Beginning Right Now! - Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We call this a fireside. I'm not really sure what that means in the Church. But let me use my own interpretation tonight if I may. I would like to talk to you as I would talk to my own family--somewhat informally, but very earnestly. I would like to talk to you tonight about matters I think are of deep concern and I hope of deep interest to you in your lives as you prepare for the future.<br><h2><b>Now Is the Time</b></h2><br>Let me begin by reminding you that being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a very special privilege. Understanding the basic principles of the plan of salvation and the principles of life that we are to live by here upon the earth is a great blessing. Some of you may need to study the doctrines more diligently so you will know the full significance of the covenants and ordinances of the gospel plan and how it provides for us. Brothers and sisters, it's wonderful to know of God's plan to exalt his children. In mortality, separated from our Heavenly Father, we all walk by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We must know his teachings and keep his commandments.<br><br>The missionary Amulek had some marvelous instructions on this subject. I read from the writings of Amulek as recorded in chapter 34 of Alma.<br><br><i>Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.</i><br><br><i>For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</i><br><br><i>And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</i><br><br><i>Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.</i><br><br>Amulek continues,<br><br><i>For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected</i>to<i>the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</i><br><br><i>And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.</i>[Alma 34:31–36].<br><br>Brothers and sisters, today, tomorrow, next week is the time for our preparation. In fact, it's a lifelong effort; it does not stop until we are safely dead with our testimony still burning very brightly. We ought to reverence life and cherish every minute of it. It should be so precious to us that we feel compelled to commit ourselves to making each day the very best day that we can, preparing ourselves someday to meet our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Not one of us here tonight knows how long he will be here upon the earth. Therefore, a wise man or a wise woman will constantly evaluate his or her life in light of the teachings of the gospel. We need to look deep into our own hearts and compare what we see in our lives today against what we have been taught about the glorious plan of salvation. Many may find that their lives are out of synchronization with the plan of salvation. If we see something in our lives that is not what it ought to be, then we must have the courage to repent and make the necessary changes immediately.<br><br>Tonight, my beloved young people, will you think about your own life? Think about how you're doing right now in keeping the commandments of God. Do you see something in your life that is less than what you want it to be? Are you struggling with some habit or behavior that is not in harmony with the plan of salvation? Our Heavenly Father has such great confidence and trust in us that he has given us the freedom to make our own choices in life. Please listen to your conscience; it will help you make proper decisions if you will learn to follow its promptings.<br><br>Looking inward into one's own life takes a lot of courage. I know this because I have to look into my own. And sometimes we may see things in our lives that must be changed if we are going to enjoy the blessings of the gospel and prepare ourselves for eternal life.<br><br>If you know of things in your life that you do not like, ask your Heavenly Father for help and you will find the inner strength to change. Do not deceive yourselves, my beloved young people, and never suppose that you can deceive the Holy Ghost. We can deceive ourselves and others, but we cannot deceive the Holy Ghost. He is our spiritual teacher and knows our thoughts and the intents of our hearts.<br><br>Please do not attempt to accommodate your habits or behavior by making your own plan or by modifying or adjusting or tampering with God's plan. Sometimes we find young people who think that the gospel is too narrow. They think that the plan of salvation is too restrictive and come to believe that God will "understand" if they elect to "do their own thing." Please do not be lulled into that kind of thinking; rather, exercise faith and develop the courage to look inward, comparing your life to our Heavenly Father's plan. The world is full of many voices saying that God's plan of morality, honesty, and integrity is old-fashioned and no longer required. You must never believe anything like this, but rather you need to know the doctrine and live by the teachings of the gospel.<br><br>The prophet Alma said:<br><br><i>And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;</i><br><br><i>But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;</i><br><br><i>Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.</i><br><br><i>And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.</i>[Alma 13:27–30]<br><br>Tonight, brothers and sisters, find the courage to repent if necessary. By so doing you will cleanse your life and you will demonstrate unto your Father in Heaven your love for him.<br><br>Many people find that making commitments is difficult. However, in my opinion, you will find that you can make some commitments tonight just as easily as at any other time in your life. In fact, it might be easier tonight, as you look into your life, to make those commitments you need to make to improve your life. Righteous commitments that improve your life now will bring blessings both here in mortality and in the eternities to come.<br><h2><b>Find Your Eternal Companion</b></h2><br>There shouldn't be a more righteous group of young students anywhere in the world than you who are beginning a new year here at BYU. The standards are high at this university, and they should be, for this is the university sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ. University training is preparation for life. The opportunities to meet fine friends of similar beliefs and standards are excellent here on this campus.<br><br>Now, may I speak about a principle of the plan that needs more of your careful attention. The principle is temple marriage. I worry about you handsome returned missionaries. (I emphasize<i>returned</i>) who maybe postponing or delaying marriage. Brethren, I do not believe you're thinking straight about this part of the plan that is required if you are to inherit the highest degree of the celestial kingdom.<br><br>President Joseph F. Smith said,<br><br><i>I want the young men of Zion to realize that this institution of marriage is not a man-made institution. It is of God. It is honorable, and no man who is of marriageable age is living his religion who remains single.</i>[<i>GD,</i>p. 272]<br><br>It is abundantly clear that young men can understand the gospel plan and know that the celestial kingdom will be a wonderful place to live; but to get there, a man must enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.<br><br>Now, brothers and sisters, don't be afraid of the future. I hear some young people say, "With the economic situation the way it is in the world and with the uncertainties in the world, I just feel I must be financially secure before I can enter into a marriage relationship." Let me tell you something about that. The reality is this: you must not look at marriage from a financial point of view, but rather from the eternal point of view. Far too many young men and women in the Church are allowing the economics of marriage to influence the decision of whether or not to get married. Please keep the financial concern in its proper perspective and do not allow it to be the factor determining when you marry. Look at your eternal destiny in light of the glorious plan of salvation that God has given to you. With this in mind, look for and find that companion who will assist you and strengthen you and be a helpmate to you. Some of you are not working on this as you should. Find your eternal companion, then get married and begin the most fulfilling time of your life.<br><br>I think back to 1951 when Sister Ballard came into my life. When I saw her, I fell in love. I have to admit that<i>I worked very hard to get her to understand that I was the only true returned missionary.</i>Brethren, sometimes you have to put forth that kind of effort! I have often told our children that the best sales accomplishment of my life was getting their mother to agree to marry me. In my case, I had to work hard to win the heart of my precious companion. Some of you may need to do the same.<br><br>We were married in the Salt Lake Temple. I had a part-time job and was attending the university (I won't name which one). She also had a job. Together we were very careful. We saved what we could. We had a hard time and we had some desperate moments. But as we look back on our thirty-six years together, some of the most beautiful times of our lives were during those early days of our marriage when we were your age. Sister Ballard was nineteen and I was twenty-two. Do not miss living through the difficult times with your companion. I believe in many ways Barbara and I became more dependent upon each other and more dependent upon the Lord in those early days of our marriage than perhaps at any other time.<br><br>Some are concerned about supporting children. I tell you tonight: do not worry about it. If Barbara and I had sat down and figured out what children would cost and whether we could afford them, we never would have had any. Yet we are now the parents of seven children and grandparents of twenty-two grandchildren--and within a matter of weeks, twenty-three. Of all our life's accomplishments, our children and our grandchildren are the most precious. We could not afford any of our children, but they are here and doing well. We have given them much love and they have given us much love in return. Today when we gather together as a family, it is glorious to us. We made it work and so can you.<br><br>President Benson said recently,<br><br><i>Young mothers and fathers, with all my heart I counsel you not to postpone having your children, being co-creators with our Father in Heaven.</i><br><br><i>Do not use the reasoning of the world such as "We'll wait until we can better afford having children, until we are more secure, until John has completed his education, until he has a better-paying job, until we have a larger home, until we have obtained a few of the material conveniences," and on and on. This is the reasoning of the world and it is not pleasing in the sight of God.</i>[Address given at a fireside for parents by President Ezra Taft Benson, 22 February 1987]<br><br>In section 131 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i><br><br><i>He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–4]<br><br>Brethren, don't tamper with this truth. Keep thinking straight about fulfilling this most exhilarating, exciting opportunity you will ever have in mortality.<br><br>To me, there is no more important thing for you to do than to find your companion, drawing him or her close to you, and together building an eternal family. The words of our beloved hymn, "Oh My Father," are true:<br><br><i>In the heav'ns are parents single?</i><br><i>No, the thought makes reason stare!</i><br><i>Truth is reason; truth eternal</i><br><i>Tells me I've a mother there.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 292]<br><br>May I say a word to you sisters? Please continue to be sweet, clean, pure, and prepared. Live each day with an eternal perspective in mind. I'm aware that there are some here tonight who may never have the opportunity of marriage here in mortality. President Spencer W. Kimball had this to say on the subject:<br><br><i>Marriage is honorable. It's a plan of God. It is not a whim, a choice, a preference only; it's a must.</i><br><br><i>We are talking to normal young people. Generally there are husbands for most young women. There might be an occasional young woman who does not find her companion, but there is little excuse for the normal young man. I tell young women who seem to have missed their chance for desirable marriage that they should do all in their power to make themselves attractive physically in dress and grooming, mentally in being knowledgeable on many subjects, spiritually in being responsive, emotionally in being genuine and worthy. And if one fails to find a companion after having done everything possible, then there will be provision for her in eternity.</i>["Marriage Is Honorable,"<i>Speeches of the Year, 1973</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1974), pp. 261-62]<br><br>President Kimball also said:<br><br><i>Women of the church who do not in this life have the privileges and blessings of a temple marriage, through no fault of their own, who would have responded if they had an appropriate opportunity--will receive all those blessings in the world to come.</i>[<i>TSWK,</i>p. 295]<br><br>The key, then, for all of us is to live worthily by keeping the commandments.<br><h2><b>Repentance</b></h2><br>Just three weeks ago, a friend of mine who is now serving as a bishop here at BYU came to my office. The purpose of his visit was to seek some counsel from me on how to deal with the moral transgressions his ward members were confessing to him. The bishop shared the fact that in the five months he'd been bishop, seventeen students had confessed moral transgressions. He was concerned that more women were involved than men.<br><br>This report concerned me, so I looked into the matter further and learned that some students have unconfessed transgressions before arriving here and others transgress during their enrollment, but they deliberately wait until they are about to graduate or get married before they clear up their problem with their priesthood leaders. Some have indicated they were afraid to confess earlier because they might face Church discipline that could affect their right to continue as students. I doubt that repentance deferred for that kind of perceived advantage will ever bring the same cleansing power and peace that a more timely confession would produce.<br><br>I now understand more and more why Jesus taught repeatedly that we are to declare nothing unto this generation except repentance. I used to think that was a little narrow. Now I am beginning to see the power in it. As men and women understand the principle of repentance and as they apply the principle to their daily lives, repentance is the process of cleansing, purifying, and sanctifying themselves to prepare them to become Saints. Thus we can all become sanctified, cleansed, and purified through the blood of the Lamb.<br><br>My plea to you students is to keep the commandments beginning<i>right now.</i>If you have a problem that needs to be confessed to your bishop, then I urge you to see him this week. Don't wait, for he will help you repent and start the cleansing process that you need in your life to remain on the path ultimately leading you to the celestial kingdom. Be grateful, brothers and sisters, that the plan provides for repentance and<i>be wise enough to use it</i>when you need to in your lives.<br><h2><b>The Plan of Salvation</b></h2><br>Some sisters say they are confused because the Church teaches them to prepare to be a wife and a mother but also to prepare to be self-sufficient. Some say a career is so important they will not allow marriage to interfere. As in all aspects of life, we must each find a proper balance and then wisely maintain it. I was interested in a recent article I read. It reported that many women who are very successful in their chosen careers oftentimes feel unfulfilled and desire more than anything else in life to become mothers. This desire is easy for us in the Church to understand because motherhood is a divinely proclaimed blessing. Sisters, there is a need for you to continue preparing yourselves for a happy and fulfilling life, and you can do this best by living true to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>I would rather be a woman not entering into marriage in mortality than a man. I would not want to stand before the Lord as a healthy, normal man and try to explain why I never married. Please understand that temple marriage is absolutely vital in our quest to inherit the highest degree of the celestial kingdom.<br><br>Now we may ask, Why do the prophets teach that today is the day of our salvation? Why do they teach us not to procrastinate our repentance or our other important decisions in life? My grandfather, Elder Melvin J. Ballard, said:<br><br><i>It is my judgment that any man or woman can do more to conform to the laws of God in one year in this life than they could in ten years when they are dead. The spirit only can repent and change, and then the battle has to go forward with the flesh afterwards. It is much easier to overcome and serve the Lord when both flesh and spirit are combined as one. This is the time when men are more pliable and susceptible.</i>[We will find when we are dead every desire, every feeling will be greatly intensified.]<i>When clay is pliable it is much easier to change than when it gets hard and sets.</i><br><br><i>This life is the time to repent. That is why I</i><i>presume it will take a thousand years.</i>. .<i>to do what it would have taken but three score years and ten to accomplish in this life.</i><br><br>Grandfather continues:<br><br><i>The point I have in mind is that we are sentencing ourselves to long periods of bondage, separating our spirits from our bodies, or we are shortening that period, according to the way in which we overcome and master ourselves.</i>[<i>Melvin J. Ballard--Crusader for Righteousness</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), pp. 212–13]<br><br>Let us remember, brothers and sisters, we knew before we were ever born that except we receive a body of flesh and bone and experience mortality we can never become like our Father in Heaven. He has a body of flesh and bones that has been glorified and exalted. He is our father; we seek to be like him. He has told us we can be like him. He has given us the plan, the central figure of which is his only begotten son, even Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Savior is the key to making the plan work in our lives. The more the mysteries of the kingdom of God unfold to us and the more we understand God's plan for us, the more adoration, affection, love, and commitment will fill our hearts for his beloved son Jesus Christ.<br><br>I pray that our Heavenly Father will bless every one of us with an increase of love for the Lord and a keen desire to serve him, to keep his commandments, and to live true to the plan of redemption and exaltation that is ours.<br><br>In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead.</i><br><br><i>And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.</i><br><br><i>And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul.</i><br><br><i>And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory;</i><br><br><i>For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father;</i><br><br><i>That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent are they sanctified.</i><br><br><i>And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.</i><br><br><i>For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:14–22]<br><br>So it is quite simple--if we want a celestial glory in the eternities, then we must live by the celestial law now. The plan of salvation is the glorious process by which men and women walk through mortality with the light of the gospel giving correct spiritual direction. Jesus has shown us the way to live here upon the earth.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we can inherit a celestial glory, we can dwell where God and Christ dwell and live with them forever and ever. All of these promises, however, are predicated upon our willingness to love God with all our hearts, to keep his commandments, to repent of our sins, and to love and serve our neighbors and our fellowmen. The first principles and ordinances of the gospel are clear and simple to follow. Through our obedience and willingness to keep the commandments and to serve, love, and honor the Lord, we can purify our lives.<br><h2><b>May God Bless You</b></h2><br>God bless you to love this church and all that it teaches you. You will never possess anything in life remotely as precious as your understanding of the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ and the plan of salvation God has for his children. Love the Lord and follow his plan, including getting married and having a family.<br><br>We are grateful that you students are enrolled here at BYU. We want you to enjoy your time here. We hope you will study hard and learn as much as you can about your chosen field of education. We pray that in all of your learning, you will learn for yourselves that you have a glorious eternal potential. You must study hard and pray continuously to know the fullness of our Father's plan. When you and I understand this eternal truth of the gospel and bind ourselves to keeping all of the commandments, we will find joy and happiness in this life beyond comprehension. The more you love and serve the Lord--you missionaries here tonight will soon learn this as you embark on your labors in your missions--the more you will prepare yourselves to dwell in his sacred presence.<br><br>You are wonderful young people. There are none better--we know that. General Authorities of the Church often talk about you, this great generation of young people. We love you, we have confidence in you. We want you to be the very best you can be. If there is something holding you back from being your very best, I'm here tonight to say that with this new school year, what better time is there to clear up any problem you might have? Then you can get on with the positive things in your life.<br><br>We hope you will take every advantage while on this campus to prepare yourselves intellectually, emotionally, physically, and spiritually for the challenges that lie ahead. You are in training here at BYU. Your spiritual preparation and training are an essential part of your education to prepare yourselves to lead your own families as well as to assume other leadership responsibilities that will surely be given to you in the Church.<br><br>I testify to you that what I have been talking about here tonight is true. I know that Jesus is the Christ. Brothers and sisters, you simply cannot do the work that members of the Council of the Twelve and other General Authorities are called upon to do if you do not know that Christ lives. He is very close to this work, and I love him. No greater honor could ever come to a man than to be asked to bear witness of our Savior's name throughout all the nations of the earth. I do that with great humility and gratitude. I witness to you tonight that he is the Son of God. This is his church. The plan of salvation that we have been talking about is from our Father in Heaven and our Lord Jesus Christ. The commandments are for our good, and if we will repent when we need to and then live true to every commandment, we will surely rejoice when the day comes for each one of us to pass by the angels into the sacred presence of our Heavenly Father and his beloved son Jesus Christ.<br><br>God bless you. May he bless you to always think clearly about your life, that you may progressively learn to live in complete harmony with the teachings of the gospel. May the Lord bless you with peace and happiness while here at BYU. Live the standards here. Don't fight them, brothers and sisters, live them. Keep the commandments of God and you will gain a positive assurance that the gospel of Jesus Christ is God's plan of happiness for his children here upon the earth. This I know to be true. Because of my great affection and love for you, the youth of the Church, and the great affection I have for the missionaries of the Church throughout the world--some thirty-three thousand now--my prayer is that you'll catch the vision, that you will see the big picture, now. Don't wait--get it now and understand that each of you has glorious eternal potential. Do those things that you need to do in your own life. Correct those things that need to be corrected. Be a better you as we start a new year here at this great university.<br><br>I invoke a blessing upon you now. Humbly, I plead with the Lord to, bless you, my beloved young people, the youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--the cream of the crop of all of the youth of the world, as far as I'm concerned. May he bless you to cherish the plan of salvation--to know it, to study it, to strive with all the power within you to live true to it, that you might make the contribution to this world and particularly to this church that is uniquely yours to make. You can do this through your faithfulness, through your attention to spiritual things, and through your willingness to strive with all the power that you have to love and serve your Father in Heaven and his beloved son Jesus Christ. May this be your blessing, may this be a blessing to your leaders and to me, that we all might go forward together in accomplishing the glorious purposes of God. This is my humble prayer, my testimony, and my blessing upon you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>ear Not - Patricia T. Holland - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
If my fourteen-year-old son's vocabulary is any indication, it is in vogue to be "weird" or feel "weird" or act "weird." I'd like to begin this morning telling you of a truly "weird" experience I had last year.<br><h2><b>A "Weird" Dream</b></h2><br>Some of you will remember that last November we had a concert on campus featuring Billy Joel. Now President Holland and I aren't quite up to the Billy Joel kind of performance (we are more into the St. George Senior Citizens Chorus), so we didn't attend. But the night after the Billy Joel concert, I had a very unusual dream--a "weird" dream, I think it is safe to say.<br><br>I dreamed that Billy and I were driving down the highway talking about his experience at BYU. I was driving the car and completely in control, but suddenly I became terrified of something that was ahead. So, instead of continuing on our journey, I veered off the road and sent the car careening over the edge of a steep cliff. Instead of the crash landing expected, we were somehow plucked out of the car and perched safely on a ledge hidden from view. We sat comfortably, watching huge crowds of people milling down below. They were coming and going and looking around but never discovering the occupants of the battered car.<br><br>When I awoke the next morning, I was incredulous! What on earth--I said to myself--would a forty-five-year-old mother hen to thousands of BYU students have in common with Billy Joel? Now, at this point, I suppose I do have to confess to you that one of my lifelong secret desires has been to play the drums in a rock band, but that didn't seem to be adequate motivation for a 3-D, Cinerama, Dolby sound, full-length "weird" dream.<br><br>I pondered a long time about that dream--and whether it is the right interpretation or not, I finally decided that I had associated Billy Joel's concert performance for you with my own frequent assignments to speak to the same kind of crowd in this<i>same</i>monstrous hall and with every one of those<i>same</i>eyes upon me. I surmised that neither of us needed to put up with such performance fears any longer, so I just detoured us over the cliff. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask Billy if he wanted to accompany me. But that's the price he had to pay for riding with me. Next time he may want to take Greyhound.<br><br>Nonsense and rock concerts aside, I think I really did identify with the public performance of such a concert and subconsciously preferred to hide in safety, far from the gaze of the crowd. Anonymity has always seemed pretty appealing to me, yet here I am--and there you are--and the show must go on, again!<br><br>I tell that ridiculous, but true, story for a purpose this morning. I have wondered and worried and prayed about what to say to you. And I have felt that perhaps some of you, who may feel a bit shy and more than a little overwhelmed at a place like BYU, need to know that the rest of us are pretty shy, too, and that lots of people--maybe most people--have fears about new experiences with people we don't know. As long as I'm already on the analyst's couch with my dream, I will go on to confess that I have always had my fair share of fears, too, and maybe you have as well. Life has lots of challenges, and some of them can be fearful.<br><h2><b>The Real Problem</b></h2><br>I remember the fear I had coming here as a new student. I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to pass my exams or even find the classrooms. I was afraid I wouldn't get along with my new roommate. I worried that my money would not last, and I was certain that I would never get asked for a date. On occasion, I still awaken in the night in a cold sweat, having dreamed I had gone a whole semester without attending a class I'd registered for and that my transcript had incompletes and UWs stamped across the front of it. I have, in the course of my forty-plus years, managed to worry about almost everything.<br><br>That's the bad news. The good news is that almost none of the things I have worried about or been afraid of have ever happened. I suppose that is why Elder Packer said recently, "You can't tell me worrying doesn't help because the things I worry about never happen."<br><br>So I have come to realize, as perhaps you need to, that our real problem is not so much fear of things or people or places but rather fear itself. I've learned, as many of you have, that such anxiety is one of Satan's greatest tools, and it needs to be opposed.<br><h2><b>Replace Fear With Faith</b></h2><br>In a motherly sort of way, I plead with each one of you to understand that<i>your opportunity to learn</i>can greatly magnify your faith--faith in yourself, faith in your future, faith in a God who is your father and who loves you. Please understand this right now--God is<i>not</i>a vengeful, punitive god who is somehow looking for new ways to torment, embarrass, and punish you. For too much of my young life that is the way I saw him, and I often obeyed him out of guilt and anxiety rather than faith and genuine desire. But you--<i>you</i>are here at<i>the</i>university that teaches of a living God, of which Elder George Q. Morris, a former member of the Council of the Twelve, once said, "It is called the Brigham Young University, but<i>it is the University of the Kingdom of God"</i>(Ernest L. Wilkinson, ed.,<i>Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years</i>[Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1975] 4:391; emphasis added). Please understand, you have come to a place designed by God, governed by apostles, and presided over by a prophet to help you discover your divine potential. I promise you that if you will treat it seriously and sacredly, faith will begin to replace fear, and<i>you</i>will stand confident before God<i>and man.</i><br><br>Brother Dennis Rasmussen of our philosophy department has written:<br><br><i>To be a child of God is to share his divine nature. But that nature is still potential in man, and the purpose of life (and I might add learning) is to make it</i>actual<i>... Man has invented many names for himself; most of them are wrong. But man wears them like labels and often comes to believe them. Who has not worn with shame and mute belief the name of Stupid or Awkward or Nobody or even Wicked? But God calls to man with a new name that only God can speak. He addresses his children born in</i>his<i>image and asks, "Can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances?" (Alma 5:19.)</i>[Dennis Rasmussen,<i>The Lord's Question: Thoughts on the Life of Response</i>(Provo, Utah: Keter Foundation, 1985), pp. 7–8; emphasis added]<br><br>We owe it to that divine potential in us to look up to God<i>without</i>fear. Some of you wonder whether God even knows you exist, or if he does know, does he care that you exist? He declares in reply that he knows every one of you and loves you dearly and can call<i>each</i>of you by<i>name.</i>He has promised that<i>the very hairs of your head are all numbered to him.</i>"The very hairs of your head"--that proclaims a<i>lot</i>of fatherly interest. He has also declared that not even one sparrow will fall to the ground unnoticed. "Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than ... sparrows" (Matthew 10:30–31).<br><br>Did you notice the way the Lord begins that scripture? "Fear ye not." Have you noticed how often the Lord prefaces so many things that he has to say with the words<i>fear not?</i>He knows that all people struggle with fears and anxieties and problems. He wants so much for us to know that. If we will but come to him, he will comfort and reassure us. And he will carry us in his arms until we are able to walk by ourselves.<br><br><i>For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</i><br><br><i>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</i>[Isaiah 41:13, 10]<br><h2><b>"I Will Not Forget Thee"</b></h2><br>As a new school year begins, I know that some of the pressures of study, finances, employment,<i>and dating</i>weigh heavily upon you. Take your fears to the Lord. Talk to him and listen to him. Then, if you feel a spiritual motion as tiny as the touch that a butterfly's wing might make, acknowledge it, heed it, and let his influence work upon you. The Lord wants you to succeed even more than you want to yourself. Have faith in a perfect Father's love, fearing nothing. Remember that love is promised not just to those who have never made a mistake, but that love is promised to every one of us--who have all made mistakes.<br><br>I think I have a glimpse of that kind of love because of my own experience of giving birth to three beautiful children. I have discovered that the child who is at the moment content and happy often has little need of me. That gladsome child usually runs away to play. But the child who has made a mistake, has faltered, or is wounded or frightened turns quickly to come back home for reassurance. As that child draws near unto me, nothing--I repeat, nothing--can stop the opening of my heart or the reaching out of my arms to enfold him or her into my protection.<br><br>Is anything more powerful than a mother's love? The scriptures say<i>one thing</i>is more powerful.<br><br><i>But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me</i>--but he will show that he hath not.<br><br><i>For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget</i>[As unwilling as I am to believe it, Pat Holland may forget her children. Yea, earthly mothers may forget],<i>yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.</i><br><br><i>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.</i>[1 Nephi 21:14–16; emphasis added]<br><br>Christ's compassionate atonement is more powerful than even a mother's love. He has engraven us upon the palms of his hands, and those marks make certain that he will never forget us. I bear my witness that he will never forget us. I promise that we will not forget you either. We love you and pray for your success. "Fear not," in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Patricia T. Holland, wife of Jeffrey R. Holland, gave this devotional address at Brigham Young University on 15 September 1987.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>d Liberty - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>A Memorable Event</b></h2><br>At two o'clock this afternoon, throughout all of the United States, bells of all shapes, sizes, and sounds will ring. Two hundred years ago today, at approximately two o'clock our time, delegates to the Grand Convention in Philadelphia started queuing up to sign their proposed constitution of the United States. It would still require nine months before it could really be called a constitution. This happened on 21 June 1788, when New Hampshire, the ninth state, ratified it.<br><br>During that hot and humid summer of 1787, the delegates labored nearly four months in a stuffy building with windows closed most of the time to prevent their words from being heard by the outside world during their deliberations. You from the East Coast know what it is like even with air-conditioning. I can't imagine what it would be like with windows closed in a small, stuffy room. Tempers would flare, some delegates would go home early--compromise and crisis would take place. Yet on 17 September 1787 they signed the document that is now the oldest written constitution of its kind in the world. It has served nearly 457 million Americans to date--247 million of whom are alive today.<br><br>How was it possible that these delegates, living in an eighteenth-century rural society, could write a constitution that would effectively serve 247 million people living in the twentieth-century space age? What did they know that writers of hundreds of other constitutions since have not known? Was there something unique about its creation or the men who wrote it? Many of the delegates realized the importance of what they were doing. Benjamin Franklin had said that if the convention failed, "mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance, war and conquest" (Catherine Drinker Bowen,<i>Miracle at Philadelphia</i>[Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1966], p. 126). Possibly this is the reason, in spite of ill health and personal suffering, that he attended the convention.<br><br>Another delegate, Rufus King, said that his fears were more agitated for his country than he could express, that he conceived this to be the last opportunity of providing for liberty and happiness for the people. Madison had also said at the beginning of the convention that the delegates "were now digesting a plan which in its operation would decide forever the fate of Republican Government" (26 June 1787,<i>Records of the Federal Convention,</i>vol. 1 [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1911], 423).<br><br>Hamilton had written in the<i>Federalist Papers:</i><br><br><i>It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.</i>[<i>The Federalist,</i>No. 1]<br><br>Certainly, their recent experience with the British and with the Articles of Confederation would have led to this concern, but it still doesn't answer the question of how they were able to write our Constitution. I believe our beloved prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, put his finger on the answer when he said:<br><br><i>It would be erroneous for us, however, to conclude that the document was the sole genius of the Founding Fathers. Theirs was a combined wisdom derived from heavenly inspiration, knowledge of political government from ages past, and the crucible of their own experience.</i>[<i>The Constitution: A Heavenly Banner</i>(Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1986), p. 1]<br><h2><b>The Assembly</b></h2><br>For our purpose today, let's start by looking at some of the delegates. Who were they? What was their background, experience, knowledge? Thomas Jefferson had said of the Convention, after he heard who the delegates were, that it was "an assembly of demigods" (Jefferson to John Adams, 30 August 1787, in<i>The Adams-Jefferson Letters,</i>vol. 2, ed. Lester J. Cappon [Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 1959], 196).<br><br>John Adams said:<br><br><i>The deliberate union of so great and various a people in such a place is, without all partiality or prejudice, if not the greatest exertion of human understanding, the greatest single effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen.</i>[John Adams, 26 December 1787, quoted in Clinton Rossiter, ed.,<i>1787: The Grand Convention</i>(New York: Macmillan, 1966), p. 11]<br><br>And Albert J. Beveridge, quoted by Everett Wilson in his book about the Constitution, stated:<br><br><i>The American system was devised by the ablest group of men who ever appeared at the same time in the same country throughout the history of the world. Just as former times produced masterpieces of literature, philosophy, and art, just as our own period is producing masterpieces in science and commercial organization, so the architects of the American plan of self-disciplined liberty produced a masterpiece of free government.</i>[Quoted by Everett P. Wilson,<i>The Constitution of the United States of America, a Bulwark of Liberty</i>(Chadron, Nebraska: Caxton Printers, 1955), pp. 59–60]<br><br>The U.S. Constitution Sesquicentennial Commission asked the question:<br><br><i>Who were the fifty-five men who, in varying degrees, were the framers of our National Constitution? The knowledge concerning some of them is indefinite, but the following facts are substantially correct.</i><br><br><i>All of them except eight were natives of the colonies. Franklin, the oldest, was 81; Dayton, the youngest, was 26; fourteen were 50 or over; twenty-one were less than 40. Twenty-five were college men. . . .</i><br><br><i>These men were almost without exception acquainted with public affairs: forty-six had been members of one or both of the houses of the colonial or state legislatures; ten attended state constitutional conventions; sixteen had been or were to be governors or presidents of states. In national affairs forty-two were delegates to the Continental Congress, eight were signers of the Declaration of Independence, six signers of the draft of the Articles of Confederation, seven had attended the Annapolis Convention, and three had been executive officers under the Congress. . . . Two future Presidents of the United States took a prominent part in the proceedings of the convention and one future Vice President. Two others were to be candidates for the highest office in the land and these and one other, candidates for the Vice Presidency. The positions which these men had occupied or were later to fill are indicative of the regard in which they were held by their fellow citizens, and of their character and worth.</i><br><br><i>The most important man in the convention was George Washington; indeed, his acceptance of the deputyship, made reluctantly and after long consideration, was the initial triumph of the movement and a foreshadowing of success, so great was his prestige. Madison and Randolph, his fellow deputies from Virginia, were very active in the work of the convention. . . . Madison's great knowledge of political science, the fact that to him more than to any other deputy public life was a profession, and his grasp of the essential problems before the convention and the means by which they could be solved, enabled him to become the principal architect of the Constitution.</i><br><br><i>Franklin was the seer of the convention. His great age and infirmities forbade very active participation, and he was probably responsible for little of the detailed results; but his very presence gave the gathering importance and dignity and his advice must have been eagerly sought and carefully considered. He and Washington were the two great harmonizers. Washington presided over the formal sessions, taking little part in the debate, but in committee of the whole and in the private conferences which were such an important underpinning of the formal structure as it arose, he was in constant consultation with his colleagues. Also, as the character of the plan developed, there was a general recognition of the fact that he must be a leading man in the early operation of the new government, and this of necessity influenced its shape.</i>[<i>History of the Formation of the Union Under the Constitution,</i>Sol Bloom, U.S. Constitution Sesquincentennial Commission (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1941), pp. 16–17]<br><br>Years after the convention, James Madison had written:<br><br><i>I feel it a duty to express my profound and solemn conviction, derived from my intimate opportunity of observing and appreciating the views of the Convention, collectively and individually, that there never was an assembly of men, charged with a great and arduous trust, who were more pure in their motives, or more exclusively or anxiously devoted to the object committed to them, than were the members of the Federal Convention of 1787.</i>[<i>Debates on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution,</i>arr. Jonathan Elliot, vol. 5 (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co., 1901), p. 122]<br><br>They were extremely knowledgeable of government and had gained considerable experience as a result of serving in their various states. Some twenty-three of the signers had served in the War for Independence and were intimately familiar with deprivation and suffering caused by a weak central government and the lack of a strong union. George Washington had served eight years as their commander and understood, better than most, this need. Even those who hadn't felt the direct effects of a weak and inefficient government at Valley Forge, Morristown, New York, and other battle sites had witnessed the deteriorating state of their republic after the war: commerce problems, rebellion, inflation caused by the printing of money. This was enough to convince even the most ardent supporters of the Articles of Confederation that something had to be done to render the Articles effective to the needs of the day.<br><br>Their individual and collective experience gained from the war and their involvement in state and national government would help. Some had helped write their state constitutions; but they needed more--an understanding of what had been tried in the past and what other ideas and opinions and options were available to them. Most of the delegates were ardent students of government and had read extensively on the subject. In fact, during the previous two decades, America had been awash with political tracts and writings on government and liberty. It was of deep interest to me to find their major source of ideas for the Constitution:<br><br><i>Two professors, Donald S. Lutz and Charles S. Hyneman, have reviewed an estimated 15,000 items, and closely read 2,200 books, pamphlets, newspaper articles, and monographs with explicitly political content printed between 1760 and 1805. . . .</i><br><br><i>From these items,</i>[they]<i>identified 3,154 references to other sources. The source most often cited by the founding fathers was the Bible, which accounted for 34 percent of all citations. The fifth book of the Bible, Deuteronomy, because of its heavy emphasis on biblical law, was referred to frequently. The most cited thinkers were not deists and philosophers, but conservative legal and political thinkers who often were also Christians.</i>[John Eidsmoe<i>, Christianity and the Constitution</i>(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1987), pp. 51–52]<br><h2><b>The Hand of Providence</b></h2><br>Now we have so far reviewed two elements mentioned by President Benson--experience and knowledge. What about heavenly inspiration? Did any of the delegates attribute the writing of the Constitution to inspiration?<br><br>The challenge before the delegates at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 was how to protect the individual's basic rights and, at the same time, provide for a union. Before the convention started, George Washington, who was elected president of the convention, said:<br><br><i>It is probable that no plan we propose will be adopted. Perhaps another dreadful conflict is to be sustained. If to please the people we offer what we ourselves disapprove, how can we afterwards defend our work? Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair. The event is in the hand of God.</i>[Frank Donovan,<i>Mr. Madison's Constitution</i>(New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., 1965), p. 39]<br><br>A year later, the day after Massachusetts ratified the Constitution, Washington wrote to another friend, Lafayette, of the miraculous nature of their efforts:<br><br><i>It appears to me, then, little short of a miracle, that the Delegates from so many different States (which States you know are also different from each other in their manners, circumstances and prejudices) should unite in forming a system of national government.</i>[Letter of 7 February 1788, in John C. Fitzpatrick, ed.,<i>Writings of George Washington (1788),</i>vol. 29 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1931–1944), p. 409]<br><br>As president of the convention, George Washington also said:<br><br><i>The hand of Providence has been conspicuous in all this, that he must be worse than an infidel that lacks faith, and more than wicked that has not gratitude enough to acknowledge his obligations.</i>[Washington to Brigadier-General Nelson, 20 August 1778; quoted by William J. Johnson,<i>George Washington the Christian</i>(Milford, Michigan: Mott Media, 1919, 1976), pp. 119–20]<br><br>Many of the other delegates also recognized divine inspiration in their work. Writing in<i>The Federalist</i>(No. 37), James Madison, often referred to as the Father of the Constitution, wrote:<br><br><i>It is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution.</i><br><br>Alexander Hamilton, famous as the originator of<i>The Federalist</i>and author of 51 of the papers, said:<br><br><i>For my own part, I sincerely esteem it a system, which, without the finger of God, never could have been suggested and agreed upon by such a diversity of interests.</i>[Paul Leicester Ford, ed.,<i>Essays on the Constitution of the United States</i>(Brooklyn, New York: Historical Printing Club, 1892), p. 288]<br><br>In a letter to the editor of the<i>Federal Gazette</i>in 1755, Benjamin Franklin said:<br><br><i>I have so much Faith in the general Government of the world by</i>Providence<i>, that I can hardly conceive a Transaction of such momentous Importance to the Welfare of Millions now existing, and to exist in the Posterity of a great Nation, should be suffered to pass without being in some degree influenc'd, guided, and governed by that omnipotent, omnipresent, and beneficent Ruler, in whom all inferior spirits live, and move, and have their Being.</i>[Albert H. Smyth, ed.,<i>The Writings of Benjamin Franklin,</i>vol. 9 (New York: Haskell House Publishers, 1970), p. 702]<br><br>Such comments were not limited to delegates themselves, but came from others who had studied the events concerned as well. Daniel Webster, a noted defender of the Constitution, although not a delegate, said in 1847:<br><br><i>I regard it (the Constitution) as the work of the purest patriots and the wisest statesmen that ever existed, aided by the smiles of a benignant Providence; . . . it almost appears a Divine interposition in our behalf . .</i>. . [T]<i>he hand that destroys the Constitution rends our Union asunder for ever.</i>[<i>The Works of Daniel Webster,</i>vol. 1 (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1851), p. 404]<br><br>And we can look today for great students of the Constitution, one being my fellow apostle, Elder Dallin H. Oaks. He recently spoke here in Provo, while most of you students were away during the summer, and cited five inspired fundamentals of that document:<br><br><i>1. The separation of powers in the three branches of govt;</i><br><br><i>2. The division of powers between the states and federal government;</i><br><br><i>3. The Bill of Rights;</i><br><br><i>4. The principle of popular sovereignty;</i><br><br><i>5. There is divine inspiration in the fundamental underlying premise of our whole constitutional order, the rule of law and not of men.</i><br><br><i>All the blessings we enjoy under the United States Constitution are dependent upon the rule of law. That is why President J. Reuben Clark said, "Our allegiance run[s] to the Constitution and to the principles which it embodies, and not to individuals." The rule of law is the basis of liberty.</i>[<i>The Divinely Inspired Constitution,</i>speech given 5 July 1987 at the Freedom Festival Religious Service, Provo, Utah, pp. 11–12]<br><br>Concerning the fourth of these great truly divine principles inspired by the fundamentals, that of the sovereignty of the people, Elder Oaks also said:<br><br><i>Perhaps the most important of the great fundamentals of our inspired Constitution is the principle of popular sovereignty: The people are the source of government power. Along with many religious people, Latter-day Saints affirm that God gave the power to the people, and the people consented to a constitution that delegated certain powers to the government. Sovereignty is not inherent in a state or nation just because it has the power that comes from force of arms. Sovereignty does not come from the divine right of a king, who grants his subjects such power as he pleases or is forced to concede, as in Magna Charta. The sovereign power is in the people. I believe this is one of the great meanings in the revelation which tells us that God established the Constitution of the United States.</i><br><br><i>"That every man may act . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.</i><br><br><i>"Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.</i><br><br><i>"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land." [D&amp;amp;C 101:78–80]</i><br><br><i>In other words, the most desirable condition for the effective exercise of God-given moral agency is a condition of maximum freedom and responsibility. In this condition men are accountable for their own sins and cannot blame their political conditions on their bondage to a king or a tyrant. This condition is achieved when the people are sovereign, as they are under the Constitution God established in our nation. From this it follows that the most important words in the United States Constitution are the words in the preamble: "We, the people of the United States . . . , do ordain and establish this Constitution."</i><br><br><i>President Ezra Taft Benson expressed the fundamental principle of popular sovereignty when he said, "We [the people] are superior to government and should remain master over it, not the other way around"</i>(The Constitution: A Heavenly Banner<i>[Salt Lake City, Utah; Deseret book, 1986],</i>p. 7).<i>The Book of Mormon explains that principle in these words:</i><br><br><i>"An unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness . . . .</i><br><br><i>"Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws. . . .</i><br><br><i>"Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law--to do your business by the voice of the people." [Mosiah 29:23–26]</i><br><br><i>Popular sovereignty necessarily implies popular</i>responsibility<i>. Instead of blaming their troubles on a king or other sovereign, all citizens must share the burdens and responsibilities of governing. As the Book of Mormon teaches, "the burden should come upon all the people, that every man might bear his part" (Mosiah 29:34).</i>[Oaks<i>, The Divinely Inspired Constitution,</i>pp. 9–10]<br><h2><b>Taking on the Responsibility</b></h2><br>As a nation, we've been showered with numerous blessings that have been a direct result of our Constitution. Unfortunately, many of us have forgotten that with the receipt of such blessings also comes responsibility. Probably our most important responsibility is to ensure the continuance of freedoms that we have received for our children and for our grandchildren. Patriotism is not a spectator sport. We must become involved in the process of freedom.<br><br><i>Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:10]<br><br>Further, we need to understand the great principles of the founding documents. How can we "befriend . . . that law which is the constitutional law of the land" if we are not familiar with it and its genesis? We need to drink deeply at the wellspring of this great document.<br><br>We must also recognize that, as President John Adams said, "We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions, unbridled by morality and religion." We are facing this situation to a degree in the world today. Therefore, we have the responsibility to remain unspotted from the world, to be upright and honest in all of our dealings, and to<i>set the example</i>for that which we have been given. Francis Grund wrote:<br><br><i>The American Constitution is remarkable for its simplicity; but it can only suffice a people habitually correct in their actions, and would be utterly inadequate to the wants of a different nation. Change the domestic habits of the Americans, their religious devotion, and their high respect for morality, and it will not be necessary to change a single letter of the Constitution in order to vary the whole form of their government.</i>[Francis J. Grund,<i>The Americans, in Their Moral. Social, and Political Relations</i>(Boston: Marsh, Capen and Lyon, 1837), p. 171]<br><br>As Latter-day Saints we should take to heart what the late President David O. McKay counseled: "Next to being one in worshiping God there is nothing in this world upon which this Church should be more united than in upholding . . . the Constitution of the United States" (<i>CR,</i>October 1939, p. 105).<br><br>We, as a people, have been the recipients of some of God's most choice blessings, and I believe they came only as a result of the dedication and sacrifice of our forefathers. We need, at this time and in this place, to follow the counsel of yet another great American, Abraham Lincoln, who said:<br><br><i>Let every American, every level of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity</i>[support the Constitution.]<i>Let . . . it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And in short, let it become the political religion of the nation;</i>[and in particular, establish a reverence for the Constitution.] [<i>Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln,</i>ed. John G. Nicolay and John Hay, vol. 1 (New York: Francis D. Tandy Co., 1905), p. 43]<br><br>I love this great land of the free. I always feel a great feeling of pride within my very soul whenever the flag passes by. I was taught this as a young child when Dad would always make us get out of the car when the American flag passed by in a parade. These feelings have only increased over the years as I stood as a young Boy Scout in early-morning flag-raising ceremonies and pledged allegiance to the flag each day throughout the years I attended school.<br><br>Yes, and there have been times on foreign soil when after a battle I stood and, in dirty dungarees and with a rifle in hand, saluted our flag as it was raised to the top of a handmade flagpole.<br><br><i>Oh, thus be it ever, when free men shall stand</i><br><i>Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!</i><br><i>Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land</i><br><i>Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserved us a nation!</i><br><br><i>Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,</i><br><i>And this be our motto: "In God is our Trust!"</i><br><i>And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave</i><br><i>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 340]<br><br>May God bless each of us with a desire to gain a real understanding of the blessings granted to us under this great Constitution of the United States of America. And may we have the strength and the courage to defend and uphold it for our generation and for all who follow after us. This is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>ncy and Freedom - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate this opportunity to participate in BYU's annual symposium on the Book of Mormon. This year you are focusing on the second book of Nephi. That book provides some of our most important doctrinal insights on the significance of free agency in the gospel plan. I have therefore chosen to speak about free agency and freedom.<br><br>The scriptural terms are<i>agency</i>and<i>free</i>. When we refer to agency, we usually combine the two words and say<i>free agency.</i>But we sometimes use this term to refer to freedom as well as agency. And the scriptural term<i>free</i>sometimes means free agency and sometimes means<i>freedom</i>.<br><br>In view of this confusion, I need to define the terms I will use. When I say<i>free agency</i>I refer to what scripture calls<i>agency,</i>which means an exercise of the will, the power to choose. (In view of the current prominence of this term on the sports pages, I must add that this "free agency" does not refer to the contract status of professional athletes.) When I say<i>freedom,</i>I mean the power and privilege to carry out our choices. This includes everything from thoughts, such as hate, to actions, such as running.<br><br>In the first part of my talk I will speak of the doctrine of the Church. In the second part I will describe some applications of that doctrine.<br><h2><b>I. Doctrine</b></h2><br>Sister Oaks is my best critic. She tells me that when I speak about doctrine my talks are pretty dry, probably more understandable to read than to hear. Perhaps it would help listeners to this first part if I began with an outline of the nine points I will make from the scriptures.<br><br>1. Before the world was created, we existed in the presence of God.<br><br>2. Free agency is a gift of God.<br><br>3. We had free agency in the premortal existence.<br><br>4. There Satan presented a plan that would have taken away our free agency.<br><br>5. When God rejected Satan's plan, Satan and those who followed him rebelled and were cast out of heaven.<br><br>6. Pursuant to God's plan, Adam and Eve made the choice that caused the Fall, making mankind subject to mortality and sin in the world.<br><br>7. We are here to be tested, and this cannot occur without opposition in all things.<br><br>8. To provide that opposition, Satan is permitted to try to persuade us to use our free agency to choose evil.<br><br>9. If we choose evil and do not repent, we can ultimately become captives of Satan.<br><br>To appreciate the significance of the added gospel knowledge restored in this dispensation, notice how many of these essential gospel truths are revealed or clarified in the Book of Mormon, especially in 2 Nephi, and in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price.<br><br>1.<i>Before the world was created, we existed in the presence of God (see D&amp;amp;C 93:29).</i>Abraham saw that God stood in the midst of these spirits and chose some of them to make his rulers (see Abraham 3:23). We do not know much about the premortal existence. The scriptures sometimes refer to preexistent "intelligences" and sometimes to preexistent "spirits" (see Moses 6:36; Abraham 3:18–23, 5:7; D&amp;amp;C 93:29–33.) For present purposes it is unnecessary to distinguish between the two. The important thing is that in the premortal existence we had individual identities and we dwelt in the presence of God.<br><br>2.<i>Free agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God.</i>As we read in 2 Nephi: "Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself" (2 Nephi 2:16). Further:<br><br><i>Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves--to choose the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 10:23]<br><br>And in modern revelation the Lord said, "Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself" (D&amp;amp;C 29:35).<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith described agency as "that free independence of mind which heaven has so graciously bestowed upon the human family as one of its choicest gifts" (<i>Teachings,</i>p. 49). The word<i>free</i>is also used to describe free agency in this hymn Latter-day Saints have been singing since our first hymnbook in 1835:<br><br><i>Know this, that ev'ry soul is free</i><br><i>To choose his life and what he'll be;</i><br><i>For this eternal truth is giv'n:</i><br><i>That God will force no man to heav'n.</i><br><i>He'll call, persuade, direct aright,</i><br><br><i>And bless with wisdom, love, and light,</i><br><i>In nameless ways be good and kind,</i><br><i>But never force the human mind.</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 240]<br><br>3.<i>We had free agency in the premortal existence.</i>This is evident from the fact that more than one plan was put forward in the Council in Heaven, and that a third of the hosts of heaven could choose to follow Satan and rebel against the Father. (See Joseph Fielding Smith,<i>Doctrines of Salvation,</i>comp. Bruce R. McConkie [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954–56], 1:64, 70.)<br><br>4.<i>Satan's plan, presented in the premortal existence, would have taken away our free agency.</i>During what we call the Council in Heaven, the Father explained the conditions of the next step in the progression of his spirit children. They needed to receive a mortal body, and it was necessary for God to "prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:25).<br><br>Satan came before God with this proposal:<br><br><i>Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</i>[Moses 4:1]<br><br>But the Beloved Son, our Savior, who was "Chosen from the beginning," said to the Father: "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27), and "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever" (Moses 4:2).<br><br>In the book of Moses God describes Satan's effort:<br><br><i>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</i><br><br><i>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</i>[Moses 4:3–4].<br><br>Satan's method of assuring "that one soul shall not be lost" (Moses 4:1) would be to "destroy the agency of man" (Moses 4:3). Under his plan, Satan would have been our master, and he would have led us "captive at his will" (Moses 4:4). Without the power of choice, we would have been mere robots or puppets in his hands.<br><br><i>5. When God rejected Satan's plan, Satan and those who followed him rebelled and were cast out of heaven.</i><br><br>The contest the scriptures call the "war in heaven" (Revelation 12:7) concerned Satan's attempts to usurp the power of God and to destroy the free agency of his children. One-third of the hosts of heaven exercised their agency to follow Satan. The Bible describes this in veiled references to Lucifer's attempt to exalt himself and to a war in which the dragon and his angels were cast out of heaven. (See Isaiah 14:12–15, Revelation 12:7–9, Abraham 3:28.) The event is described more clearly in modern revelation:<br><br><i>For</i>[the devil]<i>rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;</i><br><br><i>And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 29: 36–37; see also D&amp;amp;C 76:25–26]<br><br>In his great poem "Immanuel," Orson F. Whitney describes this event in the council of gods when "The destiny of worlds unborn hung trembling in the scale." One arose:<br><br><i>A stature mingling strength and grace,</i><br><i>Of meek though Godlike mien,</i><br><i>The luster of whose countenance</i><br><i>Outshone the noon-day sheen.</i><br><br><i>The hair was white as purest foam,</i><br><i>Or frost of Alpine hill.</i><br><i>He spake--attention grew more grave--</i><br><i>The stillness e'en more still.</i><br><br><i>"Father!"--the voice like music fell,</i><br><i>Clear as the murmuring flow</i><br><i>Of mountain streamlet, trickling down</i><br><i>From heights of virgin snow--</i><br><br><i>"Father!" it said, "since One must die</i><br><i>Thy children to redeem,</i><br><i>Whilst Earth--as yet unformed and void--</i><br><i>With pulsing life shall teem;</i><br><br><i>"And thou, great Michael, foremost fall,</i><br><i>That mortal man may be,</i><br><i>And chosen Savior yet must send,</i><br><i>Lo, here am I, send me!</i><br><br><i>I ask--I seek no recompense,</i><br><i>Save that which then were mine;</i><br><i>Mine be the willing sacrifice,</i><br><i>The endless glory--Thine!"</i><br><br><i>He ceased and sat; when sudden rose</i><br><i>Aloft a towering Form,</i><br><i>Proudly erect, as lowering peak</i><br><i>That looms above the storm.</i><br><br><i>A presence bright and beautiful,</i><br><i>With eye of flashing fire,</i><br><i>A lip whose haughty curl bespoke</i><br><i>A sense of inward ire.</i><br><br><i>"Give me to go," he boldly cried,</i><br><i>With scarce concealed disdain,</i><br><i>"And none shall hence, from heaven to earth,</i><br><i>That shall not rise again.</i><br><br><i>My saving plan exception scorns--</i><br><i>Man's agency unknown.</i><br><i>As recompense, I claim the right</i><br><i>To sit on yonder Throne!"</i><br><br><i>Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush</i><br><i>Resumed and denser grew.</i><br><i>All eyes were turned; the general gaze</i><br><i>One common magnet drew.</i><br><br><i>A moment there was solemn pause--</i><br><i>Then, like the thunder-burst,</i><br><i>Rolled forth from lips Omnipotent,</i><br><i>The words: "I'LL SEND THE FIRST!"</i><br><br><i>'Twas done. From congregation vast,</i><br><i>Tumultuous murmurs rose;</i><br><i>Waves of conflicting sound, as when</i><br><i>Two meeting seas oppose.</i><br><br><i>'Twas finished--but the heavens wept--</i><br><i>And still their annals tell</i><br><i>How God's elect was chosen Christ,</i><br><i>O'er One who fighting fell.</i><br>["Immanuel--A Christmas Idyl,"<i>The Poetical Writings of Orson F. Whitney</i>(Salt Lake City: Juvenile Instructor Office, 1889), pp. 136–142]<br><br><i>6. Pursuant to God's plan, Adam and Eve made the choice that caused the Fall, making mankind subject to mortality and sin in the world.</i><br><br><i>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</i>[the Lord told Adam and Eve],<i>nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</i>[Moses 3:17]<br><br>Adam and Eve were able to bring about the Fall by choice because they had alternatives and they had free agency, whose essence is described in these words: "Thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee" (Moses 3:17).<br><br>Thus we see that what we call "the Fall" and the "transgression of Adam" was a necessary step that resulted from our first parents' exercise of their gift of free agency. As we read in 2 Nephi, Lehi explained:<br><br><i>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</i><br><br><i>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</i>[2 Nephi 2:24–25]<br><br>With the Fall came mortality and an opportunity to be tested. The Lord told Adam that his children were given "to know good from evil; wherefore they are agents unto themselves" (Moses 6:56). Alma taught that with the Fall man became<br><br><i>as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good.</i>[Alma 12:31; also see Alma 42:7]<br><br>Similarly, the prophet Samuel taught:<br><br><i>For behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.</i>[Helaman 14:30]<br><br>Note that in this teaching the word "free" means free agency.<br><br>7.<i>We are here to be tested, and this cannot occur without opposition in all things.</i><br><br>On this subject 2 Nephi enlarges our understanding. Father Lehi taught his son Jacob:<br><br><i>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one.</i>[2 Nephi 2:11]<br><br>In other words, if we did not have opposition, we could not exercise our free agency by making choices. "Wherefore," Father Lehi explained, "the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other" (2 Nephi 2:16).<br><br>Without opposition in all things we could not achieve righteousness. All things would be a compound in one, a mixture--no distinction between wickedness and holiness. In that state of innocence, mankind would be "having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin" (2 Nephi 2:23). As we read in modern revelation,<br><br><i>And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 29:39]<br><br>8.<i>To provide the needed opposition, Satan is permitted to try to persuade us to use our free agency to choose evil.</i><br><br>In 2 Nephi, Lehi declares that the Messiah will come "in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall" (2 Nephi 2:26). Then he gives us this important explanation:<br><br><i>And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</i>[2 Nephi 2:26–27]<br><br>"Free . . . to act for themselves" and "free to choose" refer to free agency. "Free according to the flesh" refers to freedom, as I will illustrate later.<br><br>9.<i>If we choose evil and do not repent, we can ultimately become captives of Satan.</i><br><br>Lehi's assurance that we are free "to act for [ourselves] and not to be acted upon" has this exception: "save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day" if we have chosen "captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:26–27). He then pleads with his sons not to<br><br><i>choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.</i>[vs. 29]<br><br>Similarly, Amulek taught:<br><br><i>For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</i>[Alma 34:35]<br><br>In summary, free agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God, conferred on his children and exercised by them in the premortal existence. It is an essential precondition of the further progression we seek in mortality. But free agency cannot be exercised unless there is opposition in all things. That opposition is provided by Satan, who once sought to destroy our free agency. His effort continues. He tries to persuade us to do evil, and to make those choices that will finally give him the mastery he was denied in the premortal existence--to have all power over us, to lead us captive at his will.<br><h2><b>II. Application</b></h2><br>Now I will discuss some applications of these scriptural principles.<br><br><i>First,</i>because<i>free agency</i>is a God-given precondition to the purpose of mortal life, no person or organization can take away our free agency in mortality.<br><br><i>Second,</i>what can be taken away or reduced by the conditions of mortality is our<i>freedom,</i>the power to act upon our choices. Free agency is absolute, but in the circumstances of mortality freedom is always qualified.<br><br>Freedom may be qualified or taken away (1) by physical laws, including the physical limitations with which we are born, (2) by our own action, and (3) by the action of others, including governments.<br><ol><br> 	<li>Lehi taught his son Jacob that "men are free [have freedom] according to the</li><br></ol><br>flesh" (2 Nephi 2:27). For example, in the flesh we are subject to the physical law of gravity. If I should hang from the catwalk here in the Marriott Center and release my grip, I would not be free to will myself into a soft landing. And I cannot choose to run through a brick wall.<br><br>A loss of freedom reduces the extent to which we can act upon our choices, but it does not deprive us of our God-given free agency. A woman who has spent much of her life confined to a wheelchair expressed that thought in verse. Annie Johnson Flint writes:<br><br><i>I cannot walk, but I can fly;</i><br><i>No roof can house me from the stars</i><br><i>No dwelling pen me in its bounds,</i><br><i>Nor keep me fast with locks and bars.</i><br><br><i>No narrow room my thoughts can cage,</i><br><i>No fetters hold my roving mind;</i><br><i>From these four walls that shut me in,</i><br><i>My soaring soul a way can find. . . .</i><br><br><i>And when the long, long day is done,</i><br><i>I clasp the dearest book of all,</i><br><i>And through the dim, sweet silences,</i><br><i>I hear my Father's accents fall.</i><br><br><i>Then, though, in chains, yet I am free;</i><br><i>Beyond the pressure of my care,</i><br><i>Above earth's night, my spirit mounts</i><br><i>On eagle wings of Faith and Prayer.</i><br>["My Wings," Annie Johnson Flint]<br><br>2. Other limitations on freedom are self-imposed, such as the immobility we seek when we buckle our seat belt or the commitment we make when we sign a contract. In these examples we limit one freedom in order to achieve a larger and more important one.<br><br>3. Many losses of freedom are imposed by others. The science of government is a consideration of the procedures by which and the extent to which the official representatives of one group of citizens can impose restrictions on the freedom of another group. Decisions on the extent to which government power should restrict the freedom of individuals are among the most difficult decisions we face in an organized society. How much should zoning laws restrict a person's right to use his own property? How many taxes should we extract, and what compulsory functions should government perform with them? How much harm can society allow a person to do himself, such as by self-mutilation or drug use? These are all questions of freedom.<br><br>We have to accept some government limitations on freedom if we who live in communities are to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A condition of uninhibited individual freedom would allow the strong to oppress the weak. It would allow the eccentric desires of one person to restrict the freedom of many.<br><br>Interferences with our freedom do not deprive us of our free agency. When Pharaoh put Joseph in prison, he restricted Joseph's freedom, but he did not take away his free agency. When Jesus drove the money changers out of the temple, he interfered with their freedom to engage in a particular activity at a particular time in a particular place, but he did not take away their free agency.<br><br>During my nine years at BYU I read many letters to the editor in the<i>Universe</i>that protested various rules as infringements of free agency. I am glad I don't see those funny arguments anymore, probably because I no longer have to read the letters to the editor in the<i>Universe</i>. The Lord has told us in modern revelation that he established the Constitution of the United States to assure "that every man may act . . . according to the moral agency which I have given unto him" (D&amp;amp;C 101:78). In other words, God established our Constitution to give us the vital political freedom necessary for us to act upon our personal choices in civil government. This revelation shows the distinction between<i>agency</i>(the power of choice), which is God-given, and<i>freedom,</i>the right to act upon our choices, which is protected by the Constitution and laws of the land.<br><br>Freedom is obviously of great importance, but as these examples illustrate, freedom is always qualified in mortality. Consequently, when we oppose a government-imposed loss of freedom, it would be better if we did not conduct our debate in terms of a loss of our free agency, which is impossible under our doctrine. We ought to focus on the legality or the wisdom of the proposed restriction of our freedom.<br><br><i>Third,</i>we receive assurance from our doctrine that Satan, who sought to take away our free agency in the premortal existence, is not permitted to take it from us in this life. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the devil cannot compel men to do evil; he has "power over us only as we permit him" (<i>Teachings,</i>pp. 181, 187, 189). Elder James E. Faust elaborated this in our last conference, when he said, "Certainly he can tempt and he can deceive, but he has no authority over us which we do not give him" ("The Great Imitator,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1987, p. 35).<br><br><i>Fourth,</i>as suggested by these teachings, Satan is still trying to take away our free agency by persuading us to voluntarily surrender our will to his.<br><br>This subject has a morbid fascination for mankind. The long-lived German legend of Faust concerns a man who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power. This is also the theme of Stephen Vincent Benét's "The Devil and Daniel Webster." A variety of modern practices tend toward this surrender, and they carry eternal dangers. As Elder Faust warned us at conference,<br><br><i>The mischief of devil worship, sorcery, casting spells, witchcraft, voodooism, black magic, and all other forms of demonism should be avoided like the plague.</i>["The Great Imitator," p. 33]<br><br><i>Fifth,</i>we should also avoid any practices in which one person attempts to surrender even part of his will to another person or in which another person attempts to take it. Whether the means are chemical, behavioral, electronic, or others not yet dreamed of, such attempts run counter to the heavenly plan and further the adversary's plan. Free agency, the power to choose and direct our thoughts and our actions, is a gift of God, and we should resist any means that would compromise it.<br><br><i>Sixth,</i>we should avoid any behavior that is addictive. Whatever is addictive compromises our will. Subjecting our will to the overbearing impulses imposed by any form of addiction serves Satan's purposes and subverts our Heavenly Father's. This applies to addictions to drugs (such as narcotics, alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine), addiction to practices such as gambling, and any other addictive behavior. We can avoid addictions by keeping the commandments of God.<br><br><i>Seventh,</i>we should be aware that some people are more susceptible to some addictions than other people. Perhaps such susceptibility is inborn, like the unnamed ailment the Apostle Paul called "a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure" (2 Corinthians 12:7). One person has a taste for nicotine and is easily addicted to smoking. Another person cannot take an occasional drink without being propelled into alcoholism. Another person samples gambling and becomes a compulsive gambler.<br><br>Perhaps these persons, as the saying goes, were "born that way." But what does this mean? Does it mean that persons with susceptibilities or strong tendencies have no choice, no free agency in these matters? Our doctrine teaches us otherwise. Regardless of a person's susceptibility or tendency, his will is unfettered. His free agency is unqualified. It is his freedom that is impaired. Other persons are more free; though they unwisely sample the temptations, they seem immune to the addiction. But regardless of the extent of our freedom, we are all responsible for the exercise of our free agency.<br><br>As Lehi taught, in mortality we are only free "according to the flesh" (2 Nephi 2:27). Most of us are born with thorns in the flesh--some more visible, some more serious than others. We all seem to have susceptibilities to one disorder or another, but whatever our susceptibilities, we have the will and the power to control our thoughts and our actions. This must be so. God has said that he holds us accountable for what we do and what we think, so these must be controllable by our agency. Once we have reached the age or condition of accountability, "I was born that way" does not excuse actions or thoughts that fail to conform to the commandments of God. We need to learn how to live so that a weakness that is mortal will not prevent us from achieving the goal that is eternal.<br><br>God has promised that he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain (see 2 Nephi 2:2). The efforts we expend in overcoming an inherited weakness build spiritual strength that will serve us throughout eternity. Thus, when Paul prayed thrice that his "thorn in the flesh" would depart from him, the Lord replied, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Obedient, Paul concluded,<br><br><i>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</i><br><br><i>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</i>[2 Corinthians 12:9–10]<br><br>Whatever our susceptibilities or tendencies, they cannot subject us to eternal consequences unless we exercise our free agency to do or think the things forbidden by the commandments of God. For example, a susceptibility to alcoholism impairs its victim's freedom to partake without addiction, but his free agency allows him to abstain and thus escape the physical debilitation of alcohol and the spiritual deterioration of addiction.<br><br><i>Eighth,</i>beware the argument that because a person has strong drives toward a particular act that he has no power of choice and therefore no responsibility for his actions. This contention runs counter to the most fundamental premises of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Satan would like us to believe that we are not responsible in this life. That is the result he tried to achieve by his contest in the premortal existence. A person who insists that he is not responsible for the exercise of his free agency because he was "born that way" is trying to ignore the outcome of the War in Heaven. We are responsible, and if we argue otherwise, our efforts become part of the propaganda effort of the adversary.<br><br>Individual responsibility is a law of life. It applies in the law of man and the law of God. Society holds people responsible to control their impulses so we can live in a civilized society. God holds his children responsible to control their impulses so they can keep his commandments and realize their eternal destiny. The law does not excuse the short-tempered man who surrenders to his impulse to pull a trigger on his tormentor, or the greedy man who surrenders to his impulse to steal, or the pedophile who surrenders to his impulse to satisfy his sexual desires with children.<br><br>I suppose it is inevitable that those who have surrendered to impulse would try to use the defense of "irresistible impulse." But in the courts on high, this defense will be transparent to the Great Judge, who sees all our actions and "knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Alma 18:32).<br><br>There is much we do not know about the extent of freedom we have in view of the various thorns in the flesh that afflict us in mortality. But this much we do know, we<i>all</i>have our free agency, and God holds us accountable for the way we use it in thought and deed. That is fundamental.<br><br>God has commanded us not to become entangled in sin (see D&amp;amp;C 88:86). In modern revelation he said:<br><br><i>And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 38:42]<br><br>This principle of individual responsibility and these commands to go out from among the wicked and to be clean apply to a multitude of circumstances. In terms of free agency and freedom, I urge you to apply these commands in this way: If you have a weakness or a susceptibility to some particular transgression, especially one that can be addictive, use your free agency and your freedom to steer a course far from the circumstances of that particular transgression.<br><br>May God bless us to live our lives so as to avoid entangling ourselves in sin and compromising our precious and unique gift of free agency. May we accept responsibility for our thoughts and our actions. May we use our free agency to make righteous choices and to act upon them as we have the freedom to do so.<br><br>For my conclusion I come back to the words of Nephi in the concluding chapter of 2 Nephi:<br><br><i>I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people . . . .</i>[2 Nephi 33:3]<br><br><i>And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the plainness of the truth . . .</i>.[v. 5]<br><br><i>. . . And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good . . . .</i>[v. 10]<br><br><i>And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last day.</i>[v. 12]<br><br>I say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Dallin H. Oaks was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 11 October 1987.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>of Chastity - Ezra Taft Benson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Most Dear and Precious</b></h2><br>My dear brothers and sisters, what a thrill it is to look out over this congregation. I so much appreciate the collective power of righteousness that you represent.<br><br>In this dispensation the Lord reiterated the commandment given at Sinai when He said, "Thou shalt not . . . commit adultery, . . .<i>nor do anything like unto it"</i>(D&amp;amp;C 59:6; emphasis added). From the beginning of time, the Lord has set a clear and unmistakable standard of sexual purity. It always has been, it is now, and it always will be the same. That standard is the law of chastity. It is the same for all--it is the same for men and women; it is the same for old and young; it is the same for rich and poor.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Jacob tells us that the Lord delights in the chastity of His children (see Jacob 2:28). Do you hear that, my brothers and sisters? The Lord is not just pleased when we are chaste. He<i>delights</i>in chastity. Mormon taught the same thing to his son, Moroni, when he wrote that chastity and virtue are "most dear and precious above all things" (Moroni 9:9).<br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, the law of chastity is a principle of eternal significance. We must not be swayed by the many voices of the world. We must listen to the voice of the Lord and then determine that we will set our feet irrevocably upon the path He has marked.<br><h2><b>Reaping the Consequences</b></h2><br>The world is already beginning to reap the consequences of its abandonment of any standards of morality. As just one example, recently the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States warned that if a cure for AIDS is not quickly found, it could become a worldwide epidemic that "will dwarf such earlier medical disasters as the Black Plague, smallpox, and typhoid" ("HHS Chief Says AIDS Will Dwarf the Plague,"<i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i>30 January 1987, p. A-1).<br><br>As the world seeks solutions for this disease, which began primarily through widespread homosexuality, people look everywhere but to the law of the Lord. There are numerous agencies, both public and private, trying to combat AIDS. They seek increased funding for research. They sponsor programs of education and information. They write bills aimed at protecting the innocent from infection. They set up treatment programs for those who have already become infected. These are important and necessary programs, and we commend those efforts. But why is it we rarely hear anyone calling for a return to chastity, for a commitment to virtue and fidelity?<br><br>I recognize that most people fall into sexual sin in a misguided attempt to fulfill basic human needs. We all have a need to feel loved and worthwhile. We all seek to have joy and happiness in our lives. Knowing this, Satan often lures people into immorality by playing on their basic needs. He promises pleasure, happiness, and fulfillment.<br><br>But this is, of course, a deception. As the writer of Proverbs says: "Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul" (Proverbs 6:32). Samuel the Lamanite taught the same thing when he said, "Ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of . . . righteousness" (Helaman 13:38). Alma said it more simply: "Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10).<br><br>Do not be misled by Satan's lies. There is no lasting happiness in immorality. There is no joy to be found in breaking the law of chastity. Just the opposite is true. There may be momentary pleasure. For a time it may seem like everything is wonderful. But quickly the relationship will sour. Guilt and shame set in. We become fearful that our sins will be discovered. We must sneak and hide, lie and cheat. Love begins to die. Bitterness, jealousy, anger, and even hate begin to grow. All of these are the natural results of sin and transgression.<br><br>On the other hand, when we obey the law of chastity and keep ourselves morally clean, we will experience the blessings of increased love and peace, greater trust and respect for our marital partners, deeper commitment to each other, and, therefore, a deep and significant sense of joy and happiness.<br><br>We must not be misled into thinking these sins are minor, or that consequences are not that serious. One of the most sobering statements about being unchaste is that of Alma to his son Corianton: "Know ye not, my son," he said, "that these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord;<i>yea, most abominable above all sins</i>save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?" (Alma 39:5; emphasis added). Very few of us will ever be guilty of murder or of the sin against the Holy Ghost. But the law of chastity is frequently broken, and yet it stands next to these other sins in seriousness in the eyes of the Lord.<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters, are we living in accordance with these scriptures? Do we clearly understand the seriousness of sexual sins? Do we constantly stress the blessings that come from obedience to this law? I say again, as have all the prophets before me, there is one standard of virtue and chastity, and all are expected to adhere to it. What the Lord says unto one, He says unto all: "Ye must practice virtue and holiness before me continually" (D&amp;amp;C 46:33).<br><h2><b>Six Steps to Prepare and Prevent</b></h2><br>There is an old saying that states: It is better to prepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent. How true that is of the law of chastity. The first line of defense in keeping ourselves morally clean is to prepare ourselves to resist temptation and prevent ourselves from falling into sin.<br><br>For those who are pure and chaste, may I give six steps that are steps of preparation and prevention, steps that will insure that you never fall into this transgression:<br><br>1.<i>Decide now to be chaste.</i>The decision to be chaste and virtuous need only be made once. Make that decision now and let it be so firm and with such deep commitment that it can never be shaken. Don't wait until you are alone in a parked car or caught in a compromising situation to decide to be chaste. Decide now!<br><br>2.<i>Control your thoughts.</i>No one steps into immorality in an instant. The first seeds of immorality are always sown in the mind. When we allow our thoughts to linger on lewd or immoral things, the first step on the road to immorality has been taken. I especially warn you against the evils of pornography. Again and again we hear from those caught in deep sin that often the first step on their road to transgression began with pornographic materials. The Savior taught that even when a man looks upon a woman to lust after her, or in other words, when he lets his thoughts begin to get out of control, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart (see Matthew 5:28, D&amp;amp;C 63:16).<br><br>3.<i>Always pray for the power to resist temptation.</i>Temptation will come to all of us. It will take many forms and appear in many disguises, but the Lord has given us the key for resisting it. He said to the Prophet Joseph: "Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work" (D&amp;amp;C 10:5). It should be part of our daily prayers to ask the Lord for constant strength to resist temptations, especially temptations that involve the law of chastity.<br><br>4.<i>If you are married, avoid flirtations of any kind.</i>Sometimes we hear of a married man going to lunch with his secretary or other women in the office. Men and women who are married sometimes flirt with and tease members of the opposite sex. So-called harmless meetings are arranged or inordinate amounts of time are spent together. In all of these cases, people rationalize by saying that these are natural expressions of friendship. But what may appear to be harmless teasing or simply having a little fun with someone of the opposite sex can easily lead to more serious involvement and eventual infidelity. A good question to ask ourselves is this: Would my spouse be pleased if he or she knew I was doing this? Would a wife be pleased to know that her husband lunches alone with his secretary? Would a husband be pleased if he saw his wife flirting and being coy with another man? My beloved brothers and sisters, this is what Paul meant when he said: "Abstain from all appearance of evil" (1 Thessalonians 5:22).<br><br>5.<i>If you are married, avoid being alone with members of the opposite sex whenever possible.</i>Many of the tragedies of immorality begin when a man and woman are alone in the office or at church or driving in a car. At first there may be no intent or even thought of sin. But the circumstances provide a fertile seedbed for temptation. One thing leads to another, and very quickly tragedy may result. It is so much easier to avoid such circumstances from the start so that temptation gets no chance for nourishment.<br><br>6.<i>For those who are single and dating members of the opposite sex, carefully plan positive and constructive activities so that you are not left to yourselves with nothing to do but share physical affection.</i>Once again this is the principle of filling one's life with the positive so that the negative has no chance to thrive. When young people are left to themselves for long periods of time with no specific planned activities, often they turn to necking and petting to fill the empty hours.<br><h2><b>Five Steps to Repair and Repent</b></h2><br>But I realize that there may be some, even now within the sound of my voice, for whom the counsel to prepare and prevent is too late. You may already be deeply entangled in serious sin. If this is the case, there is no choice now but to repair your lives and repent of your sins. To you I would suggest five important things you can do to come back to a state of moral purity.<br><br>1.<i>Flee immediately from any situation you are in that is either causing you to sin or that may cause you to sin.</i>When Joseph of Egypt was entrapped by Potiphar's wife alone in the house, it would have been easy for Joseph to have rationalized. After all, he had not encouraged her. After all, he was her servant. After all, it would hurt her feelings if he refused. Had Joseph stood there and rationalized, he could easily have fallen. There is a great lesson in how he did respond. The scripture says, "And he left his garment in her hand,<i>and fled, and got him out"</i>(Genesis 39:12; emphasis added). He fled and got him out. My beloved brothers and sisters, if you are currently in a situation where your moral purity is being or could be compromised, follow Joseph's example. Flee from it and get yourself out. You cannot linger in sin and expect to have success in repentance.<br><br>2.<i>Plead with the Lord for the power to overcome.</i>One of Satan's most effective strategies with those he has lured into sin is to whisper in their ears that the are not worthy to pray. He will tell you that Heavenly Father is so displeased with you that He will never hear your prayers. This is a lie, and he says it to deceive us. The power of sin is great. If we are to extricate ourselves from it, especially serious sin, we must have a power greater than ourselves. No one is more anxious to help you flee from sin than your Father in Heaven. Go to Him. Acknowledge your sin, confess your shame and your guilt, and then plead with Him for help. He has the power to help you triumph.<br><br>3.<i>Let your priesthood leaders help you resolve the transgression and come back into full fellowship with the Lord.</i>Certain sins are of such gravity that they put our standing in the Church in jeopardy. Sexual sins are among those of such seriousness (see D&amp;amp;C 42:24). Full repentance of such sins requires that we not only confess our sins and resolve them with the Lord, but that we also do so with the Church. This is done through appropriate priesthood leaders. The bishops and stake presidents have been appointed by revelation to serve as watchmen over the Church and as judges in Israel. While only the Lord can forgive sins, the priesthood leaders play a critical role in the process of repentance. Even if we are disfellowshipped or excommunicated, it is a beginning step in the process of repentance, and the sooner one begins, the sooner one can find the sweet peace and joy that come with the miracle of forgiveness.<br><br>4<i>. Drink from the divine fountain and fill your lives with positive sources of power.</i>It is not enough simply to try to resist evil or empty our lives of sin. We must also fill our lives with righteousness. We must engage in activities that bring spiritual power. I speak of such activities as immersing ourselves in the scriptures. There is a power that flows into our lives when we read and study the scriptures on a daily basis that cannot be found in any other way. Daily prayer is another source of great power. Fasting for specific strength or special blessings can strengthen us beyond our normal ability. Christian service, church attendance, service in the kingdom--all can add to our storehouse of strength and power. We must do more than simply remove the negative influences from our lives. We must replace them with righteous activities that fill us with the strength and determination to live as we should.<br><br>5.<i>Remember that through proper repentance you can become clean again.</i>Moroni taught that "despair cometh because of iniquity" (Moroni 10:22). Those who are caught in immorality may be experiencing the devastating effects of despair. But there is an alternative. For those who pay the price required by true repentance, the promise is sure. You can be clean again. The despair can be lifted. The sweet peace of forgiveness will flow into your lives.<br><h2><b>Finding Joy</b></h2><br>The words of the Lord through Isaiah are sure: "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool" (Isaiah 1:18).<br><br>And in this dispensation the Lord spoke with equal clarity when He said, "Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42).<br><br>As I said earlier, when it comes to the law of chastity, it is better to prepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent.<br><br>My beloved brothers and sisters in the gospel, our Heavenly Father desires nothing for us but to be happy. He tells us only those things that will bring us joy. And one of the surest principles given by God to help us find that joy is the law of chastity.<br><br>I pray with all my heart that you will consider most solemnly the joyful consequences of keeping this law and the tragic consequences of violating it. And I do this in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Ezra Taft Benson was President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 13 October 1987</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

This joyous season that brings us Thanksgiving and Christmas is the best time of the year when we think of families, loved ones everywhere, and things of the heart.<br><br>I have prayed for divine guidance that these few precious moments might be beneficial to all. I am mindful of my responsibility as well as my desire to encourage you in your own<i>personal lives</i>to follow the course of our Savior unto salvation.<br><h2><b>Spreading the Word</b></h2><br>It is not possible here to explore or examine the vast realm of revealed gospel knowledge about our mortal existence available to you at this unusual university. And so, on this day, I bring you not an argument or a doubt, but a witness of heaven-sent revelations that this is the church of Jesus Christ, restored to the earth in these latter days; that God our Heavenly Father lives and that he loves each of us--his children; that Jesus<i>is</i>the Christ, the son of the living God, our Savior.<br><br>The heavenly event related by young Joseph, then only four or five years<i>younger</i>than most of you, after he came out of a grove of trees--which we appropriately refer to as the "Sacred Grove"--<i>is true</i>. I bear this witness and testimony to you. Joseph Smith was directed, after scripture study and prayer, to pray for guidance; and he did see and communicate with God the Father and his son Jesus Christ. This church is led today by his prophet, upon whom the Almighty has bestowed the greatest gifts that mortal man is capable of receiving, even our prophet Ezra Taft Benson. I am a witness to the bestowal of the authority and the gifts upon President Benson.<br><br>A few days ago, a most unusual news article about the Mormons appeared in the Sunday magazine section of the<i>London Times,</i>one of the most influential newspapers in the world with one of the widest circulations in the world--one million, three hundred thousand copies (ten times the circulation of Utah's largest newspaper!). As I studied this rather remarkable article, because it is so favorable and positive about us, I reflected upon the promise and direction our Lord gave twenty-six-year-old Joseph Smith at the Johnson farmhouse in November 1831. Joseph was instructed to translate the Book of Mormon and promised he would be given the "power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth" (D&amp;amp;C 1:30).<br><br>In my lifetime I have been permitted to witness events, to see and feel divine influences of the Lord in his providence, revealing his gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost. Imagine the stretch of events from the humble but heavenly directed proceedings of the restoration of the gospel to this publication in the<i>London Times</i>! We had nothing directly to do with the article, but the press and the British Broadcasting Corporation were conscious of and involved this past summer in our 150<sup>th</sup>anniversary celebration of our first missionaries arriving in Great Britain. The interest developed by writers for the<i>London Times</i>resulted in this most complimentary article about our growth and message, and it was written by a nonmember. Well, unusual things are happening all over the world to bring the message of the Restoration to every nation and every people, to tell everyone of the divine Sonship of the Lord Jesus.<br><br><i>That faith also might increase in the earth;</i><br><br><i>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</i><br><br><i>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 1:21–23]<br><br>You who attend this university have such unusual opportunities and blessings available to you. Every facet of your lives should be enriched by what you do, how you govern your lives, and what you learn while here. I urge you to take full advantage of every uplifting aspect of university life--spiritually, academically, socially, and physically--to feed your souls as well as your minds.<br><h2><b>Streams, Clear and Pure</b></h2><br>Someone has likened each of our lives to a mighty river as it flows to the sea. It is the product of many streams--some large, some small--even little brooks, created by the melting snow high in the mountains. I thank God for the streams, clear and pure, that have influenced my life; for noble parents who taught me the goodness of life, of honor and virtue, and who taught me to love the Lord; for my widowed mother who, like the Prophet Joseph Smith, taught correct principles with understanding and patience; for the priesthood and for the activities of Scouting; for the desire I had to go to college; and for the blessing of finding my sweetheart (I knew when I first saw her that she would be my eternal companion, if I could only convince her to feel the same way I did.); for the blessing of our three children and their posterity, three of whom are here today. My gratitude for the many, many streams and rivers that have affected my life goes on and on. I'm so grateful!<br><br>Each stream has a beginning, a source from which it springs. Yours has emerged and developed from sources such as parents, home, family training, early schooling, and the many, many people who have touched your lives. Soon you will be moving out into the world on your own with the necessity and hoped-for ability to make your own way. You are at junctions in your lives, or nearing them, where your stream may take you on to great heights or not so high, to joy and happiness or regret and disappointment. I urge you to use your time wisely, to stretch your intellect and expand your horizons, that you may be prepared to fulfill your personal role in the restored Church and kingdom and to be all that you can be, using correct principles to contain the waters within the banks of your own personal stream as it flows on a true course toward the high reward of eternal life.<br><br>You might say at this point, "Oh, we hear that from you brethren all the time!" So, maybe you do. But we who love you will continue to encourage each of you to determine where you are on the ladder as you climb step by step upward through this testing period, because we, too, have been there.<br><br>The Savior taught in the Sermon on the Mount: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33).<br><br>I received a letter this past week from a young father who, with his wife and two children, joined the Church four months ago. He had attended a regional conference of eight stakes that we held in Arizona last month. He wrote: "At the conference I learned of love of God and for my fellowmen. I learned that spiritual acts and a 'help-thy-neighbor' attitude will be more valuable than all the riches of the world. I learned to not just wish for higher income<i>but to work</i>to earn enough for our needs. Some of the time and effort I would normally spend just making more money will go to reading the scriptures and teaching my family the gospel at family home evenings. I realized what I received through ... baptism might be wasted by not making the proper decisions and effort to earn the blessings of the celestial kingdom."<br><br>I was impressed by this new member and his family and with the fact that after only four months of participation, their "precious faith" was already increasing that they might receive the "precious promises" as declared by the Apostle Peter.<br><h2><b>"This Is Life Eternal"</b></h2><br>Several years ago I sat in a little white room in the Los Angeles Temple--a simple, little room with no fancy adornments on the walls. My wife, Ruby, was there by my side. We had one son and his wife there along with our daughter and her new husband. Our other son was kneeling at the altar holding the hand of the young lady he was about to be sealed to.<br><br>As I looked around the room, I knew the great moment of my life was there,<i>then,</i>because all I had that was really important--remember,<i>really important</i>--was in that room. The bishops and stake presidents had found each member of my family worthy to be in that room.<br><br>It is not the number of cars you own or the size of your bank account or the number of cattle you have in the hills, but the eternal values that count. You remember the Lord said something about moth and rust getting through to our worldly possessions (see Matthew 6:20). I knew that the greatest moment in my life was having all of our family in that little white sealing room in the Los Angeles Temple. Each of our children and their companions had participated in the sacred ordinances and ceremonies that pertain to salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of God.<br><br>One of the greatest blessings of life is to realize what is truly important in our lives and then work toward that end.<br><br>Our Lord and Savior's prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane that last evening for the souls of all mankind, taking their sins and sufferings upon himself, clearly shows the need for us to know, respect, love, and obey our Eternal Father when he emphasized: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent" (John 17:3).<br><h2><b>Living the Ten Commandments</b></h2><br>Some years ago, Cecil B. DeMille, producer of the epic film<i>The Ten Commandments,</i>gave an address in which he discussed the pressing need for making that great film. Many today in this so-called "modern" and materialistic society think these commandments a bit archaic. But our Lord God revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai the great governing principles we all are subject to and by which man will be judged. Moses received these commandments twice--on each occasion written by the finger of the Lord on tablets of stone.<br><br>The first commandment:<br><br><i>I AM THE LORD THY GOD. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.</i><br><br><i>We do not bow before giant birds of carved granite or wooden idols with stone eyes.</i><br><br><i>But we have other gods competing with God.</i><br><br><i>We may never have bowed before a calf of gold, but we may still worship gold....</i><br><br><i>Is there a man or a woman who can honestly say that he has never put his ambitions or his vanity above God? Or worshipped flesh more than God? Or worshipped the blue-white glisten of a fine diamond, or the earthy beat of rock and roll, or even worshipped himself above the worship of God?...</i><br><br><i>These ... can ... enslave us and betray us into modern idolatry.</i><br><br><i>THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN.</i><br><br><i>When I was a boy I thought that referred only to profanity--but far worse than profanity is the use of the Name of God for personal worldly gain, for ambition, for intolerance, for selfish power over other men, or as a righteous cloak for unrighteous deed.</i><br><br><i>We take the Name of God in vain whenever we misuse the power of God or whenever we say to Him, "Not</i>Thy<i>will, but mine be done."</i>[Cecil B. DeMille, quoted in "The Ten Commandments,"<i>Deseret News,</i>23 February 1957, Church News section, p. 16]<br><br>President Kimball told the story about being in the hospital after one of his operations. He was lying on a gurney that was being wheeled onto an elevator. The floor of the elevator was not flush with the corridor floor, and as the cart moved into the elevator, there was a big bump. President Kimball, just coming out of the anesthetic, heard the orderly take the Lord's name in vain. This great man said to the orderly, "Oh! Don't say that! He is my best friend." The young man apologized and promised to never do it again.<br><br>And now to the next commandment:<br><br><i>REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY, TO KEEP IT HOLY fares none too well in the head-long rush of modern living.</i><br><br><i>Mankind has coined countless ... slogans about the value of time, but this Commandment reminds us that time belongs to God and that some of it should be set aside for Him.</i><br><br><i>The vital and essential heart of this Commandment is that we cannot remain close to God unless we set aside periods of time as God's time--periods of rest from the affairs of the world and the body to seek true communion with the Spirit of Truth, in meditation, in prayer.</i>[Cecil B. DeMille, "The Ten Commandments"]<br><br>Students should organize their time so that most studying can be done on weekdays, leaving the Sabbath for worshipful activities. The Lord said, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."<br><br>And so it is with all the commandments. Each of God's laws is essential, but particularly today they are vital in our somewhat confused society. The Lord commanded, "Neither shalt thou commit adultery," and added in modern revelation, "nor anything like unto it" (see D&amp;amp;C 59:6). The commandments are basic to the gospel and the plan of salvation and are as true and valid and real as the day they were cut into tablets of stone by the finger of God.<br><br>Our living the law of the Ten Command-ments is only the beginning--or the foothills--in our climb toward perfection. The Savior told the rich young man who was keeping the basic commandments to sell all his possessions and follow the Master, suggesting he should move up to a higher plane in his quest for eternal life.<br><br>Joseph Smith declared, "I teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves" (quoted by John Taylor,<i>JD</i>10:57–58). You students have been taught, hopefully, in your homes or through religious associations, correct principles. You also have the unique opportunity to be taught correct principles while here at this university. I hope you learn your lessons well that your streams may become mighty rivers of pure, clear water as they flow into the sea.<br><h2><b>The Loaf of God</b></h2><br>A willingness to serve in the kingdom when and wherever called demonstrates a life of faith and goodness, and is one of those streams in our lives that can so bless not only others but ourselves as well. I was impressed with the remarks of a stake president at a recent stake conference as he was released from his assignment. His remarks were of thankfulness for the opportunity to serve his stake and for the way the people served each other. He said:<br><br><i>My service has been out ... for all to see. But think of the many auxiliary and other leaders and individual members of the Church who have at the same time quietly done their duty and been faithful to the Lord. Some of the greatest service rendered while I have been your president has been done silently out of great sacrifice by individual members. Theirs is the widow's mite. Theirs is the blessing of true service.</i><br><br>The president remembered his ancestry, his parents, his children, his business partner, his professional secretaries, members of his high council, stake clerks, and secretaries. And then he stated: "I would not have been able to serve a single week without the help, love, and support of my dear wife."<br><br>In tribute to the bishops, branch presidents, and other leaders, he said, "They serve where the tire hits the road. They have been faithful and loyal to me, as well as to the Lord."<br><br>The president expressed appreciation for his counselors, and for one in particular who declared to him, "You may not wear the hair shirt"--meaning the stake president was never to feel guilty. He had been called by the Lord and was not to feel guilty for difficult decisions that only he could make.<br><br>He told of looking in the mirror the day after October general conference and seeing in his mind's eye the hands of God, kneading the bread dough of his kingdom, and folding him (the stake president) back into the general loaf of the kingdom of God. "Mine," he said, "was a time to rise for a moment, but now I would become part of the general membership again, as a brother in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so other lives will now be blessed and raised, for the good of the loaf of God."<br><br>What a wonderful attitude!--a stake president demonstrating and teaching how we believe and pray and study the scriptures, earn our livelihood, and serve our God with love. His life's stream is right on course.<br><h2><b>How Is It With Thee?</b></h2><br>The Lord wants and needs all of you to be strong, to be believers, to be examples of goodness to all the world. You can become mighty rivers, flowing with truth. Mediocrity and weaklings come with little effort. The world has an abundance of them.<br><br>I would urge you to use your time wisely. Don't waste it on frivolous pursuits. As Ted Koppel, a national newscaster, told the graduates of Duke University last spring:<br><br>[We]<i>can partake of</i>[TV's]<i>daily banquet without drawing on any intellectual resources; without either physical or moral discipline....</i><br><br><i>... In the place of Truth we have discovered facts; for moral absolutes we have substituted moral ambiguity. We now communicate with everyone ... and say absolutely nothing.</i>[Commencement speech given by Ted Koppel at Duke University on Sunday, 10 May 1987, pp. 5–6]<br><br>I admonish you to live so you can ask for the personal revelation you are entitled to. Someone has written, "Souls are not saved in bundles--they are saved individually. The Spirit says, 'How is it with thee--thee personally?'"<br><br>How<i>are</i>things with<i>you</i>personally? How are<i>you</i>doing?<br><br>To help evaluate how you are doing, I will pose some questions to give you a greater understanding of exactly who you are and what your potential may be, and then respond with answers from the scriptures, which hold and bear record of truth.<br><h2><b>Who Are You?</b></h2><br>You are a literal spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents.<br><br><i>Genesis 1:27:</i>"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female."<br><br><i>Romans 8:16:</i>Paul said, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God."<br><h2><b>Where Did You Come From?</b></h2><br>Your spirit body came from your heavenly parents. Your spirit lived in the presence of celestial beings, whose exalted glory is like unto the sun in comparison with the moon and stars.<br><br><i>Ecclesiastes 12:7:</i>"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."<br><h2><b>Why Are You Here?</b></h2><br>You are here because you kept your first estate. You are here to be proved and tested, to show you can keep your second estate by making right choices and being faithful to them.<br><br><i>Abraham 3:25–26:</i>"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."<br><br>"And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever."<br><br><i>D&amp;amp;C 98:11, 15:</i>"And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall ... live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God."<br><br>"For I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy."<br><br>You are here to develop the gifts and talents to which you were born heir. You will also have the opportunity to gain additional talents.<br><br><i>D&amp;amp;C 82:18:</i>"And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church."<br><br>You are here to sow good works and lay up treasures in heaven.<br><br><i>D&amp;amp;C 11:7:</i>"Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich."<br><br>You are here to meet the requirements and complete the ordinances to become an heir of celestial glory.<br><br><i>D&amp;amp;C 124:38–39:</i>"For this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was."<br><br>"Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies ... are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name."<br><br>To become an<i>heir of celestial glory</i>there are requirements that must be met. You are to be sealed to your companion for time and all eternity. You are to work out your exaltation and be of assistance to others. You are to learn to use the body to accomplish spiritual objectives and to obey the law of procreation. You are to strive for perfection and receive a fullness of joy.<br><br>With your understanding of truth:<br><br><i>You have power to do many things of your own free will and choice and to glorify his holy name (D&amp;amp;C 58:26–27)</i>.<br><br><i>You have the power of prayer (see D&amp;amp;C 93:49).</i><br><br><i>You have power over Satan (D&amp;amp;C 10:5).</i><br><br><i>You have the power of forgiveness (D&amp;amp;C 82:1).</i><br><br><i>You have the power of the Holy Ghost (2 Nephi 33:1).</i><br><br><i>It is within your power to discipline all your appetites and inclinations. (D&amp;amp;C 50:35)</i><br><br><i>You have the power to choose your destiny; to inherit the celestial or the terrestrial or the telestial kingdom (D&amp;amp;C 58:28, 88:22–24).</i><br><br>[Adapted from Thomas C. Byrne,<i>Discover Your Divine Self-Esteem</i>(Salt Lake City: Hawkes Publishing, Inc., 1985), pp. 100–121]<br><br>I pray that God will bless you to rise to the heights that can be yours, that you will magnify the opportunities that come into your lives. May each of you be blessed. May the streams of your lives lead you toward the ultimate goal of life everlasting in the celestial kingdom of God our Heavenly Father. We love you and leave our blessings, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>David B.

<h1>ith the Saints - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Several years ago I heard a popular song that contained the line "I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints." My immediate reaction was anger. The next day I heard the song again, and I laughed at myself because in the interim I had figured out why the line made me so mad. It was because it<i>sounded</i>so true!<br><br>In grade school, while others went to the movies, my parents made me go to church. In junior high school, I collected fast offerings while others slept until noon. In high school, I passed up working on Sunday and earning double time at a grocery store so I could keep the Sabbath day holy. During my mission, for two years, I walked down the streets on Saturday nights with my companion while everyone else our age drove past us with their dates, laughing, pointing, and asking, "What's with those guys?" As a young married couple, we attended church with our squirming children. On Super Bowl Sunday, while the world ate, drank, and cheered, we could be found pulling the hair and flipping the heads or ears of our children and encouraging them to listen to the words of a member of the stake high council. While traveling in our old clunker of a station wagon, we would pull up alongside a Mercedes-Benz. The occupants, with their national average 1.7 kids dressed in designer jeans, would point and laugh at my six kids dressed in their Toughskins. Now do you see why that line made me so mad?<br><br>My frustration peaked last year when my college-age kids prevailed in getting me to attend a concert in this very facility (no sacrifice is too great for my kids). When the singer announced the song from which this line is taken, the crowd went wild. He said, "I'm not trying to convert anyone, I just want to provide you with an alternative." I thought the roof was going to come off this place. I wanted to race down the steps, grab the microphone, and give my opinion on the subject. Of course, my kids would have been horrified, and you would have thought me tacky.<br><br>The statement "sinners laugh and saints cry" is a simplistic generalization at best. We Saints definitely have our share of laughter, and some sinners leave a trail of broken lives and buckets of tears. For saints as well as sinners, all that is meaningful in life doesn't have to be funny. However, to brush aside the meaning of the line in the song with this equally simplistic argument would be to ignore a reasonable question. At a given point in time, don't many who make no effort to live the Church standards appear to be enjoying life more than those who do? Our lives seem to be controlled by inhibitions, constraints, service, sacrifice, guilty consciences, and financial obligations.<br><h2><b>"For Thy Good"</b></h2><br>In the world we see people with none of these so-called restrictions who are home with their kids on more than just Monday night. And they have ten to fifteen percent more of their gross income to spend. By the time we meet our financial obligations, it seems we can't afford to do anything wrong. Let's be honest with ourselves: the Saints do a lot of crying. However, nothing worth having is free.<br><br>The celestial happiness we seek does not come without a price. We obtain celestial joy the old-fashioned way--we earn it. The voguish phrase "no pain, no gain" applies equally well to things of the Spirit.<br><br>Sometimes we cry out, "What have I done wrong to deserve this?" Often trials and tribulations are allowed to come into our lives because of what we are doing right. We are striving for the purification and sanctification that will lead us to exaltation. We all must pass through a certain amount of sacrifice that makes our spirits pliable in the hands of the Lord.<br><br>Joseph Smith's life helps us understand this principle somewhat. By all outward appearances, there was probably not a darker period in his life than the winter of 1838–39 when he was imprisoned in Liberty Jail. The Saints were being persecuted, robbed, and murdered, and there were dissension and apostasy in the ranks.<br><br>We may be inclined to underestimate Joseph's suffering. I don't speak of the coldness and dampness of the jail, but of his discouragement. We may think his anguish would be mitigated by his memory of seeing the Father and the Savior, by his memory of the visits from Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James, and John, and a host of other heavenly messengers. In reality, this knowledge may have intensified the pain. After all, he had a perfect knowledge that God could free him.<br><br>It was in this setting that Joseph cried unto the Lord, "O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1).<br><br>To this agonized plea came the Lord's answer, "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" (121:7).<br><br>"Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7).<br><br>For thy good? What possible good could come from that experience? B.H. Roberts gave his insight when describing Joseph's reaction to a similar experience in 1842.<br><br><i>But what is most pleasing to record of this period of enforced seclusion while avoiding his enemies, is the development of that tenderness of soul manifested in his reflections upon the friends who had stood by him from the commencement of his public career. . . . No act of kindness seems to go unmentioned. No risk run for him that is not appreciated. Indeed he gathers much benefit from those trials, since their effect upon his nature seems to be a softening rather than a hardening influence; and the trials of life are always beneficial where they do not harden and brutalize men's souls; and every day under his trials the Prophet seems to have grown more tender-hearted, more universal in his sympathies; his moments of spiritual exaltation are superb. No one can read them and doubt that the inspiration of God was giving this man's spirit understanding.</i>[<i>HC,</i>vol. 5, introduction, p. xxviii]<br><br>After the Lord told Joseph, "These things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good," he said, "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&amp;amp;C 122:7, 8).<br><br>Part of the reason for the Savior's suffering in Gethsemane was so he would have infinite compassion for us in our trials and tribulations. He also qualified himself to become the perfect judge. Not one of us will be able to approach the Savior on Judgment Day and say, "You don't know what it was like," because he "descended below them all."<br><h2><b>Tears in Gethsemane</b></h2><br>As a loving Father in Heaven viewed his beloved son suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Savior cried out to him: "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as<i>thou</i>wilt" (Matthew 26:39; emphasis added).<br><br>Can you imagine the tears in the eyes of the Father when he had to deny his son's request? Can we comprehend the sacred tears shed by the Father when he had to abandon the Savior on the cross and then hear him say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34). And yet, even as God the Father and his son Jesus Christ wept, the sinners laughed.<br><br>So that we can know the Savior, each of us must pass through our own Gethsemane. Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote a beautiful poem by that name:<br><br><i>In golden youth when seems the earth</i><br><i>A Summer-land of singing mirth,</i><br><i>When souls are glad and hearts are light,</i><br><i>And not a shadow lurks in sight,</i><br><i>We do not know it, but there lies</i><br><i>Somewhere veiled under evening skies</i><br><i>A garden which we all must see--</i><br><i>The garden of Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>With joyous steps we go our ways,</i><br><i>Love lends a halo to our days;</i><br><i>Light sorrows sail like clouds afar,</i><br><i>We laugh, and say how strong we are.</i><br><i>We hurry on; and hurrying, go</i><br><i>Close to the border-land of woe,</i><br><i>That waits for you, and waits for me--</i><br><i>Forever waits Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>Down shadowy lanes, across strange streams,</i><br><i>Bridged over by our broken dreams;</i><br><i>Behind the misty caps of years,</i><br><i>Beyond the great salt fount of tears,</i><br><i>The garden lies. Strive as you may,</i><br><i>You cannot miss it on your way.</i><br><i>All paths that have been, or shall be,</i><br><i>Pass somewhere through Gethsemane.</i><br><br><i>All those who journey, soon or late,</i><br><i>Must pass within the garden's gate;</i><br><i>Must kneel alone in darkness there,</i><br><i>And battle with some fierce despair.</i><br><i>God pity those who can not say,</i><br><i>"Not mine but thine," who only pray,</i><br><i>"Let this cup pass," and cannot see</i><br><i>The</i>purpose<i>in Gethsemane.</i><br>["Gethsemane," by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, in<i>Poems of Power</i>(Chicago: W. B. Conkey Company, 1903), pp. 147–48]<br><br>There is probably no greater Gethsemane for saint or sinner than the grief felt over the death of one's child. I am going to read a portion of a letter written by a father to his ten-year-old daughter just minutes after he learned of her accidental death. Note how this good man's Gethsemane became a sanctifying experience because of his knowledge of the gospel and because of the gift of the Comforter. Contrast his reaction with what it may have been without the light of the gospel. I read it with his permission.<br><br><i>If you may be permitted to listen, these are some thoughts your "Dear Ol' Dad" would like to express in his and your mom's hour of joy and sorrow.</i><br><br><i>You have been an angel of light in our home. Even in your passing you have sanctified the experience by the sweet sorrow of this temporary parting. As I sit in this hotel room many miles from home and only moments after hearing of your passing, I have confidence that you are really home. It's pleasing to know that you are now unencumbered by the mild, but troublesome physical limitations you accepted and lived with in such an adorable noncomplaining way.</i><br><br><i>Mom and I and your seven brothers and sisters are better because you came to our house. Soon after your day of birth you helped us to accept fear and the unknown; to better love others with physical, emotional, or mental challenges; to accept the disappointment accompanying an unknown prognosis and to query and plead with our Father, who today you know better than we do. As you grew older, we learned determination from you, who had every right to spill your milk but never did, who royally beat your mom and dad in tetherball, who averaged ninety-seven percent in spelling for an entire year and by sheer grit struggled with math, and who without ever a complaint sat with your mom every night--summer and school months--to read and understand what you had read. Yes, we did our best to help you learn, but what we learned from you cannot be printed in books--cannot be written because it is almost too sacred to rehearse.</i><br><br><i>We pray for all of us who the Lord expects to stay here on the job for yet awhile. Our prayers are that we will be worthy to be reunited with you and to see you whole and perfect. Oh, how we would have loved to have you stay. How we would love to hear your ever so spontaneous "I love you." How we'd thrill to feel that clinging embrace. Oh yes, especially today.</i><br><br>As you shed your tears in Gethsemane, while others laugh with the sinners, don't curse the purifying mold in which you have been placed. Your crucible is divine and will lead you to perfection and ultimate exaltation. We don't seek the unpleasant things of life. We don't look for pain and suffering. However, we recognize the sanctification that occurs when the trials and tribulations of life are met and turned into spiritual stepping-stones.<br><h2><b>Tears of Joy</b></h2><br>We have been speaking of tears of sorrow and pain. I shall now speak of a different type of tears. They are unique to the Saints and will never be shed by the sinners. I speak of the tears of spiritual joy.<br><br>In an elders quorum presidency, we worked with several less-active families. In a personal interview with one couple, I asked, "Isn't it about time you went to the temple with your family?" I couldn't believe their answer--they said, "Yes." We cried. They were asked to speak of their "conversion" in a Saturday evening session of stake conference, and as they expressed their love, I cried. I thought I was all cried out by the time we went to the temple--until I saw them with their beautiful daughters kneeling at the altar, being sealed for time and all eternity.<br><br>Shortly after my call to the Presiding Bishopric, I received a letter from one of my uncles. "Dear Glenn: I saw you on television last Sunday. Do you realize what an accomplishment it was to get your old reprobate of an uncle to watch general conference?"<br><br>That summer he and his wife celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary. After the reception I walked them to their car and said, "You know, with this calling, I have received the sealing power. If you will commit to a temple marriage, I'll tell you what I'll do for you. I'll perform the ceremony for free."<br><br>A year passed, and as I arrived home late one night, a message awaited me. "Please call your uncle no matter what time you get home." I called and he said, "Glenn, I'm calling to collect on your golden wedding anniversary offer of a free marriage sealing in the Salt Lake Temple." I asked, "Are you serious? When?" He said, "My bishop thinks I can be good enough by December."<br><br>A year ago I sealed them to each other and then sealed two of their sons to them. After fifty-one years of marriage, my uncle and aunt received their crowning glory and blessings. The entire family cried.<br><br>Just ten days ago President Ezra Taft Benson stood before the General Authorities of the Church in the monthly temple meeting. He has been ill, and this was the first time we had been together with him since general conference two months ago. He expressed his love to us and said, "Brethren, it is so good to be with you again." And then, the prophet cried.<br><br>At the conclusion of the Savior's visit to the people of Nephi, he felt their love and faith and was deeply touched. He had just announced that he must leave, but as he looked at the people he<br><br><i>Beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.</i>[3 Nephi 17:5–6]<br><br>Then he healed the sick, and those who were now whole did "bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and . . . bathe his feet with their tears" (v. 10).<br><br>And then Jesus "commanded that their little children should be brought. So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him" (vs. 11–12), and he said,<br><br><i>Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.</i><br><br><i>And when he had said these words, he wept, . . . and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</i><br><br><i>And when he had done this he wept again.</i>[vs. 20, 21–22]<br><br>Elder Bruce R. McConkie spoke of tears in general conference just a few weeks before his death. In one of the most powerful testimonies I have ever heard, that special witness, with full and complete knowledge that his passing was near, said,<br><br><i>I testify that</i>[Jesus Christ]<i>is the Son of the Living God and was crucified for the sins of the world. He is our Lord, our God, and our King. This I know of myself independent of any other person.</i><br><br><i>I am one of his witnesses, and in a coming day I shall feel the nail marks in his hands and in his feet and shall wet his feet with my tears.</i>["The Purifying Power of Gethsemane,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1985, p. 11]<br><br>Those of us who witnessed the delivery of this magnificent address can testify that those tears were flowing even as he stood at the pulpit. They were not tears of sorrow relative to leaving this mortal existence, but tears of joy at the anticipation of the blessing awaiting him.<br><br>Just one day before Elder McConkie's address, I received my call to the Presiding Bishopric. One day after his address, on Easter morning, at 5:00 a.m., I was writing my remarks to be delivered that afternoon. As I reflected on Elder McConkie's beautiful oration, I was overcome with the knowledge of my own weaknesses and inadequacies. However, as I began to comprehend what had taken place in my own life, self-doubt was replaced with peace, confidence, and eternal joy. I wept.<br><br>I penned the words that seem appropriate to repeat at this time: I love the Lord Jesus Christ. I love the transformation his atonement has wrought in me. I once was in darkness, and now see light. I once lost all of my confidence, and now know all things are possible in the Lord. I once felt shame and now am "filled . . . with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh" (2 Nephi 4:21). "I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love" (2 Nephi 1:15).<br><br>I feel the same at this Christmas season as I did on that Easter Sunday two and a half years ago. That knowledge brings tears.<br><br>Would I rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints? Not for one moment. Once one has felt the joy of the gospel there is no going back to a frivolous world. Try as we might, travel where we may, there is an emptiness all the laughter the world has to offer cannot fill. That emptiness can be filled only by placing ourselves in tune with eternal truths and living according to the prescribed laws of God.<br><br>As our understanding increases, we realize that tears of sorrow can be exquisitely beautiful, and they ultimately give way to tears of eternal joy.<br><br>Throughout the world at this season, congregations will sing, "Joy to the world, the Lord is come" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 201). Little does the world know of true joy. I thank God for the restoration of the gospel which gives that understanding. I pray that each of you will discover the majesty of crying with the Saints, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Glenn L.
