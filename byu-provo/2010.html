<h1>t Well Thy Part&quot; - Sharon G. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning! It is indeed a privilege to stand before this assembly and welcome each of you back on campus to begin the 2010 school year. My heart is full of gratitude for the opportunity I have to associate with such an amazing group of young men and women here at Brigham Young University.<br><br>Each of you is representative of a generation of young men and women who in the near future will go out into the world and do great and marvelous things--some within the public scrutiny and some more private and personal. You will eventually be found throughout the world because, indeed, the world will be your campus. Without being aware of it, that well-known author Dr. Seuss described you when he wrote:<br><br><i>OH!</i><br><br><i>THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!</i><br><br><i>You'll be on your way up!</i><br><i>You'll be seeing great sights!</i><br><i>You'll join the high fliers</i><br><i>who soar to high heights.</i><br><i>. . .</i><br><i>Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.</i><br><br>And he was right when he said:<br><br><i>You have brains in your head.</i><br><i>You have feet in your shoes.</i><br><i>You can steer yourself</i><br><i>any direction you choose.</i><br>[Dr. Seuss,<i>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</i>(New York: Random House, 1990), 11–12, 15; 2]<br><br>There is a scripture found in Revelation 3:8 that reads: "Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."<br><br>The Lord has promised each one of you that He will open doors for you to enter and that He will be a beacon of light for you to follow if you but serve Him. He will make available opportunities and experiences that can help you be successful in both the spiritual and temporal areas of your life. When you seek and listen to the Spirit and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost, many blessings will be forthcoming. Prospects for expanding your horizons and for encountering many of life's experiences are boundless if you enter the doors that the Lord provides for you commensurate with your faith. In fact, He has said that these doors cannot be shut by man, but you can close them yourself if you shut Him out ofyour life.<br><br>At the present time you are students studying to achieve important goals in your lives. You desire to gain an education that will enable you to be successful in future professional and personal endeavors. In the months and years ahead you will be entering doors that will lead you to places and opportunities you may not be able to imagine at the present time. As you make your way on the pathways of life, there will be many of these doors available to you.<br><br>There will be times in your future when the door you enter may take you on a road strewn with pain, heartache, and suffering, and you would choose not to take that path if that choice were possible. Individual struggles, however, are necessary for your eternal progression. These trials test your faith, endurance, and submission to the will of the Lord and are part of God's plan for you.<br><br>Also, it is essential that you always recognize and acknowledge the source of all the blessings you receive and that you act accordingly. In 1 Timothy 4:12 you as a youthful generation are admonished to be "an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."<br><br>When was the last time you read or recited the thirteen Articles of Faith? All but one of them begins with the words "We believe." Therefore it certainly would be a good reminder to you of what we as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints profess to believe if you would review the Articles of Faith. You live in a world where economic, political, and social conditions can be extremely dark and depressing without the hope and knowledge of Christ's mission and message. To this world and its people you are needed to be an example in all you do of the beliefs stated in this body of scripture.<br><br>Those who observe your lifestyle and behavior learn a great deal about your character, faith, and values. They can be inspired by your example if you follow the teachings of our Savior Jesus Christ. It is possible, however, for the opposite to occur if your words and actions are not consistent with the principles and teachings of the gospel.<br><br>President David O. McKay was the president of the Church during my high school and college years. Just as Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson will be the leaders you will recall as influencing you during those same tender years in your lives, President McKay is the one I admired, loved, and strived to heed the counsel of.<br><br>When I periodically enter the Missionary Training Center in Provo, I am reminded of him when I view the replica of a stone that is on display in the main entrance. The inscription on the stone influenced President McKay throughout his whole life. The message came at a time when President McKay was very discouraged and downhearted while serving his first mission in Scotland. He had just received a rebuke from a Scottish woman to whom he had presented a tract. The prejudice and misconceptions he felt the people had toward him and the Church hurt him very deeply. As he departed from the Scottish town of Stirling after touring its historic castle on that same day, he had the following life-altering experience:<br><br><i>As we were coming back into town, I saw on my right an unfinished dwelling, over the front door of which there was some carving. That was most unusual, so I said to Elder Johnston, "I'm going to see what that is." I was halfway up the graveled walk when there came to my eyesight a striking motto, carved in stone: "Whate'er thou art, act well thy part."</i><i>I repeated it to Elder Johnston as we walked into town to find a place for our lodgings before we began our work. We walked quietly, but I said to myself, or the Spirit within me whispered, "You are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. More than that, you are a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. You accepted the responsibility as a representative of the Church."...</i><br><br><i>. . . I accepted the message given to me on that stone, and from that moment we tried to do our part as missionaries in Scotland.</i>[David O. McKay,<i>"My Young Friends . . ." President McKay Speaks to Youth,</i>comp. Llewelyn R. McKay (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1973), 39; see also "Pres. McKay Speaks to Pioneer Stake Youth,"<i>Church News,</i>21 September 1957, 4]<br><br>President McKay spoke often of this experience and of how powerful and influential the message on the stone was to him and how it became an important guideline throughout his life. In fact, in his biography ofPresident McKay, Francis Gibbons stated:<br><br><i>There can be no doubt that this experience, which planted the motto in his mind under such unusual circumstances, was one of the major factors in the growth and development of David O. McKay.</i>[Francis M. Gibbons,<i>David O. McKay: Apostle to the World, Prophet of God</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1986), 46]<br><br>President David O. McKay, of course, also reiterated that the message applied to "moral and lawful endeavors, and not to harmful or villainous actions" (McKay,<i>CR,</i>October 1954, 83; also McKay, "Whate'er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>October 1959, 726; reprinted in McKay,<i>What E'er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part: The Missionary Diaries of David O. McKay</i>, eds. Stan Larson and Patricia Larson [Salt Lake City: Blue Ribbon Books, 1999], 274). Today it remains a reminder to us of the scripture found in Mosiah 18:9 in which we are admonished "to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places."<br><br>As my husband and I were raising our family, we jokingly--but very seriously--would say to our children periodically as they left the house for various reasons, "Remember who you are and what you represent." We were reminding each that they were a son or daughter of Heavenly Father and that their behavior in every word and action was representative of their family, church, and God.<br><br>At present you have different roles in your lives. These roles often change from day to day or even from hour to hour. As mentioned previously, each of you is a student at Brigham Young University who is striving to be successful in every aspect of that role. Hopefully you will periodically recall the motto of President McKay and remember to "act well thy part" in your day-to-day activities.<br><br>You can be found learning in the classrooms, studying in the library or cafeterias, walking on campus, working at jobs on or off campus, attending sporting events in different venues on this campus or away, driving motorized vehicles, socializing with friends and classmates, or attending your church meetings. I could, of course, continue with a more extensive list. As a student here we hope you understand and are an example of the motto "Whate'er thou art, act well thy part."<br><br>The Lord has opened a door for you to attend BYU with its attendant blessings, challenges, expectations, and experiences. At the doorway to this campus you are reminded to "Enter to Learn; Go Forth to Serve." He would have each of you remember who you are and how much He loves you as one of His spiritual sons or daughters. He would have you serve your fellow men--benefiting them and making this world better for your having lived in it.<br><br>You will continue to take on new roles as you leave campus life. You will find yourselves having different roles in your families. You will serve in many different capacities and assignments in the Church. You will be leaders as well as followers. In the workplace and at home you will create, teach, learn, serve, and so forth. You will have vitally important roles in your community, family, and church. Throughout your life you will have opportunities each day to be reminded of the admonition that was followed by a prophet of the Lord: "Whate'er thou art, act well thy part."<br><br>I have a testimony that the Lord lives and that we will be blessed as we enter the righteous doors He will provide if we but serve Him. I am thankful for a prophet--President Thomas S. Monson--to guide, teach, and counsel us. May we all be examples of the believers and act well our part is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G. Samuelson, wife of BYU President Cecil O. Samuelson, delivered this devotional address on 5 January 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University. All rights reserved.</i>
<h1>Taught by Two Prophets - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
His reputation for concern for the one--particularly the widow or the wounded, the poor or the persecuted--is widely known. Perhaps you would also like to know, if you don't already, that he is also very interested in and concerned about students. He continues to be most supportive of BYU and is particularly demonstrative when it comes to students. Even in these difficult times he wants you to be well housed, and shortly you will see the tangible results of his desire for more and better student housing on campus. I could say much more about our beloved prophet but will forebear fornow.<br><br>When President Monson gave his most recent devotional address on September 15, 2009, a thought crossed my mind about what I might say to you today. You remember that he reviewed lessons learned and principles taught by all the presidents of the Church whom he has known from Heber J. Grant to Gordon B. Hinckley. When he mentioned his experiences with President David O. McKay, who called President Monson to be an apostle in September of 1963, I remembered some marvelous but limited exposure that I experienced with this extraordinary prophet of my youth.<br><br>As President Monson mentioned how considerate President McKay was of everyone, Irecalled my own personal witness of that positive characteristic of the prophet. Although very different from President Monson's close, frequent, and intimate association, my memories of President McKay have been very meaningful to me, even though from a much greater distance. Because I'm sure he would have treated all of you just as he did me, if you had been in my shoes, I'd like you to understand that those of us who had the chance to interact with him personally were in a real sense just proxies for everyone else. The same is the case today with President Monson. Whenever I see him, I recognize that I am representing you.<br><br>When I was about your age, I had a few brief interactions with President David O. McKay, and I thought it might be instructive and interesting to share some experiences that are very poignant to me. At the outset, I must be clear that we were not close in the typical sense. In fact, on the few occasions when I met him personally, I always had to tell him my name because he would have had no reason to otherwise know it or remember ever seeing me. Like many of you with President Monson, I knew him, but he didn't know me, except as he knew everyone he had the opportunity to meet.<br><br>I believe we as members of the Church always have tender feelings about the prophet, but with our family it was particularly so with President McKay. He was not only the prophet and president of the Church but also a dear friend of many years to my maternal grandparents.<br><br>Although President McKay was 13 years younger than my Grandfather Mitchell, they were called at the same time to serve as missionaries together in Scotland. They associated with one another frequently during their missions and continued their friendship throughout the years. President McKay spoke at my grandfather's funeral and also married and sealed my parents and some of my mother's siblings and companions in the Salt Lake Temple.<br><br>I was in the presence of President McKay on at least two or three occasions in my youth. One such opportunity occurred when I was a teenager, and he dedicated our new ward meetinghouse. Although we didn't know each other at the time, I was interested to learn that Dr. Kim B. Clark, current president of BYU–Idaho, was also in that dedicatory service as a member of the other ward meeting in the same chapel.<br><br>My first conversation with President McKay happened when I was 19 years old. I had received a mission call and was attending the Mission Home, the predecessor to the MTC, in Salt Lake City near Church headquarters. In those days the missionaries-in-training ate their meals at the Hotel Utah, which is now the Joseph Smith Memorial Building on South Temple and Main Street.<br><br>In the basement of the Hotel Utah was a barbershop, and after lunch one day my companion and I passed the barbershop door and saw President McKay having his hair cut. We also saw that there did not appear to be a back door to the establishment, so we decided to wait until he came out to try to shake his hand. While we waited, about a dozen more missionaries came by and saw what we were doing--so they also waited. When the prophet finished with the barber, out he came. He went from one missionary to another, shaking hands, smiling, and asking each one a question or two about their names, hometowns, and missions. He was able to connect someone or something he knew with each missionary, and everyone felt a special relationship with the president of the Church.<br><br>I was the last in the line. Because my surname is different from my mother's maiden name, I had been instructed to tell President McKay if I ever met him that I was the grandson of Joseph Mitchell, which I did. He dropped my hand and hugged me with both arms. He then told all the missionaries that my grandfather had taught him how to be a missionary. I don't know whether this was an exaggeration or not, but I know how it made me feel. He then asked me which mission I had been called to. With some pride I told him the North British Mission because I knew that Scotland was included in the mission and it was also where he and my grandfather had served together.<br><br>President McKay then said something to me that I thought was quite unusual. He mentioned that in the near future the Brethren planned to divide the North British Mission, and he instructed me to tell President Brockbank, the mission president, that I was to serve in Scotland. I didn't think you were supposed to tell the mission president anything!<br><br>Several days later I found myself at the mission headquarters in Manchester, England, with the other new missionaries. I had a brief two- or three-minute interview with the mission president, and before I knew it or had any idea how to raise the issue, I was whisked out the door and the next new elder came into the room. I thought that surely I would have another opportunity to fulfill my charge, but Istill didn't have any idea as to how to present the matter. As I waited with the others, the secretary to the president came out and informed the group that she had been instructed to give us the assignments to our new areas. She did this alphabetically.<br><br>As the first nine or 10 assignments were announced, only one elder was assigned to Scotland, and my spirits sank lower and lower. It was not that I objected to serving in England, which I would have otherwise welcomed, but Ihad been given only one specific instruction by the prophet in my whole life and I had muffed it! When my name and assignment were finally announced, I learned with great relief that I had been assigned to the Kirkcaldy District in Scotland. That night as I said my prayers, I committed to Heavenly Father that if the president of the Church ever again gave me a specific assignment, I would do it whatever the cost. With all of my imperfections, I think in this one thing I have been fully faithful.<br><br>Some time later, after the mission was divided, President McKay came to Scotland, and all of the missionaries serving in Scotland at that time--I think approximately 40 in number--had the privilege of being taught by him for several hours. Time does not permit an account of the impressiveness of this master teacher except for one very remarkable episode.<br><br>During this time the new mission was being established, and we met with considerable opposition and some hostility. As President McKay was teaching us, a small phalanx of newspaper reporters barged right into the room and confronted the prophet. I think most of us young men felt disposed to physically remove the intruders, but President McKay motioned for us to remain seated and in a direct but kindly way answered their question as to whether or not he was really a prophet. He responded by asking the reporters a question that caused them to bow their heads and withdraw from the room without further comment. He simply and quietly said: "Look me in the eyes. Can you tell me that I am not a prophet?" It was a tremendous moment in my life because I knew then better than ever before that he truly was the Lord's prophet and we as young, inexperienced, and unpolished missionaries were really on the Lord's errand.<br><br>In August of 1962 President McKay visited our mission again to organize the first stake in Scotland--the Glasgow Stake. He was accompanied by other General Authorities, and it was a Pentecostal experience for all of us in attendance. I don't remember many of the specifics that he taught, but I do remember with electricity that persists to this day one statement he made. He was reviewing the challenges and difficulties of his first mission in Scotland some 65 years before. He told of the few but faithful Saints, of the sacrifices and struggles they all experienced, and of his great affection and respect for the missionaries with whom he had served. At that time he was in his late eighties, and he mused that all of his brethren save himself were on the other side of the veil. However, he felt the presence in our meeting of three whose names he mentioned. One name he expressed was that of my grandfather. To make sure I had heard correctly, Ilater looked for the text of his speech, which was published shortly thereafter in the<i>Church News.</i>Sure enough, there was the name of Brother Mitchell.<br><br>You might not think any of these experiences to be particularly impressive, but to me they have had a very profound influence on my life that persists to this day. I am grateful for them and especially for the lessons learned and the principles taught by this great prophet. Over the years I have read and reread virtually all of his general conference talks, his books, and his other messages. I very much enjoy his quoting of Robert Burns and other classic poets and also his insightful ways of teaching and explaining the restored gospel. However--and this might seem surprising to you and probably would be to him as well--as impressive as his formal teaching and ministry were, it was in my brief personal encounters that I was taught some very important lessons that have become dear to me. What are they? Let me list a few in the minutes remaining this morning.<br><br>First, as mentioned by President Monson last September, was his consideration for others. He was a gentleman in every respect, but beyond that he also made extra effort to connect with and relate to everyone he met. Ifrequently think of him taking the time to shake the hands of and encourage those in that group of young missionaries of which I was a part. There are many accounts, including some related by President Monson, of his concern for the feelings of others.<br><br>Second was his loyalty to his friends and his associates. I think it mattered not to President McKay that his friend Joseph Mitchell was not highly educated in the schools of the world. In correspondence with my grandfather over the years and in his comments at Grandfather Mitchell's funeral, President McKay was unfailingly kind, complimentary, and appropriately affectionate.<br><br>Third was his ability to be who he was so naturally and yet represent so effectively what he represented as the Lord's prophet. This caused him to be admired and loved by nearly everyone he met. He could give correction without offense and genuine encouragement ashe taught.<br><br>Fourth, his life gave regular and forceful evidence that he practiced what he preached. He was a perfect example, in my view, of one who wanted to be, and knew that he was, a true disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every time anyone was around him, he or she went away determined to be better.<br><br>Many of you who might have studied President McKay's life or ministry in detail would be able to add much more from the public record than I have mentioned. These reflections have been largely confined to my personal experiences and observations.<br><br>Let me add just one more that I'm convinced many of you share. That is the tremendous influence this servant of the Lord has had in so many obvious ways on our current president and prophet, Thomas S. Monson.<br><br>I'm sure President Monson's basic personality, commitment to the Savior, and orientation to service were fairly well established prior to his friendship and association with President McKay. Nevertheless, the impact of this prophet-leader on his younger friend and colleague is unmistakable. In President Monson we see the same tender consideration and feeling for others that President McKay demonstrated. President Monson is always interested in everyone he meets and makes special efforts to cause them to know of his genuine interest and concern.<br><br>President Monson is unfailingly loyal to his friends and associates. This characteristic is seen not only in his relationships with his counselors, the Twelve, and others in his circle but also in his interactions with the leaders of the Church in past years as well as the members of today. Likewise, his friendship and loyalty are not restricted to members of his family or his faith. While never compromising or equivocating on doctrine, principle, or revealed patterns of faith and conduct, he also unfailingly reaches out to those of different faith traditions or those with no faith at all. Certainly he is loved by the Latter-day Saints, but he is also appreciated and honored by those of other churches and backgrounds because of his kindness, generosity, and genuine concern for all people.<br><br>Like President McKay, President Monson has always tried to do not only what he needed to do but also what he felt he should do as one called to represent the Savior. I don't think President McKay was ever a bishop, but President Monson was, and he always cared for the widows, the youth, and his entire flock. After a season of service in that calling he was released, but even to this day he continues to be concerned about, serve, and watch over those for whom he was bishop.<br><br>I am most grateful for the lessons that these two great priesthood leaders have taught and are continuing to teach me. I am grateful that I can bear a solemn but happy witness that these men, and all others who have held this highest office in the Lord's Church, are true servants of our living Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. I know they are in the same calling and position with the same keys and authority of their predecessor Joseph Smith.<br><br>Might we all continue to learn from their examples and teachings and do our best to emulate them is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>g for Your Spiritual Destiny - Neil L. Andersen - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young brothers and sisters, I cannot see all of your faces here in the Marriott Center and, of course, I cannot see your faces in the thousands of chapels across the world, but I can feel of your goodness, your desire to do right, and your love of the Lord and His restored gospel. One of the blessings of being a General Authority is that we have the opportunity of being with you across the world. In the past few months, we have seen your faces and shaken your hands in many locations in the United States. We traveled with President and Sister Uchtdorf last June to Eastern Europe, Russia, and the United Kingdom. In October we were in South Africa and West Africa. In November we returned from Central America. There is a great power of righteousness among the young adults and youth of this Church. Take comfort in knowing that you are joined by thousands and hundreds of thousands in the challenges you face and in the important purposes you feel. I love you and pray that the Spirit of the Lord will be with us as we discuss things that are important to you tonight.<br><br>I have lived in this mortal life three to four decades longer than most of you, but it is not my experience that brings me before you. Realizing my own weaknesses, I stand before you as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, ordained and commissioned to testify of Him and to speak the things He would speak. My assignment tonight comes from the Savior's chief Apostle, President Thomas S. Monson.<br><br>As I look at you, I think of myself 37 years ago. I had just returned from a mission to France. With few resources other than a little borrowed money, I had come to Brigham Young University. I had found work as a window washer on the campus. It would be another year before I would meet the light of my life, Kathy Williams. I felt somewhat alone and unsure about the road ahead. I remember thinking, "What is in my future, and how should I prepare for it?"<br><br>Remembering these thoughts, I have entitled my message tonight "Preparing for Your Spiritual Destiny."<br><br>When Jesus was upon the earth, He would often speak of tangible objects to help His disciples better understand the intangible, the spiritual. He spoke of seeds and grain and barns and hens and flowers and foxes and dozens of other physical objects to help people understand more about faith and repentance, spiritual power and salvation.<br><br>He did not speak of airplanes, as they were not a part of His society, but President Uchtdorf has made up for that in the last few years and has given us wonderful teachings from his own experiences as a pilot.<br><br>I have an airplane story tonight that will teach us about preparing for our spiritual destiny.<br><h2><b>Captain Sullenberger and US Airways Flight 1549</b></h2><br>Exactly one year ago this week--January 15, 2009--US Airways Flight 1549 took off from LaGuardia Airport in New York City and lifted quickly into the sky on what was expected to be an uneventful trip to Charlotte, North Carolina, along the eastern coast of the United States. The airplane captain was Captain Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger. He had more than 19,000 hours of flying behind him, and he expected the next hour and a half would be very routine.<br><br>As the Airbus A320 climbed to 3,000 feet, the unexpected was suddenly right in front of him. A flock of mammoth Canadian geese with six-foot wingspans was directly in the path of the airplane. The large birds hit the plane. Worse still, the giant engines on the two wings, drawing air into their turbines with enormous force, drew in as well the geese in the path of the plane. There was a terrible grinding sound as the birds were sucked into the engines. Then, a deafening silence--the engines had stopped.<br><br>Captain Sullenberger immediately began determining how he could safely land the plane. He first considered returning to the airport, and then to a different airport not far away. The dangers and risks were enormous. He did not know how long he could glide the plane without engine power. He had only a moment to decide. Captain Sullenberger determined his best chance was to land the plane in the Hudson River, a river that runs close to New York City. In those few seconds all his training as an airline captain, all his judgment, his instincts, and his talents were brought to bear on the emergency landing ahead of him.<br><br>With skyscrapers outside the windows, the plane dropped quickly, flying only 900 feet above the George Washington Bridge. Then, with the plane flying as slowly as possible and with the wings perfectly straight across the water, he pulled the nose up and glided the belly of the plane onto the water. The plane, weighing 120 tons, skipped across the water and then safely stopped fully intact.<br><br>Winter weather was well below freezing, and the captain knew the plane would begin sinking. The passengers were quickly assisted out the emergency exits onto the wings. The plane's life rafts were inflated, and boats from the shore moved quickly to rescue the passengers. The news was almost unbelievable. While a $60-million plane had been lost, Captain Sullenberger had landed safely, and all of the 154 passengers and crew were safe, as well as Captain Sullenberger.<br><br>As Jesus did in His teachings, let's relate the tangible with the intangible, the material to the spiritual. Let's discuss three areas where our spiritual destiny--your spiritual destiny--can be seen in the flight of US Airways 1549. First, you are on a journey through mortality. Second, you are to be a captain in the Lord's cause with a specific mission to accomplish. Third, your sacred duty is to return safely and bring many with you.<br><h2><b>Journey Through Mortality</b></h2><br><i>Number 1: You are on a journey through mortality.</i><br><br>The passengers of Flight 1549 did not begin their existence as they entered the plane in New York. They were on a journey. Much had occurred in their lives prior to the flight, and much would occur following the flight. Likewise, this mortal life is not where we began nor is it where we will end. We are on a journey. This journey began a very long time ago in a premortal state where we received our "first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 138:56). We are literally spirit sons and daughters of heavenly parents. The Lord has said, "I am God; I made the world, and men before they were in the flesh" (Moses 6:51), "for in heaven created I them" (Moses 3:5).<br><br>The poet William Wordsworth wrote these beautiful words:<br><br><i>Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:</i><br><i>The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,</i><br><i>Hath had elsewhere its setting,</i><br><i>And cometh from afar:</i><br><i>Not in entire forgetfulness,</i><br><i>And not in utter nakedness,</i><br><i>But trailing clouds of glory do we come</i><br><i>From God, who is our home.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Our premortal life was not a passive existence. We had choices to make there as we do here. We had progressed and were in need of a physical body and the experiences of mortality. We needed to prove our willingness to live by faith. Our Heavenly Father presented a plan to us. Central to that plan was the role of His Only Begotten Son to provide a way back for us. We accepted the Father's plan and rejoiced in the chosen Savior. Our foreordained opportunities and responsibilities help shape what we are to do in mortality. In ways not fully understood, "our actions in the spirit world influence us in mortality."<sup>2</sup><br><br>We are now here--in our long-awaited mortality. Although we have no present memory of our premortal life, it rings true to us. Even in this life we don't remember all the things that are important. For example, do you remember speaking your first words or taking your first steps? Do you remember thinking, "You know, my mother is not carrying me around as much as she used to. So, if I am going to move around like I want to, I better get up and walk"? It is not difficult for us to sense deep inside that who we are did not begin with our birth into mortality. We are sons and daughters of God. There is a passage in Alma that describes the role of the scriptures to "[enlarge] the memory of this people" (Alma 37:8). Our memories have been enlarged, and we know that we prepared for the life we are now living.<br><br>Just as our life began before our birth into mortality, our life does not end with the stopping of a heartbeat. We will continue on. Who you are--you, the distinct individual--you will always be you. Some may say, "I don't like myself." Sorry. You can shape who you become, you can be more than you are today, but you will always be you.<br><h2><b>A Captain in the Lord's Cause</b></h2><br><i>Number 2: You are to be a spiritual captain in the Lord's cause, with a specific mission to accomplish.</i><br><br>You and I have a spiritual destiny, and it does not allow us to ride passively in the back of the plane traveling through mortality. The Lord promised Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (see Genesis 22:18; Abraham 2:9). He was speaking of the spiritual blessing brought to the world through us, whom He referred to as "children of the covenant" (3 Nephi 20:26). Alma described some as "called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God" (Alma 13:3).<br><br>Have you ever wondered: Why is it that I am who I am? Why is it I feel the way I feel? Why have I chosen to believe so fully in the Lord Jesus Christ? Why do I choose to keep His commandments when others do not care about them? Why do I feel the way I do about the Book of Mormon? Why do the words come off the page of scripture and go directly into my heart when others are almost indifferent about this sacred book? Why have I been willing to make sacred covenants through baptism, make covenants in the temple, and--for many of you--serve a mission?<br><br>You were chosen and foreordained to have the gospel in your life and to be a leader in the cause of the restored gospel.<br><br>Captain Sullenberger had more than 19,000 hours of flying at the time of Flight 1549. In reflecting about his decision to become a pilot, he said that at age 16, after less than eight hours of flying in a small single-engine plane, he knew that flying would be a part of his destiny.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Accept that you have an eternally important destiny, a spiritual destiny. Read your patriarchal blessing. As was said of Queen Esther of old, "Thou art come . . . for such a time as this" (Esther 4:14). Believe it, and embrace it!<br><br>Realizing who you are and who you are supposed to be doesn't make you a captain in the Lord's cause. There are obstacles and temptations much more treacherous than a flock of giant Canadian geese that would keep you from your destiny. You must be on guard. To be a captain in the Lord's cause, there needs to be preparation. And that preparation isn't easy! The Savior said, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me" (Matthew 16:24). He further explained that "for a man to take up his cross, [means he] is to deny himself [of] all ungodliness, and every worldly lust, and [to] keep [the Lord's] commandments" (Matthew 16:24, footnote d; from JST, Matthew 16:26).<br><br>In reflecting on his time in training at the Air Force Academy, Captain Sullenberger said:<br><br><i>It was an intense experience. . . . We were being tested, . . . challenged. And we had to watch a number of those in our ranks fall away. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . It made me realize that if I dug deep enough, I could find strength I didn't know I had. If I hadn't been forced to push myself . . . , I would never have known the full extent of what inner resources I had to draw upon.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Spiritual preparation will uncover your own inner resources. There is power in prayer. There is strength in the scriptures. We learn to step forward in faith and to be more fully obedient. Worthily preparing for and taking the sacrament each week renews and protects us. We receive the priceless gift of the Holy Ghost. This heavenly gift is real and absolutely essential to keeping us safe.<br><br>In talking about being an airline captain, Captain Sullenberger warned:<br><br><i>Not every situation can be foreseen or anticipated. There isn't a checklist for everything.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Also:<br><br><i>You have to know what you know and what you don't know. . . .</i><br><br><i>You also need to understand how judgment can be affected by circumstances.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>These same principles apply to our spiritual mission. Personal revelation received through the gift of the Holy Ghost guides us through the unforeseen in accomplishing what we are here to do. And personal righteousness is essential to having the gift of the Holy Ghost. We will not be guided by the Holy Ghost if we are casual about our obedience.<br><br>Central to all that we think and do is the Lord Jesus Christ. His life is our model. It is because of Him that we will live again. It is by the power of His Atonement that we can stand clean in the presence of our Father. We learn to love our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, with all our heart, might, mind, and strength. I like the statement "He loves the Lord with all his heart who loves nothing in comparison of him, and nothing but in reference to him."<sup>7</sup>Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>There are many good people upon the earth. There are many unselfish people. There are others who believe in Christ as we do. We are not alone in praying to our Heavenly Father or in receiving answers to our prayers; our Father loves all of His children. But we must never forget that only in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the priesthood of God. Only here is the Lord's prophet. Only here is the sacred sealing power that allows families to continue as families forever.<br><br>Although this broadcast is being transmitted in 33 languages, we are few in number compared to the billions upon the earth. Peter called us "a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, . . . a peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9). Do not dismiss nor diminish the specific role and responsibility that has been given you. You are to be a captain in the Lord's cause, charged with holding the banner of the restored gospel high, for the Lord has said that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will be "a messenger before [His] face to prepare the way before [Him]" (D&amp;amp;C 45:9).<br><h2><b>Your Sacred Duty</b></h2><br><i>Number 3: Your sacred duty is to return safely and bring many with you.</i><br><br>Much of your spiritual destiny will be etched in the lives of those you help spiritually. What made Captain Sullenberger a hero? What made him respected and appreciated? Was it that he could think quickly? That he made the right choices when the engines stopped? Was it that he knew how to keep the wings perfectly level as he landed in the water? Well, it was all of that! But most important, 154 lives could have easily been lost, and he saved them. And in saving them, he also saved himself.<br><br>Captain Sullenberger said of saving the physical lives of his passengers:<br><br><i>In the abstract, 155 is just a number. But looking into the faces of all of those passengers--and then the faces of all their loved ones--it brought home to me how profoundly wonderful it was that we had such a good outcome on Flight 1549.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Can we apply this to our mission? Members of this Church are enormously generous in helping the poor and needy both in the Church and across the world. However, our divine mission, the blessing the Lord said would come through the posterity of Abraham to the world, is primarily spiritual.<br><br>We are to turn our lives outward, helping others to return to our Heavenly Father with us.<br><br>The Lord has said, "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39). Let me read from Matthew 25, thinking about our role as spiritual captains, inserting the word<i>spiritually:</i><br><br><i>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</i><br><br><i>For I was an hungred</i>[spiritually],<i>and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty</i>[spiritually],<i>and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger</i>[spiritually],<i>and ye took me in. . . .</i><br><br><i>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred</i>[spiritually],<i>and fed thee? or thirsty</i>[spiritually],<i>and gave thee drink? . . .</i><br><br><i>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</i>[Matthew 25:34–35, 37, 40]<br><br>Who are you to bring with you? First of all, for all who have the opportunity, you are to marry and bring your spouse and your family. This is your first responsibility. Families are the organization of heaven.<br><br>To appreciate this responsibility we look far beyond what we see right in front of us. The spiritual effect of raising a righteous family is only understood as we look through our generations to our grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. Captain Sullenberger understood this principle even in saving the physical lives of his passengers. He said:<br><br><i>I don't know the good things still to be accomplished by the 154 people on my flight. I can't fathom what contributions might be made to the world by their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren yet to be born.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Let me share with you the effects of spiritually preparing a family through many generations.<br><br>Henry Arline lived from 1841 to 1919. In 1898, at 57 years old, he heard the missionaries preach the gospel in a schoolhouse in the state of Florida in the United States. He told his wife, "For the first time, I have heard the truth." He and his family were baptized. A few years later they traveled by train to Utah, a trip of more than 2,000 miles, so they could receive the sealing ordinances of the temple. He returned to Florida and remained true and faithful the remainder of his life.<br><br>His daughter was Sophronia Arline Williams, and her son was James Bernard Williams. Bernard Williams met a beautiful young lady, Martha Aman. She honestly investigated the Church, developed a firm testimony, and was baptized.<br><br>Eight years after their marriage, they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple with their three children. Their little daughter was Kathy Williams, whom I met years later at BYU and begged her to be my wife. We now have four children and 13 grandchildren.<br><br>I will forever be thankful for Kathy's righteous mother and her righteous great-grandfather who joined the Church and remained true and faithful all the rest of their lives. These two people never knew each other in mortality. They lived at different times. Yet they are captains in the Lord's cause, helping to bring our family with them because of their spiritual choices.<br><br>It's true that not all will have the opportunity to marry in this life, but an eternal companion is promised in the eternities to the righteous who desire such a blessing. Those who do not marry can do much in piloting the Lord's cause and bringing souls with them. This past conference, Sister Barbara Thompson, who is in the Relief Society general presidency and is single, shared these words:<br><br><i>When I left high school, my goals were to attend college . . . , get married to a handsome man, and have four perfect, beautiful children. . . .</i><br><br><i>Well, as you may know, many of my goals were not realized in the way I had hoped. I finished college, served a mission, got a job, continued on with my schooling . . . , and continued working in my profession for many years. . . . But there was no handsome man, no marriage, and no children. . . .</i><br><br><i>One work colleague who was not a member of our Church said to me, "Why do you continue to go to a church that puts so much emphasis on marriage and families?" My simple answer to her was, "Because it is true!" . . . With the Church and gospel of Jesus Christ in my life, I found happiness and I knew I was on the path the Savior would have me follow.</i><br><br>She spoke of one way she could influence others spiritually while being single:<br><br><i>I had the opportunity to serve many years in Young Women and felt that gave me an opportunity to teach and testify to younger women who were developing their testimonies.</i><sup>10</sup><br><br>Twenty-five years ago Sister Thompson was Shellie Nielson's Laurel adviser. Shellie Nielson--who is now Shellie Nielson Seager--wrote Sister Thompson more than 20 years after being in her Laurel class, expressing her appreciation. Sister Seager wrote:<br><br><i>I woke up at 5:15 a.m. and started thinking about you and what an impact you have had on my life. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . We were a priority to you. You always showed us so much attention, care, and love. You were always so much fun! . . . Most important, we knew you had a strong testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>Sister Seager now has a family with five children. Sister Thompson's influence for good will forever touch Sister Seager and the generations that follow.<br><br>The Lord said:<br><br><i>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people,</i>[and crying repentance simply means helping people return to God]<i>and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!</i><br><br><i>And now, if your joy will be great with one soul . . . , how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!</i>[D&amp;amp;C 18:10, 15–16]<sup>12</sup><br><br>As we turn our attention to others--first our spouse, then our family, and then to others--spiritually lifting them and helping them remain firm and steady, we are saving generations and fulfilling our eternal destiny.<br><br>Luciano Cascardi is president of the So Paulo Brazil Ipiranga Stake. Brother Cascardi was a six-year-old boy when his family was baptized in So Paulo, Brazil. President Cascardi came to the United States this past October looking for the missionary who had taught his family 40 years before. He knew one thing for sure: the first name of the missionary was Elder.<br><br>Through a number of miracles, Brother Cascardi found him--Brother Larry Wilson, a strong Church leader in northern California. In a letter to Brother Wilson, President Cascardi compared finding his missionary with finding a lost father after many years. Then, referring to the spiritual seed that sprouted 40 years ago and has multiplied and touched so many lives since, President Cascardi said, "You can count the seeds in an apple, but you can't count the apples in a seed."<sup>13</sup><br><br>We don't have to be on a mission to strengthen and lift others. President Monson constantly teaches us to reach out and rescue those around us. Do you remember the story of him reaching out as a young bishop to someone who was not attending church?<br><br>President Monson said:<br><br><i>When I was called as a bishop, I recognized I was the president of the priests quorum, and I wanted to get every boy out. There was one boy that never came, and I thought to myself: "I'm sitting here with the priests. They've got an adviser. I'll leave them to get the lesson from the adviser. I'm going to go find Richard Casto." And I went over to his home. His mother and dad were home, and they said he was working over at the West Temple Garage.</i><br><br><i>I went over to Fifth South and West Temple, and the door was open but nobody</i>[was]<i>there. And so I started looking around, you know, and nobody. So I went around the back, and there was one of these old-fashioned grease pits.</i><br><br><i>And I looked down into the darkness, and I could see two eyes looking at me. He said, "You got me, Bishop. I'll come up." And he came up out of the grease pit.</i><br><br><i>And we had a nice little visit there together. And I said, "Richard, we need you. You have a way with people. And I want to have every priest in attendance. Will you come?" He said, "I'll come." And he came.</i><br><br>Years later, Richard Casto shared what happened after that incident:<br><br><i>After that I served a mission. I was sealed to my wife in the temple. We have five great children--two of them have served missions. I've served as a bishop twice. My children have a great love for him, and my wife has a great love for him because of what he did for me. It's probably one of the greatest blessings that I had ever received in my life.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>In the October 2009 general conference, President Monson said:<br><br><i>I believe the Savior is telling us that unless we lose ourselves in service to others, there is little purpose to our own lives. Those who live only for themselves eventually shrivel up and figuratively lose their lives, while those who lose themselves in service to others grow and flourish--and in effect save their lives.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>You are to be a captain in the Lord's cause, with a specific mission to return home safely and bring many with you.<br><h2><b>Endure with a Brightness of Hope</b></h2><br>I close with a personal experience. It too is an airline story.<br><br>This past November 9, my wife, Kathy, and I were traveling back from Guatemala City with a connecting flight in Miami, Florida. We had an important appointment, and it was vital that we catch the plane in Miami. We started early that morning, leaving our hotel outside of Antigua, Guatemala, for an 8:55 a.m. departure to Miami. As we traveled into Guatemala City, the traffic was unusually congested. We were concerned about reaching the airport on time. We arrived with just enough time to catch our plane.<br><br>We rushed through immigration and toward the departure gate. At the gate, we learned that our plane would not be leaving for an hour and a half. It had arrived late the night before in turbulent weather. The pilots and crew were required to have a certain amount of time to rest. With this delay, we worried about making our connection in Miami. We boarded the plane an hour and a half later, but, after backing away from the gate, we learned that there was an electronic malfunction in the cockpit. This delayed us another 40 minutes. We took a deep breath, wondering if there was any possibility of making our connection.<br><br>The plane made good time between Guatemala City and Miami. We arrived in Miami with only 30 minutes before our connecting plane was scheduled to leave. Thirty minutes did not seem long enough, but we were determined to try. We ran as fast as we could. Surprisingly, the line at Immigration was short. We headed for U.S. Customs, silently praying that the luggage we were pulling behind us would not be chosen for inspection. Our prayers were answered. Glancing at the airport monitors, I noted that our airplane was at Gate D-3. After running to the D concourse came the painful process of security screening: Off with the shoes. Liquids in a plastic bag. Laptop separate. Hope that the security monitor doesn't buzz when moving through the screener.<br><br>Completing the security check, we had only 10 minutes before the scheduled departure. I looked up at the monitor again. To my horror, I had made a mistake--the plane was not leaving from D-3 but from E-3. We were in the wrong concourse. We were out of breath. The plane doors were probably already closed, and we were several hundred yards away. We thought about giving up. But, receiving encouragement from each other, we pushed ourselves toward the finish. Off we sprinted, rolling bags right behind. As we rounded the turn to Gate E-3, we heard them call our names. It was a miracle. The door was still open. We made it!<br><br>Your spiritual destiny will have obstacles, delays, and equipment malfunctions. There will be mistakes. You may wonder if you are going to make it. Don't be discouraged! You will also have moments of hope and faith as doors open and obstacles are overcome. Continue, persist, above all, believe in Christ and learn to follow Him and His prophets; endure, as Nephi said, with a "brightness of hope" (2 Nephi 31:20). As you do, I promise you, one day you will hear your name. You will make it.<br><br>Our Heavenly Father lives. We are His sons and His daughters. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. He restored His gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. President Monson is His prophet today. I pray that all the blessings of heaven that await you may be yours as you prepare for your spiritual destiny. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Neil L.

<h1>ht to the Iron Rod - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am so grateful to be here today! You look so wonderful to me--so full of life and promise. I am grateful for the Spirit I feel coming from you. You have come with open minds and open hearts. It is my prayer that we will learn together as the Spirit works within us.<br><br>This morning I would like to talk about our purpose in life--my purpose and your purpose. This is a good time of year to do this, don't you think? We usually pause at the beginning of a new year to take stock of where we are in our lives and where we are going. Then we make determinations about what is really important to us and what we need to do.<br><br>In order to better understand our purpose in life and start this process of self-evaluation, I would like to refer to the account in the Book of Mormon of Lehi's vision of the tree of life. Picture this with me. You will remember that he saw a beautiful tree. The tree bore wonderful fruit. The fruit was white and sweet and desirable to make one happy. He also saw a path, a narrow path, leading to the tree. The path came across a large and spacious field. Along the path was a rod of iron. There was also a river running along the path. And on the other side of the river there was a large and spacious building filled with people dressed in the finery of the world. Occasionally a mist of darkness arose from the river and covered the path. He saw people traveling the path. It appeared that their objective was to reach the tree, but many were distracted or lost. (See 1Nephi 8.)<br><br>Nephi, Lehi's son, desired to understand his father's vision, and so he went to the Lord, asking to know the meaning of it. The Lord answered Nephi's prayer and in so doing not only explained the vision but explained the purpose of our life here on earth as well. (See 1Nephi 11.)<br><br>We learn from Nephi's account that the "tree" or the "tree of life" is actually a representation of Jesus Christ. The pure, white fruit that comes from the tree is more desirable than any other fruit to make mankind happy. The fruit represents the Atonement of the Savior. The straight and narrow path leading to the tree is the path that we must follow to come unto the Savior. It is paved with the covenants and commandments of the Lord. The rod of iron is the word of God. This rod runs directly parallel and uninterrupted along the path and is designed to bring whoever is holding securely to the rod to the tree.<br><br>Other parts of the vision represent the opposition we all experience in this life. The large and spacious field is the world in which we live. We all have to pass through it in order to regain the presence of Heavenly Father and the Savior. The river running closely by the path represents the depths of hell. It is ever present, waiting to claim any who are careless or rebellious. Often this river sends up mists of darkness, which are the temptations of the devil. These mists obscure our vision and make the path seem a little slippery and unsure. On the far side of the river rises a large and spacious building. This too represents the temptations of the devil, because it is the pride of the world. The building, the mocking people inside, and the obvious worldly wealth all beckon to the natural man within each of us.<br><br>In the vision Lehi reaches the tree and partakes of the wonderful fruit. Then, more than anything, he wants his family and others to come and partake of it as well. He wants them to find the joy that he has experienced. He wants them to come to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. So he beckons to them to enter into the way and follow the path. Some pay no heed, thinking they know a better way. They are lost in the large field. Others start on the path and then get lost in the mist of darkness, falling into the river. Others grasp the rod of iron and carefully follow it through all the distractions and make it to the tree. They partake of the fruit but then lose faith--heeding the call of the world and wandering off to the great and spacious building. But there are others who take hold of the rod and diligently and faithfully follow it along until they reach the tree and partake of the fruit. They experience the joy and the blessings of partaking of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and they never look back.<br><br>This vision represents the love of God for us. It is Heavenly Father's plan for us to come to this earth; gain our bodies; prove ourselves by accepting the gospel and living righteously; and then, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, return to Him. Again, the vision is a representation of His love for us. It is a representation of Heavenly Father's and Jesus Christ's love for us. It also gives us awonderful and clear purpose to our lives.<br><br>Now these images that I have suggested to you today may seem very common. You have heard about them since you were in Primary. But they are basic. They are essential for us not only to know but to understand. We must clearly understand what they mean for us--how important they are to us and where we need to go with this understanding. May I also suggest that this understanding is very individual. Not one of us will get to heaven on someone else's coattail. Each must have their own knowledge and their own testimony and make their own application of these truths. In addition, each of us is at a different place in our lives. We are where we are as a direct result of our own actions and choices and the actions taken upon us. But the bottom line is that we are where we are. That means that from today on we each have our own starting place along the path. In addition, we each will experience our own distractions and "mists of darkness." Satan knows us, and he wants us. He will do everything in his power to divert us from our goal. He wants to destroy our purpose.<br><br>In order to help us really understand where we are in relationship to the purpose our Heavenly Father has laid out for us, let's take a few minutes to consider some questions. Each of us must answer these questions for ourselves, and then we will know how we need to adjust our lives. I invite you to write down the thoughts that come into your mind, because that will be personal revelation coming through the Spirit just for you.<br><br>The first question: Where am I along the path that leads to the Savior? Am I even on it? Do I have both feet firmly planted, or is one foot on and one foot off? Elder Maxwell described it this way: that some people know they should have their primary residence in Zion, but they still hope to keep their summer cottage in Babylon (see Larry W. Gibbons, "Wherefore, Settle This in Your Hearts,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2006, 102; see also Neal A. Maxwell,<i>A Wonderful Flood of Light</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1990], 47). Now remember, the path consists of making and keeping covenants. It includes the ordinances of the gospel and faithfully keeping the commandments. There are no shortcuts, no easy routes. We all must just place one foot in front of the other over and over again until we have traveled the whole distance. Being born into this world is one of the greatest blessings we have ever been given. In fact, it is absolutely necessary to our continued progression. But being in this world is also our greatest danger. There is only one way to make it through. That is to stay on this straight and narrow path.<br><br>Chances are that you have made quite a lot of progress along the path at this point in your lives. You have most likely been baptized. Most of you young men have received the priesthood. You may have served missions. Many of you have been endowed in the temple and many have been married there for time and all eternity. So you have made the covenants. Making them is the first step. Now, how well are you keeping them? Just remember, taking the first step is not of much value without the second: keeping our covenants.<br><br>For example, are you as worthy to renew your covenants of baptism as you partake of the sacrament each week as you were to be baptized in the first place? Are you as worthy to hold and use the priesthood as you were when you received it? This is where the iron rod comes in handy. It keeps us on the path. Because the iron rod is the word of God, it helps strengthen us to stay true to the covenants we have made. It helps us set righteous patterns, and keeping the commandments is easier if we have these righteous patterns of behavior. I am talking about the simple things: morning and evening prayer, reading our scriptures, fasting, attending the temple, going to all of our church meetings faithfully, keeping the Sabbath day holy, honoring our parents, having honesty and integrity, and being modest and chaste--all righteous patterns. If we stay true--being responsible, working hard, and repenting--these righteous patterns become a way of life.<br><br>By suggesting that these patterns of righteous living are simple, I am not necessarily suggesting that they are easy. It is a continual process of trying, stumbling a little, picking ourselves up, making corrections in our lives, and trying again. Coming to the Savior requires continual coming.<br><br>Here is the next question I would like each of us to ask: What are my mists of darkness?<br><br>Satan knows each of us well. He knows each of our strengths and he knows our weaknesses. Satan knows how to press our mortal buttons. And believe me, he is doing it at every opportunity. The way he tries to get me may be different from the way he tries to get you. But he is very good at finding our weak spots and hitting hard. What is it for you? Maybe it is discouragement or self-doubt. Maybe it is laziness. Or it could be influencing you to let a healthy curiosity lead you to doubting your own convictions. Maybe the mist is procrastination. Or it could be anger. It could be allowing Satan to gain power over you through horrible addictions to substances or pornography.<br><br>Satan also uses the voices from the "great and spacious building" to try and distract us from our chosen course. What voices do you hear calling to you? Is it pride or a love of worldly things and worldly pleasures? Is it encouragement to compromise your standards "because everyone is doing it" or is it that "no one will know"? Or is it a voice telling you that you can do something wrong today and still get blessings by repenting tomorrow. Do you ever hear a little voice in your head saying, "It's no big deal"? These are most certainly voices that come from the world. They are voices that want to make us act beneath ourselves. They are voices that come at us incessantly, ever trying to pull us off course. Think about what your mists are. What are the voices of the world that seem to be the hardest for you to ignore? Identifying them will help you to recognize when Satan is attempting to influence you. And be assured, you do not have to battle him alone. You have a better voice to listen to. It comes as a gift from Heavenly Father. It is the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is not a loud voice, but it will pierce your very soul if you let it. It will tell you all things you should do. It will help you discern between the voices of the world and the voices of righteousness in your lives. It will help you clearly see through the mists of darkness. Live worthy to always have the Holy Ghost with you. He will help you hang onto that rod of iron.<br><br>This leads us to the next question: How tight is my grip on the iron rod? We already know that the iron rod is the word of God. We find the word of God in the scriptures, and we hear it from our latter-day prophets. We also know that it is by holding onto that word of God--or the rod of iron--that we are able to withstand the temptations of Satan and stay on the path that leads to the Savior and to eternal life.<br><br>Now this is all pretty important, and so is this question: How tight is my grip?<br><br>This is not just a casual, run-my-hand-along-it-to-keep-my-balance kind of thing. We have to hang on as though our lives depended on it, because in fact our eternal lives do. We may begin the process of holding to the rod at a very young age when, hopefully, our hands are placed there by those who love us. But in reality we begin whenever we begin to make decisions for ourselves. We begin as we learn the truths of the gospel and begin to feel the stirrings of the Spirit witnessing to us. We continue as we learn and grow, as we make covenants of baptism, receive the priesthood, receive our endowment, and marry in the temple. We do these things as we make sure that the words of the Lord--the scriptures and the words of the prophets and the whisperings of the Spirit--have a greater place in our lives than any other influence. And then we can be safe. We just have to hang onto that rod, literally--because if we ever let go, thinking, "I'm not very far away, it's just right over there," we might find that we are on a very slippery slope or someone may be hanging onto our ankles or we might be too tired or too weak. We might be farther away than we realize. No, we cannot grasp it casually. We have to hold tight--determined to never let go.<br><br>Let me show you a picture of the hand of my 93-year-old mother. She never let go of the rod. Just a few weeks before she passed away--when she was unable to stand or walk or really do anything for herself--her one desire was to have the bishop come to her bedside so that she could renew her temple recommend because hers had expired. She received that recommend. You can see that her hand naturally curved around the rod. It had grown that way over many years of practice. Ihope that one day my hand will look just like hers. And I believe that we can actually get to the point that we no longer grasp the rod out to the side. Instead, that rod of iron will run right through us, keeping us upright--strong and safely secured.<br><br>This next question has everything to do with how well we stay connected to the rod and the path. This is it: How do I feel about being strictly obedient? If our purpose in life is to stay on the path that leads us back to the Savior and ultimately back to our Father, then we are going to have to come to terms with the principle of obedience.<br><br>First we must understand that Heavenly Father did not give us the commandments in order to control us. He gave them to us so that we might remain free from the bondage of Satan. Every commandment is designed to bring us happiness and the blessings of heaven. We can see that over and over again as we read the scriptures. Whenever Heavenly Father gives us a commandment in the scriptures, there is always a promised blessing. For example, in Mosiah 5:15 we read:<br><br><i>I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life.</i><br><br>Here is the commandment: Be steadfast and immovable in good works.<br><br>Here is the promise: The Lord will seal you His, bring you to heaven, and give you salvation and eternal life.<br><br>Heavenly Father will bless us as we are obedient to His commandments. I know that this is true. So what it comes down to is whether or not we will give ourselves over to Him and be obedient. It is our choice. President Ezra Taft Benson said, "When obedience ceases to be an irritant and becomes our quest, in that moment God will endow us with power" (quoted in Donald L. Staheli, "Obedience--Life's Great Challenge,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1998, 82).<br><br>Brothers and sisters, let us learn to love obedience and its rewards.<br><br>Our next question is important because it is directed at helping us do these things: How can I strengthen my ability to "hold to the rod"? We have to somehow take what we know in our heads, sink it deep in our hearts, and then express it through our actions. It takes a lot of faith to do this. It takes faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We have to really know in our hearts that He is the redeemer of the world. We have to know that to come to Him is the goal and purpose of our lives. We have to know that He lives. We have to know these things way down, deep in our hearts.<br><br>Then we have to have hope. Now, hope is trusting that all that Jesus Christ did for the world applies to each of us individually. Or, in other words, that it will work for me. We have to trust that He knows us, that He loves us, that He will help us, and that His Atonement was made for us individually. Hope also means that we have to believe that we are worth it. It means that we understand that we each have great value because we exist--we are our Heavenly Father's children. We can disappoint our Heavenly Father and the Savior, and we are held accountable for our actions, but They still love us. It is as simple as that. And because of that love, we can trust that the Atonement will work for us. That is what it means to have hope: hope that we can start where we are, repent if we need to, and get back on the path that leads to the Savior. We have to have hope that we can make it.<br><br>Faith and hope give us strength. They give us the power and confidence to keep on going--to keep holding on--even when things get hard. You know, everyone's life is hard. Some days are harder than others, but life is hard. It was meant to be that way so that we would have to rely on the Lord. It was designed to make us strong and determined.<br><br>When we have faith and hope, we can hold fast to the rod, and if we find that we have become distracted or have lost our grip, we can repent and grasp it again. The iron rod, the word of God, the pathway back to the Savior, will never move. We may move, but we can know that we can always return because it will always be there for us--the Savior will always be there for us. And then if our faith and hope are genuine, we cannot keep them contained. We cannot keep them to ourselves. We reach out to others with the same love we are receiving from the Father and the Son. The expression of our faith and hope, then, becomes charity.<br><br>And all of this--faith, hope, and charity--is what brings joy into our lives. It is what gives us the strength to stay on the path, to stay connected to the iron rod. And the journey back to our Father, back to the Savior, Jesus Christ, becomes joyful. Learning about what Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ want us to do, working hard to hold to the rod, making and keeping covenants, faithfully living righteous lives, facing hard times as trials come, serving others, repenting for our mistakes, and feeling ourselves draw ever nearer to the Lord--these all can become joyful. All of these things are fruits of the living tree. They are the blessings of the Atonement offered to us from the Father through the Son. And the ultimate blessing is eternal life and exaltation--living with our Heavenly Father forever. We each have to reach this place individually. We all hope to have a companion by our side who is making the same journey with the same destination in mind. But we each have to make it.<br><br>The last--and possibly most important--question is this: Will I do it? Am I willing to do all that is necessary to return to Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father? We have our agency. We decide whether or not we will hold fast to the iron rod and stay on the path that leads back to the Savior. But we must remember that ultimately we will all be brought to kneel before the Savior. At that point He will be our judge as well as our Savior. If we have been faithful in this life, we will be blessed. But he has also told us that if we are not faithful and obedient, we will have<br><br><i>to enjoy that which</i>[we]<i>are willing to receive, because</i>[we]<i>were not willing to enjoy that which</i>[we]<i>might have received.</i><br><br>Then the Lord goes on to say:<br><br><i>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:32–33]<br><br>When we kneel before the Savior, will we kneel in fear and sorrow and regret because we did not live to receive His greatest blessings? Or will we kneel before Him with great joy and gratitude in our hearts? Will we accept of His great love and look forward with great anticipation? The gift has been given. It lies before us. Will we receive it?<br><br>What is required of us might seem overwhelming to many of us. It may look too hard to do--at least consistently. But we can do hard things. And when we do, we find that they become delightful to us, and what once was hard becomes easier in the doing. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ want us to succeed. They will help us every inch of the way. Through the Spirit, They will lead us along. They will strengthen us. Jesus Christ will be our advocate with the Father. And after all we can do, He will make up the difference. Don't be discouraged if you have made mistakes. The Atonement was made for us because the Lord knew that we would need it. We all would need it! He wants us to use it to repent, to find comfort, to reach peace, to be strengthened.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, the plan has been laid out clearly for us. The Savior has trod the very path He asks us to follow. He stands before us beckoning us to come to Him. And I know that we can do it! He truly lives. He loves us. He is our Savior and Redeemer. Hold tight to that rod of iron! Be true to everything that you are and everything you can become. It is so worth it. It will bring you joy and happiness now and forever. It will bring you full circle back to Him. I know that this is true! In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cheryl C.

<h1>ce and Forgiveness in Marriage - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
When couples get married, their love is deep, and they joyfully anticipate the prospect of spending the eternities together. They enjoy having endless talks, going for long walks, and spending time together. It is a wonderful feeling being with someone you love so deeply.<br><br>Unfortunately, for many couples the bliss of deep love and immensely satisfying companionship that was present when they first got married doesn't last. Long talks become replaced with frequent arguments, and when not spent fighting, their time together is characterized by angry silence.<br><br>Many of these couples divorce. Others manage the hostility by emotionally withdrawing from the relationship. The spouses become distant from each other, and they keep their interaction to a minimum. President Spencer W. Kimball described these couples when he said:<br><br><i>There are many people who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end their marriages, but who have permitted their marriage to grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouses who . . . are in the low state of mere joint occupancy of the home.</i>[In<i>Marriage</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 44–46; adapted from Kimball, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/spencer-w-kimball_marriage-divorce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marriage and Divorce</a>," BYU devotional address, 7September 1976]<br><br>How do these couples go from ecstatic levels of love and happiness to frequent conflict, bitterness, and, in many cases, eventual divorce?<br><br>A number of reasons have been identified by researchers, but lately I've been thinking that most of these reasons can be boiled down to two fundamental factors: a lack of repentance and a lack of forgiveness.<br><br>It is important to note that these principles of repentance and forgiveness apply to all relationships, not just to marriage. They apply to roommates, family members, and colleagues at work. So, no matter what one's marital status is or what the prospects in the near future are, these principles are important to all of us.<br><br>In most cases we are married for only a short time before we hurt our spouse's feelings. Whether it is intentional, based on selfishness, or just inadvertent mistakes, we all end up doing things that create hurt in our spouse.<br><br>The remedy is pretty straightforward. We say, "I'm sorry." We feel badly that we hurt our spouse, apologize, learn from the experience, and do our best not to make the same mistake again. We repent, and, assuming that the problem wasn't too major, the issue is over.<br><br>Elder Joe J. Christensen said:<br><br><i>To develop a solid marriage, we must be able to admit we are sorry for the mistakes we make. . . . When conflicts in marriage arise, we should be swift to apologize and ask for forgiveness, even though we may not be totally at fault. True love is developed by those who are willing to readily admit personal mistakes and offenses.</i>[<i>One Step at a Time: Building a Better Marriage, Family, and You</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996), 39]<br><br>In order to be effective, an apology must be sincere and heartfelt. There needs to be evidence that you are truly sorry and that you are remorseful that you have hurt or offended your spouse. A flippant "sorry" rarely helps heal hurt feelings. In addition, a sincere apology includes taking responsibility for your mistake or offense. Too many apologies are poorly masked attempts to shift the responsibility for the problem to your spouse. "I'm sorry that you took my comments the wrong way" or the classic "I'm sorry that you can't take a simple joke" are not really apologies. Instead, they are clumsy ways of manipulating the situation in order to place the blame on your spouse.<br><br>Making excuses for mistakes is another good way to avoid taking responsibility. Even though the excuse may be valid, including it as part of your apology undermines your sincerity. Saying "I'm really sorry that I snapped at you this morning, but I didn't get much sleep last night" doesn't work very well because you are passing responsibility for your poor behavior to a lack of sleep. Just apologize. If you want to provide some justification for your subpar behavior, do it later, after the hurt feelings have been smoothed over.<br><br>I have found that effective apologies<i></i>usually come in complete sentences. A simple "sorry" or the far more eloquent "sorry about that" rarely provides the necessary evidence that you feel remorseful and that you are taking appropriate responsibility for your actions. Even the current fad of saying "my bad" (with the dutiful patting of your chest) is usually inadequate--unless, I guess, you are in the middle of a coed intramural basketball game. It is much more healing to say: "I'm sorry that I didn't do the dishes last night like I agreed to. It wasn't right, and I apologize"--two full and complete sentences. A full and complete apology that comes packaged in complete sentences will do wonders in healing hurts.<br><br>Sometimes it is necessary to apologize more than once. When an offense is especially hurtful, one apology usually isn't enough. It is so healing for the offended spouse to hear sometime after the initial apology, "I've been thinking about it, and I realize that I really blew it. Please accept my apology." When working with couples who are dealing with a difficult issue, I have heard countless people say to me, "I have already apologized. Why doesn't my spouse just get over it?" I explain to them that it sometimes takes several apologies before the sincerity of the apology sinks into the wounded heart of an offended spouse.<br><br>Besides a sincere apology, repentance includes striving to forsake our shortcomings and weaknesses. We strive to keep our promises to do the dishes. We focus on not being grumpy and not snapping at our spouse. We endeavor to become better listeners and less judgmental. As we continually repent, we constantly try to improve ourselves. We strive to overcome our weaknesses and develop more Christlike qualities. By doing so, we become a better person and a better spouse.<br><br>In my experience, there are two things that often stand in the way of saying "I'm sorry" and repenting. The first thing is that we sometimes don't know that we have done something hurtful or offensive to our spouse. It is hard to apologize when we don't know that we actually did something wrong.<br><br>A number of years ago I did marital therapy with a couple who had been married about 10 years. Over the years she had built up resentment in the relationship because of hurts and perceived injustices that she had experienced in their marriage. She was fed up with the relationship and was seriously considering getting a divorce. The husband still loved his wife and wanted the relationship to work, but her level of resentment toward him had risen to the point that she didn't feel any love for him.<br><br>She had a whole list of grievances. I thought the first one that she gave was especially interesting. When she was having their oldest child, she was in the final stage of labor. It had been a long, difficult labor, and she was physically and emotionally exhausted. While she was putting every ounce of strength that she had left toward giving birth, her husband said, "Will you please hurry up and have the baby? The football game is on TV today, and it is going to start in a few minutes." Shortly thereafter the baby was born (hopefully before the game started!). In all of the excitement of holding their new baby and becoming new parents, his unkind words were seemingly forgotten. Nothing was said, and they moved on with life. But<i>she</i>remembered what he had said, andhis words festered in her for nearly 10 years. She grew more and more resentful over his incredibly insensitive and selfish statement, and it was the cornerstone of the emotional wall that she had built between herself and herhusband.<br><br>The interesting thing, though, was that he had no idea that what had happened during the birth of their first child many years earlier was a problem. He was surprised when she presented it at the top of her list of grievances; he could barely even remember that it happened. When she brought it up during our therapy session--and it was obvious that she was deeply hurt by what he had said--he quickly apologized. He was a little more mature now, and he realized that he had said a very insensitive, selfish thing to his wife. His apology was sincere; it even had complete sentences. But it was too late. Her wall of resentment had reached the point where she didn't want to try anymore in their relationship. After another therapy session or two, she made the final decision to get a divorce.<br><br>I have often wondered what might have happened in their marriage if the wife had overtly dealt with the incident soon after the baby was born and given her husband the opportunity to apologize and make it right.<br><br>The Savior clearly taught how we are to respond when our spouse offends us:<br><br><i>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</i>[Matthew 18:15]<br><br>When our spouse does something that hurts our feelings, we need to let him or her know inorder to give them the opportunity to apologize and repent. That doesn't mean that we point out every tiny weakness and mistake; to do so would violate the fundamental requirement in marriage to nurture and lift each other. But if we find that something that our partner said or did creates negative feelings that start festering and won't go away, then it is important that we speak with our spouse and then letthem know that they did something that was hurtful.<br><br>The second major obstacle to repenting of our sins and mistakes in marriage is pride. Apologizing and repenting requires us to look inward, be humble, and take responsibility for our mistakes and weaknesses. Pride is the antithesis of these virtues.<br><br>In his great talk on pride in 1989, President Ezra Taft Benson taught:<br><br><i>Selfishness is one of the more common faces of pride. "How everything affects me" is the center of all that matters--self-conceit, self-pity, worldly self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking. . . .</i><br><br><i>The proud do not receive counsel or correction easily. . . . Defensiveness is used by them to justify and rationalize their frailties and failures. . . .</i><br><br><i>Think of the repentance that could take place with lives changed, marriages preserved, and homes strengthened, if pride did not keep us from confessing our sins and forsaking them. . . .</i><br><br><i>The antidote for pride is humility--meekness, submissiveness. . . . It is the broken heart and contrite spirit. . . .</i><br><br><i>We can choose to humble ourselves by receiving counsel and chastisement. . . .</i><br><br><i>We can choose to humble ourselves by confessing and forsaking our sins and being born of God. . . .</i><br><br><i>Let us choose to be humble.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beware of Pride</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, 6–7]<br><br>The essence of repentance is trying to change<i>ourselves</i>in ways that will make us better people. On the other hand, the foundation of pride is the desire to cover up our own weaknesses and focus on changing<i>our partner's</i>behavior and weaknesses. May we follow President Benson's prophetic counsel to humble ourselves so that we are willing to look inward and learn to recognize our faults and shortcomings. As we become humble, we will desire to improve our lives and take responsibility for our weaknesses. We will be willing to apologize and to strive to become better people, which is at the core of repentance.<br><br>In order for a marriage to be successful, there needs to be more than repentance; there also needs to be forgiveness. These two gospel principles are complementary, and both are necessary in order to progress spiritually. Similar to other gospel principles--like faith and works and justice and mercy--repentance and forgiveness are most effective when they are understood and practiced together.<br><br>President Gordon B. Hinckley said:<br><br><i>I recall listening at length to a couple who sat across the desk from me. There was bitterness between them. I know that at one time their love was deep and true. But each had developed a habit of speaking of the faults of the other. Unwilling to forgive the kind of mistakes we all make, and unwilling to forget them and live above them with forbearance, they had carped at one another until the love they once knew had been smothered. . . . I am satisfied that had there been even a small measure of repentance and forgiveness, they would still be together, enjoying the companionship that had so richly blessed their earlier years.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/06/of-you-it-is-required-to-forgive?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of You It Is Required to Forgive</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>June 1991, 4]<br><br>I am convinced that resentment is one of the most lethal poisons in marriage. Resentment doesn't ruin a marriage overnight; rather, it is like tooth decay that gradually and silently damages your teeth. Forgetting to brush your teeth one time doesn't ruin your teeth, just as eating one candy bar does not lead you to a life of wearing dentures; however, with numerous instances of neglect over many months and years, tooth decay, if not properly treated, will destroy your teeth. Likewise, resentment gradually accumulates, often without us even noticing it. If left untreated, resentment builds up over a number of years to the point where it destroys love.<br><br>Just as repentance washes away our sins and weaknesses, forgiveness washes away the hurts and emotional injuries that are inherent in being married to someone who is imperfect. Forgiveness is the perfect antidote for the poison of resentment. Forgiveness completely neutralizes resentment and makes room in our heart for feelings of love to flourish and grow.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer taught:<br><br><i>All of us carry excess baggage around from time to time, but the wisest ones among us don't carry it for very long. They get rid of it. . . .</i><br><br><i>Often . . . the things we carry are petty, even stupid. If you are still upset after all these years because Aunt Clara didn't come to your wedding reception, why don't you grow up? Forget it. . . .</i><br><br><i>If the bishop didn't call you right--or release you right--forget it.</i><br><br><i>If you resent someone for something he has done--or failed to do--forget it.</i><br><br><i>We call that forgiveness. It is powerful, spiritual medicine.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/new-era/1979/08/the-balm-of-gilead?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Balm of Gilead</a>,"<i>New Era,</i>August 1979, 39]<br><br>Relating his comments specifically to marriage, we might echo his statement by saying: If you are still upset after all of these months because your spouse didn't take you to your favorite restaurant on your birthday, forget it. If your spouse continually doesn't load the dishwasher correctly despite your best instructional techniques, leave it alone and move on. If your spouse spent the entire evening at his or her mission reunion speaking a language that you don't understand, get over it. As President Packer said, "We call that forgiveness." Our marital relationship is too important for us to clutter our minds and hearts with resentment that is created by dwelling on the faults and weaknesses of our spouse. We need to forgive and move on.<br><br>What do we do when we simply can't forgive, forget, and move on? There are some offenses, because of their seriousness, that are difficult to get over. There are some hurts that run deep--very deep. Sometimes a spouse has a difficult time forgiving something that others might consider trivial. In other cases, aspouse realizes that their level of resentment has reached such an overwhelming point that they simply can't forget it and move on. In all of these situations, the person comes to realize that they can't forgive on their own: they need help.<br><br>In these cases we need to rely on the healing power of the Atonement. If we carefully read in the scriptures about the Atonement, we learn that the Atonement heals much more than the wounds of those who have sinned.<br><br>The great prophet Isaiah wrote:<br><br><i>Surely he hath borne our</i>griefs,<i>and carried our</i>sorrows:<i>yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</i><br><br><i>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</i>[Isaiah 53:4–5; emphasis added]<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Alma taught:<br><br><i>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the</i>pains<i>and the sicknesses of his people.</i>[Alma 7:11; emphasis added]<br><br>In modern times, Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Since not all human sorrow and pain is connected to sin, the full intensiveness of the Atonement involved bearing our pains, infirmities, and sicknesses, as well as our sins.</i>[<i>"Not My Will, But Thine"</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1988), 51]<br><br>Thus the healing power of the Atonement extends beyond those who repent; it also heals those who sorrow, grieve, and are in pain. Certainly that includes those who sorrow and grieve because they have been wronged and hurt by the selfishness of their spouse. During the process of the Atonement, the Savior took upon Him all of the pain, sorrow, and grief that we will experience in this life. Because of His atoning sacrifice, He shoulders the pain that we experience, which gives us the ability to overcome these hurts and enables us to heal. Consequently, through the Atonement He lifts from us sorrow and pain, which then gives us the capacity to forgive our spouse when he or she has seriously offended us.<br><br>President James E. Faust eloquently said:<br><br><i>Our Redeemer took upon Himself all the sins, pains, infirmities, and sicknesses of all who have ever lived and will ever live.</i>[See Alma 7:11–12.]<i>No one has ever suffered in any degree what He did. He knows our mortal trials by firsthand experience.. . .</i><br><br><i>The Atonement not only benefits the sinner butalso benefits those sinned against--that is, the victims. By forgiving "those who trespass against us" (JST, Matt. 6:13) the Atonement brings a measure of peace and comfort to those who have been innocently victimized by the sins of others. The basic source for the healing of the soul is the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2001/10/the-atonement-our-greatest-hope?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Atonement: Our Greatest Hope</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2001, 19–20]<br><br>A few years ago I had the wonderful opportunity of serving as the bishop of a BYU married student ward. It was a marvelous experience being able to associate with hundreds of wonderful couples. As I was getting close to being released, my stake president asked me a question that he asked all of the bishops at the end of their service.<br><br>He asked me, "What is the most important thing that you learned while you were a bishop?"<br><br>I quickly responded, "The incredible healing power of the Atonement."<br><br>I had fine young people come into my office in the depths of despair because they had done things that had greatly offended their spouses as well as God. As part of our conversation they would often ask, "Bishop, how can I ever be forgiven for what I have done? How can I ever make it right with God and with my spouse?" We would then talk about the Atonement and its ability to cleanse each of us from sin if we sincerely repent.<br><br>I had wonderful people come into my office devastated because they had been terribly hurt by the actions of their spouse. Through their tears they would ask, "Bishop, how can I ever forgive my husband (or my wife)?" We would then talk about the Atonement and its ability to heal broken hearts and to give us the ability toforgive.<br><br>I had couples come into my office who were bitter toward each other. In just a few short years the interactions between them had deteriorated to the point where they were characterized by power struggles, bickering, angry accusations, and fighting. They felt hopeless that their relationship would ever improve. They would ask, "Bishop, is there any possibility that our marriage can be fixed?" We would then talk about the Atonement and the hope and healing that it brings to spouses who sincerely repent and who strive to forgive eachother.<br><br>I saw miracles while I was a bishop. I saw individuals repent of their sins and earn back the favor of God and the trust of their spouse. I saw brokenhearted spouses find peace and the ability to forgive. I saw couples who were on the verge of divorce turn from destructive patterns of constant fighting to humbling themselves, looking inward, taking responsibility, apologizing for mistakes, and striving to forgive each other. Every one of these miracles was made possible by the healing power of the Atonement.<br><br>May we be willing to take responsibility for our own sins and weaknesses that create stress and hurt in our marriages. May we use the healing power of the Atonement to overcome our sins, imperfections, and weaknesses. May we use the power of the Atonement to heal our hurts and sorrows so that we can fully forgive.<br><br>I testify that the Atonement not only heals broken souls, it also heals broken hearts. I also testify that the Atonement heals broken relationships. I testify that the Atonement brings hope to each of us and our marriages. I testify that as we are quick to repent and quick to forgive, our lives and our marriages will be blessed throughout the eternities. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard B.

<br>
On November 10, 1882, a young woman named Sarah Jane Carter married Alma Porter, a widower of 10 years. Sarah Jane was almost 18 years of age, and Alma was almost 48. To Sarah Jane and Alma were born 10 children. Their last child and eighth daughter was my grandmother. My grandmother was just five months old when her father died, leaving Sarah Jane a widow at age 38. In addition to losing her husband, four of Sarah Jane's daughters died at a young age.<br><br>Sarah Jane worked hard to provide for her family. Her only source of income was from what they produced on a small farm. From the cow's milk she made butter to sell at the local butcher shop. With that money Sarah Jane could buy the items the family needed that they could not supply themselves. She also sold apples and raspberries for money to pay the taxes on the farm.<br><br>In my living room hangs a large oval frame with a picture of Sarah Jane. On days when I think my life is hard, I think of her. I think of her challenges. I believe it was Sarah Jane's faith in the Lord and belief that He would strengthen her that helped her through what I imagine were very difficult and lonely days. My grandmother wrote this about Sarah Jane:<br><br><i>I can never remember sitting down for breakfast but what we knelt down and had a family prayer. It was a must at our home. You all know the slogan today, "the family that prays together stays together." Mother knew she needed lots of help to keep her family close to her and our Heavenly Father was her best source of strength.</i><br><br>Difficulties in life serve at least two purposes: they help us come to the Lord and rely on His strength, and they also help refine us. The process of refining gold and silver requires the elements to be exposed to very high temperatures. This removes the impurities and results in a final product that is much stronger. In life, the trials, challenges, heartaches, disappointments, and so forth, like the ones experienced by my great-grandmother, are part of the mortal refinement process.<br><br>As painful and difficult as these experiences may be, if endured well, they will lead to our growth and development. As Job said of his trials, "When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."<sup>1</sup>Elder Dallin H. Oaks stated: "Through the justice and mercy of a loving Father in Heaven, the refinement and sanctification possible through such experiences can help us achieve what God desires us to become."<sup>2</sup><br><br>Of course talking about enduring is somewhat easier than actually doing it. At times we may become discouraged and feel like giving up. We may relate to the feelings of Mrs. Linforth, a pioneer immigrant stranded on the Wyoming plains. In 1856 converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints went west pulling handcarts. Most handcart companies were successful. The Willie and Martin Handcart Companies started late in the year. By the time they reached Wyoming, food and other provisions had run low, winter snowstorms had arrived early, and, as a result, hundreds were dying from starvation, exposure, exhaustion, and dysentery.<br><br>The handcarts and wagons left most of their belongings at Devil's Gate and started toward the Salt Lake Valley. Later that day Mrs. Linforth was found sitting by the side of the road dressed "elegantly" and crying. When asked what the matter was, sobbing shereplied:<br><br><i>This is too much for me. I have always had plenty, and have never known hardships; we had a good team and wagon; my husband, if let alone, could have taken me on in comfort. Now I am turned out to walk in this wind and snow. I am determined not to go on but will stay here and die. My husband has gone on and left me, but I will not go another step.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>To endure well and not give up amidst the challenges in our journey will require us to have strength beyond our own. We cannot do it alone, but with the Lord's help our success is assured. As the Psalmist wrote, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all."<sup>4</sup><br><br>A central message found in the Book of Mormon is that of deliverance--specifically, the Lord's power to deliver His people. As Alma promised:<br><br><i>I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>One story of deliverance is found in Alma 2. The Nephites were experiencing a tremendous period of prosperity and peace. Then one day a man by the name of Amlici decided that he wanted to be king and convinced people to follow him. Once Amlici became king he started a war with the Nephites. During the first day of the war, more than 12,000 Amlicites were killed, as well as more than 6,000 Nephites. The Nephites decided to rest, and they pitched their tents in the valley of Gideon. Alma sent spies to check on the Amlicites. The report came back that the Lamanites had joined forces with the Amlicites and were attacking the people north of Zarahemla. If Alma and his army did not return to Zarahemla, the Amlicites would certainly overtake the city. They packed up camp and began to cross the river. As they did so, they were attacked by the Amlicites and Lamanites, who Mormon recorded were "as numerous . . . as the sands of the sea."<sup>6</sup>Mormon then related (and this is the key point):<br><br><i>Nevertheless, the Nephites</i>being strengthened by the hand of the Lord,<i>having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>In our life it may seem that the opposition is "as numerous . . . as the sands of the sea." We may be encumbered by spiritual bondage and sin, discouragement, disappointment, and weaknesses that hinder our progression or with responsibilities and burdens that are beyond our own ability to manage. On my bedroom wall hangs a painting of a single woman pulling a handcart across a snowy plain. Sometimes I feel like I am that woman--I'm steadily climbing the hills of life, and at times it feels like I am doing it alone. Yet I know God is mindful of me as an individual and is watching over me. Just as the Nephites were strengthened by the hand of the Lord and delivered from their enemies, I, and you, will receive similar strength to pull our loads.<br><br>Last fall I received the invitation to speak at the devotional today. I pondered, prayed, and selected the topic "Strengthened by the Hand of the Lord." A few weeks later I met with my bishop, and he extended a call for me to serve as the ward Relief Society president. I knew immediately that I would have personal experience with being strengthened by the hand of the Lord. Today I share with you what I have learned from that experience and many others by offering four suggestions that can help us be qualified to be strengthened by the hand of theLord.<br><br>These suggestions are not just for the really difficult trials but also for everyday life. Each day we have an opportunity to be strengthened by the hand of the Lord. Think about that. Why would anyone choose to wade through life's difficulties alone when the Lord stands at the door and knocks? The Savior Himself said, "Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you."<sup>8</sup><br><br>For us to draw near unto the Lord and be strengthened by Him, the first thing we must do is to have faith and believe that the Lord can and will strengthen us. In Isaiah the Lord counseled: "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness."<sup>9</sup><br><br>If we are to be strengthened by the hand of the Lord, we must learn to more effectively control our fears and feelings of discouragement. Then we must trust God and wait for Him. In Hebrew the phrase<i>to wait</i>means "to hope for or anticipate."<sup>10</sup>Consider that definition as we read a verse from Isaiah 40:<br><br><i>But they that wait upon the Lord</i>[or hope for or anticipate]<i>shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.</i><sup>11</sup><br><br>An experience of Daniel W. Jones illustrates well the concept of being strengthened by the hand of the Lord as we wait upon Him. Daniel Jones was one of 20 men who agreed to stay at Devil's Gate through the winter of 1856 and protect possessions left there by the immigrant pioneers I mentioned earlier. Daniel and two of the other men had come from Salt Lake City as members of the rescue party and were planning to be gone for just a few days, not the entire winter. There were only enough provisions to last about 20 days, even though there were at least five months of winter ahead. After eating the meager provisions, including the remaining 20 head of cattle, the men survived on what they could hunt. But food was scarce because the cold winter storms had driven away all the animals.<br><br>Daniel Jones related the following about their situation:<br><br><i>Game soon became so scarce that we could kill nothing. We ate all the poor meat; one would get hungry eating it. Finally that was all gone, nothing now but hides were left. We made a trial of them. A lot was cooked and eaten without any seasoning and it made the whole company sick. Many were so turned against the stuff that it made them sick to think of it. . . .</i><br><br><i>Things looked dark, for nothing remained but the poor raw hides taken from starved cattle. We asked the Lord to direct us what to do. The brethren did not murmur, but felt to trust in God. We had cooked the hide, after soaking and scraping the hair off until it was soft and then ate it, glue and all. This made it rather inclined to stay with us longer than we desired. Finally I was impressed how to fix the stuff and gave the company advice, telling them how to cook it; for them to scorch and scrape the hair off; this had a tendency to kill and purify the bad taste that scalding gave it. After scraping, boil one hour in plenty of water, throwing the water away which had extracted all the glue, then wash and scrape the hide thoroughly, washing in cold water, then boil to a jelly and let it get cold, and then eat with a little sugar sprinkled on it. This was considerable trouble, but we had little else to do and it was better than starving.</i><br><br><i>We asked the Lord to bless our stomachs and adapt them to this food. We hadn't the faith to ask him to bless the raw-hide for it was "hard stock." On eating now all seemed to relish the feast. . . . We enjoyed this sumptuous fare for about six weeks, and never had the gout.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>As Daniel Jones and the other men waited upon the Lord and trusted in Him, they were strengthened by His hand. Their bodies were able to bear their burdens with ease.<sup>13</sup>They were able to cheerfully endure months of freezing temperatures and near starvation without murmuring.<br><br>Another illustration of faith as a prerequisite of strength was brought to my attention while doing family history research. Annie Langeland was born in Wisconsin in July 1859 to immigrant Norwegian parents. At age 18 she married Adolph Langeland, also a Norwegian immigrant, and they homesteaded in South Dakota. From what I have read, Annie worked hard and did not enjoy much of the world's wealth. Yet I believe that Annie's Lutheran faith and her trust in God sustained her and increased her capacity for endurance as she waited upon Him. In 1939, at age 79, a widow of six years, Annie wrote the following letter:<br><br><i>My dear friends, I received your very interesting letter and the gift inside, for which I can not find words strong enough to express my thanks, but it was entirely undeserving. What little I've done for you was not . . . as much as I wanted to do. How the Lord does provide. I have to buy seed corn as we're putting</i>[in]<i>25 acres of corn and I could not see where the money was coming from to buy</i>[it]<i>and here came your fine gift. I surely need a new dress, but will have to get the seed. It's awful dry here and the grasshoppers are hatching by the thousands, so it is not very encouraging to do any sowing or planting, but we must not lose faith in our God. Heis almighty and can save us from all evil.</i><sup>14</sup><br><br>Faith in the Lord helps us endure well our personal challenges. It also helps us serve more effectively in our callings. In 1837 Heber C. Kimball was called as a missionary to England. President Gordon B. Hinckley said the following about Heber's call:<br><br><i>It is difficult for us to comprehend the enormity of that call. . . . It meant leaving a family destitute. It meant traveling to New York and crossing the sea when he had no money. It meant that a man with very little schooling, who had grown up and lived in frontier communities, would go to the great cities of the British Isles among a people known for their education and enlightenment.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Heber wrote: "The idea of such a mission was almost more than I could bear up under. I was almost ready to sink under the burden which was placed upon me." Heber's response to this call illustrates his faith and belief that he would be strengthened by the hand of the Lord to fulfill this mission. He also wrote:<br><br><i>However, all these considerations did not deter me from the path of duty; the moment I understood the will of my Heavenly Father, I felt a determination to go at all hazards, believing</i>that He would support me by His almighty power, and endow me with every qualification that I needed;<i>and although my family was dear to me, and I should have to leave them almost destitute, I felt that the cause of truth, the Gospel of Christ, outweighed every other consideration.</i><sup>16</sup><br><br>The Lord did strengthen Heber and made him a successful missionary; in eight months 2,000 Saints had been baptized and 26 congregations had been formed.<sup>17</sup>The Lord will strengthen us and deliver us as we wait for Him.<br><br>My second suggestion for being strengthened by the hand of the Lord is to pray and ask the Lord for strength. As it states in Matthew, the Lord already knows what we need before we ask.<sup>18</sup>However, I believe the Lord wants us to acknowledge Him and express our understanding that strength and other blessings come as gifts from His hand. Our responsibility is to humbly petition the Lord to receive those blessings.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, Nephi and his family left Jerusalem and journeyed in the wilderness for eight years. After a period of time, the Lord commanded Nephi to build a ship. It is highly unlikely that Nephi, having lived in Jerusalem, possessed many shipbuilding skills. Nevertheless Nephi did not doubt--he responded positively with faith to the Lord's command. In the process of building the ship, Nephi frequently went to the mountain to pray. As he did, the Lord showed him great things, including how to build the ship.<sup>19</sup>The same can be true for us. When we need to be strengthened by the hand of the Lord to do hard things beyond our natural ability, if we pray, God will show us the way.<br><br>I have found myself on my knees many times petitioning the Lord for guidance in my new call as a Relief Society president. One morning I was feeling particularly weighed down. As I knelt down to pray and express my concerns, an overwhelming sense of peace came over me that everything would be okay. The answers to my prayers do not come all at once, but rather line upon line. Just as Nephi kept returning to the mountain for additional instructions on building the ship, I return to my knees and seek guidance on moving forward.<br><br>A few years ago our stake youth went on a pioneer trek to Martin's Cove, an area in Wyoming where the stranded handcart pioneers took shelter from the storms and waited for help to arrive. As a stake we had planned and prepared for this experience for months. On the second morning of the trek, around 4a.m., I awoke suddenly with terrible stomach pains from food poisoning.<br><br>In the early morning hours I slowly paced back and forth in significant discomfort. I sat for a while on a wooden bench and watched the sun begin to peek over the horizon. I knew that it was very unlikely that in just a couple of hours I would be able to walk with the youth from our campground to the cove.<br><br>All morning I had had a prayer in my heart that I would be able to accompany the youth. However, at one point I stopped and specifically prayed that I would be healthy and able to go to Martin's Cove. I told Heavenly Father that after all the months of planning and effort, I really wanted to go and have that experience.<br><br>At approximately 6 a.m. I received a message that a member of the stake presidency wanted to give me a priesthood blessing. To be honest, I had not thought about asking for a blessing, but I readily accepted the offer. In that blessing President Smith told me that Heavenly Father was mindful of me. He blessed me that my body would rid itself of what was making me sick and that I would be able to fulfill my responsibilities with the youth.<br><br>By 10:30 a.m. I was able to leave camp, meetthe youth at the cove, and fulfill my responsibilities as promised. I then walked back to camp, a distance of about four miles. Ihad the strength to do this despite the fact that I had been sick, had slept only a few hours, and had eaten very little food.<br><br>I had often wondered why the Lord allowed those faithful handcart Saints to suffer so much. Surely he could have intervened and tempered the storms. As I stood in Martin's Cove and pondered the pioneers who lived and died there, the Spirit whispered to me that just as the Lord was mindful of me that day, He was mindful of those pioneers in 1856. He knew of their suffering and pain. Just as those pioneers came to know the Savior in their extremities, I too have a testimony that when we have trials and challenges, we can, if we are willing, draw close to the Lord and that He will strengthen and bless us by the power of His almighty hand.<br><br>The third suggestion is to immerse ourselves in daily scripture study. A study of the scriptures will deepen our understanding of and relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. It is this personal testimony and perspective that will carry us through and strengthen us in times of need. We will have faith that "[He] will go before [our] face. [He] will be on [our] right hand and on [our] left, and [His] Spirit shall be in [our] hearts, and [His] angels round about [us], to bear [us] up."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Our need to study the scriptures to qualify us for the Lord's strength is illustrated by an account from the Old Testament. Ezra was a scribe in Israel. A scribe was not just someone who wrote down the law but also someone who had studied and was very familiar with the scriptures and taught them to others. Ezra and the children of Israel had been in captivity in Babylon for many years. One day Ezra asked the king of Persia if he could leave Babylon and take some of the children of Israel home to Jerusalem. The king agreed. The king also told Ezra to take all the silver and gold they could find so they could buy meat and drink for offerings at the temple in Jerusalem. If they did not have enough money to purchase these, they had permission to take it out of the king's treasury. And so it was that Ezra prepared 2,000 people for a journey of 1,100 miles (about the same distance it would be to walk between BYU campus and Nauvoo, Illinois).<br><br>Going on this long journey with thousands of people and a lot of money was a little daunting to Ezra. However, Ezra was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect them because he had told the king that the hand of God was over all those who sought Him. So Ezra and the people fasted and prayed. Then Ezra reported, "The hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy."<sup>21</sup><br><br>Perhaps it was Ezra's personal scriptural preparation, in addition to fasting and prayer, that allowed the hand of the Lord to be upon him and the people to be delivered from their enemies. Having a testimony of the Lord and His goodness, gained through scripture study and confirmed by the Holy Ghost, strengthens us in our subtle needs as well as in our crises.<br><br>Elder M. Russell Ballard tells a story about receiving a visit from one of the missionaries who served under him when he was a mission president. The missionary expressed that he was beginning to doubt his testimony and had several questions. Elder Ballard posed the following question to the young man: "How long has it been since you read from the Book of Mormon?"<br><br>His response was, "It's been a long time."<br><br>Elder Ballard challenged the young man to read the Book of Mormon for an hour each day until they met again. Ten days later the young man returned to Elder Ballard's office. He immediately said that he knew the Church was true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet. Elder Ballard asked the young man what he had learned from the experience.<br><br>The young man said, "Give the Lord equal time."<sup>22</sup><br><br>My testimony of the power of personal scripture study began in college during a religion class taught by Dr. Keith Sellers. As part of the course we were required to read the scriptures for 30 minutes each day. The course ended, and though I continued to read the scriptures, it was not at the same level. When I finished graduate school, I realized that if I had spent as much time studying the scriptures as I had studying for a degree, I would have known the gospel so much better. At that point I made a commitment to diligently study the scriptures and give the Lord equal time. I testify that this effort has increased my testimony and that because of it I have felt strengthened by the hand of the Lord.<br><br>My fourth and last suggestion to help us become strengthened by the hand of the Lord relates to temple worship. One summer I visited Nauvoo, Illinois, with my sister and her family. We walked down Parley Street along the Trail of Hope reading the testimonies of the faithful Saints who had left their beautiful city for the unknown. As we turned and looked up the bluff at the majestic Nauvoo Temple, Imentioned to my nine-year-old nephew, Justin, how sad it must have been for the Saints to leave this beautiful temple they had just built. Justin said to me, "I would take the temple with me."<br><br>It is possible to take a piece of the temple with us each time we attend. The dedicatory prayer offered at the Kirtland Temple, as recorded in Doctrine and Covenants, included the following promise for temple worship:<br><br><i>And we ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have charge over them.</i><sup>23</sup><br><br>Perhaps the early Saints who waited from early morning until late at night to receive theirtemple endowments in the Nauvoo Temple knew something about the power of temple covenants and the Lord's ability to bless and strengthen them through those covenants. Sarah Rich, who served with her husband in the Nauvoo Temple for four months, wrote:<br><br><i>Many were the blessings we had received in the House of the Lord, which was</i>[cause for]<i>joy and comfort in the midst of all our sorrows, and enabled us to have faith in God, knowing He would guide us and sustain us in the unknown journey that lay before us. For if it had not been for the faith and knowledge that was bestowed upon us in that Temple by the influence and help of the Spirit of the Lord, our journey would have been like one taking a leap in the dark, to start out on such a journey in the winter as it were, and in our state of poverty, it would seem like walking into the jaws of death.</i><sup>24</sup><br><br>Elder David A. Bednar shared the following insight about the power of temple worship. He said that when serving as president of BYU–Idaho, he and Sister Bednar would host General Authorities who had served as temple presidents. In talking with them he would always ask this question: "What have you learned as a temple president that you wish you had better understood when you were a General Authority?" Elder Bednar said:<br><br><i>As I listened to their answers, I discovered a consistent theme that I would summarize as follows: "I have come to understand better the protection available through our temple covenants and what it means to make an acceptable offering of temple worship. There is a difference between church-attending, tithe-paying members who occasionally rush into the temple to go through a session and those members who faithfully and consistently worship in the temple."</i><br><br><i>The similarity of their answers impressed me greatly. Each response to my question focused upon the protecting power of the ordinances and covenants available in the house of the Lord.</i><sup>25</sup><br><br>I know, just as Sarah Jane knew, that the Lord is my best source of strength. I must regularly and consistently do those things that will qualify me to receive that strength. When I first received my temple endowment, I made a personal commitment that I would never let my temple recommend expire. I wanted to be worthy and able to go to the temple at any time. One year it was time to renew my temple recommend. I was living in Atlanta, Georgia, and within a week I would be returning to Utah, where I could meet with my home-ward bishop to renew my recommend. However, I chose to meet with my Atlanta bishop and stake president so that my temple recommend would remain current.<br><br>On my way to Utah I met my sister and her family in Nauvoo for the vacation I mentioned earlier. As part of our stay we had made arrangements to attend a session in the Nauvoo Temple. On the morning of our appointment I awoke early, quietly got dressed, and prepared to leave. Much to my dismay, I could not find my temple recommend. I searched my purse and suitcase and then began unloading my car, sifting through all my moving boxes. The time for my appointment approached, and there was still no recommend. I resigned myself to the fact that I would miss my appointment and began to cry. I so wanted to attend the temple. I needed the strength that I knew a temple session would provide. My niece, Katie, who was five years old at the time, asked me what was wrong. I explained that I could not find my temple recommend. She responded, "That's not very good." No, it wasn't very good, and I was despondent. Then Katie, in a most sincere and thoughtful tone, said to me, "My mom has one that you can borrow."<br><br>Unfortunately I could not borrow my sister's personal recommend to attend the temple that day any more than I could borrow her prayers, the hours she has spent in scripture study, or her faith that the Lord will strengthen her during her difficulties. Being strengthened by the Lord is an individual experience. We qualify for it individually, and individually we receive strength.<br><br>I testify that as we wait upon the Lord and prepare ourselves to be strengthened by the hand of the Lord, we will become the person the Lord desires us to become. As the Lord says in Zechariah, "I . . . will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: Iwill say, It is my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God."<sup>26</sup><br><br>I testify that the Lord is my God. He lives. Iam strengthened by His hand each day.

<h1>ition to Do Good Continually - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As a little boy, a favorite activity in my grandparents' home was climbing upon my grandfather's lap to have him read children's stories from the Book of Mormon. Grandpa Condie read slowly and deliberately, and I felt the spirit of the Book of Mormon and easily associated the Savior's love for me as Grandpa lovingly held me close to him.<br><br>One of my favorite stories was the account of venerable King Benjamin, who called upon all of his loyal subjects to gather around the temple, where he would give them his parting counsel. He reminded the people four times that he had received the text of his talk from an angel of the Lord, and the speech he delivered is one of the greatest in all of holy writ (see Mosiah 3:2, 4:1, 4:11, 5:5).<br><br>At the heart of King Benjamin's benedictory address was the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Though the Savior would not be born on earth for another 124 years, King Benjamin spoke "as though [Christ] had already come among them" (Mosiah 3:13; see also 2 Nephi 25:26; Jarom 1:11; Mosiah 16:6).<br><br>He described the Savior's future earthly mission in detail, of how He would<br><br><i>suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</i><br><br><i>And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</i><br><br><i>And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name.</i>[Mosiah 3:7–9]<br><br>As Benjamin concluded the sermon given him by an angel, the multitude fell to the earth as they<br><br><i>viewed themselves in their own carnal state. . . . And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins . . . ; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</i>[Mosiah 4:2]<br><h2><b>Filled with Joy</b></h2><br><i>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins.</i>[Mosiah 4:3]<br><br>Being "filled with joy" is one of the reassuring hallmarks that we have received a remission of our sins. Alma taught that "wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10), and this statement is akin to the predictability of the law of gravity. It is virtually impossible to be filled with joy while we are entertaining evil thoughts or wicked practices.<br><br>Alma taught the inhabitants of Zarahemla that a mighty change of heart should be reflected by the image of Christ in their countenances (see Alma 5:14). Now, some of us--myself included--were born with a face only a mother could love; but it can still be a happy face.<br><br><i>As a beauty I'm not a great star.</i><br><i>There are others more handsome by far,</i><br><i>But my face, I don't mind it,</i><br><i>Because I'm behind it--</i><br><i>'Tis the folks in the front that I jar.</i><br>[Anthony Henderson Euwer, "My Face," in<i>Rhymes of Our Valley</i>(New York: James B. Pond, 1916), 92]<br><br>One of the signs of having received a remission of sins is a joyful heart and a cheerful countenance.<br><h2><b>Peace of Conscience</b></h2><br>A second sign of receiving a remission of sins is reflected by the "peace of conscience" that Benjamin's people experienced "because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come" (Mosiah 4:3).<br><br>As an old man, my list of past sins is so long that I cannot begin to remember them all. But the list is so long I can't forget them all either. But I<i>can</i>remember them with a peace ofconscience.<br><h2><b>Filled with the Love of God</b></h2><br>Benjamin assured his listeners that<br><br><i>as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins . . .</i><br><br>[then]<i>ye shall always rejoice, and be</i>filled with the love of God,<i>and always retain a remission of your sins.</i>[Mosiah 4:11–12; emphasis added]<br><br>Hearts filled with love become a third confirmation that our sins are forgiven.<br><br>A heart filled with love has no room for discouragement, doubt, fear, hatred, vengeance, envy, lust, or greed, because a heart full of love is<i>full.</i><br><h2><b>No Mind to Injure</b></h2><br>King Benjamin described a fourth indicator of retaining a remission of our sins, and that is that we "<i>will not have a mind to injure one another,</i>but to live peaceably" (Mosiah 4:13; emphasis added). Not having a mind to injure one another is reflected by our overcoming even the very inclination to put others down, to tell jokes defaming a given ethnic group, or to speak of a roommate or a spouse or any others in unflattering terms.<br><br>Brother David M. Sorensen has been engaged in counseling and marital therapy formany years. He once told me he has seen hateful, hurtful marriage relationships "turn on a dime" when couples merely agree to be<i>kind</i>to each other for a day, a week, a month, and then a lifetime.<br><h2><b>Teach Our Children</b></h2><br>A fifth hallmark of retaining a remission of our sins is that<br><br>[we]<i>will not suffer</i>[our]<i>children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will</i>[we]<i>suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another. . . .</i><br><br><i>But</i>[we]<i>will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness;</i>[we]<i>will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</i>[Mosiah 4:14–15]<br><h2><b>The Wadsworths of Panaca, Nevada</b></h2><br>Franklin Don Wadsworth was an enterprising young man from Nevada who met a lovely young woman from Salt Lake City by the name of Sylvia Hinckley. They were soon married, and they were blessed with 11 children: seven sons and four daughters. When the youngest son, David, was seven years of age, his lovely mother died suddenly at age 49. Notwithstanding this tragic and untimely loss, the Wadsworth children rallied around their heartbroken father, providing great comfort to him and to each other. Then, just 17 months later, not long after David was baptized, his father died at age 56, leaving eight unmarried children at home.<br><br>The relatives counseled together, and it was decided that one uncle and his wife would take some of the children into their home and another uncle and aunt would care for the rest of the children in their home.<br><br>At this point the Wadsworth children met in family council, with the oldest son, Franklin Brent, taking charge. The children unanimously agreed that their deceased parents would not want them to be separated and unable to see each other frequently during their formative years. Their parents had taught them to serve one another and to be responsible for one another, so they declined any outside help. The members of the extended family agreed to stand back and let them give it a try.<br><br>Lark was in her third year in high school, and the school allowed her to take all of her classes early in the day so she would be home in time to welcome the younger children when they arrived home from school. Valerie was in the process of graduating from college, and she found a job nearby and helped with the younger children for the first year. Scott was a returned missionary, and he worked the family farm and commuted to Cedar City, where he attended college.<br><br>All of the children eventually went to college, and all of the sons served missions. When only two children--David, then 14, and Charlotte, then 17-- remained living at home, they were invited by their older sister Terry and her husband, Lorell Bleak, to live with their family.<br><br>Though Don and Sylvia Wadsworth were snatched from their mortal existence prematurely, they had taught their children by precept and example that true joy comes from loving and serving others and placing the needs of others above their own. Now in postmortality Don and Sylvia claim a rich posterity of 106 grandchildren and 80 great-grandchildren.<br><h2><b>Succor Those in Need</b></h2><br>A sixth measure of our remission of sins, according to King Benjamin, is that we "will succor those that stand in need of [our] succor," that we "impart of [our] substance to the poor, . . . feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief" (Mosiah 4:16, 26). In this regard, giving generous fast offerings and emulating the lifelong ministry of our beloved President Thomas S. Monson readily come to mind.<br><h2><b>Do Good Continually</b></h2><br>At the conclusion of King Benjamin's forthright counsel, the people<br><br><i>all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe</i>all<i>the words which thou hast spoken unto us ... because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that</i>we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. [Mosiah 5:2; emphasis added]<br><br>This is the test of retaining a remission of our sins: we overcome any inclination to do evil, supplanting it with a sustained disposition to do good continually. This is the demonstration of discipleship.<br><br>The Savior humbly testified: "I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, ... I do always those things that please him" (John 8:28–29).<i>His</i>was a disposition to do good continually.<br><br>Now, some contend that because Christ was the Son of God He was exempt from temptation, but that belief is contrary to the scriptural record of His earthly ministry. We are all aware of His temptations by Satan after fasting for 40 days in the wilderness (see Matthew 4:1–11). And just prior to entering the Garden of Gethsemane, he expressed His gratitude to Peter, James, and John, who, said the Savior, "have continued with me in my temptations" (Luke 22:28).<br><br>The Apostle Paul wrote of Jesus Christ, who "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). Alma foresaw the Savior "suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind . . . that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities" (Alma 7:11–12).<br><br>How was the Savior able to resist and transcend all these temptations of the flesh? We read in Doctrine and Covenants 20:22: "He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them." Because of the Savior's divine disposition to do good continually, no temptation nor bitter cup could distract Him or dissuade Him from performing His divine mission.<br><br>The well-known British cleric Frederic Farrar observed:<br><br><i>The only difference between the temptations of Christ and our</i>own<i>is that</i>His<i>came from without, but</i>ours<i>come also from within. In Him "the tempting opportunity" could not appeal to "the susceptible disposition."</i>[Frederic William Farrar,<i>The Life of Lives: Further Studies in the Life of Christ</i>(London: Cassell and Company, 1900), 251; emphasis added]<br><br>Our goal in life should be to overcome the susceptible disposition.<br><h2><b>The Pulling Power of Covenants</b></h2><br>Within the restored kingdom of God on earth, the making and keeping of covenants is a central doctrine and practice with a divine purpose in helping us develop a disposition to do good continually. Covenants are the promises to keep the Lord's commandments, and they are an integral part of gospel ordinances. The word<i>ordinance</i>shares etymological roots with the word<i>order,</i>and so it is that ordinances help order our lives in such a way that we prioritize the use of our time, our means, and our talents in serving Heavenly Father's other children and assisting in the building of His kingdom. It is through the ordinances of the priesthood that the powers of godliness are manifest unto men in the flesh. (See D&amp;amp;C 84:19–21.)<br><br>Captain Moroni declared: "I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the covenant which Ihave made to keep the commandments of my God" (Alma 60:34). There is a pulling power inherent in keeping covenants, a power that pulls us onward and ever upward toward our celestial home. It is not only important but also indispensable that we frequently renew our covenants in sacrament meeting and in the temple, reminding us of the Lord's "exceeding great and precious promises" (2 Peter 1:4) contingent upon our obedience to His commandments.<br><br>Covenants are kept when we<i>feel</i>the promises we renew. It is then that doing good continually no longer becomes a tedious task but rather a daily delight.<br><br>President David O. McKay was fond of reminding the Saints:<br><br><i>Sow a thought, and you reap an act;</i><br><i>Sow an act, and you reap a habit;</i><br><i>Sow a habit, and you reap a character;</i><br><i>Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.</i><br>[Quoted by Samuel Smiles (1812–1904) in<i>Life and Labor</i>(1887)]<br><h2><b>Heiko Mazurek</b></h2><br>Twenty-five years ago Heiko Mazurek was a young German music student in Vienna, Austria. One day he was walking down the street when a Book of Mormon display caught his eye. So he stopped to talk with the missionaries, and they gave him a copy of the Book of Mormon. He began to read it and to accept the missionary discussions. Eventually he was baptized.<br><br>Shortly after his baptism he moved back to his home in Germany to accept a teaching position in a music school. As the mission president at the time, I was concerned that a new convert might get lost in the shuffle of moving away so shortly after baptism. I called Heiko's new stake president and asked him if he could give Heiko some special attention to assure that he remained active and committed to the kingdom.<br><br>A few weeks after Heiko's arrival in Germany, his caring stake president invited him to travel three hours by train to a Saturday stake priesthood meeting to share his conversion story with the brethren. Heiko accepted the invitation with much fear and trepidation.<br><br>He'd never spoken to a large audience before, so the evening prior to his appointed speech Heiko spent a rather sleepless night tossing and turning. When the alarm clock finally rang, he turned it off and promised himself he would just sleep for a few more minutes and then get up. (Does this sound familiar?) However, he was so exhausted from his fitful night's sleep that he awoke too late to catch the last morning train in time to arrive at the stake center to give his talk.<br><br>He hurriedly dressed and rode his bike to the small airport outside of town, and although he was a financially struggling musician, he chartered a small plane for $400 to fly him to his destination.<br><br>The stake president phoned me in Vienna after the meeting and described how Heiko had arrived all out of breath, but he gave a wonderful and inspiring testimony, and all in attendance were grateful for the sacrifice he had made to attend.<br><br>Several months later Heiko visited us in Vienna, and he recounted his experience of chartering a plane to the priesthood meeting. When he concluded, I asked: "Heiko, why didn't you just call up President Rueckauer and tell him you would not be able to make it to the meeting and that you would be willing to speak on some future occasion?"<br><br>Heiko looked at me indignantly as he said: "President Condie, when the missionaries taught me the gospel, they explained the importance of commitments and of making covenants, and they said that when we make a promise to the Lord or one of His servants, we are expected to keep our word." (See Spencer J. Condie,<i>In Perfect Balance</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2004], 127–29.) To this day Heiko continues striving to do good continually, and Church members still introduce him to their nonmember friends as "the legendary guy with the airplane."<br><h2><b>The Prodigal's Brother</b></h2><br>The parable of the prodigal son illustrates in bold relief a wide variety of human dispositions. First there is the self-centered prodigal son unconcerned with anyone or anything but himself. But, alas, after riotous living he discovered for himself that "wickedness never was happiness," and "he came to himself" (Luke 15:17). He eventually realized whose son he was, and he yearned to be reunited with hisfather.<br><br>His arrogant, selfish disposition had given way to humility and a broken heart and contrite spirit as he confessed to his father: "I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son" (Luke 15:21). Gone were the adolescent rebellion, the immature selfishness, and relentless pleasure seeking, and in their place was an embryonic disposition to do good continually. Now, if we are completely honest with ourselves, we will each confess that there is, or has been, a bit of the prodigal son in every one of us.<br><br>Then there is the father. Some may criticize him for having been overly indulgent in granting the younger son's request to "give me the portion of goods that falleth to me" (Luke 15:12). The father in the parable was undoubtedly sensitive to the divine principle of moral agency and freedom of choice, a principle over which the premortal War in Heaven had been waged. He was not inclined to compel his son to be obedient.<br><br>But this loving father never gave up on his wayward son, and his unrelenting vigilance is confirmed in the poignant narration that when the son "was yet a great way off, his father ... had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him" (Luke 15:20). Not only was there an open display of physical affection toward his son, but the father requested his servants to give him a robe, shoes for his feet, and a ring for his hand and instructed them to kill the fatted calf, joyfully declaring, "He was lost, and is found" (Luke 15:24).<br><br>Throughout the years this father had continually developed such a compassionate, forgiving, loving disposition that he could do nothing else but love and forgive. This parable is a universal favorite for all of us because it holds out the hope to each one of us that a loving Father in Heaven stands in the roadway, as it were, anxiously awaiting the arrival of each of His prodigal children back home.<br><br>And now to the older, obedient son who protested to his forgiving father:<br><br><i>Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</i><br><br><i>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</i>[Luke 15:29–30]<br><br>Just as there may be an element of the prodigal son in each of us, it may also be the case that every one of us is tainted with traits of the older son. The Apostle Paul described the fruit of the Spirit as "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, [and] temperance" (Galatians 5:22–23). While it may well be that the older son had, indeed, been obedient to his father, beneath the obedient surface was seething subterranean self-righteousness and a disposition to be judgmental, covetous, and totally lacking in compassion. His life did<i>not</i>reflect the fruit of the Spirit, for he was not at peace but rather greatly distressed at what he perceived to be a gross inequity of treatment.<br><h2><b>Judged After Our Ways</b></h2><br>The mighty prophet Ezekiel taught that if a righteous man<br><br><i>trust to his own righteousness, and</i>[then]<i>commit iniquity, all his</i>[righteous acts]<i>shall not be remembered. . . .</i><br><br><i>But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.</i><br><br><i>Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal</i>[or equitable].<i>O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one</i>after his ways. [Ezekiel 33:13, 19–20; emphasis added]<br><br>This great prophet taught the people that the Righteous Judge of us all is not computing a running total of all our good deeds from which all of our evil deeds will be subtracted. Rather, we will be judged "after [our] ways"--our way of life and our dispositions to do either good or evil (see Ezekiel 18:21–27, 33:13–20.)<br><br>In 2005 the CEO of a large business corporation was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding his company and its shareholders of $11 billion. His defense attorney pointed out that over the years his client had contributed $95 million to charitable causes, and then he asked the judge: "If you live 60-some-odd years, if you have an unblemished record, if you have endless numbers of people who attest to your goodness, doesn't that count?" (Bernard Ebbers' defense lawyer Reid Weingarten, in Erin McClam, "WorldCom's Ebbers Weeps at 25-Year Sentence," Associated Press, 13 July 2005; http://iinternational.org/showCnews.php?id=70&amp;amp;referrence=page%3D65).<br><br>Ezekiel would likely respond that, actually, those good deeds do<i>not</i>count for much, because overshadowing all of the good deeds of the<i>distant</i>past--like the mission in Taiwan or Texas--are the more egregious, dark deeds of the<i>recent</i>past. King Benjamin would perhaps share the observation that this particular individual still had an unfettered disposition to do evil on a grand scale. He had inflicted great suffering upon numerous employees, shareholders, and clients whose trust had been betrayed at a terrible personal cost to each of them. In the process of becoming, he had become a crook.<br><br>As a second prophetic voice, Elder Dallin H. Oaks teaches us that<i>testimony</i>involves believing and feeling, whereas<i>conversion</i>includes doing and becoming. To quote Elder Dallin H. Oaks:<br><br><i>The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts--what we have</i>done.<i>It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts--what we have</i>become. ["The Challenge to Become,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2000, 32; emphasis in original]<br><h2><b>Brother Wakolo's Disciple's Soul</b></h2><br>While serving in the South Pacific, I received a letter from the First Presidency with an assignment to travel to Fiji and deliver a letter to Taniela Wakolo, president of the Nausori Fiji Stake. After I handed the letter to him, he read aloud the call from the First Presidency to serve as an Area Seventy, and tears flowed freely from his cheeks and those of his lovely wife, Anita.<br><br>After discussing with him the nature and duties of his new calling, I observed the tattoo on Brother Wakolo's large right hand. Now, tattoos are very common throughout the South Pacific, and long before he joined the Church, Taniela Wakolo had the back of his hand tattooed with a large, garish design.<br><br>I said: "Brother Wakolo, in your new calling as an Area Seventy, you are going to be speaking to the youth on many occasions. I would suggest before such meetings that you put a large Band-Aid on the back of your hand to cover your tattoo. It's hard to discourage our youth from getting tattoos when the speaker has one himself."<br><br>He smiled a broad smile, and with a radiant expression he said, "I'll take care of it. I want to be a good example."<br><br>A few weeks passed, and the next time we met, his hand was heavily bandaged as if he were preparing for a boxing match. I asked, "What in the world happened to you?"<br><br>He smiled with glistening eyes and said, "I followed your counsel and had the tattoo removed."<br><br>"Was it laser surgery?" I asked.<br><br>"No," he replied with a big smile, "they don't remove tattoos with lasers in Fiji. I had it surgically cut out."<br><br>A month later Elder Wakolo and I were assigned together to reorganize a stake presidency in American Samoa. As we met at the airport, I immediately noticed an unsightly scar on the back of his hand where the surgeon had removed several square inches of skin and then very crudely sutured the gaping wound closed. This had not been performed by a plastic surgeon.<br><br>I apologized for having been the cause of the large scar on the back of his hand. He responded with a radiant Christlike countenance: "Not to worry, President Condie; this is my CTR ring. Now the Lord knows where I stand! I'll do anything the Lord asks of me."<br><br>Elder Wakolo has become a disciple who keeps his covenants and strives to do good continually.<br><br>My precious young brothers and sisters, I invoke the blessings of heaven upon each and every one of you of the rising generation and pray that your righteous thoughts and deeds will overcome any susceptible disposition to do evil and that the Holy Spirit will be your constant companion in helping you to develop a disposition to do good continually, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Spencer J.

<h1> in the Defense of Religious Freedom - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your warm welcome, andthank you, President Samuelson, for your verykind introduction. As you point out, I am the Catholic Archbishop of Chicago and also the President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. This dual role allows me to bring greetings from both the Catholic community of Chicago and from the Catholic bishops of this country to all of you--students, faculty, staff, and administration of this distinguished university, now marking its 135th year of service in higher education, and also to our guests from the surrounding community, many of whom I'm told are watching on satellite TV.<br><br>As a cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, Ihave a special bond with the Bishop of Rome, Pope Benedict XVI, whose specific service is one of preserving unity among Catholic believers everywhere and also of fostering peace and respect for human life and dignity among all people of goodwill. As a cardinal priest, that is, as a member of the clergy of Rome itself, quite apart from my being Archbishop of Chicago, Ihave the privilege and obligation to vote in a papal election. The cardinals assemble at the death of one pope in order to elect his successor because they are the clergy of Rome; but the choice of the Bishop of Rome, the one who sits in the chair of St. Peter, is, for us Catholics, we pray and hope and believe, in the hands of God, our Heavenly Father. Most important of all, I am a bishop of the Catholic Church and, therefore, a pastor to the people whom Christ Jesus has given me to love and to care for, first of all in two counties of Illinois, Cook and LakeCounties, which count 2.3 million baptized Catholics in the Archdiocese of Chicago, but also with a shared concern for all the Churches. Catholic bishops collectively oversee the Catholic Church with and under the Successor of Saint Peter, the head of the Apostolic College, the Bishop of Rome.<br><br>So I come before you today as a religious leader who shares with you a love for our own country but also, like many, a growing concern about its moral health as a good society. In recent years Catholics and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have stood more frequently side by side in the public square to defend human life and dignity. In addition to working together to alleviate poverty here and abroad, we have been together in combating the degradations associated with the pornography industry; in promoting respect for the right to life of those still waiting in their mother's womb to be born; and in defending marriage as the union of one man and one woman for the sake of family against various efforts to redefine in civil law that foundational element of God's natural plan for creation. I am personally grateful that, after 180 years of living mostly apart from one another, Catholics and Latter-day Saints have begun to see one another as trustworthy partners in the defense of shared moral principles and in the promotion of the common good of our beloved country.<br><br>Of course, partnerships in causes of great moral import build on friendships and gestures of respect for one another's identity, and these too have multiplied in recent years. The late and universally esteemed Latter-day Saint President, Gordon B. Hinckley, opened his door on many occasions to the past and present bishops of the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City, which encompasses all of Utah: Bishop George Niederauer, now Archbishop of San Francisco, and Bishop John C. Wester, who is with us today. Bishop Wester spearheads with great dedication the Catholic bishops' national immigration reform efforts.<br><br>One of the high points of the centennial celebrations of the Catholic Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City was the presence of LDS President Thomas S. Monson at a multi-faith service on August 10, 2009, honoring the cathedral's civic engagements. At the service President Monson spoke eloquently about the enduring friendships that Catholics and Latter-day Saints have forged by together serving the needs of the poor and the most troubled of society. Through such shared dedication, he noted, we will "eliminate the weakness of one standing alone and substitute, instead, the strength of many working together" (Gerry Avant, "Joining Celebration at Catholic Cathedral,"<i>Church News,</i>15 August 2009, 3). The service was marked by the presence of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.<br><br>I sometimes suspect, and maybe some of you do too, that Brigham Young and the first Catholic bishop of Salt Lake City, Lawrence Scanlan, would have been rather astonished at seeing the LDS First Presidency and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir helping local Catholics celebrate the anniversary of their cathedral. But good for them and good for us! I thank God for the harmony that has grown between us and for the possibilities of deepening our friendships through common witness and dialogue.<br><br>Let me mention one personal experience that stays with me, an experience with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which I first heard when I was 13 years old. I visited Salt Lake City then with my mother, who was a good musician and who wanted to hear that great organ and the choir. The memory of that sound has stayed with me; it was overwhelming.<br><br>I had the great opportunity, through the kindness of the choir itself, to lead it once, on June 27, 2007. They were at the Ravinia music center in Highland Park, Illinois, outside of Chicago. A few days prior to the concert, I received a call from the choir's music director, Dr. Craig Jessop, who asked whether I would consider assuming the conductor's podium at the end of the performance and lead the choir in an encore number. Never had I been asked to do something like that! I seized the occasion, and, after a brief lesson from Craig at the dress rehearsal, I got up and faced the choir with a tremendous feeling of awe and power and great satisfaction. There was silence as this marvelous choir was looking at and waiting for me. If that doesn't give you something of an ego trip, I don't know what would! I paused for a moment, and then I gave the downbeat, according to Craig's instruction. All of a sudden, that vacuum of expectant silence was filled with this magnificent, overpowering sound, all in unison, all in harmony. I thought to myself, "I'm doing better with the Mormons than I am with the Catholics!" I have a lot harder time getting them to sing together! What the choir sang was<br><br><i>This land is your land, this land is my land</i><br><i>From Wrigley's diamond to the great Sears Tower,</i><br><i>From the Hancock Building to Lake Michigan's waters,</i><br><i>This land was made for you and me.</i><br><h2><b>II.</b></h2><br>What I'd like to do now in the short time available to us is to make three points. First of all, to share with you the Catholic understanding of religious freedom, which I think we share together: Religious freedom cannot be reduced to freedom of worship or even freedom of private conscience. Religious freedom means that religious groups as well as religious individuals have a right to exercise their influence in the public square. Any attempt to reduce that fuller sense of religious freedom, which has been part of our history in this country for more than two centuries, to a private reality of worship and individual conscience as long as you don't make anybody else unhappy is not in our tradition. It was the tradition of the Soviet Union, where Lenin permitted freedom of worship (it was in the constitution of the Soviet Union) but not freedom of religion. Lenin was drawing on several antecedents, one of whom was Napoleon Bonaparte, who made civil peace after the terror of the French Revolution by limiting the Church to the sacristy but not permitting it to have a public role. This is not the American tradition, even though it is now argued by some Americans that it should be.<br><br>The second point I want to examine is the mounting threats to religious freedom in America. Thirdly and lastly, I want to show why it is that Catholics and Mormons do stand together and shall continue to do so with other defenders of conscience and the public exercise of religion.<br><br>We start with what the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sang in Chicago: this land is our land, a land of many peoples of differing religious convictions and political views, who will continue to differ in those convictions but who can come together for the sake of social harmony and the common good that we must all share. We Americans are "dedicated to the proposition that all men [and women] are created equal" (Abraham Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address) and that all people, no matter their respective beliefs, have equal protection under law. This 234-year-old experiment in self-government has made this land, our land, a place where both our religious communities and many others, with the help of God, have been able to flourish.<br><br>In 1634 a few dozen Catholics, precursors to millions of others of all faiths who would seek protection in this nation of immigrants, sailed on the<i>Ark</i>and the<i>Dove</i>from England to the shores of Maryland, where they and their associates would establish the first English-speaking Catholic community in America at a time when Catholicism was still proscribed in the British Empire, where it was against the law to build a Catholic church. They gathered in their own homes until the time of the American Revolution. The first Catholic bishop of this country, John Carroll, the Bishop of Baltimore, Maryland, was profoundly grateful for the First Amendment of our Constitution, which permitted the Church to come out, not only out of the sacristies but out of the basements of their own homes, and to take part in public life. That small Catholic community would grow to 67 million Catholics here today.<br><br>As you know, around 70,000 Mormon pioneers made the dangerous journey with Brigham Young to Utah in the period of 1847–68, and today the Latter-day Saints number 6 million in the United States and more than that--7 million--abroad.<br><br>The lesson of American history is that churches and other religious bodies prosper in a nation and in a social order that respects religious freedom and recognizes that civil government should never stand between the consciences and the religious practice of its citizens and Almighty God. The Founding Fathers understood when they amended the Constitution that the separation of church and state springs from a concept of limited government and favors a public role for churches and other religious bodies in promoting the civic virtues that are vitally necessary in a well-functioning democracy. But Catholic memories go back further than this. It was Pope Gelasius I who told Emperor Anastasius I, "Two there are," when the emperor was trying to run the Catholic Church as well as the empire. That institutional separation remains integral to the Church's self-identity, although how it is worked out varies, depending upon the particular government, the particular area, and the particular culture.<br><br>The Catholic Church did not always understand and appreciate that religious freedom is compatible with democratic government, with liberal democracy. That is because throughout much of the 19th century, Catholic leaders in Europe could not distinguish between the antireligious furor unleashed by the Jacobin terror of the French Revolution in the name of democracy and the United States' defense of liberty based on the natural rights of man in our own democratic experiment. The Catholic Church came to terms fully with what is positive in the movement to defend democracy and human rights in that context only in the late 19th century, when Pope Leo XIII began the tradition of issuing modern social encyclicals.<br><br>At that time, the Pope wrote on the economic rights and duties of capital and labor in an encyclical called by its first two Latin words, <i>Rerum Novarum</i>(1891). He tried to defend labor against the power of capital by telling laborers to organize into unions so that the dialogue would be a little more equal; but his basic concern was the condition of the family in an economy that was moving from an agricultural base to an industrial base. In an agricultural economy, the family is also an economic unit; it was work that helped keep mother, father, and children together. In an industrially based economy, the Pope saw the father in the factory working apart from his family, the mother who was perhaps in the home of someone who owned a factory, working as a maid, and the children who were very often on the streets. Because of that social disorder, a number of religious orders began in the late 19th century. I think particularly of the Salesian Fathers, who took boys from the streets, literally, because they no longer had a home, and educated them and gave them a second kind of home. In an attempt to teach that work must continue to protect the family and not destroy it, Pope Leo XIII wrote about a family wage. A worker would be paid not only for work to be performed but also for responsibilities to be met.<br><br>Behind the family wage, there is the basic conviction that it is not individuals and their rights that are the basis of society, although they might be the basis of a political order, but it is the family that is the basic unit of society: mothers and fathers who have duties and obligations to their children and children who learn how to be human in the school of love, which is the family. The family tells us that we're not the center of the world individually but are rather always someone's son, someone's daughter, someone's brother or sister or cousin or uncle. The family relationships are prior to individual self-consciousness. That is the basis of Catholic social teaching; it is ineluctably a communitarian ethos.<br><br>In this country we have to pay "equal pay for equal work," which is defensible when you take equality as a sign of justice. Nonetheless, we also have to accommodate family obligations, and that is done by paying benefits. Benefits are based on relationships, and it is relationships that count, finally, in Catholic social teaching. If you want to understand where the bishops are coming from, where Catholic social theory is coming from on any particular issue, ask the question, "How will this policy or proposal affect the family?"<br><br>At the Second Vatican Council, which was held from 1962 to 1965, when I was a seminarian, the Catholic Church praised constitutional limits on the powers of government, and it also taught that constitutional guarantees of religious freedom for all people in every place are necessary to have a just society.<br><br>In the Declaration on Religious Freedom (<i>Dignitatis Humanae</i>) in 1965, from that same Council, the affirmation was made that churches and religious organizations must be free to govern themselves and to pursue their goals of education outside of the sacristy, through programs for the formation of believers (in youth groups and catechetical conferences and other instances), through charitable pursuits on the streets, outside of the sacristy, and through working for the advance of justice in society, outside of the sacristy.<br><br>The difference in the teaching, the development of doctrine that took place at the Second Vatican Council, was that the Church focused the locus of those rights not in institutions, whether church or state, but rather in persons and talked about the anthropology of the human person as made in the image and likeness of God and, therefore, made to be free.<br><br>Civil laws and obligations should protect that personal freedom; the basis of it all is religious freedom, because it is our relationship to God that determines our relationship to everyone else. We are related to God, who is Creator and Savior and Sanctifier, and then related to everyone God loves; so we must see others, in some sense, as brothers and sisters, as members of the one human family, no matter what other differences there might be.<br><br>Vatican II was the immediate background for the role assumed by one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century, Karol Wojtyla of Poland, who became in 1978 the 264th pope. Up until his death from Parkinson's disease in 2005, Pope John Paul II was one of the most successful evangelists in modern times, making 104 foreign trips and covering more than 750,000 miles so that he could preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in many tongues and to many cultures. His aim was always, first, to strengthen the spiritual lives of his own flock and to be, at the same time, a powerful advocate for human rights in every land where he set foot.<br><br>John Paul II's visit to his homeland of Poland in 1979, shortly after his election, set in motion the emergence of the first independent trade union in communist Eastern Europe,<i>Solidarność</i> (Solidarity), which set off a chain reaction that would, within a decade, bring down the Iron Curtain. When asked years later about his role in the collapse of communism--acknowledged by principal actors like Mikhail Gorbachev to have been vitally instrumental, Pope John Paul II said self-effacingly, and also what he believed, "I didn't cause this to happen. The tree was already rotten. I just gave it a good shake" (in Carl Bernstein and Marco Politi,<i>His Holiness: John Paul II and the History of Our Time</i>[New York: Penguin, 1997], 356). He saw, even before many in our own state department saw, that the Soviet Union could not last. Why? Because, with a philosophical and theological eye, he saw that a social order that opposed personal freedom to social justice was inherently unstable. To hold that in order to have social justice you have to sacrifice personal freedom is to create a social order at odds with human nature.<br><br>What we sometimes forget is that this same pope, speaking to our own culture, said you cannot play off personal freedom against objective truth. Therefore, the truth question must be public, even the religious truth question, and there are canons of intellectual pursuit that are in place to examine it. You cannot put objective moral and religious truths aside and imagine that you can build a social order that safeguards individual freedom by suppressing objective truth; yet that is our system, and we must ask with the Pope, "Is it sustainable?"<br><br>John Paul II poured his heart into the defense of religious freedom, but not primarily as a politician on the world stage. He denounced evils like racism, human trafficking, abortion, euthanasia, and the exploitation of workers and immigrants, but his approach was from the vantage point of a pastor to whom Christ had entrusted the mission to teach and care for the least of the Lord's brothers and sisters (see Matthew 25:40). He was also a philosopher by training, someone who had assimilated the reflections of the great thinkers of the Western tradition and who recognized that the question of freedom lies at the heart of modern society's deepest conflicts, because it always lies at the heart of who we are as creatures made in the image and likeness of a God who loves us freely. For the philosopher-pope, freedom is not the entitlement to do whatever one pleases, to pursue one's individual dream. It is not the pretext for moral anarchy, but the capacity to fulfill one's deepest aspirations by choosing the true and the good in the human community. This is what distinguishes human beings from other living creatures: we can know the truth about God and about ourselves as creatures with inviolable dignity precisely because we are made in God's image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). Therefore, freedom of religion was for the Pope, and for the tradition out of which he spoke, the most fundamental human right and the precious achievement of any good society.<br><br>I think in all this, while with different words sometimes, Mormons and Catholics can come together with a great deal of agreement and work together to try to be sure that our society doesn't have that cultural fault line that continuously pits personal and individual liberties against objective truth, or at least the search for it, including the search for religious truths, even if we don't come to common agreement.<br><h2><b>III.</b></h2><br>There are--and this is my second point--threats to religious freedom in America that are new to our history and to our tradition. We have seen this with particular clarity in areas that would seem, at first blush, to have little to do with religious freedom--in the question of health care and in the question of human sexuality.<br><br>Threats to conscience in health care have become prominent recently, particularly in the context of our discussion about health-care-reform legislation. Yet those threats were there already long before in Supreme Court decisions and sometimes in legislation in parts of our country, particularly around the protection of those waiting to be born.<br><br>Once<i>Roe v. Wade</i>was decided in 1973, some advocates for abortion would interpret that decision even more broadly than it was drawn, in a way that would threaten the consciences of Catholic and other health-care workers and institutions. Specifically, they argued<i>Roe v. Wade</i>did not merely declare a right to have the government<i>not interfere</i>with a woman's privacy but also the right to have the government<i>positively assist</i>in a woman's having an abortion, whether by government's funding of the abortion and, therefore, using our money in such a way that we all become complicit in what we regard as a morally heinous act or by government's inducing or compelling others to provide the abortion. If the civil law were to impose such pressures and duties to assist in provision of abortion and other immoral procedures, then freedom of conscience would be directly threatened.<br><br>In order to be sure this didn't happen, members of Congress passed a number of amendments and laws to qualify the<i>Roe v. Wade</i>decision. They passed a law called the Church Amendment, named after the legislator, which made clear that hospitals receiving federal funds are not thereby obliged to provide abortions. It also protects an employee who refuses to participate in that kind of procedure from any kind of employer discipline. In 1976 the Hyde Amendment was passed; it prohibits the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for elective abortions, whether directly by reimbursement for the cost or indirectly by subsidizing health insurance coverage that includes abortion.<br><br>These laws have remained in place for over three decades, and even stronger protections have been added. The Weldon Amendment forbids states receiving federal health-care dollars from punishing individual or institutional health-care providers who, for reasons of conscience, will not provide abortions or abortion referrals. All these are still in place, but what is in question now is how they will survive the present health-care debate.<br><br>In that debate the Catholic bishops have tried to play a role as a moral voice, not as politicians. It's hard to maintain that stance in the public sphere because the media talk about politics and personalities, and very seldom will they rise to the level of principle. In the realm of moral principle, the bishops have stressed two points: First, that everyone should be taken care of. We need to look at health-care reform. There are pregnant women who don't have the prenatal care they should have; there are people with preexisting health conditions who cannot get insurance; there are too many gaps in our care and too many people aren't being taken care of by the government or by hospitals or by private philanthropy. Everyone should be cared for, but it's not the bishops' job to say how.<br><br>The second moral point is that no one should be deliberately killed. Health care doesn't include euthanasia and doesn't include abortion; those are killings, not treatments. Those are the two moral principles that the Catholic bishops have insisted on, with the risk of being captured by one party on the need for universal care and by the other on removing killing from it.<br><br>The second area of conflict today posing a threat to religious freedom is human sexuality, especially in the development of gay rights and the call for same-sex "marriage." Again, with the LDS Church, Catholics would insist that every single person is made in God's image and likeness. Every single person, no matter his or her sexual orientation, must be respected as an individual; everyone must be loved because they are loved by God. Loving someone, however, doesn't mean that one approves of everything they do.<br><br>With the advocates of same-sex "marriage" legislation, we can expect a one-two punch from hostile governments, whether locally or perhaps federally. We will see, first, attempts to compel traditional religious organizations to afford same-sex, civilly married couples the same special solicitude that they afford actually married couples, whether in the provision of employment benefits, adoption services, or any of a number of other areas where religious groups operate in the broader society and where rights hinge on whether or not one is civilly married. If this first wave is successfully resisted, there will be a second series of government punishments for that persistence. We will lose state or local government contracts, tax exemptions, anything else that could be characterized as a "subsidy" for our "discrimination."<br><br>There is nothing conjectural about these risks. In Massachusetts, Catholic Charities had to move out of placing children for adoption after over 100 years of being involved in that charitable enterprise. Now, in the District of Columbia, Catholic Charities, the Archdiocese of Washington, and our own headquarters of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, as well as of the Military Ordinariate, have to come to terms with a law just passed recognizing same-sex "marriages," without any religious exemption, and that done very deliberately.<br><br>These examples illustrate the threats to religious freedom in America. It's not at all agreeable to get into a context that plays off individual liberties against the liberty of religious bodies themselves. At some point, I suppose, it will have to go to the courts, which finally decide what are the terms of our living together. What I most regret is not so much the opposition but the misunderstanding, deliberate or not. Those of us who have gay people in our family, as I have, know the anxieties and deep conflicts in their own lives, and we have to be there for them and love them and support them. But when, in public life, what is wanted politically is not given, as happened with Proposition 8 in California, and the response is thuggery, then the common good of our whole society stands in great jeopardy.<br><h2><b>IV.</b></h2><br>Dear friends, I believe, lastly, that Catholics and Mormons stand with one another and with other defenders of conscience and that we can and should stand as one in the defense of religious liberty. In the coming years, interreligious coalitions formed to defend the rights of conscience for individuals and for religious institutions should become a vital bulwark against the tide of forces at work in our government and society to reduce religion to a purely private reality.<br><br>At stake is whether or not the religious voice will maintain its right to be heard in the public square. Our collaborative efforts in this work may include common statements and court testimonies, demonstrating principles that are consonant with our religious beliefs, even as they are expressed in the language of law and human reason. Sometimes our common advocacy will make one of us the target of retribution by intolerant elements. But, despite that, if we stay together and go forward together, the good sense, the common sense, and the generosity of the majority of people, as well as the love that is truly present through God's grace in the hearts of all people will, I believe, bear much fruit.<br><br>When government fails to protect the consciences of its citizens, it falls to religious bodies--especially those formed by the gospel of Jesus Christ--to become the defenders of human freedom. If this continues to be our shared calling, one to which we invite others, then we will defend religious liberty first of all for the good of law itself, knowing that good law protects everyone's rights, no matter how feeble they might be. That's the purpose of law: to defend those who otherwise could not defend themselves. We will be together in this struggle for the good of society itself, believing with Alexis de Tocqueville that churches and religious bodies play a crucial role, a mediating role, in fostering a nation's civic life.<br><br>Finally, we will work together because it is for the good of the people whom we shepherd in our own communities: Mormons and Catholics who take pride in our citizenship as Americans and in our legacy of service to the nation, and who continue to claim full citizenship in this pluralistic country.<br><br>Our churches have different histories and systems of belief and practice, although we acknowledge a common reference point in the person and in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Itstrikes me that, however different our historic journeys and creeds might be, our communities share a common experience of being a religious minority that was persecuted in different ways in mid-19th-century America. We know that religious conviction combined with America's founding vision of religious liberty and justice for all was what sustained our people in a hostile environment and eventually enabled them to emerge from their enclaves to make a very great and significant contribution to the political and cultural life of our nation. It is, therefore, true, especially of our two groups, the Latter-day Saints and the Catholic Church, that the defense of religious liberty affirms what is deepest in our self-identity.<br><br>Dear sisters and brothers, years ago Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the saint who spent her life caring for the sick and the extremely destitute, was bringing supplies to a Palestinian orphanage in the Gaza region of the Holy Land. At one point her vehicle came up to a checkpoint, and a young Israeli soldier asked the diminutive nun whether she or her assistants were carrying any weapons. Mother Teresa replied, "Yes, my prayer books."<br><br>Perhaps in the struggle to defend religious liberty for our churches and for all Americans, our greatest weapon is neither the voting booth nor the legal brief but the prayers that we and our worshipping communities lift up to Almighty God week after week on behalf of our nation.<br><br>My prayer for all of us here today is that we become true blessings to one another in the shared work of advocacy for human rights and dignity so that together we may become a true blessing for the world. I thank you for your kind attention.<br><br><i>His Eminence Francis Cardinal George, OMI, was President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Archbishop of Chicago when he gave this forum address at Brigham Young University on 23 February 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Francis E.

<br>
I am humbled to be standing here today where so many prophets and servants of our Savior have stood. My primary desire--besides wanting to sit down where you are--isto say what the Lord wants me to say. I pray that both you and I may feel the Spirit and be edified.<br><br>When I was 21 I married my eternal companion, although I didn't know that at the time because we were not members of the Church. By the time I was 31, we had joined the Church, we had four children, and my husband was very, very sick, unable to ever work again. We felt prompted that I should go to nursing school so that I could support the family. I started out as a nurse's aide in a local hospital and then went on to get associate, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in nursing. I tell you these things not to boast of myself, because I am no different than you are, but for two reasons: first, to tell you that none of these worldly accolades were possible without the Lord's love, help, and guidance--He never left my family's side or stopped reaching out for us; and second, to talk about choices.<br><br>I have been privileged as a nurse and through many callings to be with individuals and their families at very difficult times--when a loved one just had open-heart surgery, after an adolescent's suicide, when a family member hit bottom and was admitted to a psychiatric unit or a drug treatment program, when sexual abuse toward children was discovered, or in someone's home when a loved one was dying--to name just a few experiences. At each juncture, I noticed the choices people made. Ihave spent hours talking to people who were angry because things didn't turn out the way they wanted or who became offended by someone or who were angry with God. Each time these people made a choice. Often they would ask me, "Why me?" My intent is not to minimize the tribulations we go through. Our trials are exquisitely powerful and painful in so many ways and very genuine. So the question remains: "Why<i>not</i>you?" The Lord loves you, and you have the potential to be stronger and more useful in His service. Or you can choose to let your trials drive a wedge between you and the Savior--exactly what Satan hopes for.<br><br>We are masters of our choices. In fact, we have already fought a war over the right to choose. We were all there in the premortal existence in the Grand Council in Heaven. We were not asked which plan for our progression was the best. We were asked, "Whom shall I send?" (Abraham 3:27). Jesus said He would obey and follow the plan, which required Him to perform the Atonement. Jesus volunteered because of His great love for His Father and for us. Throughout His mortal life, Jesus repeatedly reconfirmed His choice, always expressing to the Father, "Thy will be done" (Matthew 6:10).<br><br>Satan, on the other hand, sought to take away our freedom to choose, entirely negating the plan of happiness. In addition, he wanted all the glory for himself. Heavenly Father chose Jesus. Satan chose to be angry, and a war followed--a battle that is still raging. One-third of our brothers and sisters chose to follow Satan and were cast out and denied the right to receive mortal bodies. All of us here chose the Savior and are here now to be proved and tested to see whom we will choose to follow in this life.<br><br>When challenges come--and come they must because that is why we are here--we choose how we will react. Will we grow toward Christ and our eternal home or not? I have watched as some have chosen to fall away as they succumb to their feelings of being hurt, offended, or angry or when confronted with others' abuse, unfaithfulness, illness, addictions, suicide, and death. Yet others, when faced with the same issues, choose to allow the trial to stretch them, to allow the Savior to carry them through the trial, to seek the guidance of the Spirit, and to feel of the Savior's love and Atonement.<br><br>Through all of these times, I have noticed that as individuals struggled with whatever was facing them, if they turned to Jesus Christ and trusted in Him, they were successful in finding the Savior, finding peace, and finding their way. The outcome may not have always been what they wanted, but one thing was certain: they grew stronger, more loving, more trusting, and more obedient and, filled with faith, they moved closer to the Savior.<br><br>Our second estate is based on choices. If you are going to make a choice, there must be the possibility of more than one choice. How can we appreciate happiness unless we also have felt sadness? There has to be opposition in all things.<br><br>We give up our eternal right to choose when we say, "He (or she) made me angry." I encourage you not to give away your right to choose by handing that power over to someone else. No one can "make" you angry. You make a choice to respond by being angry or by taking offense. But you can also choose to make the effort to find out what is really going on with the other person and understand their behavior--or maybe just agree to disagree.<br><br>We make hundreds, maybe even thousands, of choices daily. Some may be insignificant, such as what you chose to wear today. However, that same decision might be very significant if you chose to wear shorts when there is a blizzard going on outside. Our choices define who we are.<br><br>It was Alma and the Spirit who converted me to the gospel over 30 years ago. My husband and I strongly felt that we should bring up our daughter with some type of religious background. As we investigated many churches, the Lord sent people to talk to us about the LDS Church. It was back in the days before the three-hour block schedule we now have, and every time we went to the local church building, there was no one there. We thought, "This is strange."<br><br>The Lord sent a member of the Church to my husband's place of business in Los Angeles to talk to him about food storage. At the same time, a coworker and I talked about our desire to find a church, and we found out that she had an LDS babysitter. So we arranged to have a dinner at my coworker's home and invite the babysitter and her husband so they could teach us more about the Church. At the last minute, the LDS couple couldn't make it, but they sent the ward mission leader, and we saw the filmstrip<i>Meet the Mormons.</i>But we lived in a different mission from my coworker. We wanted the full-time missionaries to come teach us the gospel, but our names were lost several times.<br><br>Finally our missionaries came. We opened the door and asked them, "What took you so long?" I will always be eternally grateful to Elder Wardle and Elder Mulford for their choices to go on missions. As I read the Book of Mormon for the first time, Alma 32:27 came so powerfully to me: "If ye will ... experiment upon my words." I could do that! While the choice to join the Church brought some opposition from our extended families, it was, and still is, the best decision we ever made.<br><br>After we joined the Church, we continued to nourish the seed. Challenges came: poverty, the birth of a baby with a handicap, my husband becoming disabled, my trying to go to nursing school and working to support our family. When I graduated as an RN with an associate degree, I was pregnant. We were told the name of that child, but he was stillborn a couple of days before I was to take the RN-NCLEX exam. The Lord was there to help us through. We were taught about unconditional love, survival, obedience, and submissiveness to the will of the Lord and that the Lord was always near to lift us up. Occasionally I wondered why the Lord was not as near, and I realized He was not the one who had moved away--Ihad.<br><br>I taught early-morning seminary at six o'clock in the morning for four years. I love Lehi's vision (see 1 Nephi 8). Once, one of my students painted a full mural about 8 feet by 10 feet on my living room wall of Lehi's vision. It was a great reminder to me of God's love for us--how He desires for us to come home and actually shows us the way to return.<br><br>Lehi's vision is really a schematic or blueprint for living in our second estate. To reach the tree of life and taste of the love of God, we must choose to walk in the strait and narrow path by holding fast to the iron rod. Did you notice that you cannot sit down on the iron rod or the strait and narrow path? You must press forward. Nephi tells us:<br><br><i>Ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting</i>[not snacking]<i>upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.</i>[2 Nephi 31:20]<br><br>Many, including those in the tall and spacious building, will not even enter onto this path. Or they may start on the path, but when times get tough, for one reason or another, they will choose to go off the path, and even those who do make it to the tree of life and taste of God's love may respond to the mocking people in that tall and spacious building by becoming ashamed and making the choice to leave, thus suffering the consequences of not enduring to the end.<br><br>When we moved from that house, we wallpapered over that mural. I often wondered what the new owners thought when they took down the wallpaper and saw Lehi's vision.<br><br>We had a son, Seth, who was born with Down syndrome. He loved everyone and would never allow anyone in his presence to get upset or to use the word<i>stupid.</i>He would always tell us, "Calm down. Relax." One day when he was 20, he came to me and said that he wanted to go home. I said "Silly, you are home." He said, "No, I want to go to my home far away." Shortly afterward he was diagnosed with leukemia and was dead seven months later. In those seven months Seth spent his time helping us to get ready for him to leave. He decorated his entire room from floor to ceiling with pictures of rainbows to remind us that God loves us.<br><br>There were many miracles during those seven months. I will mention only one. My oldest son, David, and his beautiful wife, Leah, were getting married in the Washington D.C. Temple. Seth was very ill, and we knew that he probably didn't have much longer to live. Itwas a difficult choice for me to choose which son to be with that day: with my son as he was married for time and all eternity or with my son who was dying.<br><br>I stayed with Seth, and my husband went with David to the temple. Seth wanted to go to the reception that night very, very badly. We decided to let him go for just a few moments and even planned to take him there in a wheelchair because he was so weak and had difficulty keeping food down.<br><br>When we got to the reception, Seth would have none of that. He ate what he wanted and he danced with all the young women there. He didn't want to leave for hours, but eventually we took him home, where he immediately was very sick again. He died a day later. I learned so much from Seth, particularly about unconditional love. We chose to look for the spiritual and positive things in this experience, and we found them.<br><br>Over the 27 years my husband, Joel, was sick, I noticed that he became stronger spiritually as his physical health declined. He never complained. It still amazes me that despite the literally hundreds of doctor visits, procedures, hospitalizations, and surgeries, he didn't see himself as sick until the last three months of his life. He always looked for the positive despite being in constant pain. He had some partial amputation of toes. When people would ask him how he felt, he would say "Well, if the Lord is going to take me a piece at a time, I'm glad that He started at that end"--a quote he had heard attributed to Bruce R. McConkie. He always looked forward to his renewed perfect body. Even in the last two days of his life when our dear bishop came to our home and asked him if he had any message for our ward family, Joel quickly replied, "He lives!"<br><br>But not everyone who has trials seeks for the positive aspects of that learning. A woman I knew came to me complaining that her husband had left her and that they were getting a divorce. She said, "I have been active in the Church, always paid my tithing, always accepted any calling, and this is what I get?" She chose to leave the Church because she could not look beyond her pain to the lessons she could learn. She chose instead to be bitter. She chose to look for the negative, and she found it.<br><br>Sometimes we don't make such great choices. The Lord loves us so much that we can, through applying the power of the Atonement, repent. Accessing the Atonement on a daily basis, even on a minute-to-minute basis sometimes, is necessary. We don't have to be perfect--after all we can do, the Savior does the rest. When we repent we<i>choose to be changed,</i>to be spiritually stronger, and to come closer to the Savior. Choosing to repent, while it does not take away the consequences of our choice, does turn us around and point us in the direction of the Savior. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:<br><br><i>The soul that comes unto Christ, who knows His voice and strives to do as He did, finds a strength, as the hymn says, "beyond [his] own." The Savior reminds us that He has "graven [us] upon the palms of [His] hands.</i>"<i>Considering the incomprehensible cost of the Crucifixion and Atonement, Ipromise you He is not going to turn His back on us now. When He says to the poor in spirit, "Come unto me," He means He knows the way out and He knows the way up. He knows it because He has walked it. He knows the way because He</i>is<i>the way.</i>["Broken Things to Mend,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2006, 71; emphasis in original]<br><br>Christ is our GPS--He will guide us successfully back home if we will but choose to follow Him.<br><br>We must, as we have been told many times in the scriptures, choose whom we will serve (see Joshua 24:15; Alma 30:8; Moses 6:33). Elder Boyd K. Packer taught:<br><br><i>Our lives are made up of thousands of everyday choices. Over the years these little choices will be bundled together and show clearly what we value.</i><br><br><i>The crucial test of life ... does not center in the choice between fame and obscurity, nor between wealth and poverty. The greatest decision of life is between good and evil.</i>["The Choice,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1980, 21]<br><br>There really are only two choices for us: we are either for or against the Savior. The Savior Himself said, "He that is not with me is against me" (Matthew 12:30). You cannot sit on the fence or be neutral or lukewarm. If Satan can get you to sit on the fence and be lukewarm, you are essentially deactivated--out of the battle raging for the souls of men and not valiant. You have not chosen the Savior. In D&amp;amp;C 76:79 we are warned that if we are "not valiant in the testimony of Jesus" we will inherit the terrestrial (not the celestial) glory. However, as Lehi tells us, we are always free to "choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil" (see 2 Nephi 2:27).<br><br>As we come to love the Savior more and more, we realize that He has given us so much, lending us the very air we breathe, as King Benjamin tells us (see Mosiah 2:21). He has given us the scriptures, the Holy Ghost, the priesthood, Relief Society, family, prophets, General Authorities, stake and ward leaders, and each other to help us return home. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught:<br><br><i>Our wills constitute all we really have to give God anyway. The usual gifts and their derivatives we give to Him could be stamped justifiably "Return to Sender."</i>["Consecrate Thy Performance,"<i>Liahona,</i>December 2008, 24]<br><br>The vast majority of you have chosen to be here today at this time because of your love of the Savior. You want to be spiritually strong. Me too! President Thomas S. Monson said:<br><br><i>We need not feel that we must be without fault in order to receive the blessings of God. He will take us from where we now stand if we will come to him. He will build us up, spiritually, and he will build us up with confidence in ourselves.</i>["The Message: 3R's of Free Agency,"<i>New Era,</i>April 1973, 5]<br><br>You may not think of yourselves as leaders in the cause of Zion, but you are. Your example influences those around you. Your choices influence others' choices. You are here at this time for a reason. President Ezra Taft Benson said:<br><br><i>Each day we personally make many decisions showing the cause we support. The final outcome is certain--the forces of righteousness will win. But what remains to be seen is</i>where<i>each of us personally, now and in the future, will stand in this battle--and</i>how tall<i>we will stand. Will we be true to our last days and fulfill our foreordained missions?</i>[President Ezra Taft Benson, "First Presidency Message: In His Steps,"<i>Ensign,</i>September 1988, 2; emphasis in original]<br><br>Yes, these are difficult times we live in. Yes, we will have struggles to wade through. Yes, as President Henry B. Eyring has said, "As the forces around us increase in intensity, whatever spiritual strength was once sufficient will not be enough." But President Eyring immediately went on to say, "And whatever growth in spiritual strength we once thought was possible, greater growth will be made available to us" (<i>Because He First Loved Us</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2002], 66–67). We are not alone if we choose not to be. The Savior will always be reaching out to us to lift us up.<br><br>I would never have chosen the trials that I have been given. But I know that the Lord knows the beginning from the end. He loves me and He loves you and He knows exactly how to strengthen us. I am very glad I have had those experiences because I have learned so much. In fact, the more I learn, the more I realize how little I know. I didn't always make the best choices, but I know that choices are fundamental to our existence and to our success in life. I exhort you to grow toward the Savior. If you do, you will be successful. When we put the Savior first in our lives, everything literally falls into place.<br><br>This much I know: He<i>lives!</i>The Savior knows each of us individually--He knows our names! (How great is that?) He<i>loves</i>us individually. He<i>saves</i>us individually. He gave His perfect life for us. He wants us to succeed and come home, and He will never stop reaching after us. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Barbara Heise was a BYU professor in the College of Nursing when this devotional address was given on 2 March 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ne Nature and Destiny of Women - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
The Family: A Proclamation to the World" states:<br><br><i>All human beings--male and female--are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>My focus this morning will be on the divine nature and destiny of women and the sacred role they play in the sanctification and purification of men.<br><br>I'm going to start by giving you two exclusive scoops. First, males and females are different. Second, those differences are more than physical.<br><br>I developed a love and appreciation for womanhood in my childhood. My mother, sisters, grandmas, aunts, and female cousins and friends brought immeasurable love into my young life. This set the stage for the adult relationships with my wife, daughters, and granddaughters.<br><br>All of the above have contributed to my feelings of reverence, adoration, and even veneration of righteous women.<br><br>In pondering the effect women have had on my life, I have concluded that there has been a metamorphosis of my spirit that could not have taken place without these relationships.<br><br>Of course, the first woman in my life was my mother. How can I describe the impact of my mother's love? A lullaby, being tucked in bed, are you warm enough, a kiss goodnight, Glenn, you'd better get up, you don't want to be late for school, a kiss good morning, you are such a special boy, oh honey, how I love you, I made some chocolate chip cookies, I want to take your picture, I'm so proud of you, I know you can do it, are you going to go on a mission, you are going to go on a mission, I miss you so much, frequent love notes, let's go look at the roses, did you see the full moon, aren't the mountains beautiful today, the love in her eyes, her touch, her smell, her elegance, her tender heart, her sensitivity, her femininity.<br><br>That was just a blink in a lifetime of nurturing.<br><br>In addition to the loving care I received from my mother, I received similar nurturing from my big sister, who was my mentor and protector.<br><br>When I was old enough to enter kindergarten, I was worried sick. I had watched my sister do her homework and was concerned by the fact that I didn't know how to read or do arithmetic. The night before school started, my apprehension must have shown, because she came into the bedroom and started talking to me about school. I explained my concerns, and she immediately began to allay my fears. She told me about recess. I could handle that. Then she explained that I would be taught to read one word at a time, and she assured me that Iwas smart and wouldn't have any trouble.<br><br>Now, how would a brother handle a situation like that?<br><br>"Wow, you're in big trouble! You may never graduate from kindergarten. But I'll tell you what I'm going to do. If you will give me your allowance, I'll help you."<br><br>As I mentioned earlier, men and women are different.<br><br>My appreciation for women rose to a whole new dimension when our two daughters came into our lives. There is something angelic about daughters--at least in the eyes of their father.<br><br>I have sometimes lamented that I wasn't born with the perspective daughters brought into my life. If a man could be born with that insight, his respect for and treatment of a young woman during his dating years would improve significantly.<br><br>I remember a time when my oldest daughter was just six or seven years old. I was struggling with saying my personal prayers on a consistent basis. I remember walking into her bedroom one night to listen to her say her prayers. Her room felt so peaceful, innocent, and pure that I felt like praying. I explained as best I could that I'd like to get into the habit of saying my prayers and asked if I could pray at her bedside. She looked a little puzzled but agreed. On the second or third night, as I began my silent prayer, I felt her little hand on my head. She then turned on her side and with both hands began running her fingers through my hair. I felt touched by an angel. I must admit, itfelt so good that my prayers became longer.<br><br>To this day, whenever there is a family gathering, I will eventually work my way over to the couch or chair where she is located, sit on the floor, and wait for her to run her fingers through my hair.<br><br>From the time my second daughter was a baby through her early grade-school years, I would rock her to sleep at night and carry her to bed. I always knew when she was asleep because tiny beads of perspiration would appear on her little nose. I would look at her angelic face and wonder if heaven could feel any better than this.<br><br>I concluded it must be a great comfort to her to fall asleep in her father's arms. Now I realize the peace and comfort she transmitted to me was possibly even greater.<br><br>I have always been impressed with the love and respect our Savior bestowed upon the women in His life. As we read about these associations, our focus is generally on what He taught them and the love and understanding He gave them. Have you ever considered the possibility that these women provided immense comfort to His burdened soul? It is my belief that He needed them as He journeyed toward living a perfect life so He could provide the ultimate sacrifice.<br><br>I repeat that my associations and interplay with the righteous women in my life have created a metamorphosis of my spirit and have been purifying and sanctifying.<br><br>I'd now like to turn to the more intimate relationship of husband and wife and the impact that relationship has on our exaltation.<br><br>You are all familiar with the story of the Creation. I'm going to pick up the account where Adam was placed on the earth. Please pay particular attention to the sequence of events leading up to the introduction of Eve.<br><br><i>And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</i><br><br><i>And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in Eden, and there they put the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed.</i><br><br><i>And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the tree of life, also, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</i>[Abraham 5:7–9]<br><br>Thus far there is no mention of Eve.<br><br><i>And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life, and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.</i><br><br><i>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for him.</i>[Moses 3:19–20]<br><br>In summary, before Eve appeared, the world had been created, Adam had been placed in the Garden of Eden, and he had named and associated with all of the animals. He was enjoying a utopia in physical surroundings as well as open communication with God. What more could he ask for? What more could he need?<br><br>As President J. Reuben Clark put it:<br><br><i>Adam wandered alone in the glorious Garden in Eden, which he had dressed and adorned--the Garden of Eden with its stately trees, its lovely flowers heavy with sweet odors, its grassy swards, its magnificent vistas with the far reaches of its placid rivers, with its gaily plumed birds, its lordly and graceful beasts, all at peace, for sin was not yet in the world. Through all this magnificence Adam wandered, lonely, unsolaced, uncompanioned, the only being of his kind in the whole world, his life unshared in a solitude of exquisite elegance, and, what was of far greater moment, his mission, as he knew it to be, impossible of fulfillment, except the Father gave him an helpmeet.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>I'd like to share a perspective from John Milton's<i>Paradise Lost</i>that fully resonates with my soul.<br><br>Much like President Clark, Milton describes the beauty of the Garden and the variety of animals. However, he goes into more detail on his perception of Adam's frustration and loneliness. In his account, Adam watches the interplay between the animals and communicates with them as best he can. However, Adam concludes something is drastically amiss. Milton wrote:<br><br><i>They rejoice</i><br><i>Each with their kind, lion with lioness;</i><br><i>So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd;</i><br><i>Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl</i><br><i>So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;</i><br><i>Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>In other words, Adam is saying, "What's wrong with this picture?"<br><br>Milton goes on to suggest that God delayed the introduction of Eve until Adam could fully appreciate her. Seeing that Adam is now ready for the introduction of Eve, God describes what is going to happen next. I love Milton's description of what Eve would mean to Adam:<br><br><i>What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd,</i><br><i>Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,</i><br><i>Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>"Thy fit help"? No, this doesn't mean she would be in good shape. It means she would be a match, a complement, a counterpart, even his "other self."<br><br>Finally, Eve stood before him, and she exceeded his highest expectations. He had never seen anything like her in the garden. Milton continues:<br><br><i>Under his forming hands a creature grew,</i><br><i>Manlike, but different sex, so lovely fair,</i><br><i>That what seem'd fair in all the world, seem'd now</i><br><i>Mean, or in her summ'd up, in her contain'd,</i><br><i>And in her looks, which from that time infus'd</i><br><i>Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before.</i><sup>5</sup><i></i><br><br>I hope Milton will forgive me for adding my opinion that the "sweetness" Adam felt, which was "unfelt before," was much more than that which was generated by Eve's physical appearance. Those feelings flowing into him had as their source her wellspring. His feelings were the direct result of standing in front of one of the daughters of heavenly parents who had a divine nature different from, but complementary to, his own divine nature.<br><br>I believe the Father's statement "It is not good that the man should be alone" (Genesis 2:18) had a much more profound meaning than the obvious biological implications. It also went further than providing Adam with "company." Adam's ability to obtain the purification necessary to get back into the presence of God was dependent upon his continuous association with Eve.<br><br>Remember what Adam said when Eve stood beside him for the first time: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (Abraham 5:18).<br><br>Many years after the creation of Adam and Eve, Paul said, "Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 11:11).<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;</i><br><br><i>And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 131:1–3]<br><br>Why can't he obtain it? It's not just because he didn't obey a celestial commandment. It's because he didn't become a celestial being. There is a limit to our spiritual development as long as we are single. There is a spiritual development that can only be obtained when a man and a woman join their incomplete selves into a complete couple. Just as conception requires the physical union of male and female, perfection requires the union of the very souls of male and female.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott has said:<br><br><i>In the Lord's plan, it takes two--a man and a woman--to form a whole. Indeed, a husband and wife are not two identical halves, but a wondrous, divinely determined combination of complementary capacities and characteristics.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Men and women can accomplish marvelous things alone. However, they are incomplete until united intellectually, emotionally, physically, and, most important, spiritually.<br><br>The world we live in has gone awry with its focus on the physical part of the male and female relationship. If there is too much focus on the physical, the vital areas of intellectual, emotional, and spiritual union are not being placed in an environment where they can flourish and grow. Our current society is so obsessed with "making love" that they are not developing a complete relationship that would enable them to "express love."<br><br>Since melding our divine natures is a necessary element in bringing about perfection, we must guard against any deterioration of those natures. Sisters, keep in mind anything that detracts from your divine nature should be avoided. You live in a time when you have more opportunities and options available to you than any other women have had throughout the history of mankind. Some of these options will complement your God-given natures. Others will chip away at it. Some things will make you strong. Others will make you hard. Some will increase your spiritual sensitivity. Others will separate you from the Spirit.<br><br>If the world keeps chipping away at the divine nature of women, it is probable that our relationships in marriage will not bring about the sanctification necessary for exaltation or, as a minimum, the process will be delayed.<br><br>I express my love and appreciation to my wife. She is an example of one who has retained her eternal nature through 47 years of marriage, six children, 29 grandchildren, and putting up with me.<br><br>Wearing that eternal nature well, she has supported me as a General Authority for 25 years. I could not have served nor would I have been qualified to serve without her love and support. She has been the crucial key to the metamorphosis I desperately needed to become worthy and able to serve.<br><br>Her eternal nature and destiny was never clearer to me than at the temple marriage of our youngest son. I have had the sacred honor of performing the temple marriages of all six of our children, and they along with their spouses were worthy to be in attendance on this occasion.<br><br>Prior to the ceremony as I spoke of sacred things, I looked at my wife, who was seated next to our son. My spiritual eyes were opened, and I saw her shining in all of her glory as she basked in the warmth of having joy and rejoicing in her posterity. She was radiant. I saw before me a priestess, queen, and goddess. There is absolutely nothing the world can offer that could come close to the fulfillment she was feeling. There was no accomplishment in the world she could have attained that would have made me love her more or be more proud of her efforts. Her eternal nature was then and is now still intact.<br><br>We commonly hear the phrase "Men have the priesthood and women have been given the blessing of procreation." Without perfection, neither assignment meets the full measure of its creation. After perfection comes the ultimate role of god or goddess. These are eternal roles in which one continues to complement the other throughout all eternity.<br><br>It is the marriage ceremony in the temple in which husband and wife receive the power to perfect their relationship and, thereby, obtain their exaltation.<br><br>Elder John A. Widtsoe put it this way:<br><br><i>Modern revelation sets forth the high destiny of those who are sealed for everlasting companionship. They will be given opportunity for a greater use of their powers. That means progress. They will attain more readily to their place in the presence of the Lord; they will increase more rapidly in every divine power; they will approach more nearly to the likeness of God; they will more completely realize their divine destiny. And this progress is not delayed until life after death. It begins here, today, for those who yield obedience to the law.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>I emphasize that the power coming down from heaven on those married in the temple by the holy priesthood cannot alone bring about the progress mentioned by Elder Widtsoe. It takes the righteous interplay of male and female.<br><br>I like the Quaker proverb "Thee lift me and I'll lift thee and we'll both ascend together."<sup>8</sup><br><br>What will happen when we finally "ascend together"? I can put it no better than did one of the great women in our history, Eliza R. Snow, who said:<br><br><i>When I leave this frail existence,</i><br><i>When I lay this mortal by,</i><br><i>Father, Mother, may I meet you</i><br><i>In your royal courts on high?</i><br><i>Then, at length, when I've completed</i><br><i>All you sent me forth to do,</i><br><i>With your mutual approbation</i><br><i>Let me come and dwell with you.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>Sisters, I testify that when you stand in front of your heavenly parents in those royal courts on high and look into Her eyes and behold Her countenance, any question you ever had about the role of women in the kingdom will evaporate into the rich celestial air, because at that moment you will see standing directly in front of you, your divine nature and destiny. I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Glenn L.

<h1>nds Do Stand By Thee: Mentors and Friendship - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear young friends, it is a great privilege and honor to be able to address you in this CES fireside. I am grateful to be here in the Marriott Center on the campus of Brigham Young University and to speak to those of you gathered in locations throughout the entire world in many different circumstances and languages. Thank you for coming. You honor the Lord Jesus Christ by putting aside other matters in your lives to join together at this time. Iam grateful to be here with my wife, Melanie, and a number of our family and dear friends.<br><br>I pray that my remarks will be guided by the Holy Ghost and that you will feel in your own hearts that what I have to say has relevancy to what you are facing and what you are experiencing at this time in your lives.<br><h2><b>The Importance of Righteous Friendships</b></h2><br>Many years ago, in March of 1839, the Prophet Joseph Smith, with several of his companions, had been wrongfully incarcerated for months at Liberty Jail. Many writers of Church history have said that this experience for the Prophet Joseph was certainly one of the most difficult and darkest periods of his entire life. His words "O God, where art thou?" (D&amp;amp;C 121:1)--as recorded in section 121 of the Doctrine and Covenants--speak of a desperate loneliness in the bleakest of settings.<br><br>The Lord did not appear or send angels; He did not thrash the guards or swing wide the door of that damp, dirty cell. Put simply, He did not change the circumstances, but He spoke comfort and reassurance to Joseph like no other could: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment" (D&amp;amp;C 121:7). It was as if the Lord put His arm around Joseph when He said, "My son." Those are precious and tender words. And then He put a timetable on Joseph's hardship--"a small moment." What a lesson for all of us to remember. Our hardships will be brief--in eternal terms--and the Lord will be right there.<br><br>Then the Lord said this: "Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands" (D&amp;amp;C 121:9).<br><br>Here was Joseph, locked in jail by the treachery of men, some of whom had once been his close associates. But the Lord made the point so clear--"thy friends do stand by thee." How comforting that declaration was to the Prophet Joseph; how comforting to us. Think for a minute what it means to you to know you have someone standing right by you, someone you can trust to be your friend on good days and bad, someone who values you and supports you even when the two of you are apart.<br><br>Our most prized friend is Jesus Christ Himself. Is there any greater assurance than His "I will be on your right hand and on your left, . . . and mine angels round about you, to bear you up" (D&amp;amp;C 84:88)? So often those "angels round about" are our friends.<br><br>My message tonight centers on the importance in each of our lives of righteous friendships. In my youth, an inspired patriarch laid his hands on my head and by revelation opened to me an understanding of my potential--for who I really am--and gave a direction for my life, just like a patriarch has done for most of you. I was told that I would not lack for friends and associates, that their friendship would be a special blessing to me both temporally as well as spiritually. I was counseled to select for my closest friends those who were righteous and had a desire to keep the commandments of God.<br><br>That passage from my patriarchal blessing and the verse from section 121 have been like a comfort blanket to me throughout my life. At times, especially while living away from home, those words have given me a peace and strength--my friends were standing by, although separated by many miles. And at such times I learned one of life's most important lessons, that no matter how long I was away, no matter how great the distance, whenever my friends and I met again, it was as if nothing had changed. We picked up our lives where we left off, and it was as if time had stood still.<br><br>Why do I emphasize that? Because in today's world so many people willingly trade those friendships for video characters and quick text messages. They spend their time identifying with television personalities who for them are only faces on a screen. They are choosing to "hang out" rather than commit to a deep and meaningful relationship that can be sealed in the temple for eternity. Think about it. True friendships are based on love of God and sharing that love with others. That was one of the messages in Liberty Jail.<br><br>From my earliest days growing up in the Cottonwood Stake in the Salt Lake Valley, friends have been a special blessing to me. The closest friends made in my youth remain my friends to this day. Some are here with us tonight. It has always been that way; we have always been there for each other. And I have been grateful to make new friends who have been a strength and blessing to me as well.<br><br>When I think of friendship, I think of the example of President Thomas S. Monson. Consider this teaching of our beloved prophet. He said:<br><br><i>Friends help to determine your future. You will tend to be like them and to be found where they choose to go. Remember, the path we follow in this life leads to the path we follow in the next.</i><br><br><i>In a survey made in selected wards and stakes of the Church, we learned a most significant fact: Those persons whose friends married in the temple usually married in the temple, while those persons whose friends did not marry in the temple usually did not marry in the temple. This same fact pertained also to full-time missionary service. The influence of one's friends appeared to be a highly dominant factor--even equal to parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.</i><br><br><i>The friends you choose will either help or hinder your success.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Those are sobering words.<br><br>Who wouldn't choose President Monson as a friend? He gives away his trains at Christmastime, he gives the clothes off his back and the shoes off his feet to people who don't have any, he gives countless hours to those so often forgotten in care centers or struggling for life in hospitals, and he shares his joy for life with all of us when he wiggles his ears. What's not to like? When a group of missionaries was asked to identify one of President Monson's greatest attributes, almost all chose his love for people. One even suggested he wished he could live next door to the prophet because he knew they would then become good friends.<br><br>I have found the Brethren's counsel on friendship to ring true with my own experience and be particularly applicable today. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said:<br><br><i>Whether young or old, we need to be good friends, but also to pick our friends carefully. By choosing the Lord</i>first,<i>choosing one's friends becomes easier and much safer. Consider the contrasting friendships in the city of Enoch compared to peers in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah! The citizens of the city of Enoch chose Jesus and a way of life, then became everlasting friends. So much depends on whom and what we seek</i>first.<sup>2</sup><br><h2><b>Mentoring Friendships</b></h2><br>Some friends are wise and trusted mentors. They are a special kind of friend; they have gone before us, and they know the way. And they too "stand by" us. Who were Joseph Smith's mentors? Moroni comes immediately to mind; ancient disciples; John the Baptist; Peter, James, and John; Paul; Joseph's mother and father; his brother Alvin--the list is impressive. It is fair to say he was found in good company.<br><br>Consider for a minute those who have mentored each of you. Do you desire to mentor others as opportunities come in the future? Are you preparing to share your testimony of the gospel and your grasp of how to be successful in our everyday pursuits?<br><br>History and the scriptures are full of examples of men and women who have served as righteous mentors. Perhaps the most obvious is our Lord Jesus Christ as He established His Church in the meridian of time. At the beginning of His ministry, He selected 12 seemingly ordinary men who left their normal occupations and spent three years in His company. They traveled with Him, listened to His sermons, ate meals with Him, witnessed the miracles He performed, and were the recipients of many private moments of instruction. What an unparalleled blessing it was for them to be personally tutored by our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Each of them was personally changed by that privileged association.<br><br>Another example in a somewhat unusual reversal of roles is Joseph Smith, who became a spiritual mentor to his older brother Hyrum. Hyrum, humble and teachable, stood by Joseph's side. He was there in Liberty Jail, and he fell first at Carthage. Hyrum chose as his mentor the prophet of God. He chose well.<br><br>In our day, and in my service as a General Authority, members of the Quorum of the Twelve take a profound interest in our lives, generously conveying to us their experiences and effectively teaching us how to fulfill our sacred summons to this ministry. I recall a comment made by Brigham Young when he said of the Prophet Joseph: "I feel like shouting hallelujah, all the time, when I think that I ever knew Joseph Smith, the Prophet."<sup>3</sup>I have felt that way about a number of the leaders of ourday.<br><br>In each case, a more experienced, trusted individual serves as an effective guide and adviser to a less-experienced person, helping to shape that person's understanding and teaching principles that will make him or her more effective, stronger, wiser, and more valuable as a servant of God.<br><br>Pause for a minute now and think: Who has mentored you? What have you learned from them that is life changing? How have they watched over you? How will you take their example and be a mentor yourself to younger brothers and sisters, friends, and colleagues--those who may need and desire such a relationship?<br><h2><b>An Example of a Mentoring Friendship</b></h2><br>Let me give you an example from my own life. I have been blessed to have such dear friend-mentor relationships in my life with Elder Jon M. Huntsman--Area Seventy, philanthropist, benefactor, founder of the Huntsman group of companies, and my friend.<br><br>I first met Jon Huntsman in 1975, when I was 24 years old. I was an elders quorum president for a University of Utah married-student ward, and Jon Huntsman was my high council adviser. We became friends, and in my senior year, as I was preparing to conclude my education at the university, Brother Huntsman recruited me as a sales representative in his plastics company.<br><br>One of my very first assigned accounts was Avon, the cosmetic giant headquartered in New York City. To get me started with that important client, Brother Huntsman personally accompanied me to New York City for my initial introduction. Excited to be entering into a new career and anxious to make a good impression, I wore my best brown college suit with a brown tie and brown loafers. When we met at the airport, I noticed that Mr. Huntsman gave me a peculiar look. But he didn't say anything!<br><br>When we arrived in New York City, he told me there was a stop we needed to make before calling upon Avon. We went directly to a famous men's clothing store known as Brooks Brothers on swanky Madison Avenue. On the way, I recall him saying to me, "Now, Ron, if you are going to be a salesman in my company, and if you are going to represent me to Avon, you are going to learn how to dress, how to act, and how to serve in this new role." And then he added, "You don't wear brown suits in a business environment in New York City!" Not representing Jon Huntsman at least!<br><br>Jon knew the people at Brooks Brothers, and he watched as they fitted me with a beautiful, dark gray, pin-striped suit--the nicest I had ever seen and certainly the nicest I had ever owned. After it was taken away to be tailored for a perfect fit, we picked out a shirt, some ties, a belt, and all the accessories. Next we went to the shoe department, where Jon introduced me to my very first pair of black wingtip dress shoes.<br><br>I guess Brother Huntsman's account at Brooks Brothers gave him special privileges because after we had had lunch, we returned to the store, where my new business wardrobe was ready, courtesy of Jon M. Huntsman.<br><br>I remember my gratitude to Jon for sparing me the needless embarrassment of showing up in my college clothes. As I stuffed--and that's exactly what I did--my brown outfit into a bag, I realized he had made sure I was properly dressed! Then it was off to Avon, where he introduced me as their new account representative from his company. Jon was teaching me much more than the importance of looking the part. He was introducing me into a whole new way of thinking, of doing things, of representing myself to others. He was mentoring me. This was the first of many such valuable lessons I learned from him.<br><br>Years later, while serving as an executive in Brother Huntsman's company, I was very involved in my duties, which took me around the globe. Returning from one of these business trips, Brother Huntsman, a stake president at this time, asked me what I was doing in the Church. I told him I was happily teaching a gospel doctrine class in Sunday School. He asked me what kinds of experiences I had had in Church leadership. I told him I had enjoyed serving in several presidencies, but most of my Church service, very happily, had been in teaching.<br><br>After I explained this to Brother Huntsman, he told me of a similar time in his life when he had been called to serve in a student stake, first as a high councilor and later as a bishop. He found it ideal for his busy schedule. In fact, as I mentioned earlier in this message, that was where I first met Jon Huntsman.<br><br>He said he knew a brother at the University of Utah who was serving as the stake president of one of the university married stakes who could fill Church-service positions with brethren from across the Salt Lake Valley. Brother Huntsman asked if he might phone this stake president and let him know of my name. I agreed and really did not think of it again, knowing how busy he was.<br><br>Sometime later I received a call from Robert Fotheringham, the president of what was then the University of Utah First Stake. He asked if he and his counselors might come to our home and visit with Sister Rasband and me. Not many days later all three of the stake presidency were sitting on the couch in our living room, inquiring about our situation and feeling our testimonies. After a searching interview with each of us, the three men looked at each other knowingly, and the stake president then extended a call to me to serve as a member of the University of Utah First Stake high council. They said they had already talked to my resident stake president and that he felt fine about the call--if they should want to move forward.<br><br>I accepted that call and began my service in the University of Utah First Stake. As a part of my assignment, Sister Rasband and our young family enjoyed a wonderful opportunity to develop choice Christ-centered relationships with the young married students. After serving for a period of time on the high council, I was called as the bishop of the 10th Ward in that stake.<br><br>I later found out that Brother Huntsman didcall President Fotheringham and simply suggested that he knew someone who might do well in a university campus setting. Hence, my dear friend and mentor Jon Huntsman, merely by mentioning my name for a possible interview, provided another kind of experience for me in Church service.<br><br>I think of the wonderful young people I met in that university ward setting and the opportunity I had to assist several of them in finding employment themselves, one who is here with us tonight. Most importantly, I had the privilege of bearing witness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and establishing righteous friendships in a way similar to what Brother Huntsman did for me.<br><br>Later, when Sister Rasband and I were called to preside over the New York New York North Mission, we enjoyed the privilege of working with many faithful missionaries. We were able to help them not only be more effective in their current callings as servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, but our connection has continued to this day as we assist them with letters of recommendation, counsel, encouragement, and all of our love. I do have to admit I have not bought anyone a new suit and wingtips . . . yet!<br><br>As these few examples show, I am a very strong believer in friend-mentor relationships.<br><h2><b>Accept Counsel from Mentors</b></h2><br>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who served as a mentor for so many--including me--said:<br><br><i>Each of us, from time to time, is mentored and has chances to mentor. In my experience, truthful and caring one-liners that occur within such nurturing relationships have a long shelf life! You can probably recount three or four examples of how people have said something--probably a sentence or clause--and you remember it still. It moves and touches you still.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>I think of the young mother who always said to her children when times were tough, "We can do this." They believed her. Or the missionary who told his new companion fresh from the MTC, "Expect a miracle every day." He did, and that faith set the course of the new elder's mission. Or President Monson concluding his message and acknowledging a young man eight rows back in a sea of 5,000 youth assembled at an East Coast Scout Jamboree. That young man was my 12-year-old son, whom he had met on several occasions. Believe me, my son will never forget that President Monson called him by name and said, "Chris Rasband, come up here and say hello." And what greater example than the Savior, who looked at a humble group of fishermen and said these simple words: "Follow me" (Matthew 4:19).<br><br>In this day and time, described by the Apostle Paul as a "perilous" time (2 Timothy 3:1), recorded by the Prophet Joseph Smith as a"day of . . . calamity" (D&amp;amp;C 136:35), described by Nephi in the Book of Mormon as a day when the adversary would "rage in the hearts of the children of men" (2 Nephi 28:20), I suggest to all of you, my dear young friends, the importance of developing sound and wonderful friendships with wise and trusted mentors.<br><br>Sometimes we are reluctant to receive counsel; we push back from someone offering us suggestions. We get the notion that we already know what we need to know; pride gets in the way. When that occurs we forfeit the wisdom, information, or experience which would otherwise bless our lives. Imagine the difference it might have made in my relationship with Brother Huntsman, or in my career, if I had been too proud to accept his generous offer of a new suit.<br><br>This is often the case in our youthful relationships with our parents, whom we sometimes think of as old-fashioned, uninformed, or simply "not cool!" So at times it is easy to dismiss their teachings as irrelevant in our lives. Many of us have heard the statement "When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years." Although we do not know who penned this quote, its message is instructive for each of us. Moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas have a lot to offer. Do not discount what their experiences have taught them and the love they have for you. They are perhaps your ultimate earthly mentors. Sister Rasband and I now treasure the opportunity we have to be grandparents. What a thrill it is when our grandchildren ask us a question or seek some direction on some important matter in their lives.<br><br>Others who may have valuable input, but who we on occasion tend to ignore, are our in-laws. Their experiences are often as pertinent as those of our parents. We would do well to respect their opinions and give consideration to their input. Many of you do not have in-laws yet, but I'm confident you will someday! Take time to learn from them and solicit their opinions. Doing so will certainly add to your own wisdom.<br><br>For each one of you within the sound of my voice and those who will read this message later, there are many other potential mentors available to you. Let me suggest a few: bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, quorum leaders, professors, seminary and institute teachers, trusted friends and colleagues, Relief Society sisters, and so many others. I have benefitted from so many of their examples and teachings, and so have you! Take full advantage of their ideas, and let their influence inspire and bless your lives too.<br><h2><b>Be Good Friends</b></h2><br>It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of being good friends. Becoming such friends is not always easy. Ralph Waldo Emerson gave great counsel when he observed, "The only way to have a friend is to be one."<sup>5</sup>And the old cliché "Birds of a feather flock together" is still true. To have friends who live high standards, who stand for virtue and goodness, who are faithful and true to their covenants, you must be such a person to them.<br><br>In this world where there is so much sleaze, permissiveness, and immorality, having good friends will go a long way in ensuring our ability to withstand the evils of this, our day. For those who are still single, having good friends will put you in a position to attract the kind of eternal companion you will hope to find. Such was the case with Sister Rasband. We were first great friends. An invitation for marriage came later.<br><h2><b>Jesus Christ Is Our Exemplar in Friendship</b></h2><br>As we think of friendship, think of what the Prophet Joseph Smith saw in a vision and recorded of the Apostles preaching in England:<br><br><i>I saw the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth, who hold the keys of this last ministry, in foreign lands, standing together in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen, with their eyes cast downward, and Jesus standing in their midst, and they did not behold Him. The Savior looked upon them and wept.</i><sup>6</sup><br><br>Though they did not see Him, Jesus stood by them. Aware of their plight and sympathetic to their hardship, it was His loving support that sustained them in their mission and brought hundreds and thousands of new converts into the Church. It was the Savior who said to His disciples, "Ye are my friends" (D&amp;amp;C 84:63). It was the Savior who taught, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). It was the Savior who beckoned, "Come unto me" (Matthew 11:28). In friendship, as in every other principle of the gospel, Jesus Christ is our Exemplar.<br><br>Now my dear young, new friends gathered throughout the world, I bear my testimony to you at this time that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. I bear witness that a very important element of your experience in the gospel is the friends you make and the mentors you follow, just as I was promised in my patriarchal blessing at 19 years of age.<br><br>I close where I began, with the verse of scripture spoken by God to the Prophet Joseph when he was in Liberty Jail, and suggest this could equally be spoken to you and to me in whatever condition we find ourselves at this time: "Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands" (D&amp;amp;C 121:9).<br><br>I reaffirm this promise given by the Lord in the early days of the Restoration of this Church. I pray that each of us will have the privilege of enjoying righteous friendships and mentoring relationships as we grow together in the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>These thoughts and words I leave with you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Friend, amen.<br><br><i>Ronald A.

<h1>ifts - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
After recovering from the shock of being invited early last November to speak at today's devotional, my mind turned to finding a topic on which to speak. The invitation was to address a gospel topic of importance to me. The idea of gospel gifts came quickly to mind. We were entering the holiday season, a season of gratitude for gifts and blessings received as well as a season for the giving of gifts. A bit more thought reminded me that I would be speaking one day before my youngest daughter's 15th birthday and, as we know, birthdays are also occasions for gift giving.<br><br>Subsequent pondering and prayer confirmed that my initial impression to speak about gospel gifts was appropriate. The idea of gifts permeates the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the most recent general conference of the Church, 11 of the 34 talks included the word<i>gift</i>or<i>gifts.</i>Additionally, 129 chapters or sections of the standard works make reference togifts.<br><h2><b>Gospel Gifts Typify Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>So what do I mean by gospel gifts? As the Bible Dictionary in the LDS edition of the scriptures tells us, "The word<i>gospel</i>means good news. The good news is that Jesus Christ has made a perfect atonement for mankind" (s.v. "gospels," 682). While preparing this talk, I read the following verse during my regular scripture study:<br><br><i>Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.</i>[2Nephi 11:4]<br><br>The phrase<i>gospel gifts</i>came to me weeks before I read this passage, but only upon reading it did I understand more fully. Gospel gifts are gifts that point us to or typify Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Gospel Gifts May Be Given to Us By God</b></h2><br>One of the scriptural references to gifts is found in Matthew 7:9–11, which reads:<br><br><i>Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</i><br><br><i>Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</i><br><br><i>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</i><br><br>In these verses, the Savior teaches us that even we imperfect mortals know how to give good gifts. That being the case, it ought to cause no wonderment in us that, in their perfection, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ also give good, even perfect, gifts. However, the 129 scriptural passages I referred to either address gifts in general or they do not make clear what specific gift is being given.<br><br>Gifts are given--indeed, the dictionary suggests that the word<i>gift</i>is akin to the Old English<i>giefan,</i>which means "to give." Therefore, I searched for the word<i>give</i>and its variants in the online version of the scriptures. My point in searching was to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the specific gifts actually given by God to some or to all of His children. I quit compiling my list somewhat over two-thirds of the way through the more than 700 scriptural references that came up in my search results. Here is the list Icompiled:<br><ul><br> 	<li>land</li><br> 	<li>the dews of heaven or rain</li><br> 	<li>bounties of the earth</li><br> 	<li>food</li><br> 	<li>clothing</li><br> 	<li>peace</li><br> 	<li>mercy</li><br> 	<li>favor in the sight of others</li><br> 	<li>light</li><br> 	<li>law or commandments</li><br> 	<li>scriptures</li><br> 	<li>rest</li><br> 	<li>others to help His servants</li><br> 	<li>an inheritance for sons and daughters</li><br> 	<li>a charge to His prophets in the sight of the congregation</li><br> 	<li>victory over enemies</li><br> 	<li>children</li><br> 	<li>sorrow of mind when disobedient</li><br> 	<li>strength</li><br> 	<li>wisdom and knowledge</li><br> 	<li>honor</li><br> 	<li>a heart to do the commandments</li><br> 	<li>reviving in our bondage</li><br> 	<li>the desires of our hearts</li><br> 	<li>grace and glory</li><br> 	<li>doctrine</li><br> 	<li>the bread of adversity</li><br> 	<li>the water of affliction</li><br> 	<li>weakness</li><br> 	<li>an everlasting name</li><br> 	<li>pastors</li><br> 	<li>a heart to know God</li><br> 	<li>an expected end</li><br> 	<li>beauty for ashes</li><br> 	<li>the oil of joy for mourning</li><br> 	<li>the garment of praise for spiritual heaviness</li><br></ul><br>In the cases of some of the items on the list, it was easy to see how the gift typifies the Savior. Take light, for instance. John 8:12 states, "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." But what of some of the other items on the list? How does weakness typify the Savior?<br><br>The Lord Himself told Moroni, "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me" (Ether 12:27). If, because of humility induced by the weaknesses given to us by God, we "becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble," we will also "becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord" (Mosiah 3:19). The Apostle Paul, after beseeching the Lord three times that his "thorn in the flesh" (2 Corinthians 12:7) might be removed, received in response this comforting reply: "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." After recounting this reply in his Second Epistle to the Corinthian Saints, Paul wrote these words: "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me" (2 Corinthians 12:9). I feel certain that, in this sense, to glory in one's infirmities is to give thanks to God that He has blessed us with help to curb the pride that so easily distances the natural man or woman from the saving grace of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Gospel Gifts May Be Given to Us By Others</b></h2><br>Though I have thus far concentrated on gifts given to us by Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, I do not mean to suggest that such gifts constitute the sum total of gospel gifts. I firmly believe that some of the good but imperfect gifts that we give to each other are also gospel gifts and, as such, will typify Jesus Christ. I offer examples of three gospel gifts that I have received, though I could offer manymore.<br><br>The Burley Theatre in Burley, Idaho, is a single-screen theater. While I was a young child and preteen, Clayton Bryan, "Mr. Bryan" to us kids, was the manager, and he appeared a somewhat fearsome man. It seemed to my young mind that he would just as soon kick you out of the theater as look at you--at least if you were misbehaving. As a 16-year-old, I got a job as a projectionist at the Burley Theatre. Through working for him, I learned that Mr. Bryan was not the fearsome man of my childhood.<br><br>The Harris Theatre, another single-screen movie theater about a block and a half from the Burley Theatre, was owned by the same man and was managed by Mr. Bryan's wife, Kathryn. Given the proximity of the two theaters to each other and the half-hour difference in starting times of the movies shown at each, it was possible for me to be the projectionist at both of them. After starting the movie at the Burley Theatre and taking a few minutes to make sure all was running well, I would walk to the Harris Theatre and start the movie there.<br><br>The days of the dual-projector booth that allowed movies to be shown by alternating the reels between the projectors were over. TheBurley Theatre had implemented a platter-projection system. All reels of the movie were spliced together and wound around a removable metal spool in the center of a platter. To play the movie, the metal spool would be removed and placed on an empty platter. The film would be pulled from the center of the fullplatter, threaded through the control mechanism of the platter, which was called the payout unit, then over a series of rollers to the projector, through the projector and sound head, and finally over another series of rollers to the empty platter, where it would be secured to the metal spool, around which it would be wound to be ready for the next showing of themovie.<br><br>As the movie played, the payout unit controlled the rotation speed of the platter system to ensure that as the movie was pulled off of the full platter and wound onto the empty platter, it maintained an even tension, thereby preventing the film from breaking. To keep centrifugal force from spinning the end of the film off the full platter at the outer edge, a suction cup attached to a small metal plate was affixed to the full platter to hold the end of the film in place.<br><br>One night I started the movie at the Burley and then, as usual, went to the Harris to start the movie there. When I got back to the projection booth at the Burley, I was horrified to see that I had failed to securely fix the suction cup to the full platter. As a result, the cup, its attached plate, and the loose film end had been spun off the platter. While I had been away, close to a reel of film had been pulled off the platter and tied in a huge knot.<br><br>With scissors I cut the film closest to the edge of the full platter, stopped the platter long enough to really secure the suction cup, and then set to work fixing the mess. Quickly abandoning my attempt to untie the knot, Imade several dozen cuts in the film until I had flat lengths of film to work with. Then Ibegan matching up ends and splicing them back together until I finally had a single complete length. With Mr. Bryan's help, I was able to splice this repaired section to the film still on the platter and then let it wind back on, all without stopping the movie. To this day I don't remember how we managed that feat.<br><br>Even though I had learned that he was really a kind man, the fearsome Mr. Bryan of my childhood was in my mind as I repaired the film. For my carelessness, I expected a tongue lashing at the very least. But instead of condemning me, he calmly and frankly forgave me while also admonishing me to learn from the mistake and to be certain that it didn't happen again. That night Clayton Bryan gave me the gospel gift of compassion.<br><br>In 1981, as a 19-year-old missionary in the Florida Tallahassee Mission, my first transfer sent me to serve in the Macclenny Ward in Baker County to the west of Jacksonville. The area had been closed for a period of time before my companion and I were assigned to reopen it. For several days while we looked for suitable lodgings, we were houseguests of Bishop Kenneth Alligood and his family.<br><br>As a lover of books, I have been wont to peruse the bookshelves of almost any home or office I am in when it would not be impolite to do so. On the Alligoods' bookshelves Ifound one paperback and five hardback volumes from the Harper and Row Basic Reading Program, the very books used when I attended the Dworshak Elementary School from first to sixth grades. Seeing the volumes brought back fond memories of school and especially of my first-grader pleasure in taking each of the paperback volumes home after the class had completed it and excitedly reading each to my parents. My excitement and pleasure came because mine was a reading family, and now Itoo had become a reader.<br><br>I must have commented to the Alligoods about the volumes and of my fond memories of them and what they represented to me. Sister Alligood explained that she had acquired them after she learned that the local school district intended to discard them. After slightly more than three months' service in Macclenny, older sister missionaries were to replace my companion and me. The Alligoods, like most Florida Saints, enjoyed both having the missionaries in their home and feeding them well. We dined with them shortly before being transferred from Macclenny. While we were at their home, Sister Alligood pulled the Harper and Row Basic Reading volumes off her bookshelf and gave them to me as a parting gift. Whether her action was impulsive or not, I do not know. I demurred, but she insisted, and I have the books to this day. They now bring back good memories not only of my elementary school days but also of the day and the manner of my receiving them. That evening, along with the books, Sister Alligood gave me the gospel gift of unselfishness--of placing the happiness of another above one's own desires.<br><br>On the afternoon of June 20, 2005, two vertebrae in my neck were fractured in an automobile accident. I wore a rigid cervical collar continuously for more than three months after the accident and was under doctor's orders not to lift much of anything or to do anything else that was likely to strain my neck or to cause me to lean forward or backward. Truthfully, I didn't feel like doing much of anything for the first four to six weeks after the accident, least of all mowing the lawn, which has never been a favorite activity of mine. But, had I felt like mowing the lawn, the doctor's orders would have prohibited it.<br><br>After hearing of my accident, a family in our ward volunteered to mow our lawn for as long as I would not be able to mow it myself. We were grateful for their offer, and we told them that we would gladly pay them to mow the lawn. They refused the payment and were as good as their offer. The father, one of the sons, or sometimes two of them together faithfully mowed our lawn every week until I could once again mow it myself. This family had taken to heart King Benjamin's teaching that "when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God" (Mosiah 2:17). Throughout those summer months they gave me the gospel gift of vicarious sacrifice--doing for someone else what that person cannot do for him- or herself.<br><h2><b>Gospel Gifts May Be Given but Not Received</b></h2><br>I might, because of pride or some other misguided notion, have chosen to refuse these gifts. That would not have negated the giving of the gifts. Giving and receiving are two separate actions reposing in two different individuals. This is clearly taught in D&amp;amp;C 88:33:<br><br><i>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver ofthegift.</i><br><br>Have you ever experienced the pang of sorrow that comes from having tried to give a thoughtful gift that was received with indifference or insincerity? I have. Unfortunately, I am also guilty of having caused such sorrow through my failure to truly receive gifts thoughtfully given to me.<br><br>In the colder months, I enjoy wearing sweaters. When my wife, Bonnie, and I married, I owned a maroon sweater one of my brothers-in-law had given me some years earlier. I had worn the sweater a great deal, and the fabric had noticeably thinned at the elbows.<br><br>My wife is talented with a crochet hook and makes beautiful things with that tool. Bonnie had crocheted herself several sweaters beginning when she was in 4-H as a girl. She decided, either because she couldn't find a ready-made one or because she couldn't find one that was within our Christmas gift budget, that she would crochet one to replace my beloved but worn sweater.<br><br>Her intent was both to please and to surprise. On Christmas morning, however, it became apparent--as it had not been while she crocheted it--that the sweater was too bulky. It was not only apparent to Bonnie; I knew it as well, and it showed on my face. While Bonnie would no doubt tell you that she was sorry about the sweater's bulkiness, I know that her sorrow was compounded by my selfish first thought about how I would look wearing it rather than by thinking first about the love that had gone into it. I had not truly received her gift. Gratefully, I have since received her forgiveness.<br><h2><b>Gospel Gifts Received Are Gospel Gifts Kept</b></h2><br>In general, when we truly receive a gift, we keep it. The printout of the entries listed under the verb<i>keep</i>contained in the online version of the<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>runs to 35 pages and encompasses 58 separate but related definitions. The sense in which we keep gifts is captured by definition 29, which reads, "Actively to hold in possession; to retain in one's power or control; to continue to have, hold, or possess" (http://dictionary.oed.com, s.v. "keep,<i>v</i>").<br><br>I graduated from Burley High School 30 years ago this year. I still regularly use some of the tangible gifts I was given for graduation. The money clip in my pocket is one example. My manicure set is another. The travel toiletries bag I received served me well for many years, but my repeated use wore it out. A newer edition replaced the college dictionary that had clearly, after 29 years, been superseded. Even today, I remember the individuals who gave me these gifts and think of them when using the gifts. I truly kept all of these things in the dictionary sense of<i>keep</i>quoted previously.<br><br>However, some gospel gifts are intangible and cannot be kept in quite the same way. The gift of compassion and admonishment to learn from my mistakes given to me by Mr. Bryan was one such gift. Elaine Temkin, the woman under whose tutelage I served as a student teacher, gave me another such gift. When conversing with me one day about some interactions I had observed at the school where she taught, Elaine matter-of-factly said, "Jeff, mediocrity resents excellence." The phrase stuck in my mind. Sometimes, after doing my best and excelling to one degree or another, I have been the object of resentment. At other times, when I have witnessed excellence in others and have been reproached by my conscience for doing less than I could and ought to have done, I have done the resenting. In both situations, the Spirit has brought Elaine's phrase to my remembrance and helped to temper either the pride that may have been present in the first situation or the sense of self-pity that may have been present in the second.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, God gives us the gift of commandments. These are intangible gifts. How do we "keep" them? The phrase<i>keep the commandments</i>is found in more than 125 chapters or sections of the standard works--often in multiple verses within those chapters. Throughout most of my life, I have considered the word<i>keep</i>in<i>keep the commandments</i>as synonymous with<i>obey,</i>and I still do. However, it has come to have the additional meaning of<i>keep</i>of which I have been speaking.<br><br>So how do we keep the commandments in that sense? I believe that our keeping of these intangible gifts will be like that of Mary when she "kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart" (Luke 2:19). Abinadi chastised the iniquitous priests of King Noah with these words: "And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of God, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts" (Mosiah 13:11). When we obey the commandments, we write, and thereby keep, them in our hearts. Just as we remember those who have given us gifts--whether tangible or intangible--we are more likely to "always remember [Jesus Christ] and keep his commandments which he has given [us]" (D&amp;amp;C 20:77) as we obey the commandments.<br><br>As was made explicitly clear in John 14:15, which says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments," as we keep the commandments, we demonstrate our love for Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father. We also witness our desire to make Their will our own. In truly keeping the commandments, we are promised the proximate blessing of "always hav[ing] his Spirit to be with [us]" (D&amp;amp;C 20:77) and, after enduring to the end, the ultimate blessing of "eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><h2><b>Gospel Gifts Truly Received Prompt Thanks--Another Gospel Gift</b></h2><br>Just as we keep the gifts that we truly receive, we must do what the good manners that our mothers taught us insist upon. That is, we must offer thanks to the givers of gospel gifts, whether they be our fellow mortals or our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Indeed, the scriptures contain frequent references to giving thanks to God for the gospel gifts we are given.<br><br>D&amp;amp;C 59:7 states, "Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things." Verse 21 of the same section reads, "And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments." Sincere expressions of gratitude coupled with willing obedience are what God hopes to and certainly will receive if we give them to Him. Indeed, according to Elder Robert D. Hales, "Our obedience to the laws, ordinances, and commandments is the greatest expression of love and gratitude that we can bestow upon" the Lord ("Gratitude for the Goodness of God,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1992, 63).<br><br>The Savior revealed the meaning that our thanks has to Him in the parable of the 10 lepers, found in Luke 17:11–19:<br><br><i>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</i><br><br><i>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afaroff:</i><br><br><i>And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</i><br><br><i>And when he saw them, he said unto them, Goshew yourselves unto the priests. And it came topass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</i><br><br><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i><br><br><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i><br><br><i>There are not found that returned to give glory toGod, save this stranger.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</i><br><br>I believe this story illustrates the truth of Elder Hales' statement that "gratitude brings warmth to the giver and the receiver alike" ("Gratitude for the Goodness of God," 65).<br><br>Gratitude and thanks themselves qualify as gospel gifts because they also typify Jesus Christ. Elder Hales also pointed out several examples of the Savior offering His thanks to Heavenly Father. When feeding the five thousand, "Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples" (John 6:11). Before commanding Lazarus to come forth from the place where his dead body had been laid, "Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me" (John 11:41). On the night of His betrayal, as He instituted the sacrament, Christ gave thanks for both the bread and the wine before giving each to His disciples (see 1 Corinthians 11:23–24; Mark 14:23). When His chosen disciples in the new world had received the Holy Ghost, Jesus said in prayer, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen" (3 Nephi 19:20).<br><br>May we all remember that gospel gifts typify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ; that they may be given to us by God or by our fellow mortals; that the giving and receiving of gospel gifts are two separate actions; that our true receipt of a gospel gift is manifested by keeping the gift; and that giving thanks for our gospel gifts is itself a gospel gift because giving thanks also typifies Jesus Christ.<br><br>I close by offering my gratitude for two supernal gospel gifts. The first is the gift of the Holy Ghost. Through this gift I have received the witness that Jesus is the Christ, through whom the second gift, that of the great vicarious, unselfish, and compassionate sacrifice known as the Atonement, was wrought for me and for you. I leave you with this testimony in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>C. Jeffrey Belliston was an assistant university librarian for the BYU Harold B.

<h1>hip and Faith - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It is a privilege to be here today, but I have to tell you that it is pretty intimidating to be the poor fellow who has to follow Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell. I actually want to follow up on something that was evident as I listened to him speak: it is possible to be both professionally excellent and to be a person of faith. I am going to tell you today that striving for this kind of balance in your life is the best way to live.<br><br>When Karl G. Maeser was called by Brigham Young to come down here and rescue the struggling Brigham Young Academy, President Young gave him a famous charge:<br><br><i>Brother Maeser, I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God. That is all. God bless you. Good-bye.</i>[In Reinhard Maeser,<i>Karl G. Maeser: A Biography by His Son</i>(Provo: Brigham Young University, 1928),79]<br><br>This remains at the core of what we try to do here at BYU, and it's not easy. Balancing is hard, as all dancers and gymnasts know, and the intellectual balancing in President Young's challenge is hard, too. One of these hard things grows out of the emphasis on "logical reasoning [and] critical analysis" that appears in the<i>The</i><i>Aims of a BYU Education</i>(<i>The Mission of Brigham Young University</i>and<i>The Aims of a BYU Education</i>[Provo: BYU, 1995], 5).<br><br>I've been involved in logic and criticism for a long time now, and it is often an ugly and unfriendly business. Unlike the title of the popular book<i>I'm OK--You're OK</i>by Dr. Thomas Harris, critical analysis often feels more like "I'm OK--you're an idiot."<br><br>When I write papers and submit them to the editors of journals, I have a great sense of happiness and accomplishment when the paper is finished and sent out. But the editor doesn't just congratulate me and schedule my paper for publication. It is first sent out to a few of my colleagues for their review. After a few weeks comes the dreaded day when these reviews arrive. The first time I got one, I just opened it and happily started to read. Icouldn't even finish it in one sitting because the comments were so cruel. With later papers I learned to let the reviews sit for a day to steel myself for the ordeal and was then tempted to look for strategies that would get the paper published with the minimum number of changes. The fighting and the cynicism didn't feel like what I had signed up for when I went into science.<br><br>It seems that for many of us, the more we learn, the more we get puffed up with pride. Intolerance then sets in, and balance becomes impossible. This process is described often in the Book of Mormon, and there are many warnings against it. A really good one is given by Jacob in 2 Nephi 9:28–29:<br><br><i>O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i><br><br>I received a similar message from a rather unlikely source early in my career. When I was just out of graduate school, I attended my first meeting of the American Physical Society in New York City. It was a heady experience, and a highlight was a special event arranged by the conference organizers: the great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov had been invited to speak to us.<br><br>He began by telling us about something that had happened to him when he was a young student. He was hired to help a historian do research on social resistance to technological change. Hour after hour he wrote down the stories he found in books in the university library about people protesting the invention of things like machines to spin thread and to weave cloth, steam-powered trains, automobiles, airplanes, etc. All of these advances were perceived by the general public either to be physically dangerous or to be a threat to the livelihoods of workers in trades that were about to be destroyed by these advances.<br><br>He regaled us with these stories for a long time, and they were very funny, but it went on so long that I began to wonder where he was going. Finally he got to the point. He said that when he started to write science fiction, he remembered all of this work he had done. So while his fellow writers were all rhapsodizing about the thrill of rockets and space travel (long before such things were possible), he wrote a story about how the local populace showed up at the launch site with torches and pitchforks in opposition to space travel. Years later, when rockets and travel outside of the earth's atmosphere became possible, there were protests, and many of Mr. Asimov's colleagues were astounded that he had predicted so far in advance that this would occur.<br><br>"Why," Mr. Asimov then asked us, "among all of these talented and visionary writers, wasI the only one who was able to predict that this resistance to change would occur?" He let us think about the question for an uncomfortably silent minute, then leaned into the microphone and said in an intense voice that I still vividly remember: "It's because people are stupid!" And he included himself. He said that if he hadn't had this idea pounded into his head daily for several months, he was sure that he wouldn't have been able to foresee it either.<br><br>The lesson I take today from my memory of this experience and from my reading of the Book of Mormon is that the proper attitude to have when confronted with the vast complexity both of the universe and of the ideas and activities of the people who live on this small planet orbiting an ordinary star far away from the center of things in our galaxy is profound humility.<br><br>Consider, for example, what the electron does as it hovers around the proton of the hydrogen nucleus. We have illustrations that depict the electrons as fuzzy areas, which give us an indication of what's going on, but the pictures don't really represent an electron--electrons are always detected as tiny little dots of mass and energy. When we detect one, it isn't fuzzy at all. So what is the fuzziness? Well, it's a representation of where we might find one of these little dots. We never find one in the dark places in the diagram, only in the fuzzy areas.<br><br>We try to make sense of this by saying that the electron has both wave and particle natures. But if you push us to explain how such a crazy thing can be, we really can't. If you continue to push, we will show you some horrible equations and assure you that they describe where an electron dot might be found, on average, with impressive precision. But if you ask us why the world is built in this weird, incomprehensible way, we really have no good answer. All we can say is that the mathematics seem to work.<br><br>I have had similar experiences in my spiritual life. At Christmastime, after my first child was born, Margo and I traveled back to Utah from Wisconsin, where I was studying physics. When my daughter, Melanie, got an ear infection, we found that we were missing two really important things: insurance coverage and money--two things that many of you have trouble with, too. She cried and cried, and it started to look like a budget-busting Sunday night trip to the emergency room was going to be required. In desperation I went to a bedroom in my in-laws' house, where we were staying, closed the door, held her in my arms, and gave her a priesthood blessing. She immediately settled down and went to sleep, and the next day a kind doctor treated her ear infection (for cheap) in his office.<br><br>Now, I don't really understand the details of why this works any more than I understand why the mathematics of quantum theory can predict where electrons will be found. But the priesthood and science both help us live better in this complex world.<br><br>It seems to me that the right thing to do is to follow the practical counsel of Brigham Young. He taught that we should use everything we can lay our hands on, both physically and spiritually, when faced with problems that need solving:<br><br><i>If we are sick, and ask the Lord to heal us, and to do all for us that is necessary to be done, according to my understanding of the Gospel of salvation, I might as well ask the Lord to cause my wheat and corn to grow, without my plowing the ground and casting in the seed. It appears consistent to me to apply every remedy that comes within the range of my knowledge, and to ask my Father in heaven, in the name of Jesus Christ, to sanctify that application to the healing of my body. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . But supposing we were traveling in the mountains, . . . and one or two were taken sick, without anything in the world in the shape of healing medicine within our reach, what should we do? According to my faith, ask the Lord Almighty to . . . heal the sick. This is our privilege, when so situated that we cannot get anything to help ourselves. Then the Lord and his servants can do all.</i>[<i>JD</i>4:24–25]<br><br>Dr. Henry Eyring, the great LDS chemist and father of President Henry B. Eyring, was a great example of how to combine professional excellence with faith and humility. He was world-famous for his work on chemical reactions and was also known both to his scientific colleagues and to members of the Church as a man of faith and devotion. He said:<br><br><i>I am happy to represent a people who throughout their history have encouraged learning and scholarship in all fields of honorable endeavor, a people who have among their scriptural teachings such lofty concepts as these: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." "It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance." "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection."</i>[Henry Eyring,<i>The Faith of a Scientist</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1967), 32–33; quoted in Henry J. Eyring,<i>Mormon Scientist</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2007), 50]<br><br>In speaking to youth, he once said:<br><br><i>We learned from the Prophet Joseph Smith that man lived before he was born; that life is a school where man is sent to learn the things the Lord intends; and that he continues on into life after death. Death is not the end; it is but one more step in a great forward march made possible by the redemption wrought by the Savior. This is the spirit of true science--constant and eternal seeking.</i>[Henry Eyring, in Era of Youth: "Henry Eyring Speaks to Youth,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>November 1970, 133; quoted in Henry J. Eyring,<i>Mormon Scientist,</i>50–51]<br><br>For Brother Eyring, however, the things that we discover in our seeking are no occasion for pride:<br><br><i>Contemplating the awe-inspiring order in the universe, extending from the almost infinitely small to the infinitely large, one is overwhelmed with its grandeur and with the limitless wisdom which conceived, created, and governs it all. Our understanding, great as it sometimes seems, can be nothing but the wide-eyed wonder of the child when measured against Omniscience.</i>[Henry Eyring, "Speaks to Youth," 133; quoted in Henry J. Eyring,<i>Mormon Scientist,</i>52]<br><br>Brother Eyring wanted to see the whole picture, physical and spiritual combined, but even he couldn't see how to fit everything together. But he had faith that the whole picture existed.<br><br><i>So this, then, is sort of the picture that I would give you and end on the note that I can't see any difference between the kinds of arguments that you make to support religion and the arguments that you make to support science. I understand, of course, that there are contradictions of all kinds in science, and there are contradictions between science and religion, and there are contradictions between various parts of religion in every human mind (but not in God's mind; in a billion years you'll have your problems solved, if you can wait).</i>[Henry Eyring, "You Don't Have to Make All the Mistakes There Are," speech given at Brigham Young University, no date, Henry Eyring Papers, Manuscript Division, Special Collections, J. Willard Marriott Library, University of Utah, box 20, folder 23;quoted in Henry J. Eyring,<i>Mormon Scientist,</i>302]<br><br>I take from the counsel of President Young and Dr. Eyring that we should seek all the good we can from the world of scholarship and also seek the blessings of the Lord by asking and having faith in Him. Even if we<i></i>can't see how everything fits together into a complete picture, we can have faith that there is such a picture and find joy in working and serving in both realms.<br><br>Looking back on the journey I have taken from the perspective of my advancing years, it feels like I have been trying to build an arch bridge, like the one over Sydney Harbor, which was constructed inward from the two shores it rested on until the two halves met in the middle. In the case of my unfinished bridge, the two ends seem to be reaching for each other, and the finished span promises to be wonderful. But like Brother Eyring, I don't expect my bridge to be finished anytime soon. I am confident that truth is a great unity, but I'm just not smart enough to figure it out.<br><br>I know this isn't very satisfying intellectually, but I have come to find some peace in the observation of Isaac Asimov. Sometimes Ireally am stupid. In my fumbling attempts to better understand how physics works, I use more erasers than pencil lead, and the most common key for me to press when I am writing computer code is the delete key. But flashes of success come, too. It really is exciting to discover how something works. And it is equally exciting to feel the thrill of knowing that the Lord has worked through me to bless someone else's life.<br><br>Even though we can't see how the two spans of the bridge come together, we can make some connections between the two partial spans by the way we live our lives. I recommend this course to each of you. Let me close with a few examples.<br><br>I have a testimony of the power of Amulek's admonition given in Alma 34:17–21:<br><br><i>Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</i><br><br><i>Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty tosave.</i><br><br><i>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.</i><br><br><i>Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.</i><br><br>I testify that this works for all fields and for all flocks. My field is physics; yours may be linguistics, construction management, or nursing. Or maybe you're in business management--you will have flocks to tend. Whatever the area of study, the Lord has mastered it. If you ask Him, He can help you in your studies. I have felt comfort, confidence, and a much-needed flow of ideas come through prayer about technical matters and can promise you that the Lord is interested in every part of your life.<br><br>Our studies can also inform our faith. Jacob was right: it is good to be learned. My life has been richly blessed by the appreciation I gained here at BYU for art, literature, and music. The more-technical things you learn in your studies are valuable, too, even if you don't major in them. You should use your critical-thinking skills to carefully examine propositions that are made to you, whether by well-disguised criminals or by those who are well-meaning but uninformed. You may be invited to participate in business ventures promising fabulous rates of return, offered wonderful elixirs that will cure everything that ails you, or be given the opportunity to invest in the 200-miles-per-gallon SUV, the development of which is being suppressed by the government and the oil companies. Your studies in economics, physiology, and physical science will come in handy here. Situations like this deserve the best critical analysis you can muster, and being learnedmay save you thousands and thousands of dollars.<br><br>There are also matters of public policy on which we as citizens must vote. It will take the combined learning and faith of all of us if we are to preserve our society and our planet.<br><br>A word of caution: it is important to learn when to use critical thinking and when to be still and listen. Around the time I was a student here, a young lady in one of the BYU wards bore her testimony on fast Sunday by saying, "Iknow that my roommates are true!" There was a flood of letters to the<i>Daily Universe</i>about the incident, sparked by those who made fun of the young lady. Testimony meeting is not such a good time to apply critical analysis. Those who were wise and compassionate, however, might have been able to look beyond the awkward use of the English language to focus more on what was being said in the language of the heart.<br><br>The Savior counsels us in the Sermon on theMount:<br><br><i>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</i><br><br><i>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</i>[Matthew 7:3–5]<br><br>We echo this counsel when we sing in the sacrament hymn "In Humility, Our Savior": "Fill our hearts with sweet forgiving; Teach us tolerance and love" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 172). I hope that in spite of all that we learn and achieve--and I hope that we learn and achieve in abundance--that we will also learn patience, humility, tolerance, andlove.<br><br>Finally, please stay close to the Church. Do the simple things: have daily prayer, read the scriptures, hold family home evening, attend your Church meetings, worship in the temple.<br><br>When I was a graduate student, I had some trouble balancing my spiritual life and my scholarly life. Most of the other graduate students didn't have children and Church callings. I felt like a juggler who was about to drop all of the balls he was trying to keep in the air. To make ends meet, we sometimes took care of the children of people with money while they flew to the Caribbean to escape the bleak Wisconsin winter. After we would get their and our children to bed, I would do my physics homework at the kitchen table. One night after working for hours on a particularly difficult assignment, I knelt on the kitchen floor to ask the Lord for some help and encouragement. Ialso asked for some kind of a testimony boost. The answer I got surprised me a little. It went something like this: "I have given you atestimony, and you have made covenants. This should be enough for now. Just hang on, and the blessings will come."<br><br>And the blessings have come. I have been molded and shaped by the things I have learned in the Church over the years and by the service I have given in the callings I have received. President Gordon B. Hinckley often repeated President David O. McKay's saying that the Lord's program is to make bad men and women good and good men and women better as He prepares us for eternal life. Participation in His kingdom here on earth can change us in wonderful ways if we are faithful.<br><br>In closing I would like to read this passage from Jacob 4:8–10:<br><br><i>Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.</i><br><br><i>For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.</i><br><br>I testify that the Lord lives, that He loves us, and that He will bless us in our righteous endeavors at both ends of the bridge. We may not see it in all of its completed glory, but it is there. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Ross Spencer was chair of the BYU Department of Physics and Astronomy when this devotional address was given on 30 March 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1> Clock Reads Double Zero - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises and hope the opportunity you have had to attend BYU fills your heart with gratitude. This university embodies sacred strength as part of the Lord's work. Petr Ruda, a native of the Czech Republic who earned his nursing degree in December--and who is with us today--said:<br><br><i>BYU makes me happy; it connects me to Heavenly Father--even by just walking on campus. This place significantly changed me, and I'm grateful to those who made it possible for me to come.</i>[In "Nurse, Immigrant from Czech Republic Cares for U.S. Veterans,"<i>President's Report,</i>winter 2009–2010, 8]<br><br>I trust we all feel that same kind of gratitude for our BYU experience.<br><br>We have a family tradition related to sporting events: When we attend, we stay until the clock is at "double zero." No matter how bleak the end might appear, or how miserable the weather, we wait until the double zero appears--even when others are exiting the sports arena. Staying until double zero has often yielded a victory for both fans and players. Consider these defining events in BYU football history:<br><br><ul><br>	<li>The "Hail Mary" pass from quarterback Jim McMahon to Clay Brown in the last seconds of the Holiday Bowl game in 1980 that tied the game and set up the Kurt Gunther extra point and the win. The game was renamed the Miracle Bowl, because we had been behind by 20 points.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Robbie Bosco hit wide receiver Kelly Smith in the back of the end zone with a minute left to give BYU a national football championship in 1984.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>And what about the pass from quarterback John Beck to tight end Jonny Harline with three seconds left at the University of Utah in 2006?</li><br></ul><br>The players did not give up, and we did not give up on them. Staying or perhaps "enduring to the end" enriched the experience for both fans and players.<br><br>Just like waiting until the clock reads double zero, you have prepared for the proper educational plays, emerged victorious, and received your hard-earned degree. We applaud you--and no one gave up on you. Professors, family, friends, and unknown benefactors trusted in you and have high expectations for the rest of your life.<br><br>We are confident you will<br><br><ul><br>	<li>live a Christ-centered life</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>serve in the Church and your community</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>be a good parent and supportive spouse</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>use the fruits of your BYU experience to build the kingdom of God on the earth</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>remain virtuous</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>be strong in your gospel testimony</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>work hard</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>pursue learning throughout your life</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>stay "connected for good" to BYU</li><br></ul><br>There is something else.<br><br>Remember how excited you were when you opened your acceptance letter? Qualification for this university requires exceptional academic performance and moral excellence. To participate in the experiences that touched the social, spiritual, and intellectual pieces of your life was a profound blessing. Our sponsoring organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has made a tremendous investment in you. You have received a "loan" from the Church in the subsidizing of your education in the form of low tuition relative to the value of your education. Many generous benefactors have supplemented the costs of your education. You are indeed fortunate, and we anticipate that as you prosper, you will follow this vital tradition of giving back to your alma mater.<br><br>Chris Giovarelli, the 2006 BYU student-body president and 2008 Student Alumni Association president, once shared these thoughts:<br><br><i>As we reflect on our BYU experiences and see how far the university has come, basking in the light of national ranking and acclaim, let us remember that the work is not done. Our founders sacrificed time, talent, and treasure to build the foundation of this university, and through similar small and simple offerings we can continue that work today.</i>["Return to Give Back,"<i>Emeritimes Newsletter,</i>spring 2008, 1]<br><br>My hope is that you will replenish BYU. Commit to advancing the educations of future students. Nourish the university with your resources through volunteer service or financial support for the outstanding programs and disciplines developed at BYU. Many of us wear a CTR ring that reminds us to "choose the right." Let me suggest another meaning for the acronym: "choose to replenish."<br><br>When you look at your CTR ring, consider BYU as a unique and sacred place. Choose to replenish the university so your children and grandchildren will also enjoy the benefits of BYU.<br><br>As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 370,000.

<h1>r Until the Perfect Day” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Picture in your minds an image of the sun with its rays peeking over the mountains and the sky lit up like a fire. Few visions can surpass the beauty of this scene. In your mind's eye, is this sun setting or rising?<br><br>Few moments in life are anticipated as much as graduation from college and the celebration of the hard work that was required. Few experiences can surpass the poignancy of this moment. Again, is your sun setting or rising? The difference between the two is important, since one gives way to darkness while the other leads to more light.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants it is written:<br><br><i>That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Truth is light. We need light in order to see, because it carries information from the world to our eyes.<br><br>If this time of commencement is to be the dawn of our future growth, we must seek out opportunities to expand our knowledge. As a famous phrase states, "Education is not so much the filling of a bucket as the lighting of a fire."<sup>2</sup>Fire, as a source of light, needs constant fueling to burn. From our education here we have learned that the real key to learning is the maintenance of this fire--the thirst for morelight.<br><br>Just as the light of day requires a window to pass into our homes, the light of truth requires a conduit to pass into our souls. We have discovered here at Brigham Young University that the sciences, humanities, and arts are some of the many conduits that invite truth into our lives, because all things testify of Christ.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Light and knowledge may be acquired in two different ways. One way is to receive light by having others refer us to that knowledge; the second is to seek out conduits for this light on our own. Our education here at Brigham Young University has trained us to employ both of these methods.<br><br>While studying here, we have relied heavily on enlightened professors who have encouraged us--by shining example--to "seek . . . out of the best books words of wisdom."<sup>4</sup>As I have read great recommended works, such as Gogol's<i>Dead Souls</i>or Dostoyevsky's<i>Crime and Punishment,</i>the light of truth has reflected into my heart and expanded my soul.<sup>5</sup>My mind has been ignited to such a point that my wife and I have placed a quote from Erasmus on our bulletin board: "When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes."<sup>6</sup>This is also a feeling that most of us starving graduates have experienced at the beginning of each semester.<br><br>As we have pored over textbooks and other materials, our minds have been enlightened and our lives have grown brighter and brighter. This change was barely noticeable at the time, as we learned "line upon line, precept upon precept"<sup>7</sup>--just as darkness steadily turns into day with the gradual rising of the sun. Looking back now, we can notice the change in light, but we have not yet grown unto "the perfect day."<br><br>From here we will need to discover our own individual ways of obtaining light through the second method I mentioned: our own experiences. It is hoped that our experiences here have prepared us well for this. A few years ago I made a personal goal to learn how to play the violin. Initially it seemed that instead of light I had discovered the purest conduit of pain for my roommates and family as I practiced. However, eventually it was a very rewarding experience, not only because it helped me to discover more light and creativity but also because the pretty girl I asked to help me had to grab my hand to teach me the vibrato technique. I must have been a pretty good student, because later she became my wife. One just never knows what conduits are being opened when we try new things.<br><br>Sparked by curiosity, we discover new conduits for light as we invest time in learning new skills. Additionally, just as the beauty of the surrounding world is expressed through varying wavelengths of light, our lives are enriched when we seek out a balanced variety of knowledge.<br><br>Our use as instruments in the Lord's hands depends on our ability to remain sharpened as we continually fill our lives with light, making this graduation the dawn of our future. The Lord has a work for us to do if we will extend our reach to it. Just as the sun's light shoots across the vast distance of space and illuminates our planet, all truth shines forth from God, enlightening us as we seek for it. He has said:<br><br><i>If your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>He will help us in our quest for knowledge if we will--as we have done here at Brigham Young University--center our learning on Him.<br><br>While the sun may be setting on our time at BYU, it is only beginning to rise on our eternal development. This sunrise will ultimately give way to "the perfect day" if we continue to seek after light and truth.<br><br>Fellow graduates, congratulations--not only for what we are finishing but also for what we are all beginning.<br><br><i>Brian Timothy Wright spoke as the representative of his graduating class at BYU commencement on 22 April 2010.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>l Test - April 2010 Commencement - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Samuelson; trustees, faculty, and staff of Brigham Young University; honored guests; parents; family members; and graduates: My dear brothers and sisters, Sister Christofferson and I offer our congratulations, respect, and love to all of you. We thank you for the privilege of being with you on this grand occasion and rejoice with you in the achievements that we honor today. We are pleased to have been authorized to convey to you the greetings of President Thomas S. Monson, his counselors in the First Presidency, and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. We extend those greetings and their commendations most warmly.<br><br>In preparing my remarks to you, I have determined not to follow the example of my brother, the Apostle Paul, when he spoke to the Saints in Troas. It is reported in the book of Acts that "upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."<sup>1</sup>The cartoonist Garry Trudeau is purported to have said, "Commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated."<sup>2</sup>I'll do what I can, but Idon't want to over-sedate you.<br><br>It is traditional, of course, in graduation speeches to offer counsel. One sage proffered this advice: "Your families are extremely proud of you. You can't imagine the sense of relief they are experiencing. This would be a most opportune time to ask for money."<sup>3</sup>Then there are references to the wisdom of the ages. I remember my father's aphorism repeated often with some exasperation to his five sons: "For every mistake made for not knowing, 10 are made for not looking." This afternoon, however, I would like to call upon the insights of our departed friend and colleague Professor Hugh Nibley.<br><br>We knew Professor Nibley as a man of superior intellect and honest spirituality. I remember my first sighting of him during my freshman year at BYU. It was in the library as I passed a table laden with perhaps two dozen books, most of them open and stacked one upon another in a semicircle in front of an empty chair. As I wondered who could possibly absorb all of that material in one sitting, the legendary scholar appeared out of the stacks carrying three or four more books. I tried not to stare, but it wouldn't have mattered; Professor Nibley ignored me completely and dove into the books. I was impressed and more than a little motivated. I wish I could tell you that after that experience I never again slumped over a library desk with my face in a book asleep, but dishonesty would be unbecoming in someone in my position.<br><br>Hugh Nibley was a graduate student at Berkeley during the Great Depression. He was able to finance his education there with some struggle and a translation job that fortuitously came his way. It is reported that for a time he was extremely discouraged. I quote Boyd Jay Petersen:<br><br><i>When he returned to his family's home in Hollywood for the Christmas vacation at the end of 1936, his discouragement had become a full-blown depression,</i>[and he said],<i>"Those were desperate times." He even began to doubt the truthfulness of the Church. "I thought there were certain flaws in the gospel," says Hugh. "I was terribly bothered about this afterlife business and that sort of thing. I had no evidence for that whatever." That all changed when Hugh came down with appendicitis and was taken to the hospital. When the doctor turned the ether on, Hugh swallowed his tongue and stopped breathing. While unconscious, Hugh experienced a life-after-life experience that reoriented his life. "I didn't meet anything or anybody else, but I looked around, and not only was I in possession of all my faculties, but they were tremendous. I was light as a feather and ready to go."</i><br><br><i>This experience had a profound influence on Hugh. Certainly education remained important to him throughout the rest of his life. However, this experience was a "higher" form of education that helped him recognize that the most important tests in this life are not administered in the classroom. This knowledge helped him not take life too seriously,</i>[and he wrote],<i>"We're just dabbling around, playing around, being tested for our moral qualities, and above all the two things that we can be good at: we can forgive and we can repent."</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>There is no question that it is good to strive to fill our souls with light and truth, described in the scriptures as intelligence.<sup>5</sup>I congratulate you again on having been anxiously engaged in seeking learning, "even by study" and I hope "also by faith."<sup>6</sup>I trust you will continue to do so, diligently and throughout your life. We understand that<br><br><i>whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto inthis life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>Even so, as Professor Nibley observed, in this limited mortal experience "we're just dabbling around" in our learning. None of us while here will approach the intelligence or glory of God. It behooves us to be humble. We live with an awareness of our divine heritage and destiny, yet not forgetting our present earthly confines.<br><br><i>The Hasidic rabbis taught: "Everyone must have two pockets, so that he can reach into the one or the other according to his need. In his right pocket are the words, 'For my sake the world was created,' and in the other, 'I am</i>[but]<i>earth and ashes.'"</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>In my experience, those who have cultivated their capacities of mind and spirit, who have developed an uncommonly large store of knowledge and wisdom, are typically the most humble of men and women. In diligently applying themselves, they have gained a greater sense of the vast breadth and depth of truth, and they appreciate more than most how small a portion of truth we really know. It is those who know a little as they suppose who oftentimes assume they know a great deal and become guilty of hubris. Indeed, the greatest stumbling block to learning more may be the conviction that we already know nearly everything.<br><br>We rightly rejoice in and express gratitude for all that God has revealed in rewarding both spiritual and scientific inquiry, but at the same time we must acknowledge how much more has not been revealed. As God Himself has expressed it:<br><br><i>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</i><sup>9</sup><br><br>For those who show themselves capable and desirous, there will be time and opportunity enough now and in the eternities to truly know and understand "things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come."<sup>10</sup>The real, the core purpose of this mortal experience is the moral test: Will we in fact "do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]"?<sup>11</sup>Our central quest is to learn and to live the celestial law: "For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory."<sup>12</sup>If we can learn to abide the celestial law, we become what the scripture calls persons "of a celestial spirit."<sup>13</sup>In the Resurrection such persons receive a celestial body, and in due course they receive a fullness of that celestial glory by which they have been quickened<sup>14</sup>--or, in other words, the same fullness of light and truth that constitute the intelligence and glory of God.<br><br>Let us suppose that there is a man whose employment it is to come here after today's ceremonies and stack and store all the folding chairs that some of the graduates and faculty are occupying. Actually, I'm sure there will be a number of people involved--and probably most of them fellow students--but let us suppose that this particular individual is not a graduate of this or any other institution of higher learning because circumstances may have denied him the chance or his interests and skills run in another direction. As a consequence, there are some opportunities that are denied him and potential attainments that are foreclosed to him. It is to me, however, a mark of the justice of God that despite any such limitations, our friend may excel as fully as you and I in the moral test that is at the heart of our mortal experience. There is nothing in what has been denied him that precludes his leaving mortality with feet planted firmly on the path of celestial law that will enable him eventually to attain omniscience. I am reminded of C. S. Lewis' profound observation, "It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no<i>ordinary</i>people."<sup>15</sup><br><br>One way to think of the celestial law is Professor Nibley's simple statement: "The two things that we can be good at: we can forgive and we can repent." We also have James' concise and profound expression: "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."<sup>16</sup>In other words, our test is to learn to serve one another and to attain personal holiness. All the commandments of God tend to one, or usually both of these ends at the same time. BYU professor emeritus Chauncey C. Riddle has observed:<br><br><i>Many people reject</i>[the celestial law]<i>because it does not allow them to take advantage of other human beings and requires repentance from every sin (which repentance is to stop taking advantage of other human beings and to truly bless them instead). The weakness that prevents and destroys Zion is human selfishness.</i><sup>17</sup><br><br>As you look forward to a new phase of life, I urge you to recommit to the celestial law and the Christian standard of greatness:<br><br><i>Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</i><br><br><i>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>If it is not already yours, seek for the blessing of marriage and family, where your service can be the most vital, the most unselfish, and the most fulfilling. And if this blessing is denied you until later, serve the children, especially the fatherless, who come within your ambit. And don't forget those who call you aunt or uncle. Bless all those you can with your wisdom and means. Jesus says to you:<br><br><i>Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.</i><br><br><i>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain thewhole world, and lose his own soul? . . .</i><sup>19</sup><br><br><i>Therefore deny yourselves of these, and be not ashamed of me.</i><sup>20</sup><br><br>John Dryden in his poem<i>The Hind and the Panther</i>expressed the better nature of mankind that we aspire to develop more fully by repenting, forgiving, and serving:<br><br><i>Beasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway,</i><br><i>Where still the stronger on the weaker prey;</i><br><i>Man only of a softer mould is made,</i><br><i>Not for his fellows' ruin, but their aid:</i><br><i>Created kind, beneficent and free,</i><br><i>The noble image of the Deity.</i><sup>21</sup><br><br>Today we recognize your very significant achievements. We are happy for you and with you. We place robes on your shoulders and mortar boards, tassels, and other marks of honor upon your head and about your neck. At the same time, my plea to you is not to let this achievement or any other success or failure blind you to your central purpose on earth: to learn to do whatsoever the Lord your God may command. You and I achieved success in the moral test of our premortal first estate. It was a limited but crucial test that opened the way for our current and broader test--one that takes place in a physical body, in a fallen world, and outside God's personal presence. Whatever time and experiences your particular moral test may entail, success will mean glory (that is, light and truth) "added upon [your] heads for ever and ever."<sup>22</sup>Without diminishing this day, I urge you to keep your eye on the prize. Let your<i>cap and gown</i>point you to the infinitely greater<i>robe and crown</i>that await you in God's celestial realm.<br><br>I pray that you will have a full measure of the guidance, protection, and gifts of the Holy Ghost. I pray that day by day and year by year you will draw ever closer to "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."<sup>23</sup>I affirm my witness of His reality, divinity, and grace and of His desire to walk with you in the moral test that is your life on earth. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>D.

<h1>ble of the Cherry Tree: How to Enjoy the... - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Years ago I took a botany class here at BYU. The professor described a problem that sometimes occurs with sweet cherry trees. Apparently, there are times when they look fully mature, are beautifully shaped, and have complete foliage, but they don't bear fruit. As Iremember (and I ask the life sciences students here to be patient with me as I describe this in lay terms), he said that there are times when the sugar that sets fruit does not stay in the branches but goes to the roots instead. If this has occurred, then it may be necessary to "shock" the tree by upsetting the cambium layer in the tree trunk so that the sugar will stay in the top of the tree and set fruit.<br><br>We students asked how one does this. The professor told us we could carefully cut into the bark with a knife or we could shoot the tree with a small-caliber firearm. (Apparently, years ago some farmers did this.) Or we could beat the bark with a baseball bat. He said if we did beat the bark with a bat, we should do it after dark so our neighbors wouldn't see us.<br><br>Well, I decided to try shocking the tree because I had a seven-year-old sweet cherry tree that would not bear fruit. So I got out my bat, waited until dark, and "carefully" tapped the bark around the base of the tree--then waited for the results. And results I got. The leaves began to wilt, turn yellow and then brown, and finally fall to the ground. I had completely girdled the tree, which totally cut off the branches from the roots. The tree died.<br><br>My purpose is not to illustrate that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing--though in my case it was. Rather, my purpose is to illustrate the devastation that results when branches are cut off from their roots. When this occurs, nourishment cannot flow from the roots to the branches. Similarly, if we cut ourselves off from the Holy Ghost, our source of spiritual nourishment, we experience spiritual devastation.<br><br>The Savior taught:<br><br><i>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forthmuch fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</i><br><br><i>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</i>[John 15:5–6; see also 1 Nephi 15:15 and Alma 16:17]<br><br>I want to consider my experience with the cherry tree as a parable representing the Savior's teachings about the true vine. When we maintain our relationship with the Holy Ghost, we are blessed with the flow of influence and direction that can nourish our spirits and bring them life. To do this I will respond to two questions:<br><br>1. Why do we need the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost?<br><br>2. How can we enjoy the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost?<br><h2><b>Why Do We Need the Constant Companionship of the Holy Ghost?</b></h2><br>Unquestionably, life is full of difficult choices. You students need the direction of the Spirit as much or more now than at any other time in your life. You are making so many critical, life-determining decisions. Think of some of these: what to major in; how to balance school, work, and church responsibilities and a social life; whom to date; how to get a date; whom to marry; when to marry; and what to do about a job or career--especially in a difficult economy. You have some difficult choices to make and need help. The Holy Ghost can assist you in making these choices--that is, if you do not allow circumstance to "shock" you into losing your connection.<br><br>Elder Richard G. Scott recently taught us, "Therefore, we are led to seek personal inspiration in life's important decisions. . . . That assistance will come to you through the Holy Ghost as spiritual guidance" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/to-acquire-spiritual-guidance?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To Acquire Spiritual Guidance</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 6).<br><br>In Moroni we are given this promise: "And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things" (Moroni 10:5). From the book of John we learn these important truths: the Holy Ghost "will guide you into all truth" (John 16:13) and "shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance" (John 14:26).<br><br>In this most recent general conference, Sister Julie B. Beck, Relief Society general president, said, "The ability to qualify for, receive, and act on personal revelation is the single most important skill that can be acquired in this life." Furthermore, she said, through personal revelation we "can prioritize correctly and navigate this life confidently," "prevail over opposition and persist in faith through difficult days and essential routine tasks," and understand "what to do every day to increase faith and personal righteousness, strengthen families and homes, and seek those who need our help" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/and-upon-the-handmaids-in-those-days-will-i-pour-out-my-spirit?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And upon the Handmaids in Those Days Will I Pour Out My Spirit</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2010, 11).<br><br>I bear testimony that for these and many other reasons, it is absolutely necessary to have the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. We must keep our connections open and strong.<br><h2><b>How Can We Enjoy the Constant Companionship of the Holy Ghost?</b></h2><br>Of the many things we've been taught through scriptures and by the counsel of our Church leaders, I want to speak about four. These are not new (see President Thomas S. Monson, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/search?lang=eng&amp;amp;query=be+your+best+self&amp;amp;collection=general-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be Your Best Self</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2009, 67–70; Marion G. Romney, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/marion-g-romney_guidance-holy-spirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidance of the Holy Spirit</a>," BYU devotional address, 20 March 1979). These four things have been taught since the organization of the Church. They are among the small and simple things written in the scriptures. But remember--out of small and simple things, great things are brought to pass (see Alma 37:6–7; D&amp;amp;C 64:33). Strong connections and open channels can be maintained in simple ways. They are<br><br>1. Pray in faith continually.<br><br>2. Search the scriptures daily.<br><br>3. Keep the commandments always.<br><br>4. Serve others willingly.<br><h3><i><b>Number One: Pray in Faith Continually</b></i></h3><br>In Alma 34:20 we are invited to "cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks" (see also Alma 34:17–27). Thinking of fields and flocks reminds me of an experience I had recently while attending a sacrament meeting in a BYU Asian ward. A good Asian brother told of praying prior to taking a calculus test to be calm and to remember the things he had studied. He was doing pretty well until he came upon a problem that required him to convert feet into inches. He knew how to do the problem but could not complete it until he could make the conversion. However, he didn't understand feet and inches because all of his schooling had been in the metric system. He prayed again, like the people of Alma who prayed silently and had their burdens lifted (see Mosiah 24:12–15). Then into his mind came the image of an advertisement he had seen recently of a foot-long sandwich; the ad said that it could be divided into two 6-inch sandwiches. Knowing that a foot is 12 inches, he was able to complete the problem.<br><br>The Lord knows when each sparrow falls. He knows each of us. He wants to be involved in the details of our lives, and the whispering of the Spirit is one of the ways He does this. Prayer is one way that we invite Him to give us this blessing.<br><br>I was reminded of this several years ago at Christmastime when one of our daughters had returned recently from her mission. My wife and I had purchased a gift for her--one that she was excited to receive. On Christmas Eve I suddenly realized that I didn't remember where I had hidden the gift. (Remember, I'm the guy who beat a cherry tree with a baseball bat.) I racked my brain. I searched in all my favorite hiding places. I simply could not find the gift. I felt sick. Minutes went by, stretching into an hour or more. Nothing came to my mind. I decided to pray: "Father in Heaven, I need your help. I have a gift for my daughter but I can't find it. She is a choice daughter, and I don't want to disappoint her. Please help me find the gift." Immediately, I knew where to look. I found the gift. I testify that He knows us. He loves us. We can go to Him in prayer, even in the small and simple things.<br><br>Consider for a moment what some of your "flocks" and "fields" might be, and include them in your prayers. But remember, branches should not be deadweight. You have the responsibility to do your part. It does little good to ask for help to do your best on a test if you haven't studied, to stay free from the H1N1 virus if you fail to take proper care of yourself, or to avoid improper actions on a date if you are out too long and too late and aretoo isolated.<br><br>President Boyd K. Packer illustrated this principle with his story of the little girl who prayed that her brother would not catch birds in his trap. After she prayed, she told her mother that she was positive her brother wouldn't catch any more birds. Her mother asked her how she knew. The little girl replied that after she prayed, she had gone out and kicked the trap to pieces (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2009/11/prayer-and-promptings.p1?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prayer and Promptings</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 46).<br><br>Pray morning and evening and during the day. Pray vocally and in your heart. If you have faith that your prayers are heard and answered in the Lord's own way, the Holy Ghost can bring answers and guidance to you.<br><br>I love the words of the hymn "Sweet Hour of Prayer":<br><br><i>In seasons of distress and grief,</i><br><i>My soul has often found relief</i><br><i>And oft escaped the tempter's snare</i><br><i>By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!</i><br>[<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 142]<br><br>To enjoy the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must pray in faith continually.<br><h3><i><b>Number Two: Search the Scriptures Daily</b></i></h3><br>Nephi said, "For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children" (2 Nephi 4:15).<br><br>The verb I've chosen is<i>search</i>. I could substitute other verbs such as<i>study</i>or<i>ponder.</i>Notice that the verb isn't<i>locate,</i>as in "locate my scriptures." Nor is the verb<i>dust off,</i>as in "dust off my scriptures." The Holy Ghost opens our minds to truths in the scriptures and brings to our minds guidance from our scriptural learning, but we need to get scriptural truths into our minds in the first place. Finding and dusting are only preliminary steps.<br><br>Consider the words from 2 Nephi 31:20: "Feasting upon the word of Christ" (see also 2 Nephi 32:3). Feasting is certainly more than nibbling. We need to immerse ourselves in the scriptures like butter and honey flowing over a hot dinner roll. The sons of Mosiah brought thousands of people to Christ, having "searched the scriptures diligently" (Alma 17:2–3). They were well prepared for the revelation they received.<br><br>I appreciate what Elder Jay E. Jensen of the Seventy has written in his book<i>Treasure Up the Word,</i>in which<i></i>he lists some important verbs that might be applied to our approach to the scriptures:<br><br>Read--<i>Peruse, look over, investigate.</i><br><br>Study--<i>Explore, investigate, research, review, survey.</i><br><br>Search--<i>Examine, explore, inspect, investigate, scrutinize. . . .</i><br><br>Ponder--<i>Meditate, contemplate, reflect upon, think about, weigh heavily. . . .</i><br><br>Liken--<i>Compare.</i><br><br>[<i>Treasure Up the Word</i>(Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997), 29]<br><br>Verbs such as these suggest anything but a casual approach to the scriptures.<br><br>My wife, Cathy, shared with me an experience she had recently with inspiration from the scriptures. Our oldest son, who is in the military, was being deployed to the Middle East. Cathy was extremely worried about him. At night sleep was difficult for her, and during the day she was continually unsettled. One day as she was studying the Book of Mormon, the thought came into her mind to turn to the chapters in Alma concerning the sons of Helaman (see Alma 53:20–21; 56:45–48; 57:21–27; 58:40). As she read, peace came into her mind and heart. She felt calm. She knew all would be well.<br><br>During the early years of our marriage, Cathy and I established the practice of family prayer and family scripture study. The memory of our sometimes discouraging efforts came back to me during general conference as Elder David A. Bednar told us that as he and his wife attempted to hold family home evening or family scripture reading, often one or the other of their boys would say, "He's touching me!" or "Make him stop looking at me!" or "Mom, he's breathing my air!" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/2009/11/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Diligent and Concerned at Home</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 19).<br><br>As I read from the scriptures during these early mornings, the children's eyes were often closed. "Kids, listen up," I would say. "Dad, we're meditating," came the sleepy reply. Or when I would stop to explain a particular scripture, I heard more than once, "Dad, don't talk about it. Just read it." We wondered if we were doing any good at all. Now our children have children of their own. And they are having family prayer and family scripture study. And their children close their eyes to "meditate" as the parents are reading. Maybe closed eyes do not indicate completely closed connections.<br><br>We need to be diligent in our study of the scriptures and not take them for granted. Former Church President Ezra Taft Benson reminded us of this as he called us all to repentance regarding our inadequate reading of the Book of Mormon (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2011/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Book of Mormon--Keystone of Our Religion</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, 4–7). He quoted the following from D&amp;amp;C 84:57:<br><br><i>And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written.</i><br><br>One of our hymns expresses an important connection between scripture study and the Holy Ghost:<br><br><i>As I search the holy scriptures,</i><br><i>Touch my spirit, Lord, I pray.</i><br><i>May life's myst'ries be unfolded</i><br><i>As I study day by day.</i><br>["As I Search the Holy Scriptures,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 277]<br><br>To enjoy the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must search the scriptures daily.<br><h3><i><b>Number Three: Keep the Commandments Always</b></i></h3><br>"Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46). "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).<br><br>Elder Bruce A. Carlson gave us some valuable insights in the most recent general conference when he said, "Obedience to the Lord's commandments provides us confidence in our chosen path, qualifies us for His guidance and direction as we pursue our efforts, and offers us the potential to become like our Savior, Jesus Christ, and return to our Father's presence" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/when-the-lord-commands?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When the Lord Commands</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2010, 40).<br><br>I agree with Elder Carlson: we do not qualify for His direction through the Holy Ghost--and we certainly cannot become like the Savior--if we do not obey what He has commanded us to do. To me the relationship is not complex. When we keep the commandments, we are happy. When we don't, we aren't. "Wickedness never was happiness" (Alma 41:10).<br><br>The following scriptures teach us additional important truths about keeping the commandments:<br><ul><br> 	<li>We are admonished that certain blessings come only by obedience to the law upon which those blessings are based (see D&amp;amp;C 130:20–21).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are promised that the Lord is bound when we do what He says (see D&amp;amp;C 82:10).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>He promises us His fulness if we keep His commandments (see D&amp;amp;C 93:20).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>And He promises gifts of the Spirit if we are obedient: "For verily I say unto you, they [the gifts of the Spirit] are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do" (D&amp;amp;C 46:9). "And him that<i>seeketh</i>so to do" (emphasis added)--this statement should give us encouragement.</li><br></ul><br>Again, I find inspiration in the hymns of theChurch: "Hold to the rod" ("The Iron Rod,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 274). Really hold onto it, tightly, with both hands. "Keep the commandments. In this there is safety and peace" ("Keep the Commandments,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 303).<br><br>To enjoy the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must keep the commandments always.<br><h3><i><b>Number Four: Serve Others Willingly</b></i></h3><br>There are so many ways we can serve, but sometimes we think of service in terms of position. We may think we need to be a counselor in the bishopric, the president of our elders quorum or Relief Society, or a Gospel Doctrine teacher in order to give real service. It's just not so. Remember what was said of the Savior: He "went about doing good" (Acts 10:38). The Holy Ghost can guide us in following the Savior's example.<br><br>Following my release from a Church calling, I wondered, "Now just how good a Christian are you? Can you be a good neighbor and friend without a formal calling? Can you be more kind and considerate of others, more decent, and less quick to judge and find fault, and just go about trying to do good? And can you not just<i>do</i>good but<i>be</i>good?"<br><br>When I think of the hymn "I Am a Child of God," I often think of a change that was made to the wording years ago. One line was originally penned, "Teach me all that I must<i>know</i>/ To live with him someday." It was changed to read, "Teach me all that I must<i>do</i>/ To live with him someday" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 301; emphasis added). Perhaps when we sing it next time we can think, at least on the last verse, "Teach me all that I must<i>be</i>/<i></i>To live with him someday." I mention this because giving service for the right reasons and without a formal calling makes us particularly sensitive to the guidance of the Holy Ghost and helps us<i>become.</i><br><br>So what are some areas of service that are often overlooked? How about home and visiting teaching? I believe that if you want to prepare for a mission or for marriage, you'll not find a better way than by being a good home teacher or visiting teacher. And why? Because to be a good home or visiting teacher, we have to forget ourselves and think of someone else, and doing that is critical preparation for a mission or marriage.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks spoke of some often-undervalued areas of service--the sacrifice parents make for their children and the pain and loss of personal priorities and comforts mothers endure to bear and rear their children. He taught us the value of a smile and simple greeting to someone who is sitting alone at church as an important act of service (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/unselfish-service?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unselfish Service</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2009, 93–96). When we are willing to sacrifice and to reach out to others, the Holy Ghost will guide us in doing these things.<br><br>In my remarks to this point, I have said we don't need an official call in the Church in order to give service and receive guidance from the Holy Ghost, and this is true. It is also true that church callings provide wonderful opportunities to receive inspiration and to give service. Therefore, I want to share what Icall "10 Things I Have Learned About Church Callings." They are given in no particular order and are not intended to be exhaustive.<br><br>1. Do not seek callings. 2. Accept callings when they come. 3. Magnify each calling when it comes. 4. Do not ask to be released. 5. When released, accept it with a good heart and attitude. We do not "own" our callings. 6. It does not matter<i>where</i>we serve. It does matter<i>how</i>we serve. 7. Do not be critical of how you are called or how you are released. 8. Study the Church handbooks specific to your calling and follow them. 9. Never speak negatively of your leaders. Seek and accept their counsel. 10. Find out what the Lord would have you do. Seek the Spirit.<br><br>And one other thing--have you noticed that if you try to serve unselfishly, you grow as you serve? Growth comes as a natural process. But if our primary motive for serving is so we can grow personally, our selfishness damages our connection to the Holy Ghost, and our growth is impeded. Only when we forget ourselves and focus on others do we become stronger through service.<br><br>Of all of the reasons we may have for serving, may those reasons be ever more frequently and consistently that we love others and our Father in Heaven (see Dallin H. Oaks, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1984/11/why-do-we-serve?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Do We Serve</a>?"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1984, 12–14).<br><br>One of our hymns expresses a plea for us to remember:<br><br><i>Savior, may I love my brother</i><br><i>As I know thou lovest me,</i><br><i>Find in thee my strength, my beacon,</i><br><i>For thy servant I would be.</i><br><i>Savior, may I love my brother--</i><br><i>Lord, I would follow thee.</i><br>["Lord, I Would Follow Thee,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no.220]<br><br>To enjoy the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost, we must serve others willingly.<br><br>Sunday School general president Russell T. Osguthorpe taught us a pattern of teaching: to teach, invite, and promise (see "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/teaching-helps-save-lives?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching Helps Save Lives</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 15–17).<br><br>I have endeavored to follow this pattern. First, I have tried to<i>teach</i>correct principles. Second, I<i>invite</i>you, if the principles I've taught are not consistent in your lives, to make them so. Third, I<i>promise</i>you that if you do, the Lord's choicest blessings will be yours, for He has said, "And, if ye keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>Remember the cherry tree. Branches separated from their roots wither and die, but when they are connected, they receive nourishment, which brings abundant life. The Holy Ghost is that vital connection all of us have with our Father in Heaven, through whom we receive the nourishment of His wisdom, guidance, andlove.<br><br>To enjoy the constant companionship and blessing of the Holy Ghost we must<br><br>1. Pray in faith continually.<br><br>2. Search the scriptures daily.<br><br>3. Keep the commandments always.<br><br>4. Serve others willingly.<br><br>I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven C.

<br>
In the 20th chapter of Matthew, we read the interesting account of the mother of James and John approaching the Savior and requesting that her two sons be permitted to sit at His side, one on the right and one on the left, in His kingdom. The Savior explains that this is not His to give and says, "But it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father" (verse 23). When the others of the Twelve heard about this conversation, it was the source of some ill feelings toward James and John.<i>Indignation</i>is the word used in the Bible. The Savior called the Apostles together and taught them this great lesson:<br><br><i>Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</i><br><br><i>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</i><br><br><i>And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.</i>[Matthew 20:25–27]<br><br>Recall these words of the Savior as recorded in Mark: "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it" (Mark 8:35).<br><br>To lose ourselves in the service of others, which is to lose ourselves in the work of the Lord, takes a great deal of faith--faith that He will provide for us and sustain us in the challenges and trials of that work, and faith that He will prepare the way for us to accomplish Hiswork.<br><br>Recall with me the account of the sons of King Mosiah, who, after being changed from their wicked ways through the visit of an angel of the Lord, worked tirelessly to undo the damage they had done and to strengthen the Church. Then they desired to carry the message of salvation to their brethren, the Lamanites (see Mosiah 27). We read in Mosiah:<br><br><i>Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites. . . .</i><br><br><i>Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</i>[Mosiah 28:1, 3]<br><br>Mosiah inquired of the Lord concerning their request, and the Lord told Mosiah, "Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites" (Mosiah 28:7). As the four sons of Mosiah and their companions reached the land of the Lamanites, they separated and went to different parts of the land. Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, where he was taken, bound, and carried before the king, who was King Lamoni. Ammon told the king, "I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die" (Alma 17:23). The king, being pleased with Ammon, desired that he should take one of his daughters as his wife, but Ammon declined, saying, "Nay, but I will be thy servant" (Alma 17:25). And thus began one of the most successful missions recorded in the scriptures, in which thousands of the Lamanites were converted to the truth. Ammon did not begin by calling King Lamoni to repentance or by listing the injustices of the Lamanites toward the Nephites. He began by saying, "I will be thy servant"--a profound lesson. Ammon's faithful service to King Lamoni soon led to opportunities to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to the king, to his household, and to many others.<br><br>Now recall the response of Nephi when he was informed by his father that the Lord had commanded Nephi and his brothers to return to Jerusalem to procure the brass plates from Laban. Most of you can probably quote Nephi's response:<br><br><i>I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</i>[1Nephi 3:7]<br><br>This is a remarkable answer, and it warrants closer consideration. Where did Nephi come by this answer? Was he simply saying what he thought his father wanted to hear? Or, perhaps, was he merely repeating something that he had heard his father say? Most certainly not (for both questions). Nephi was a young man (probably near the same age as most of you), and he had undoubtedly already faced challenges through which he had experienced the Lord preparing a way for him to accomplish what was commanded. Nephi's faith-filled response flowed from his own experience in relying on the Lord. I expect that many of you could proclaim a similar witness as a result of the Lord preparing the way for you.<br><br>Further in Nephi's account, we see that after a failed attempt to get the plates, Nephi's older brothers were ready to admit defeat and return to their camp in the wilderness. Nephi succeeded in convincing them to try again. This second attempt, in which the family's wealth was offered to Laban, also failed, and Nephi's older brothers were angry and started to take it out on Nephi and Sam. An angel of the Lord intervened, yet the older brothers murmured, asking, "How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands?" (1 Nephi 3:31). Nephi counseled, "Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?" (1 Nephi 4:1). Nephi showed tenacious faith.<br><br>As a side note, remember that part of the Lord's work, for which He will prepare the way, is avoiding temptation and sin. We read in James:<br><br><i>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</i>[James 1:27]<br><br>He will provide the way for us to keep ourselves unspotted from the world.<br><br>If we can combine unwavering faith that the Lord will provide a way for us to do His will and His work, as demonstrated by Nephi, with selflessness in the service of others, as demonstrated by Ammon, we can be instruments in the Lord's hands in furthering His purposes, and we will find real and lasting joy as we lose ourselves in His service. Let me share some favorite stories that demonstrate how God prepares the way for those who faithfully and selflessly serve Him.<br><br>Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Church, was baptized on December 31, 1833, in New York after hearing the preaching of two of the elders of the Church. He was 26 years old. The next spring he was part of Zion's Camp. After the march of Zion's Camp from Kirtland to Missouri, Joseph directed that Wilford and other single men in the company remain in Missouri to help build Zion. While in Missouri, Wilford yearned to serve a mission. He went into the woods and prayed that the way might be opened for him to be called to preach the gospel. He states, "Before I arose from my knees, the spirit of the Lord rested upon me and bore witness that my prayer was heard and should be answered upon my head." He arose from his prayer and walked from the woods to the road, where he encountered Judge Elias Higbee, a faithful high priest in the Church, who said, "Brother Wilford, the spirit of the Lord tells me that you should be ordained to go and preach the gospel" (quoted in Matthias F. Cowley,<i>Wilford Woodruff: History of His Life and Labors</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1964], 46–47). A few days later he was ordained a priest and, having been a member of the Church less than one year, started on his mission to the southern states.<br><br>We see Brother Woodruff's faith and the Lord's blessings in the following experience. He and his companion decided to travel down the Arkansas River and then walk into Tennessee. Being unable to get passage on a boat, they cut down a three-foot-thick cottonwood tree and hollowed out a canoe. They floated 150 miles in their handmade canoe to Little Rock, Arkansas. They then tied up their canoe and started the 170-mile walk to Memphis, Tennessee, on a road that, as Brother Woodruff said, "lay through swamps, and was covered with mud and water most of the way" (quoted in<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i>54). The first day they walked 40 miles through mud and water that was knee-deep.<br><br>On March 24, after traveling about 10 miles, Brother Woodruff became lame with a sharp pain in his knee and stopped to rest. At this point his companion left to return to Kirtland and Wilford was left alone sitting on a log in an alligator swamp. Wilford records, "I knelt down in the mud and prayed, and the Lord healed me and I went on my way rejoicing" (quoted in<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i>55).<br><br>He continues:<br><br><i>On the 27th of March I arrived at Memphis, weary and hungry. I went to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson. I told him I was a stranger and had no money, and asked him if he would keep me over night. He inquired what my business was, and I told him I was a preacher of the gospel. He laughed and said that I did not look much like a preacher. . . .</i><br><br><i>The landlord wanted a little fun, so said he would keep me if I would preach. He wanted to see if I could preach. I must confess that by this time Ibecame a little mischievous, and pleaded with him not to set me preaching. The more I pleaded to be excused the more determined Mr. Jackson was that Ishould preach. He took my valise, and the landlady got me a good supper. I sat down in a large hall to eat. Before I got through, the room began to be filled by some of the rich and fashionable people of Memphis, dressed in their broadcloth and silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after traveling through the mud as I had done. When I had finished eating, the table was carried out of the room over the heads of the people. I was placed in the corner of the room, with a stand having a Bible, hymn book, and candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with the landlord in the center.</i><br><br><i>There were present some five hundred persons, who had come together, not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some fun. I read a hymn, and asked them to sing. Not a soul would sing a word. I told them I had not the gift of singing; but with the help of the Lord, I would both pray and preach. I knelt down to pray, and the men around me dropped on their knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His spirit and to show me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord, in my prayer, that I would deliver to that congregation whatever He would give to me. I arose and spoke one hour and a half, and it was one of the best sermons of my life. The lives of the congregation were open to the vision of my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the reward they would obtain. The men who surrounded me dropped their heads. Three minutes after I closed, I was the only person in the room.</i><br><br><i>. . . In the morning, I had a good breakfast. The landlord said if I came that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long as I might choose.</i>[Quoted in<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i>55–56]<br><br>By the end of the first year of this mission, Brother Woodruff records that he "had traveled three thousand two hundred and forty-eight miles, held one hundred and seventy meetings, baptized forty-three persons . . . , organized three branches, ordained two teachers and one deacon" (quoted in<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i>58).<br><br>After completing this mission, serving two missions to the Fox Islands in eastern Canada, and being called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder Woodruff, with others of the Twelve, was called on a mission to England in 1840. After arriving in England, he was directed through prayer to the area south of Liverpool, where he was told that "many souls were waiting for [the Lord's] word" (quoted in<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i>116).<br><br>Again I quote from Elder Woodruff's account:<br><br><i>On Sunday, the 8th</i>[of March],<i>I preached at Frome's Hill in the morning, at Standley Hill in the afternoon, and at John Benbow's, Hill Farm, in the evening. The parish church that stood in the neighborhood of Brother Benbow's, presided over by the rector of the parish, was attended during the day by only fifteen persons, while I had a large congregation, estimated to number a thousand, attend my meetings through the day and evening.</i><br><br><i>When I arose to speak at Brother Benbow's house, a man entered the door and informed me that he was a constable, and had been sent by the rector of the parish with a warrant to arrest me. I asked him, "For what crime?" He said, "For preaching to the people." I told him that I, as well as the rector, had a license for preaching the gospel to the people, and that if he would take a chair I would wait upon him after meeting. He took my chair and sat beside me. For an hour and a quarter I preached the first principles of the everlasting gospel. The power of God rested upon me, the spirit filled the house, and the people were convinced. At the close of the meeting I opened the door for baptism, and seven offered themselves. Among the number were four preachers and the constable. The latter arose and said, "Mr. Woodruff, I would like to be baptized." I told him I would like to baptize him. I went down into the pool and baptized the seven. We then came together. I confirmed thirteen, administered the Sacrament, and we all rejoiced together.</i><br><br><i>The constable went to the rector and told him that if he wanted Mr. Woodruff taken for preaching the gospel, he must go himself and serve the writ; for he had heard him preach the only true gospel sermon he had ever listened to in his life. The rector did not know what to make of it, so he sent two clerks of the Church of England as spies, to attend our meeting, and find out what we did preach. They both were pricked in their hearts, received the word of the Lord gladly, and were baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The rector became alarmed, and did not venture to send anybody else.</i>[Quoted in<i>Wilford Woodruff,</i>117–118]<br><br>In the eight months time he preached in this area, Elder Woodruff was instrumental in bringing more than 1,800 souls into the Church. Certainly Elder Woodruff was an exceptional example of unwavering faith and selfless service.<br><br>Now permit me to relate some personal and family stories. First a brief story from my own mission to the south of France. My companion and I had labored some time in the town of Périgueux and had met with limited success. One evening, after a long day of tracting, we were ready to return to our apartment, but we decided to knock on the doors of one last street. Here we met a great family of three: a father, a mother, and a teenage daughter--the De Mets family--who were interested in hearing our message. The father, a large man, was a former police officer who had been injured in the line of duty and was paralyzed from the waist down. We taught the family about the restored gospel and returned to teach them a couple of more times. The Spirit was working on them, and they were receiving the word.<br><br>Then came the fateful announcement that many European missionaries (and missionaries elsewhere, I'm sure) hate to hear: the family announced that they were leaving on their annual vacation and they would be gone for a whole month. A month was a long time, and we were worried that the small flame of testimony would flicker and fade. All we could do was challenge them to read the Book of Mormon and to pray while they were away. They accepted the challenge. And while they were away we, too, prayed.<br><br>As soon as they returned, we anxiously and somewhat nervously went to their home. They told us that when they opened the door to their hotel room, they saw a picture of the Savior on the wall, and seeing that picture reminded them of their commitment to study and pray. They were baptized shortly thereafter. We rented a small pool in a physical therapy office for our baptisms. Sister De Mets was baptized first. Brother De Mets was baptized next. To baptize him, we helped him onto a chair, which we then lifted into the pool. Following the baptismal prayer, one elder tipped the chair backward while the other held Brother De Mets' legs to keep them underwater. The daughter was baptized after her parents. We returned to the branch meeting hall, where all three were confirmed and we all enjoyed an outpouring of the Spirit.<br><br>In the late 1940s (which, by the way, was a long time before I was born) my parents and my three oldest brothers were living in Sugar City, Idaho. My father's carpentry business was beginning to grow, they had just bought a house, and my father and mother were both busily engaged in their Church callings.<br><br>Their bishop came to my father and said he had a problem. "Why did you come to me?" asked my father.<br><br>The bishop replied, "Because you are my problem. I can't sleep at night because I can't stop thinking about you. You see, I received a call a few weeks ago from Salt Lake. The Brethren wanted you to go on a building mission to Tonga." (My father had served a proselyting mission there as a young man.) The bishop continued, "I told them that I didn't think you should go because you had just moved into a home that you are buying, you had three small children, you were just getting going in your business, and you were needed in the ward. Now, if I'm going to get any sleep, you'll have to call Salt Lake and tell them what you want to do."<br><br>My father telephoned Salt Lake and accepted the call, and he and my mother began preparations to leave. They turned their home back to the seller, my father turned over his business contracts to another carpenter in the town, and they sold everything they had. My brothers said, "Daddy even sold our beds." Then, as a family, they left on their mission to help build Liahona High School in Nuku'alofa, Tonga.<br><br>My father recounts the following story, which occurred early in the construction of theschool:<br><br><i>We needed rock for aggregate for the blocks we were making to build the Liahona School. We had taken the compressor out to the quarry and drilled many holes so we could put in dynamite and blast out the rock to be crushed in our small crusher.</i><br><br><i>President Dunn asked me to go to the government quarry and pick up the licensed dynamite expert of the Tongan Government and take him overto our quarry to get our blasting done.</i><br><br><i>At the appointed time next morning (about sun up) I left for the government quarry about five miles away. It was raining quite hard and became more intense as time passed. By the time I reached the</i>[government office]<i>it was raining so hard I couldn't see through the windshield of the jeep station wagon and I had to look out the side window tostay on the road.</i><br><br><i>I confronted the man I was to pick up but he protested because of the rain. I felt inclined to persist and in so doing we loaded up his gear and dynamite and started out. The rain continued making it almost impossible to drive. As we had to pass by Liahona I drove into the building area and stopped, but I was uneasy and felt that I should continue on to our quarry about a mile away.</i><br><br><i>I started the motor again and we were on our way. My passenger, for the most part, was silent. Upon reaching the gate to the fence around the quarry I stopped and turned off the ignition. It stopped raining instantly. My passenger, looking greatly surprised, got out and opened the gate. We drove down into the quarry, set the dynamite and fired it, getting out a good quantity of rock.</i><br><br><i>We gathered up the gear and put it into the jeep. I got into the jeep and turned on the ignition. The motor started and so did the rain.</i>[Thomas P. Wilding,<i>History of Thomas Preston Wilding,</i>1988, in author's possession, 45]<br><br>One last story from my father's account of this mission:<br><br><i>During a conference session while Apostle Cowley was in Tonga in 1950, I was sitting on the stage, with my back to the opening that went all the way around the thatched roof at the eve line for ventilation.</i><br><br><i>A fellow tapped me on the shoulder and beckoned me to come out and talk with him. He wanted me to get another missionary and go to his home to administer to his wife who was very ill. The fellow was a member of the LDS Church but he had become inactive. His wife was not a member.</i><br><br><i>When we two Elders arrived at his home</i>[we saw that]<i>they had built a little house in back of their home for his wife. It is a Tongan custom to build these little one room houses about eight feet square as a place to die.</i><br><br><i>I was told that the doctors had told them there wasn't anything they could do for her and that the Tongan remedies did not help and that they wanted us to administer to her so she wouldn't die.</i><br><br><i>Family members had gathered and were sitting on mats around the entrance of the little house. Ithink all were non-members. I talked to them for some time explaining the priesthood ordinance of anointing and laying on of hands and the pronouncement of blessings. I told them that the Lord should not be mocked and that the sick were healed by faith, the power of the priesthood and the will of our Father in Heaven. I then asked if they still wanted me to administer to the sick lady. They did.</i><br><br><i>We Elders went into the little house. The lady was being held in the sitting position by a sister. She was too weak to sit by herself, her eyes had a glossy look and she was having much difficulty breathing. We knelt and had prayer. I asked the Lord to grant us His Spirit to influence us to speak His will and to bless the family members that they would know of His will. We knelt by the sick lady, and my companion anointed her head with the consecrated oil and then we both placed our hands on her head and I spoke the words of the blessing promising her that she would get well.</i><br><br><i>The next Sunday I visited the Branch where this lady was also a visitor being completely well. She asked to be baptized.</i>[<i>History,</i>48–49]<br><br>It is my witness that if we show tenacious faith and are prepared to lose ourselves in service, our Father in Heaven will prepare the way for us to accomplish all that He asks of us. I pray that we can be instruments in our Father in Heaven's hands in doing His will and that we will find great and eternal joy in His service. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>W.

<h1>Sanctuary - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Like many other parents, my wife, Amy, and I spent a good deal of time watching videos with our kids when they were young. Often those videos contained surprising lessons. For example, in the Disney animated film<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>there is a climactic moment when Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda from the flames and rushes into the Cathedral of Notre Dame, shouting for sanctuary. Whatever liberties the executives at Disney may have taken with Victor Hugo's novel, they are at least drawing on an actual medieval practice that considered the church a place of refuge. During the conflicts between church and state in Europe during the Middle Ages, church land was considered to be beyond the reach of the law and thus a sanctuary, or place of refuge, for those wrongly, or in some cases rightly, accused of crimes. Although the practice of sanctuary was discontinued centuries ago, you can still find sanctuary stones dotting the English countryside, marking the ancient boundaries of refuge for sanctuary seekers.<br><br>In a time when we are swept up in a tidal wave of bad news, when the gloomy march of economic misery seems to engulf us all, when natural and man-made disasters occur almost daily, when today's students are told that they are entering a bleak job market and an uncertain economic future, when the screaming heads of an increasingly politicized 24-hour news cycle convince us that things have never been worse, and when each of us quietly--or not so quietly--muddles through a multitude of personal trials, let me suggest that we counter that tide by working to find our own personal sanctuaries in our faith, at our church meetings, in the temple, and in our relationships with family, friends, and the Lord.<br><h2><b>Faith</b></h2><br>Finding sanctuary begins with understanding who we are and what we believe. Soon after we were married, Amy and I moved to Boulder, where I began a PhD program in political science at the University of Colorado. There were about a dozen of us who entered the program that year, and one of them was a woman named Sandi Samuels. Sandi was a chain-smoking, self-described nonpracticing Jew, and she and I became good friends. One day when I was studying in the group office that PhD students shared in the basement of the building, Sandi walked in, sat on the corner of the desk, lit a cigarette (asking if I minded and not waiting for my response), took a long, theatrical drag, and asked, "You're a Mormon, right?"<br><br>You might have thought that a reasonably well-educated returned missionary would rise to the occasion, prepared to deliver a stirring recitation of our beliefs; but instead, I confess, Iheard alarm bells in my head. Having been in this situation many times growing up, I knew that inevitably this question was followed by an examination based on some misunderstanding of our beliefs. So I was caught off guard when Sandi simply asked, "What is a Mormon?"<br><br>I remember stumbling through some inadequate description of our beliefs that must have satisfied her because the conversation turned to another subject. That little exchange has bothered me over the years, and I've rehearsed a thousand better answers to her question than what I gave her.<br><br>It is my practice to begin each day by reading the<i>New York Times</i>. It is a habit I picked up in graduate school and have continued since. I'm a great advocate of reading quality newspapers, and it's one of the reasons that the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies distributes free copies of the<i>Times.</i>In the buildup to the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, I was interested to read the media coverage of Utah, particularly how the culture and dominant religion were portrayed.<br><br>As each article came out I eagerly read through to see how we were described. With increasing frustration, I kept trying to find myself in those articles. I barely recognized the culture and religious beliefs being described. The facts were in order, but the meaning was missing. Frustrated, I composed a hundred letters to the editor in my head, explaining who we really were, what we believe, and how we live. In the end I resigned myself to something that scholars have long known: understanding a culture from the outside is an extraordinarily difficult thing.<br><br>However frustrating outside critiques may be, the bigger obstacle to finding sanctuary is when we begin to misunderstand our own beliefs--when we allow our faith to be diminished and trivialized. That can occur if we rewrite our own history, concluding that "my mission wasn't that meaningful" or "I didn't really have that experience." In so doing, we fall prey to the situation described by George Orwell in his novel<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>when he wrote: "Who controls the past . . . controls the future: who controls the present controls the past" (<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>[New York: Penguin, 1950], 32).<br><br>At our worst, we caricature our own beliefs, making them seem small, insignificant, and slightly embarrassing. In the end we come to believe that our religion is no more than a series of interesting social customs and that our faith is as easily discarded as an unwanted gym membership.<br><br>I suppose we are known for many things, including some valuable social behaviors, but let us be clear about our faith. As inspired as these teachings are, we are not the church of the people who don't date until they're 16 or the church of the people who don't drink coffee. Others may want to circumscribe our religion, to make it small and tidy. But we must not let ourselves shrink our religion or let our own thinking be made small. We are the Church of Jesus Christ, and we seek to follow Him andput His teachings into practice in our ownlives. In so doing we find sanctuary in ourfaith.<br><br>But what about those times when our faith is weak or wavers? Then we must act<i>as if.</i>In the words of William Sloan Coffin, the longtime chaplain of Yale University:<br><br><i>It is terribly important to realize that the leap of faith is not so much a leap of thought as of action. For while in many matters it is first we must see, then we will act; in matters of faith it is first we must do then we will know, first we will be and then we will see. One must, in short, dare to act wholeheartedly without absolute certainty.</i><br><br>Or, as he said more succinctly:<br><br><i>I love the recklessness of faith. First you leap, and then you grow wings.</i>[William Sloan Coffin,<i>Credo</i>(Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press, 2004), 7]<br><br>Remember also the lesson recorded in Joshua 3. The waters of the Jordan River were not stopped until the priests stepped into the river. Faith compels action, and we nourish that faith by communicating with the Lord.<br><br>My assignment at the university requires me to have some infrequent contact with Church headquarters, especially as it relates to hosting or to a program I direct in China. A couple of years ago, Amy and I were making our annual pilgrimage to Disneyland with the kids when my cell phone rang. We were driving south on I-15 at the time, just passing through Las Vegas. I looked at the caller ID, knowing that Ihad asked my secretary to forward only emergency calls, and I saw that it was coming from a 240 prefix--the prefix of the Church Office Building.<br><br>Knowing I had to answer this call, I asked the kids to be quiet and said hello. A formal female voice replied, saying, "Please hold for Elder Oaks." Immediately I was nervous. For him to be tracking me down on my cell phone suggested that there was a problem. For some reason I felt guilty even taking the call while I was driving through Vegas on my way to Disneyland, so I told the kids to be quiet with alittle more urgency and waited for Elder Oaks to come on the line. Fortunately, I had a ready answer to his question, and, mercifully, the call ended quickly.<br><br>I've been thinking about that call, and other calls I've had over the years, in connection with prayer. If I respond so seriously to conversations with General Authorities and other Church officers, why am I inclined to occasionally treat communication with my Father in Heaven so casually?<br><br>We are instructed to "counsel with the Lord in all thy doings" (Alma 37:37). I suspect that none of us is able to spend all day on bended knee counseling with the Lord. There are classes to attend, chores to do, meals to cook, and a thousand other things each of us needs to do every day. What, then, might it mean to "counsel . . . in all thy doings"? Clearly, part of it involves regular, formal prayers; but to me it also suggests an attitude of living--the recognition of our dependence on our Heavenly Father and a commitment to seek and know His will.<br><br>Several years ago the "What would Jesus do?" movement became very popular. It was inspired originally, I believe, by our friends in the evangelical community. Before it became a marketing tool used to sell merchandise, it contained a helpful reminder: to keep our relationship with the Lord in our minds as we make decisions throughout the day.<br><br>Early in our marriage, Amy had a friend who took this teaching quite seriously. She counseled with the Lord in all aspects of her life, including seemingly trivial matters like what to cook for dinner or how to decorate her apartment. Amy and I used to laugh at this, confident that the Lord didn't need to be troubled with such minutia of daily life and thinking that such prayers suggested a kind of unhealthy spiritual dependency. Now, with a little more life experience, I'm less quick to dismiss these kinds of prayers. I still don't find myself asking the Lord about paint colors for the walls, but I'm more inclined to believe that constant communication forms part of the fabric of a necessary relationship with the Lord.<br><br>For me it makes some sense to relate it to parenthood. Each of our children has different ways of communicating with Amy and me. We've tried to raise them to be independent, capable adults, something I hope they're on their way to becoming. But on the way I've noticed some interesting things. Our oldest daughter, Kelsey, just finished her junior year at BYU. She lives in an apartment with friends and manages her life about as well as any 20-year-old could be expected to do. She also calls us just about every day, often with what seem to be nonquestions. Amy and I used to laugh about it, but it has gradually dawned on me that there may be a purpose in those calls. Kelsey doesn't really need us to answer the question she's asking; she needs us to know what she's doing and that she's thinking about us and values our opinions.<br><br>Our other children have their own ways of communicating. Some of them want to tell us lots of details and practically demand our attention, while others are happy to simply know we're there. I suspect the same holds true for each of our relationships with the Lord. They are colored by our own personalities and needs, and they each march to their own individual rhythms.<br><br>But what remains true for all of us is the need to counsel with the Lord. The key, I think, lies in the word<i>counsel.</i>It suggests a very different kind of prayer than those we sometimes fall into the trap of reciting. My wife and I have been pretty good throughout our married life at making sure that each day ends with our family on our knees praying together. Unfortunately, not all of those prayers rise to the level of counseling with the Lord. There is the inevitable giggling or recitation of rote lines. Years ago our younger son began using the word<i>cuponus</i>in his prayers. At first I was a little baffled, thinking it soundly vaguely Latin. What it turned out to be was his young mind trying to make sense of the phrase "come upon us," which apparently we all used routinely in our evening prayers. It was nothing to him but a collection of sounds that he figured had to fit into a prayer at some point. Perhaps many of us at times fall into thetrap of routinized prayers that fall far short of the goal of counseling with the Lord. In so doing, we starve our faith and delay finding sanctuary.<br><h2><b>Church</b></h2><br>Entering the great cathedrals of Europe invokes an immediate sense of awe at the majesty of the architecture and at the dedication it took to build these great monuments. Walking into a modern LDS building may not have the same effect on us. The architecture is much less grand and the interiors much more practical. Nevertheless, they should and ought to be weekly places of sanctuary for each of us. In D&amp;amp;C 115:6 the Lord says, "The gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm."<br><br>To the outsider, the three-hour meeting timeon Sunday, depending on the ward, must seem to have elements of a worship service, a neighborhood gathering, a singles social event, a day care, and a K–12 school with some adult education thrown in. Too often, even to those of us in the Church, it can feel more like work than worship. But at the heart of those three hours is the ordinance of the sacrament and the opportunity to renew our baptismal covenants--the opportunity to witness again to the Lord that we not only believe, but that we also willdo.<br><br>To find sanctuary at our church meetings, our responsibility is twofold: to ourselves and to others. To ourselves we have the responsibility to rethink, if necessary, our approach to our weekly meetings and to treat them less like an assignment and more like worship. I'm well aware of the challenges of getting kids out of bed and ready while worrying about the Primary, Sunday School, Relief Society, or priesthood lesson we need to teach and the difficulty of feeling reverent when our young kids throw their Cheerios and our teenagers sleep open-mouthed through the services. But somehow, we must find that reverence. We can all take practical steps to make sure that we are more prepared for Sabbath services, but we can also make an inner commitment to refocus and recommit to the core purpose of worship.<br><br>We have the responsibility to enrich the experiences of others in the congregation as well. On several occasions my family has lived in London and attended a local branch or ward. These few scattered branches in a city of 12 million people are vital sanctuaries for the members. They are places where they can meet with fellow Saints and rejoice in their company. Obviously, our situation is different here, but we could learn something from those British Saints, many of whom are both recent immigrants to the UK and recent converts to the Church. They look forward to each Sunday, often traveling long distances, and greet each other like family members. The meetings may not always run with the precision of a Wasatch Front ward and may not always adhere to standard operating procedures, but there is a palpable joy in being together in a community of Saints. Let us work to bring that same sense of community to our services--the same inclusiveness, the same fellowship--and we may begin to feel the sanctuary of our weekly services.<br><h2><b>Temple</b></h2><br>A few years ago, Amy and I were in Hong Kong on assignment from the university and attended a session at the Hong Kong Temple. After the session we received a briefing from the Asia Area Presidency on the state of the Church in Asia. In the course of the briefing, Elder Kent D. Watson showed a picture of an elderly Mongolian woman standing in front of her yurt, the traditional Mongolian tent. He went on to explain that this sister, a recent convert to the Church, had, over the course of many months, saved her money so that she could pay for the four-day train ride from Mongolia to Hong Kong to attend the temple for the first time. She did all this at her own expense without any monetary support from the Church. As I looked at the picture of this dedicated sister and thought of her four-day train ride, my own commitment to the temple seemed rather pale in comparison.<br><br>Amy and I live near Kiwanis Park on the east side of campus, so rather than a four-day train ride on hard seats, we have about a four-minute car drive on comfortable car seat cushions. Yet it may as well be a four-day train ride sometimes. I can easily find two hours to watch my friend coach a basketball game in the Marriott Center, but finding the same amount of time to be in the temple feels somehow more difficult.<br><br>I fear that for some of us, the convenience of a temple may have led to casualness about the temple. And yet it is there that we can find, as Isaiah said, "a place of refuge, and . . . a covert from storm and from rain" (Isaiah 4:6). Let us all recommit to finding sanctuary in the temple, to treat it as a refuge from the daily grind. In the temple we find peace, we find truth, we find God.<br><h2><b>Relationships</b></h2><br>I've reached the stage of my life commonly known as middle age, and I expect it's a consequence of that stage to become a bit more reflective, so permit me a few words about families. I recognize that in the audience are people at all stages of family life. Some are still firmly embedded in their parents' families, others are just starting their own. Amy and I are now sending children out of the house rather than welcoming them in. I suppose we all have moments of clarity that strike each of us in different ways--on a walk, listening to music, reading the scriptures. Mine typically come at 34,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean, stuck in seat 44C in economy class.<br><br>I had one of these moments a couple of summers ago, flying back from Shanghai, trying unsuccessfully to get comfortable while Amy snoozed contentedly beside me. I started thinking of my kids--at that time Taylor was almost back from his mission, Kelsey had just finished her freshman year at BYU, and Eliza was about to join Hansen at Provo High. It reminded me that when I took a job at BYU, Kelsey was a newborn, and Hansen and Eliza weren't born yet. Amy and I were that young couple with the little kids on the ward picture board.<br><br>Despite how I may still feel about myself, Irecognize that we aren't that family anymore. What surprises me is how quickly it has gone and, as we sit around and reminisce, what it is the kids remember. Some of it, certainly, is the big events and the accomplishments. But more of it is the minutia, the day-to-day stuff of life: the made-up stories when we're desperately trying to get the kids in bed, the attempts at family prayer and scripture study that may not have turned out perfectly, or the trips to 7-Eleven for a Slurpee.<br><br>As every parent knows, the lessons we think we're teaching our kids aren't always the lessons they are learning. Back in 2000 we were living in London directing the Study Abroad Program. It was our kids' first time in the city, so we spent a couple of days walking around the neighborhood and helping them get settled. On one of these walks down a busy street, Amy noticed a bus number that she had been wondering about, and since it was one of the old Routemaster buses with the driver up front and a conductor in the back, she hopped on the back platform to ask the conductor about its route and cost. Satisfied, she hopped back off, and the bus started to drive away. What we hadn't noticed was that Hansen had followed her onto the bus. And as it drove away, we had a perfect view of his eight-year-old face looking quizzically at us from the back platform. A million things go through a parent's mind at a time like this, including, "How in the world is he ever going to find his way back when he doesn't have any money, doesn't know the city, and has no idea where we live?"<br><br>Panicking that she would never be able to find him again, Amy starting yelling, "Jump!" In a panic of what would happen if he jumped off a speeding bus onto a busy street, I started yelling, "Don't jump!" Caught in that awkward moment of conflicting parental demands, Hansen froze, uncertain what to do. Luckily, an observant businessman grabbed him, stopped him from jumping, and notified the driver to pull over.<br><br>In the aftermath of our little scare, we went to a great deal of effort to establish a family safety travel plan. If any of the kids ever got separated from the family, they were to get off at the next bus or Tube stop and wait for the family to catch up. On a subsequent trip we had occasion to put the plan into practice. We had ridden the light rail to Greenwich and were returning to London. The kids had run ahead, pushed the "Open Door" button on the train, and gotten on. We followed them and pushed the button for the door to open. It didn't work on the first push or on any of the increasingly vigorous pushes that followed. Instead the train began to pull away, and we watched as our kids waved goodbye with their faces pressed against the window. Again we were saved by the kindness of other passengers, who notified the conductor; the train was stopped and the doors manually opened.<br><br>In our debriefing afterward, we asked the kids what they would have done if the train hadn't stopped. Fully expecting that they would tell us that they would have followed the family plan, our youngest, Eliza, instead said that she would have ridden the train into the city and switched to the Tube at Bank Station, ridden it to Queensway, walked down Bayswater Road, turned right on Palace Court, and gone to our home at number 27. I was stuck wondering how in the world she had learned to navigate the transportation system of one of the largest cities in the world and how in the world she had gotten our family plan so wrong.<br><br>Of all the lessons we try to teach our kids, there is one that we must get right: it is the lesson that they are loved. Perhaps the greatest gift my parents ever gave me was the gift of never wondering if I was loved, never wondering if they were proud of me, never wondering where I fit in their hierarchy of priorities. That's the gift I hope I've given to my children. For each of us, home ought to be our daily sanctuary.<br><br>I've on occasion heard people speak about their marriages and say things like "I've never spoken a word I regretted" or "We've never gone to bed angry with each other." It's not that I don't admire the sentiment or these people--I just don't know who they are and how they do it. Amy and I are certainly not perfect, and I may have spoken a few words I regretted and made her angry at me more than once, but I have never doubted that she is the one I want to spend eternity with. It is a love so deep and so fundamental to who we are that it trumps any of the problems that life brings.<br><br>There is enough criticism at school and work for a child or spouse without them having to face it at home, too. Outside of the home there is always someone smarter, prettier, more athletic, or better educated. In the home we should all feel loved, respected, and accepted, knowing that among these people and in this place, we have our sanctuary.<br><h2><b>Personal Sanctuary</b></h2><br>Finding sanctuary in our faith, at our church, in the temple, and in our relationships may not help us pass the test we haven't prepared for, find the perfect job, or save a wayward child or roommate. But it does promise the peace that comes when each of us finds the ultimate sanctuary in a personal relationship with our Lord and Savior. That peace and assurance can sometimes take time to find. Discipleship is not earned in a day, a week, or a year. It is earned through the sustained exercise of faith and commitment during the variety of challenges each of us will face in our lives. The challenges may appear unequal from person to person, but they give each of us the opportunity to learn, grow, and<i>become.</i>Discipleship requires patience with ourselves and with our situations.<br><br>One of the enduring questions in theology is often phrased as follows: If God loves us so much, why is life so hard? Why do some endure miserable living conditions, broken home lives, and unbearable pain, while others seem to coast through life with a silver spoon in their mouth? I don't know that I have a fully satisfactory answer to that question, but I do know that the differing situations we face in life do not correspond to how much our Father loves each of us. I trust that one aspect of God's love is His desire for the ones He loves to fulfill their full potential. Parents who understand divine love ask more of their children; teachers who understand this demand more of their students; and a God who authored this allows each of us to be tested so that we can progress along the path to the divine.<br><br>No stranger to suffering himself, Elder Neal A. Maxwell wrote:<br><br><i>The justice of God permits no special deal for disciples. We must subdue our selfishness; we must endure the pain of prioritizing. We must cope with the variables of the second estate. There can be no later outcry by the nonbelievers that they were ultimately deprived of an</i>equal chance<i>to believe and to follow. For disciples there is no spiritual equivalent to the "prime rate" or the "most-favored nation" clause.</i>[Neal A. Maxwell,<i>The Neal A. Maxwell Quote Book</i>, ed. Cory H. Maxwell (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997), 91; emphasis in original]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, there is no cramming for discipleship, no CliffsNotes, no accelerated courses. It is an education that proceeds according to the rhythm of our lives as we meet the challenges presented to us. The blessings of discipleship unfold slowly as we act on Christ's teachings and bear with patience and humility the lessons we are taught. And the blessings of discipleship take the form of the most important victories in our lives--no fanfare or public notice, no awards or trophies--just the personal and infinitely more meaningful victory of the soul that allows us to come to know Christ and to understand the purpose of mortality.<br><br>In the meantime, we must, as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, "plow in hope" (1 Corinthians 9:10). The patience of a disciple can sometimes extend to the next generation. Finding patient sanctuary in his old age, Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Too old to plant trees for my own gratification, I shall do it for my posterity" (Letter to Constantine Samuel Rafinesque [October 9, 1822], in Edwin M. Betts, "The Correspondence between Constantine Samuel Rafinesque and Thomas Jefferson,"<i>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</i>[Lancaster, Pennsylvania: Lancaster Press, 1944], 87:377).<br><br>I apologize to those of you who have heard me tell this story before, but, as some of you know, I was raised in what we refer to in the Church as a part-member home. My mom was an Idaho farm girl who had moved to the big city, Idaho Falls, to be a telephone operator. My dad was the son of a Pennsylvania coal miner who joined the navy at 17 and was, several years later, sent to Idaho to train at the nuclear reactor facility for his assignment on the first nuclear submarine, the<i>Nautilus</i>. There they met, fell in love, and eloped to the romantic getaway of Elko, Nevada.<br><br>During those years, my dad was a wonderful father and a devoted husband, but he was not interested in my mother's faith. My mom found herself living on a submarine base in New London, Connecticut, with four young children and a husband who was out to sea for months at a time. I wonder how easy it would have been for her to slip away from the Church, to take a week off, to make the understandable excuse that it was just too hard to get the kids to church by herself. But she never did. She cured our bouts of "Sunday sickness," served faithfully in her callings, and never took the easy way out.<br><br>As an adult I realize that everything Ibecame in the Church I owe to my mother. Idon't want to romanticize growing up without a father in the Church--there were difficult moments for my mom that I was oblivious to and things that I missed out on as a child. But it did free me of one all-too-common misperception in the Church: growing up the way I did, I was never burdened with the false belief that women are in any way less capable or less fundamental to the gospel plan than are men. For those of you who know Amy, you won't be surprised to hear that I've relearned that lesson every day for the past 25 years.<br><br>There is too often a mismatch between our professions of the sanctity of womanhood and motherhood and our behavior that demeans and diminishes. We do no damage to God's eternal plan in behaving this way, but we certainly endanger our role in that plan.<br><br>Many of us find ourselves in situations where we fight against hopelessness, wondering why things haven't gone the way we had them planned out when we were young. Sometimes we recognize the consequences of our own choices, and other times we suffer from the consequences of others' choices. But there is always hope.<br><br>For 51 years my mother went to church without a husband as they moved from submarine bases on the East Coast to shore duty in Missouri to postnavy life in Colorado and then retirement in Utah to be near their kids. A few days before my father's 75th birthday, he was baptized; when he was 76 we were sealed in the temple as a family; and now at 79 he serves with my mother in a small branch, ministering to those in a care facility in Orem. My dad is in the branch presidency, and my mom is in the Relief Society presidency. These past four years didn't make the previous half-century easier; they just made it worth it. It's the same for all of us--it may not be tomorrow or next month or next year, but it will be worth it.<br><br>Paul described Abraham as one "who against hope believed in hope" (Romans 4:18). There may be times that that is all we have to cling to. But the ultimate reward of that hope is the sanctuary of a personal relationship with the Lord. That is the good news. As recorded in 2 Samuel 22:3, "The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour." Or as written in Deuteronomy 33:27, "The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms." We can find sanctuary in good times and bad in the open, loving arms of a Father in Heaven and a Savior who love us both for who we are and who we may become. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffrey F. Ringer was director of the BYU David M.

<h1>Your Calling in Life? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Twenty-five years ago my dad dropped me off at Deseret Towers for my freshman year at BYU. I felt lonely in my dorm that first night, so I took a walk around campus at dusk. I remember looking at all of these stately buildings and envisioning their walls reverberating with great thoughts and words of wisdom. I was awestruck. In fact, I think that was the night I fell in love with BYU.<br><br>Now, as a BYU professor, I have the humbling responsibility to be one of the voices reverberating within the hallowed walls. I often question whether I measure up. But I'm unspeakably grateful to do the work I do and to do it here at BYU. I believe I have found my calling in life, and it brings me immense joy.<br><br>I'd like to ask each of you a personal question. What is<i>your</i>calling in life? If you don't know yet, how will you find out?<br><br>I have asked those questions to hundreds of students over the years. Usually, it creates a lot of anxiety. Some of you lose sleep over which class to take next semester, let alone what you should be when you grow up. Some of us grown-ups haven't really figured it out either. For many, deciding what to do with your life can feel like a personal crisis that doesn't go away.<br><br>As I begin my remarks, I want you to understand that finding my calling in life was not easy. My career path was circuitous, and I often felt great anxiety about it. I always knew I wanted to care passionately about my work, but for years I had no idea what that work should be. Several times I felt utterly adrift, as if I had somehow missed the path I should have taken and could never get back on it. In hindsight, those moments are important parts of the tapestry of my career. Each thread that felt out of place at the time now provides structure to the pattern of my life. They helped me distinguish and define my calling. I learned, to quote Romans 8:28, that all things do indeed "work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the<i>called</i>according to his purpose" (emphasis added).<br><br>My aim today is to encourage you to think about your future life's work<i>without</i>the anxiety--because when we ponder our calling in life through the lens of the restored gospel, we don't need to feel anxious.<br><br>First, we need to explore what we mean by a "calling in life" to see whether the idea fits within the framework of the restored gospel. Actually, the idea of a professional calling is not ancient. It was brought into focus by Martin Luther, who revolutionized how the world looked at work. Prior to Luther, people viewed work as a necessary evil at best. The ancient Greeks considered work a galling distraction from the more sublime pursuits of the mind--a view that allowed them to justify slavery so that the elite class could focus on thinking great thoughts. Some early Christian traditions believed that work kept men from the holier pursuit of contemplating God's greatness, and thus justified a monastic life devoid of labor, and sometimes even service.<br><br>Luther, however, saw the fallacy in these beliefs. His study of the Bible convinced him that work is how we participate in God's providence toward His children. Lee Hardy, ascholar of Luther's teachings, noted, "As we pray each morning for our daily bread, people are already busy at work in the bakeries" (Lee Hardy,<i>The Fabric of This World: Inquiries into Calling, Career Choice, and the Design of Human Work</i>[Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1990], 48).<br><br>Luther also taught how to find your calling. It was pretty simple: your calling was to do whatever your station in life dictated. If you grew up in a cobbler shop, your calling was to devote yourself to making shoes. And doing so, you participated in the work of God by covering the feet of His children. Luther believed that virtually any type of work could be a calling, so long as it rendered service to mankind.<br><br>John Calvin elaborated on Luther's ideas in a way that may make them seem a little more applicable to us today. For Calvin, it wasn't our position in the social structure that determined God's calling for us. Rather, he argued that God endows each of us with particular talents and gifts, and that it is our calling to discover those gifts and to seek out ways to use them in the service of our fellowmen. As he put it, "For as God bestows any ability or gift upon any of us, he binds us to such as have need of us and as we are able to help" (quoted in Hardy,<i>The Fabric of This World,</i>62; also in<i>Sermons of M.John Calvin upon the Epistle of Saint Paul to the Galatians</i>[London: Lucas Harison and George Bishop, 1574], 307; translation modified).<br><br>So the very roots of the idea of a professional calling are distinctly religious. Ironically, the world still embraces the notion of a professional calling, but it has almost entirely abandoned the spiritual roots of the idea. As sociologist Max Weber put it, "The idea of duty in one's calling prowls about in our lives like the ghost of dead religious beliefs" (Max Weber,<i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,</i>trans. Talcott Parsons [New York: Dover, 2003], 182).<br><br>Because society has drifted from the spiritual moorings of calling, it has developed some odd and distorted doctrines about<i>finding</i>your calling. In fact, I would like to refer to a few of these doctrines as heresies. That may seem like a strong word, but I believe it's fitting because if we were to embrace these worldly doctrines, they would lead us far afield from how the Lord intends us to view our life's work. I submit to you that these heresies are the very things that cause us so much anxiety when we are trying to decide what our calling in life is. So if we appeal to the restored gospel to dispel these heresies, we can replace anxiety with faith and hope.<br><br>The first heresy I'd like to discuss gets right to the heart of our anxiety. It is: "You might have a calling if you are lucky, or you might not." To dispel this heresy, let's look at a scripture I use as the theme for many of my classes. You have heard it many times, but I'd like to point out something that you may have missed. In D&amp;amp;C 58:27, the Lord asks His children to "be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness." You might be tempted to think, "Well, that scripture refers to church work. It's not really relevant to my career." Are you sure about that? Would the Lord so pointedly command us to be<i>anxiously</i>engaged in good causes if he wanted us to spend a huge portion of our waking hours--eight to five, for instance--simply punching a clock? The Lord asks us to do "many things" in service to good causes. Why should our work not be one of them?<br><br>Now, here's the part you may not have thought about--I certainly hadn't until a few years ago: After the Lord charges us to anxiously pursue good causes, the next verse begins: "For the power is in them" (D&amp;amp;C 58:28). Think about that. The Lord hasn't just told you to pursue good causes, He has equipped you with power to do so. You--you personally--are full of divine capacities to do good that you probably don't even fully appreciate.<br><br>These verses testify that you are<i>not</i>part of a lottery system for life callings. You have a calling in life: to pursue good causes. And you have been given power to do just that.<br><br>But knowing that you have power to do good works is one thing; knowing specifically what you ought to do is quite another. How do you find your<i>particular</i>calling? That's the burning question for many of us.<br><br>Some are lucky enough to know at an early age what they are meant to do. Doctors, writers, and artists, for instance, often realize during childhood that they have a gift and never have to agonize about what work they will do. Most of us are not so fortunate, though. We are perplexed by a dizzying array of college majors, service opportunities, and job choices--many of which seem interesting, but perhaps none of them speak definitively to our souls. That was how I felt as an undergraduate at BYU. At various times I seriously considered becoming an attorney, a businessman, a linguist, a federal government official, and a seminary teacher--never a professor, by the way. I liked all of those ideas but was overwhelmed by uneasiness every time I got close to committing to one of them.<br><br>The anxiety you might feel about choosing a career brings up the second heresy that we can dispel through an appeal to gospel truth. It is: "You have to find your one true calling in order to be fulfilled."<br><br>This heresy should remind you of your favorite fairy tale in which the princess finds her "one true love." Let's consult the scriptures again to see if they support the idea of a unique perfect fit.<br><br>D&amp;amp;C 46 enumerates many spiritual gifts that you might have been given--gifts of teaching, healing, or language. Some of these gifts don't seem particularly relevant to choosing a profession. But let's see what else the Lord tells us about spiritual gifts. Verses 11 and 12 read:<br><br><i>For all have not every gift given unto them; forthere are many gifts, and to every man is given agift by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.</i><br><br>Note that there are many gifts, that they are distributed differently among us, and that they are given so we can bless one another. But the Lord does not say that He has listed every possible gift. In fact, Elder Bruce R. McConkie said that "spiritual gifts are endless in number and infinite in variety" (Bruce R. McConkie,<i>ANew Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1985], 371). Could this endless and infinite list include spiritual gifts relevant to our professional lives? We know that all things are spiritual to the Lord, so yes, of course our spiritual gifts have everything to do with our professional callings.<br><br>In fact, finding our calling in life involves the same process as discovering our spiritual gifts. Elder Robert D. Hales has provided some insight on this process:<br><br><i>To find the gifts we have been given, we must pray and fast. . . . I urge you each to discover your gifts and to seek after those that will bring direction to your life's work and that will further the work of heaven.</i>[Robert D. Hales, "Gifts of the Spirit,"<i>Ensign,</i> February 2002, 16]<br><br>As you consult your spiritual gifts, you may find that you don't feel an urgent pull to practice medicine or educate children, for instance. Maybe instead you just like working with people. That is the most common thing I hear from students who are perplexed about what type of work they should do. If you think your spiritual gifts lie somewhere in that ambiguous area, I challenge you to delve much deeper into what your specific gifts are.<i>How</i>do you like working with people? Our strongest gifts tend to appear early in life, so it might help if you think back on your childhood and about how and what you played. Were you the kid that always got the neighborhood baseball game going? Maybe you have a spiritual gift for organizing others into collective action. Were you a natural storyteller? Maybe you have a spiritual gift for presenting ideas in a compelling and dramatic way. Were you the person who other kids always sought out for sympathy and acceptance? Maybe you have a spiritual gift for listening and discerning others' emotions. Other types of gifts that you may notice in yourself include the ability to praise others effectively, to identify and encourage others' talents, to organize information in a concise manner, and to see a problem from multiple angles.<br><br>These sorts of gifts may not suggest a particular career path to you, and that may seem like a disadvantage. I challenge you to try thinking differently. The gifts I have just listed have market value. They are also highly portable. You might express those gifts in many professions or organizations. Consequently, finding your calling in life<i>may not</i>be a matter of finding the one right job. Instead, it may be that your calling is to bring your unique spiritual gifts to whatever position the Lord blesses you with.<br><br>If you exercise faith in the Lord, follow His spirit, and seek to amplify your gifts, you will be led gradually to a place where you are well equipped to serve. I have seen it happen over and over. I have a colleague, tremendously respected in his field, who became an auditor--not by long-term planning, but by a series of minor circumstances that led him gradually and unintentionally to his profession. He could never have predicted the fulfillment his career would give him. We usually can't predict exactly where our gifts will lead us. But in retrospect, we will see the hand of the Lord leading us from door to door and opportunity to opportunity as we exercise and hone our spiritual gifts.<br><br>This principle is particularly important in today's economy. We faculty are keenly aware of how challenging it is for our students to find jobs today. You cannot control the economy. As a result, there is a temptation to feel like a victim or to give in to despair. When you are negatively affected by unstable economic conditions, focus on your gifts, which<i>are</i>stable. You may have to take a job that is below your level of qualification. If so, perform the work with drive, and use your gifts to put your unique stamp on your contributions. Doing so will increase your chances of finding better employment later.<br><br>You may even suffer joblessness for a time. Research shows that unemployment can have a devastating long-term impact on self-confidence, on health, and on happiness. I submit that having a sense of calling is part of your inoculation against the vicissitudes of the job market. Know yourself. Know what your gifts are. And define yourself by your gifts--not by your lack of a job. Contrary to what the world might tell you, you don't have to have a job to express your calling in life. If the world at present is not willing to pay you for what you can do, then donate your spiritual gifts to worthy causes--perhaps through public service or volunteering--until the value of those gifts becomes so evident that people want to pay you a fair wage for them. Even in a booming economy, you may have to create your own opportunities to fulfill your calling in life. Despite what most fairy tales imply, real-life princes and princesses don't just wait around for their dreams--or dream jobs--to come true.<br><br>Speaking of dream jobs brings us to the third heresy: "When you find your calling, work will be bliss." This is a particularly pervasive heresy today. The media implores you to build a career that is exciting and intensely fulfilling. Now, I am certainly an advocate of enjoying your work! But it is a distortion of the idea of calling to think that work should always be fun.<br><br>As an example, let me share with you the story of some people I have recently studied: zookeepers. I chose to study zookeepers because they are passionate about the work they do, even though they make little money and have few opportunities for career advancement. Learning about what "calling" means to zookeepers was eye-opening. As you might expect, zookeepers find their work very meaningful. They care for their animals as if they were their own children, and they feel great satisfaction when they can enrich their animals' lives and maintain their health. They believe deeply in conservation and see themselves as educators of the public about species preservation. By and large, they are almost outrageously satisfied with their work.<br><br>But is every day fun for them? Hardly.When zookeepers talked about their work as a calling, they spoke not just about satisfaction but also about sacrifice--caring for sick animals in the middle of the night, doing unsavory work, foregoing a comfortable living, and the list goes on. I learned something tremendously important from my study of zookeepers. For them, the pain and burdens and sacrifice were not threats to their sense of calling--they were<i>part</i>of it. The work was meaningful<i>because of</i>the trials and burdens. That is an important lesson. We can't expect deep meaningfulness from our calling unless we are willing toassume its burdens as well.<br><br>Joseph Campbell, a professor of literature who studied and taught about hero myths, introduced the phrase "follow your bliss" back in the 1970s. The idea was that heroes don't chase money or prestige; they look into their hearts to find their passion and then pursue it (see Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers,<i>The Power of Myth,</i>ed. Betty Sue Flowers [New York: Doubleday, 1988]). Now you see the phrase "follow your bliss" everywhere. Later, Campbell developed misgivings about how people were using the phrase. It was reported that he quipped, "What I should have said was, 'Follow your blisters.'" Brothers and sisters, you may do the most important, exciting work in the world. Nonetheless, some days will be mundane and no fun at all--kind of like the days I spend grading papers. You will be called upon to sacrifice. Don't expect deep meaning without paying the price for it.<br><br>A related heresy is: "Finding a calling means that the world will take notice." If you expect the world to loudly applaud your calling in life, you may be disappointed. This point reminds me of one of the zookeepers I interviewed. One day when he was busily caring for an animal, a nun came by with a group of her students. Within earshot of the zookeeper she said, "See the kind of job you get when you don't finish your education!" Ironically, the zookeeper actually had a college degree.<br><br>I would like to tell you about my friend Barb, who was a custodian at my previous university. She was a tiny dynamo of a woman probably in her early 50s. Every afternoon she came into my office, a smiling flurry of activity, to take out my trash. She often asked if there was some special task she might do to make my office cleaner. I rarely took her up on her offer, but I came to realize that it really made her happy when I did. One day I asked her, "Barb, how do you feel about your job?" She beamed. "I love it," she said. "I'm so happy to be a part of this school and just really like making it a better place. Plus," she added proudly, "I'm really good at it." And she was! Barb did make the university a better place. It occurred to me that when I saw her enthusiasm, it made me want to be a better professor. I wish I had told her that, but I don't recall ever doing so.<br><br>I challenge you to look for examples of nobility among those who do the so-called menial tasks all around you. You will find many inspiring examples of people who use their spiritual gifts to serve in quiet but remarkable ways. We do great violence to the souls of those who offer their callings in less-glamorous ways when we consider them invisible or treat them as minor cast members in the great drama of our professional lives. The Savior saw nobility in "the least of these" (Matthew 25:40). And getting to know the Barbs in your life will inspire you to be your best in whatever you are called to do.<br><br>If you find your calling leads you to work that is less than glamorous, take heed to what John Calvin said: "No task will be so sordid and base . . . that it will not shine and be reckoned very precious in God's sight" (quoted in Hardy,<i>The Fabric of This World,</i>90; also in John Calvin,<i>The Institutes of the Christian Religion,</i>ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles [Philadelphia: Westminster, 1960], 3.10.6, 725). The Book of Mormon also promotes an egalitarian spirit about work. Among the Nephites, priests probably held more status than anyone but the king. And yet, Alma 1:26 tells us that even priests were to labor for their own support, with the priest "not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, . . . and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength." It is a heresy that work is meaningful only when it gives us status and esteem. When we work to impress or outshine others, we violate the Lord's vision of work.<br><br>Now, I'd like to speak to you about the last and most insidious heresy about work. It's insidious because it's<i>almost</i>true. The heresy is: "Meaningfulness in life is to be found at work." This idea has become a foundational doctrine of the world. Many people identify themselves primarily by their professions. Once again, I emphasize that I am in favor of working passionately. However, there is a danger that meaningful work might distract us from the weightier matters of eternal life. As one wise person noted, in the eternal scheme of things, our jobs will someday seem to us like playthings. Work is simply one stage upon which we can act out our service to God and our fellowmen.<br><br>The fifth heresy is almost true because our worthwhile work can indeed give us a sense of meaning. But the idea that meaning comes primarily from our work entirely misses the point, because it focuses on the self. Imagine, if you would, a great artist who creates stunning and inspiring masterpieces but then hoards them in her attic, where only she can enjoy them. Certainly she may take pleasure in her creations, but it is through enriching others that the artist makes her contribution to the world. As the fifth heresy suggests, we can indeed find personal meaning in our work, but the real point is that the Lord expects us to render meaningful service through work. True meaning, as always, comes from service.<br><br>Allow me to share a simple experience from my mission. As I was nearing my release date, Ianticipated a sense of loss when I could no longer give all my time to serving God. At a zone conference, my mission president opened the floor for Q&amp;amp;A on any topic. I raised my hand and asked, "After our missions are over and we are no longer full-time servants of God, how can we keep a sense of purpose?" Before the mission president could answer, his wife leapt to her feet and, literally elbowing him aside, said, "I'll take this one."<br><br>I will never forget her response. As near as I can recall, she said, "When I do the laundry, I am building the kingdom of God. When I scrub the floors, I am serving the Lord. When I tidy the clutter, I'm an instrument in His hands. I do a lot of mundane jobs, but if my eye is single to God and I'm trying to serve my family, then I feel as much purpose in my work as a missionary can." Those words remind me of what King Benjamin said about laboring in the fields to support himself--a decidedly unkingly occupation. He said, "I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God" (Mosiah 2:16).<br><br>So perhaps the state of our hearts is as important as the tasks we do in determining whether our work is truly--and eternally--meaningful. D&amp;amp;C 117 reinforces this idea. In this section, the Lord extends a professional calling to Oliver Granger. He is called to Zion, where "he shall be made a merchant unto my name . . . for the benefit of my people" (verse 14). What's striking is that two verses later, the Lord promises to "overthrow the moneychangers in mine own due time" (verse 16). So what is the difference between a merchant unto the Lord's name and a moneychanger whom the Lord will expel? The work they do must look very similar. But in the case of Oliver Granger, he was called to do his work in the service of God and man,<i>not</i>in the service of himself, and certainly not in the service of his own bank account.<br><br>We need to be very cautious about our motives for the work we do. It's tempting to say, "I serve my family when I'm at home, I serve God when I'm at church, and I serve my career when I'm at work." This approach moves us perilously close to becoming moneychangers. We must see our work as but another extension of the Lord's commandment to serve His children and "bring to pass much righteousness."<br><br>How does this measure up to the world's teaching that you have to take care of number one, climb the corporate ladder, get ahead? One of the great gospel ironies is that when we lose ourselves, we find ourselves. Work is much the same. I testify that when you focus your work first and foremost on blessing others, you will become extraordinary at what you do and will find fulfillment and success much more reliably than if you spend your time at work trying to get ahead or get rich. My brothers and sisters, work to serve! Remember the words that greet you at the gateway of the university: "Enter to learn; goforth to serve."<br><br>In closing, I testify that our Heavenly Father is intimately involved in the doors that open for us and in the circumstances that lead us to the places we should be--the places where we are equipped, with power, to serve. Have faith that your unseen Navigator will lead you gradually to your life's calling.<br><br>I also testify that, as with all important questions, when it comes to asking what our calling in life is, Jesus Christ is in the answer. The grace of Christ, that same power that helps us do things we otherwise couldn't, is what will guide us to our callings and enable us to excel in them. You can call upon the grace of Christ to help you with your professional calling. In fact, He pleads with us to do so. In Alma, He invites us to pray over our flocks (see Alma 34:20). Even if we are not shepherds by trade, we all tend professional flocks, and He is mindful of them. Knowing that helps us expel anxiety.<br><br>Lastly, may I conclude with a personal word to you students here at BYU. We, the faculty, love you. You are<i>our</i>flocks. You are our calling in life. And the finest expression of our labors will be the good that you do in the world with the things you learned at BYU. My dear brothers and sisters, follow your bliss, follow your blisters, and go forth to serve. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Jeffery A.

<h1>Prayer - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for coming. It is a singular honor to be with you today, and I pray that this morning we will feel the Spirit instructing us in our collective and individual needs. Those of you who know me may be expecting me to talk about dance, children, or education, and I am very passionate about those things. I would love to sit down with you and talk about them some time. Perhaps you're expecting me to share some of the inspirational experiences I've had with some very unselfish BYU students who reach out to children in schools and touch their lives in ways that are so satisfying. But these simply are not the messages the Lord would have me share with you today.<br><br>I know it is traditional to<i>conclude</i>a talk or lesson with personal testimony, but as I begin this devotional address today, I would like to start with my testimony of prayer. I know that God hears and answers our prayers, and Itestify that the act of praying changes us.<br><br>My testimony of prayer began as a child as I learned to pray from my sweet mother. Mom, who passed away just one year and one week ago at the age of 89, was a lifelong example of sincere prayer. As a single mother raising seven children she never doubted that praying was one of her greatest assets. I am so grateful for her patient teaching and reminding throughout my life. She often asked, "Marilyn, have you said your prayers?" I remember the winter mornings when mother would drive us to school. Neighborhood friends often gathered at our house to go with us. Mormon and non-Mormon alike were invited to crowd into our front room next to the old upright piano and faded green couch. We would kneel in family prayer with our friends before piling into our blue Plymouth to swoosh down the unplowed snowy roads on our way to West Jordan Junior High School. No matter the season, we never left the house without first invoking the blessings of protection from our Father in Heaven, nor did we miss very many evening prayers. Mother guided us in opening and closing the day with family prayer. I also remember seeing her kneel next to her bed as I was growing up, as she sought the strength and insight she knew prayer provided. And I never saw her eat anything without first insisting on a blessing. During her last few years, she grew very forgetful, but never about prayer. Speaking to our Heavenly Father was so deeply a part of her that prayers and blessings were never forgotten. If she forgot anything it was that we had already blessed the food (so our meals together were sometimes doubly blessed).<br><br>My testimony of prayer began as many of our greatest life lessons do--with the example of a faithful parent, in my case my mother, who taught and encouraged from the earliest days I can recall. The best lessons, of course, are the lessons of example. She always prayed.<br><br>But my own testimony of meaningful personal prayer deepened only through practicing it. Like Enos, who said:<br><br><i>My soul</i>hungered;<i>and I</i>kneeled<i>down before my Maker, and I</i>cried<i>unto him in mighty</i>prayer<i>and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came Idid still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</i>[Enos 1:4; emphasis added]<br><br>That scriptural passage gives reinforcement and instruction about three principles I have found important for accessing the peace and power of meaningful personal prayer.<br><br>First of these three lessons is: Enos hungered. How was it that Enos hungered? He was out hunting, but it was not physical hunger he felt as he recalled the words of his father:<br><br><i>And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I received a remission of my sins.</i><br><br><i>. . . And the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.</i><br><br><i>And my soul hungered.</i>[Enos 1:2–4]<br><br>Enos was in need of change--in need of repentance--he was hungry for spiritual peace, eternal assurance, and joy.<br><br>This hunger can be likened to praying with the firm faith and real intent that we read about in Moroni and have been counseled to pursue from modern-day apostle Russell M. Nelson.<br><br><i>To access information from heaven, one must first have a firm faith and a deep desire. One needs to "ask with a sincere heart [and] real intent, having faith in [Jesus] Christ" (Moroni 10:4). "Real intent" means that one</i>really intends<i>to follow the divine direction given.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/ask-seek-knock?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask, Seek, Knock</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 81; emphasis in original]<br><br>What do you hunger for? What do you need? Each family responsibility and church calling I have been blessed with and challenged by has prompted prayers of great need in my life. So has my work and stewardship atBYU.<br><br>So we share something. Two of our most universal needs that we all share in common are, first, the need to personally change, to examine ourselves, and to repent; and, second, the responsibility and concern we have for others--our stewardships, callings, and work. I'd like to share two examples that taught me about accessing the power of prayer in these two times of need.<br><br>The first lesson came from my sister Ann. She had heard me complain at length about a particularly difficult situation I was having with a person I felt had wronged me and who seemed to take delight in seeing me struggle. This situation was consuming me. I was angry and frustrated. Ann suggested that I rethink my victim role and instead follow the admonition from the scriptures in Matthew 5:44: "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."<br><br>Ann shared a specific strategy that at first was very hard--but I accepted her challenge to pray sincerely every day for 30 days that this individual, my "enemy," would have all the best things in life that I would want for myself and my own family. She reminded me that the key was to be sincere, specific, and consistent for the full 30 days. There was a part of me that wanted this person to be miserable; I will admit that sincerely praying specifically for the blessings of love, protection, respect, success, and happiness for this person was really hard at first. But by day 14 I had relearned the power of prayer to change the one who is praying. I could clearly see that I needed to rethink the whole situation and to repent from my own pride and anger. By day 30 it had been transformative. Had my enemy changed? Not really. But the power of prayer and a good dose of repentance from my anger had liberated and changed me.<br><br>The second example of these two universal needs is Sister Peck, who was called to be Relief Society president in Riverton, Utah, where my husband and I purchased our first home. She was very young, in her early 20s, and had just delivered her second child when she received her calling. Ours was a rapidly growing ward with a diverse and large number of sisters. Needless to say, she had a full plate. At times Sister Peck shared her feelings of inadequacy, but more often she expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to serve each of us. But it was one of her counselors that told us something about Sister Peck that Iwill never forget: Sister Peck prayed for each sister in our ward by name in their weekly presidency meetings. That amazed me. In Alma we are invited to "pray over our flocks." Sister Peck prayed over each member of her flock by name. If she could do that with each sister in our ward, couldn't I do more of that, too? Think for a moment about those who you know are praying for you. How do you feel when you realize that others who you wouldn't expect to remember you in their prayers do pray for you? Who could you and Ipray for even more specifically?<br><br>The second principle illustrated in Enos 1:4 is: Enos kneeled. He said, "I kneeled down before my Maker."<br><br>You don't need to be a dancer who studies the meaning of movement to recognize the significant symbolism of kneeling. This gesture of humility and reverence does so much for the one kneeling. During a season of my life when that became impossible because of a serious knee injury with its consequent multiple surgeries, I longed for the privilege to kneel again in prayer more than I longed to walk and to dance again. The first time my knee could bend enough to kneel, tears of gratitude poured out. They still do.<br><br>The scriptures give us a number of references to the importance of kneeling and the attitude of worshipful reverence that it represents. Isaiah instructs, "Every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear" (Isaiah 45:23). Alma records, "[Ammon] fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God" (Alma 19:14). In the Doctrine and Covenants we are admonished to offer prayer upon our knees (see D&amp;amp;C 88:131),<i></i>and in numerous other places in the scriptures we find this simple counsel, to kneel down.<br><br>In his fall 2009 general conference address, Boyd K. Packer said:<br><br><i>Learn to pray. Pray often. Pray in your mind, in your heart. Pray on your knees. Prayer is your personal key to heaven. The lock is on your side of the veil.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/prayer-and-promptings?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prayer and Promptings</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 2009, 46]<br><br>Having silent prayer unceasingly in our mind and heart is wise and worthwhile. But striving to find a place to be alone, to kneel down, and to pray aloud has made a difference for me. Praying out loud is an empowering commitment. It is one of the principles of prayer that we see Enos emulate.<br><br>The third lesson from Enos is: Enos prayed out loud. He records:<br><br><i>And I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication. . . . I</i>[did]<i>cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</i>[Enos 1:4]<br><br>This third principle--praying aloud as Enos did--must have had particular significance for him. I believe it may have helped him be ready to hear the responding voice of the Lord.<br><br><i>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</i><br><br><i>And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.</i>[Enos 1:5–6]<br><br>Enos found forgiveness, increased faith, and perspective as he prayed fervently on that day. He gained the desire to keep praying for his loved ones and the preservation of their sacred records. Eventually he was even moved to pray for his enemies as he "raised his voice" up to heaven through the night.<br><br>Praying aloud has had particular significance for me, too. Its active nature takes a different kind of consideration and energy than silent prayer. Speaking out loud while alone requires finding a place of solitude and sanctuary, a sacred space. Out-loud speaking slows down the tendency to rush a prayer. Time itself becomes part of the sacred process. Speaking audibly while praying alone has over my life been an active confirmation, a self-witnessing of my own faith in a loving Father in Heaven, who is listening. It is certainly not always possible to pray out loud or in solitude, and we are given council to pray unceasingly. A silent prayer in our heart is always appropriate. But when your circumstances permit you to do so, I challenge you to consider saying your personal prayers aloud, if you don't already do so, and to consider how that might make those prayers more meaningful.<br><br>How should we speak in this solitary time of prayer? We should use the same language of prayer we know shows reverence in public. Again this reinforces our personal relationship to the Deity. It changes our prayers from simply a list of things we are thankful for and a list of requests to a more worshipful experience.<br><br>My dance colleague Ed Austin's devotional address from May 2002 enlightens us on this subject. He reminded us of what Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught us about "the special language of reverence and respect." Elder Oaks asserted, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches its members to use special language in addressing prayers to our Father in Heaven" (Dallin H. Oaks, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1993/04/the-language-of-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Language of Prayer</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1993, 15; as noted by Edwin G. Austin Jr. in his BYU devotional address, "<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/edwin-g-austin_reverence-act-showing-respect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reverence: The Act of Showing Respect</a>," 21 May 2002).<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball also taught, "In all our prayers, it is well to use the pronouns<i>thee, thou, thy,</i>and<i>thine</i>instead of<i>you, your,</i>and<i>yours</i>inasmuch as they have come to indicate respect" (<i>Faith Precedes the Miracle</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1972], 201; emphasis in original).<br><br>There are three beautiful prayers offered by the Savior during His earthly ministry and recorded in the scriptures. They are found in Matthew 6:9–13, John 17:1–26, and 3 Nephi 19:20–23. They are models by which we can emulate our Savior when He prayed.<br><br>Finally, President Joseph Fielding Smith was clear when he said, "The Father and the Son should always be honored in our prayers with the utmost humility and reverence" (<i>Answers to Gospel Questions,</i>comp. Joseph Fielding Smith, Jr., 5 vols. [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1958], 2:15).<br><br>So far we have been addressing principles learned from Enos and other leaders of the Church about how to pray. Please consider with me now the privilege of praying itself.<br><br>In his address entitled "The Lifeline of Prayer," President James E. Faust stated, "Access to our Creator through our Savior is surely one of the great privileges and blessings of our lives" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2002/04/the-lifeline-of-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lifeline of Prayer</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 59).<b>Annapurna</b><br><br>I want to share a story about what discovering the notion of sincere personal prayer to a loving Father in Heaven--the kind of prayer we have been discussing today--did for a young Hindu woman in Hyderabad, India. First I need to set the scene. In August 2001, I had the opportunity of traveling to India as artistic director of BYU's The Dancers' Company. While there, we performed and taught in several major cities. We had studied and prepared to be respectful guests by learning as much as we could about the culture and customs of the people of India before leaving Provo. But with a culture as ancient, diverse, and complex as India's, we were only moderately versed in their beliefs and social customs. When I got there I observed in the people I met a consistent dedication to education and family. The people of India are well read. I also saw great charity and spiritual qualities in the people, most of whom are Hindu. It was inspirational and one of the most marvelous experiences of my life. I'm so grateful I was able to share it not with just the dancers but with the other directors and my husband and my daughter, who danced on the company that year.<br><br>There are not a lot of Mormons in India, but while we were there we met a small number of wonderful Latter-day Saint missionaries, humanitarian service missionaries, and convert members. It is not economically or socially easy to convert from Hinduism to Mormonism. Not only are the theologies extremely different, but a person loses social status and is often cut off from their family by simply becoming a Christian. Again, I am not expert about the complex social systems of India, but I can tell you that I witnessed a variety of circumstances wherein the separation of those from different castes was manifested. For example, at one of our first performances, I was sweeping up some rice that was left on the stage at the completion of a dance in which the soloist slowly drops rice from her hands. Some of the native Indians who were backstage called to me to stop, cautioning, "Only the untouchables do that kind of menial labor." Untouchables are members of a group considered below even the lowest social caste, or<i>varna.</i>The woman whose story I am about to share, Annapurna, came from the highest varna.<br><br>I vividly remember the day I met Annapurna and our motorized rickshaw taxi ride together. Please forgive me just a little longer while I set the scene a bit more. These vehicles are basically a motor scooter with a buggy-like attachment that can carry about three passengers at a time. They are soft-sided and have no protection or seat belts for the passengers. Because they're small and lightweight, the drivers often careen wildly through streets as they strive to get as many fares as possible in a day's work. Riding in these vehicles usually created heightened anxiety in me as I worried for my life--I'm even gripping the podium right now, remembering this--and the lives of the BYU students riding in them with us. But there were times when we just simply had to ride in these rickshaws because our transportation choices were limited.<br><br>Upon arriving at the airport in Hyderabad more than two hours late, Annapurna, her husband (a new branch president), and their 11-month-old baby met us. They had helped arrange transportation for our small group that day as we hurried to get to the LDS church where we were scheduled to present a midweek youth fireside. I rode in a rickshaw with one of the dancers and Annapurna. Her husband and baby went in a small car with the other members of our group. We needed to hurry! After a few minutes of observing the rickshaw driver dodge and dart through busy traffic, I realized that watching the road wasn't a good idea. Annapurna was a lovely hostess and her English was very good, and as we bounced along we exchanged the usual courteous greetings shared by people who have just met. Then I became very curious. I asked her to share her conversion story and how she made the dramatic change from Hindu to Latter-day Saint. The Spirit that engulfed us that late afternoon during our rickshaw ride was tangible. The atmosphere inside that little cubby in the back of that motor scooter changed. We all were unaware of the dangerous twists and turns and were completely drawn into her story.<br><br>Annapurna came from a devout Hindu family. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfathers for many generations were all Brahman priests. Her brothers were expected to follow in the family tradition, and she and her sister were expected to marry young men from their own varna, or social caste, who would qualify to become Brahman priests. Again, I am not expert on the practices of this religion, but, as she explained to me, she had spent much of her life memorizing and learning all the rituals and sacred prayers, or Vedas, that were a part of the practice of her religion. She said:<br><br><i>I always felt like the many steps that had to be taken in order to reach deity were so complicated and took so long that I wished for an easier or better way. I yearned to access enlightenment, or what I know now as a loving Father in Heaven, more directly and immediately, but I didn't know how and never shared my thoughts with anyone because I knew that kind of thinking was unacceptable in my family.</i><br><br>When Annapurna was 17 her wonderful grandmother--the light of her life--died. Annapurna's grief was immense. She told us:<br><br><i>I desperately wanted to see my daa-dee-ma again and was struggling with accepting that she was gone. Imagining her essence going on into another form just wasn't comforting me. I kept feeling like my grandmother was near. I wanted to believe that I could talk to her as I had known her--my daa-dee-ma.</i><br><br>Annapurna yearned to pour out her heart in grief and find comfort or hope but had no one who understood the way she was feeling. Then she was befriended by a member of the Church. She discovered that Mormons pray every day, often several times a day, to a loving Father in Heaven. They don't have to attend a shrine or travel to a far-distant temple and follow a series of long, specific Vedas, offerings, and steps to reach God. He is always there ready to listen and comfort. Annapurna wanted to know more about this way of praying. She began to pray like a Mormon prayed, and that was the beginning. She knew this was the answer she had been looking for all of her life. She studied the life of Jesus Christ, read the Book of Mormon, and was taught the gospel. She was baptized a couple of years later but did not know how to tell her family.<br><br>Now the story really gets interesting. Annapurna's sister, whom I mentioned earlier, had attended school in another city, and they had been separated for a number of years. Like Annapurna, she had been devastated by their grandmother's death. In a country where less than 3 percent of the population are Christian and in 2001 less than 5 percent of those Christians were LDS, the odds of two sisters meeting two different Mormons in two different cities within a month of each other are extremely low. But that is just what happened. Annapurna's sister was drawn to the LDS belief that families are forever, that through Jesus Christ and His gift of resurrection she could not only see but also be with her grandmother again. Without the other sister knowing, each of them had been baptized within a short time of one another. Iremember how Annapurna said that she told her sister, "I have to tell you something very important and I hope you will not hate me." Her sister responded, "I have to tell you something and it may mean that we will never see each other again." Each confessed at the same time: "I have been baptized into the Mormon Church."<br><br>I met Annapurna only a few years after her baptism. She shared with me that most of her family ties had indeed been severed. She no longer had the privileges of the Brahman caste in her social life. Everything in her life had changed, but she was grateful to have found the truth of the gospel because of her lifelong desire and feeling that she could and should be able to communicate with God more directly. She discovered prayer. Our 45-minute ride had ended but it felt like we had been going for only a few minutes. The Spirit had been so strong and her testimony of prayer so powerful that time ceased to exist on that ride. I realized as I climbed out of the rickshaw that evening in front of the little building used as both chapel and recreation hall by the Hyderabad Saints that I had taken my personal knowledge of prayer for granted most of my life.<br><br>Let's read the rest of the statement from President Faust's address.<br><br><i>Access to our Creator through our Savior is surely one of the great privileges and blessings of our lives. I have learned from countless personal experiences that great is the power of prayer. No earthly authority can separate us from direct access to our Creator. There can never be a mechanical or electronic failure when we pray. There is no limit on the number of times or how long we can pray each day. There is no quota of how many needs we wish to pray for in each prayer. We do not need to go through secretaries or make an appointment to reach the throne of grace. He is reachable at any time and any place.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2002/04/the-lifeline-of-prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lifeline of Prayer</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 59]<br><br>Ultimately, as President Spencer W. Kimball promised:<br><br><i>There is a knowledge that our Father in Heaven wants each of us to have, and that is a personal knowledge that he hears and answers our prayers.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1981/10/pray-always?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pray Always</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>October 1981, 3]<br><h2><b>Closing</b></h2><br>In closing, I testify to you again that our Heavenly Father is intimately interested in hearing from us and that He is omnipresent and available to listen at all times. I also testify that as we sincerely pray unto the Father through our Savior Jesus Christ, we will be changed. I am grateful for the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, for a living prophet, and for the guidance that prayer provides. May we all more fully appreciate this privilege and commit ourselves to making our personal prayers more meaningful.<br><br>Lastly, may I end on a personal note to you students here at BYU and to my family: Students, we the faculty love you. We pray for you name by name when possible and invoke the Lord's choicest blessings upon you. Thank you for reciprocating and praying for us. We feel your prayers.<br><br>To my husband, children, and grandchildren--to all of my family: Please know that I am particularly grateful for the answers to prayers that led me to you, Craig, my eternal companion, and that have helped and guided us as we have raised our family. Thank you all for being here today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Marilyn W.

<h1> Foundation - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In 1969 I had the privilege of living in the enchanting city of Cuzco, Peru. Each day as my missionary companion and I walked along the stone streets of Cuzco, I never ceased to marvel. Much of the city is literally built on ancient Inca ruins. The workmanship of the carved stones, all fit together without mortar, is exquisite. The strength of such walls made from precisely cut stones, many with interior interlocking arms (somewhat like giant ancient Legos), is incredible. It is ironic that we call them "ruins" because, even though they were constructed many centuries ago, most of them remain perfectly intact today.<br><br>Peru is a land of many earthquakes. We are familiar with the terrible destruction of the 2007 quake there. Tens of thousands were left homeless as buildings in a large region collapsed from the powerful tremors. Many are still trying to rebuild their homes and their lives. Through the centuries such disasters have occurred repeatedly in Peru. While more recently built construction crumbles, the Inca-built structures remain. Somehow these ancient stones, fit together perfectly, withstand whatever natural disasters occur. They remain a firm foundation.<br><br>You are familiar with Christ's teaching:<br><br><i>Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock--</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</i>[3 Nephi 14:24–25; see also Matthew 7:24–25]<br><h2><b>Isfahan, Iran</b></h2><br>In 1976 my wife, Diane, and I, along with our two small children, traveled to Iran, where I had a contract through an American company to teach English to Iranian air force pilots. These pilots were in flight school being taught in English by American instructors to fly modern military aircraft. American-Iranian relations were very different then than they are today.<br><br>While in Iran we lived in Isfahan, an ancient city with beautiful mosques, bridges, fountains, and parks. We witnessed some of the amazing workmanship from the glory days of ancient Persia. These centuries-old treasures were obviously built on solid foundations.<br><br>During our stay in Isfahan we rented a house in a new, rapidly spreading area on the outskirts of the city called "the flats." Many of the houses there were being built quickly for rental to foreigners, particularly Americans, who were coming in large numbers to work on various projects going on in Iran at the time. The house we rented was brand new. It lacked some of the comforts and conveniences we were used to, but it had other luxuries that were new to us, such as beautiful chandeliers and marble floors.<br><br>One day while we were out walking in our neighborhood, we observed preparations being made to build a new house--workers were clearing the ground, moving rocks and piles of dirt. A day or two later we saw chalk lines on the ground showing where the walls were to be located, both exterior and interior. Within days, piles of mud adobe bricks appeared, and the walls began to rise on the bare ground where the chalk lines indicated. My wife and I asked each other, "Where is the foundation?"<br><br>Ironically, about this very same time, we began experiencing problems in our house. We could hear what sounded like water running in the house even when all of the faucets were turned off. One day as my wife was eating lunch with the children in the kitchen, she heard a strange, loud noise. She turned and watched, in shock, as the floor in the large entry room adjacent to the kitchen caved in. Later, as I returned home to the scene, I also found that the wall of the garage had begun to disintegrate into oozing mud. A leak in the water pipe located in the dirt directly beneath the house was literally washing away the foundation of our house. We were experiencing firsthand the problems of a house built on a sandy foundation. Though our house had many ornate features and fancy materials, its foundation was weak. We moved out, and, unfortunately, the landlord was left with a total disaster.<br><br>Christ warned:<br><br><i>And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand--</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</i>[3 Nephi 14:26–27; see also Matthew 7:26–27]<br><br>Our house in Isfahan didn't even require a strong storm to bring it down, only a small leak in a water pipe underneath it.<br><h2><b>Christ Is the Sure Foundation</b></h2><br>Much more important than the foundations of houses or buildings or bridges are the foundations upon which we build our lives. Our true desires, priorities, and aspirations guide our lives now and will determine our future possibilities. The spiritual foundation upon which we choose to build can be a firm, sure foundation or a weak, sandy one.<br><br>Helaman counseled:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, . . . and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you . . . because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>Today we sang the hymn "How Firm a Foundation" (<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 85). The foundation of which we sing is, of course, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He is the sure foundation. I will now relate three experiences of family members, which illustrate the powerful effect of the words and message of this hymn and the sure foundation upon which we must build our lives.<br><h2><b>Amanda Barnes Smith</b></h2><br>My third great-grandmother Amanda Barnes Smith witnessed the terrible tragedy known as the Haun's Mill Massacre on October 30, 1838. Just hours after arriving at the settlement in Missouri, Amanda's husband, Warren, and her son Sardius were shot and killed along with 13 others by invading mobsters. Amanda, with her two daughters and two other sons, survived. Her six-year-old son, Alma, however, was critically wounded, his hip blown away by gunshot. As the grief-stricken wife and mother tried to deal with the shock and the horror of the situation, she later related:<br><br><i>We laid little Alma on a bed in our tent and I examined the wound. It was a ghastly sight. I knew not what to do. It was night now. . . . Yet was I there, all that long, dreadful night, with my dead and my wounded, and none but God as our physician and help. "Oh my Heavenly Father, I cried, what shall I do? Thou seest my poor wounded boy and knowest my inexperience. Oh, Heavenly Father, direct me what to do!" And then I was directed as by a voice speaking to me.</i><br><br>Amanda goes on to describe how she followed the promptings to repeatedly clean the wound with a cloth saturated with lye from the hickory ashes of their smoldering fire. She then placed a poultice made from the roots of a slippery-elm tree into the wound. After covering the wound with linen, she poured a bottle of balsam into the wound, which greatly soothed Alma's pain. She then laid him on a bed, facedown, and instructed him: "Now you lie like that, and don't move, and the Lord will make you another hip."<br><br>In the desperate days and weeks that followed, she and a few other bereaved widows who could not flee stayed behind at the home of Brother David Evans. I continue, in Amanda's words:<br><br><i>In our utter desolation, what could we women do but pray? Prayer was our only source of comfort; our Heavenly Father our only helper. . . . One day a mobber came from the mill with the captain's fiat: "the captain says if you women don't stop your d__d prayer he will send down a posse and kill every d__d one of you!" . . . Our prayers were hushed in terror. We dared not let our voices be heard in the house in supplication. I could pray in my bed or in silence, but I could not live thus long. This godless silence was more intolerable than had been that night of the massacre. I could bear it no longer. I pined to hear once more my own voice in petition to my Heavenly Father.</i><br><br><i>I stole down into a cornfield, and crawled into a "stout of corn." It was a temple of the Lord to me at that moment. I prayed aloud and most fervently. When I emerged from the corn a voice spoke to me. It was a voice as plain as I ever heard one. It was ... a voice, repeating a verse of the Saint's hymn</i>[as we sang today]:<br><br><i>"The soul who on Jesus hath leaned for repose</i><br><br><i>"I will not, I cannot desert to its foes;</i><br><br><i>"That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,</i><br><br><i>"I'll never, no never, no never forsake!"</i><br><br><i>From that moment I had no more fear. I felt that nothing could hurt me.</i>[Journal of Amanda Barnes Smith, unpublished manuscript]<br><br>After five weeks Alma miraculously recovered. Amanda and her surviving children left Missouri for Quincy, Illinois, then Nauvoo. They later came west with the Saints, Alma driving a wagon the full distance. He later married, had a family, and served four missions for the Church. Amanda remained faithful and experienced the Lord's promised blessing. Through the years Amanda's example of faith and reliance upon the firm foundation of the Savior for strength has continued to inspire her many descendants.<br><h2><b>Hal Loren Taylor</b></h2><br>One of Amanda's great-great grandsons is Hal Loren Taylor, my father. In February 1966 he was serving as president of the Southwest Indian Mission, headquartered in Holbrook, Arizona. While in Salt Lake City for training meetings, he and my mother had to take my two-year-old sister, Susan, who was critically ill, to the Primary Children's Hospital. When the meetings concluded, Dad left Mom and Susie there in the hospital in Salt Lake City while he returned to the mission in Arizona. He later recounted,<br><br><i>I had a terrible cloud of discouragement over me and I didn't want to leave them. . . . This heaviness seemed to become worse the closer I got to Holbrook. When I arrived that night, I was so discouraged that I felt I would simply work and work hard enough that I might overcome this terrible feeling.</i><br><br>He started going through the large stack of letters on his desk. A thick letter from a friend who worked out on the Indian reservation caught his attention. He opened it and began to read, hoping to receive some words of encouragement. Instead, the letter contained harsh criticism of him personally and his approach to teaching the gospel to the Lamanites. He stopped reading partway through the letter, his discouragement reaching a new low. He buried his face in his hands and cried aloud, "What am I doing down here?" feeling that the Lord had forsaken him. In that moment the following occurred:<br><br><i>I no more than said those words when a glorious spiritual experience took place where in it was brought so clearly to my mind that I thought someone was speaking these words to me: "Fear not, I am with thee, be not dismayed, for I am Thy God and will still give thee aid. I'll strengthen thee, I'll help thee, and cause thee to stand." That is where the message ended. I looked up from having my head in my hands almost expecting to see someone, or the words written on the wall, because of the glorious feeling which I had. I saw no one, but know that somehow the Lord was giving me the encouragement which I badly needed. I remember straightening up my shoulders and raising my head and feeling a strength that I had never felt before. . . . I realized like I had never realized before that the Lord did not neglect his servants. I cannot remember ever having a real discouraging feeling for the next two and a half years of mission work</i>. [Personal history of Hal Loren Taylor, unpublished manuscript]<br><br>My sister, Susie, survived. Although she still has health challenges, she is today the happy mother of a missionary son who this week completes his service in Chicago, Illinois. My father finished his mission in Arizona and four more that followed, faithfully relying on that firm foundation, the Savior. My father recently celebrated his 92nd birthday.<br><h2><b>Lindy Taylor Barrett</b></h2><br>Now move forward two generations to an experience of Hal's granddaughter, and Amanda's fourth great-granddaughter, Lindy Taylor. In 1998 while serving as a missionary in Bangkok, Thailand, she and her companion were teaching two investigators who had just committed to be baptized the following week. Suddenly an intense feeling of fear and uncertainty overcame Lindy. As they left the church, her Thai companion, Sister Wanprasite, sensed Lindy's anxiety and began to sing, "Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed" ("How Firm a Foundation,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 85). Lindy wrote:<br><br><i>As we rode our bikes from the church, the hymn echoed in my ears . . . "I'll strengthen thee, help thee and cause thee to stand." As we approached the corner I heard the sound of a truck coming down the road. The Spirit told me in a direct and forceful way to stop right where I was. I told Sister Wanprasite, who was behind me, to stop too. I looked and saw a huge garbage truck barreling down the street. ... It was coming so fast we didn't have time to do anything. All of a sudden the truck swung around the corner</i>[just in front of us]<i>barely missing us. ... I felt God's protection, the presence of his angels. "Fear not, I am with thee." I came home last night knowing that, in my efforts to help others gain a testimony and in our own individual lives,</i>we must have faith. [Letter from Lindy Taylor to her family, dated March 23, 1998; emphasis in original]<br><br>The two young ladies who were taught that night were baptized the following week and remain faithful members of the Church.

And the faithful links of the family continue on, built on that sure foundation that never faileth.<br><br>The Lord reminded Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and all of us:<br><br><i>Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail. . . .</i><br><br><i>Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 6:34, 36]<br><h2><b>How Do We Build on the Sure Foundation?</b></h2><br>Finally, let us consider the all-important question: How? How do we build the foundation of our lives on Jesus Christ, the sure foundation? The answer may seem simple, but in reality is supernally profound: we make and keep sacred covenants with Him. In the waters of baptism, in weekly sacrament meetings, and in holy temples, we promise to take His name upon us, to always remember Him and His Atonement, and to keep His commandments which He has given us (see D&amp;amp;C 20:77). In other words, we covenant to make Jesus Christ the foundation of our lives. Our thoughts, desires, and actions are centered on our relationship with Him. As we do this, He promises to bless us with His spirit, His guidance, His help, and His support. Of this we can be totally confident, for the Lord keeps His promises.<br><br>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught the following in the October 2008 general conference:<br><br><i>When we join in the solemnity that should always accompany the ordinance of the sacrament . . . we are qualified for the companionship and revelation of the Spirit. This is the way we get direction for our lives and peace along the way.</i><br><br><i>The resurrected Lord emphasized the importance of the sacrament when He visited the American continent and instituted this ordinance among the faithful Nephites. He blessed the emblems of the sacrament and gave them to His disciples and the multitude (see 3 Nephi 18:1–10), commanding:</i><br><br><i>"And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</i><br><br><i>". . . And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock.</i><br><br><i>"But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall" (3 Nephi 18:11–13).</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Sacrament Meeting and the Sacrament,"<i>Ensign</i>, November 2008, 19]<br><br>To this I add my witness that as we make and keep these sacred covenants with the Lord, He will keep His promises to us. Our lives will be built on that sure foundation, and there will be no need to fear. We will receive guidance and encouragement and strength in times of need, for He understands how to succor us perfectly because He has suffered all of our fears, pains, temptations, and infirmities (see Alma 7:11–12). Our personal infirmities are overcome through the firm foundation, Jesus Christ, the Rock of our Salvation. Of this I bear testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven L.

<br>
<br>
The history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a "marvelous work and a wonder," an unfolding story of revelation, sacrifice, and faith. As a Church historian, I am continually amazed at why it is that some toss and tangle with our past to discredit their faith and that of those around them while others find solace, cheer, and comfort from our past. Iam of the latter persuasion and have chosen to see the hand of the Lord not only in our history but also in the discovery of new understandings of His handiwork in the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in these latter days. If my bias is showing, it is only because of my firm testimony that in all its ups and downs, comings and goings, this is the Lord's doing and His hand figures carefully, if not always prominently, in this great work. And as for Church history, we learn patiently "line upon line," or, as the scripture says: "But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it" (Romans 8:25). I wish to discuss one example of this today.<br><br>My purpose is to share with you new light on a very important episode in our history. In 1970 the late Stanley B. Kimball published an article in<i>BYU Studies</i>in which he examined the significance of the so-called "Anthon Transcript," the identity of the leading scholars who Martin Harris consulted in February 1828, and why Harris returned so committed to financing the printing of the Book of Mormon.<sup>1</sup>My specific purpose in delivering this much abridged version of a longer study I have recently published is to reveal the identity of the three "wise men" Harris visited--Luther Bradish, Charles Anthon, and Samuel L. Mitchill--and what in their background, training, and personalities uniquely prepared them for Harris's visit and why Harris left New York so resolved to pay for the Book of Mormon's printing.<sup>2</sup><br><br>The outlines of this story are well known. In late 1827, working with the gold plates and the Urim and Thummim, Joseph Smith began translating the "reformed Egyptian" characters found in the book of Lehi on the large plates of Nephi. As part of this early work, he transcribed some of the characters as a sort of alphabet or reference guide. His primary scribe was then Martin Harris--a well-known and respected Palmyra farmer, an early and keen supporter of Joseph Smith's work, and later one of the Three Witnesses. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the resentment of his wife, Lucy, at his growing involvement, Harris persuaded Joseph to let him take a transcription to New York City, as historian B. H. Roberts wrote, "to submit them to men of learning for their inspection."<sup>3</sup>Roberts says Harris submitted "two papers containing different transcripts, to Professors Anthon and Mitchell [<i>sic</i>], of New York, one that was translated and one not translated."<sup>4</sup><br><br>According to Anthon's own accounts, Harris first visited Mitchill, who wrote him a letter referring him to Anthon,<sup>5</sup>who in turn "stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian" and that the characters "were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyric, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters . . . and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct."<sup>6</sup>However, when Harris said that an angel had given Joseph the book, Anthon tore up his certificate, vehemently denied the possibility of heavenly manifestations, and told Harris to bring him the plates, which he would translate. When Harris replied he could not do so and that parts of the plates were sealed, Anthon brusquely responded, "I cannot read a sealed book."<sup>7</sup>Harris promptly returned to Mitchill, "who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation."<sup>8</sup>Sometime later this entire episode came to be interpreted as fulfilling Isaiah 29:11, which speaks of "the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed."<sup>9</sup>Whatever else Harris gleaned from these leading scholars, they confirmed his beliefs and encouraged him to devote his time, energy, and resources to the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon. If he left Palmyra wondering and inquiring, Harris returned supporting and defending.<br><h2><b>Luther Bradish</b></h2><br>William W. Phelps recalled that Harris went to New York City by way of Albany, the state capital.<sup>10</sup>Pomeroy Tucker mentioned that "he sought . . . the interpretation and bibliological scrutiny of such scholars as Hon. Luther Bradish, Dr. Mitchell, Professor Anthon, and others."<sup>11</sup>Why was Harris interested in this man Bradish?<br><br>In 1828 Luther Bradish (1788–1863) was a newly elected member of the New York State Assembly who would later run for governor. Born and raised in Massachusetts, Bradish had lived for a considerable period of time in Palmyra, where his parents had moved in 1798. Bradish remained in Massachusetts to attend Williams College, graduating with a BA in 1804. After graduation he rejoined his parents in Palmyra before accepting a teaching post in 1806 at Union Hall Academy in Jamaica, Long Island. By 1810 Bradish had opted for a law career, and he became a very successful, relatively wealthy lawyer whose clients included such well-known literary figures as Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper. On several occasions, certainly in 1815 and again in 1819, he had made extensive visits to Palmyra.<br><br>Thus Martin Harris was calling on a man with whom he was already well acquainted. The Harris and Bradish families had both come to Palmyra in the 1790s. In 1804 both Martin's and Luther Bradish's fathers were together elected as overseers of roads. By 1811 Martin Harris and Calvin Bradish, Luther's older brother, had replaced their fathers as overseers and worked together for a year.<br><br>In April 1816 Bradish's wife, Helen, died in giving birth to their son, who also perished. Bradish sought consolation or at least distraction by traveling abroad. A Whig like John Quincy Adams (then secretary of state and later U.S. president), Bradish applied for a special passport in 1820 offering to serve his country if it cared to take advantage of his whereabouts.<br><br>Adams was particularly interested in promoting American commercial interests with the Ottoman Empire at a time when acute tensions were developing between Turkey and the Muslim countries on the one side and Greece, Russia, and Great Britain on the other. England was especially wary about American interference in this volatile Mediterranean region. Thus Bradish went to Turkey as a private citizen but in a secret, quasi-official capacity. His assigned objectives were to discover whether American interests could be furthered by a treaty of amity and commerce with the Ottoman Empire; to determine the best way of accomplishing this objective; and, finally, to obtain free passage for American ships to Russian ports on the Black Sea. Secretly transported by American naval ships, young Bradish traveled to Constantinople, capital of the Ottoman Empire, which then held loose control over Egypt, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. With a special passport from the sultan's government, Bradish secretly embarked for Egypt in February 1821. He stayed there for five months and held several meetings with the Egyptian ruler Mohammed Ali Pasha.<br><br>His visit to Egypt coincided with the "war of the consuls" between England and France over the archaeological spoils of Egypt, then being plundered by European excavators. Since Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798, an intense European interest in Egyptian antiquities had developed, highlighted by the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 and its eventual decipherment in 1822 by the brilliant French linguist Jean-Franois Champollion. Interest in all things Egyptian was at a fever pitch when Bradish, the only known American in Egypt at the time, sailed up the Nile to the Second Cataract. As his biographer stated, "His curiosity led him into areas few other Americans of his day even knew existed."<sup>12</sup>He was at Dendera at precisely the same time the French excavator Jean Baptiste Leloraine was removing the famed Circular or Dendera Zodiac from the roof of the Hathor Temple for transport to Paris. Bradish was consequently well versed in the excavations and archaeological intrigues of his time. He finally returned home to America in December 1825.<br><br>Thus Bradish was more conversant with contemporary American interests in the Middle East and with Egyptian archaeological excavations and the emerging field of biblical archaeology than any other contemporary American. Though not a linguist by training or profession, he knew firsthand of the rising interest in Egyptian hieroglyphics and antiquities. This fact coupled with the strong likelihood that Martin Harris and Luther Bradish were acquainted and that Bradish knew men in New York City renowned for their learning may explain why Harris visited Bradish in Albany before continuing on down the Hudson to NewYork City.<br><h2><b>"A Man to Be Obeyed": Dr. Charles Anthon</b></h2><br>Our second wise man of the east was the young and coming scholar of linguistics, thirty-one-year-old Professor Charles Anthon (1797–1867), who had become a professor of languages at Columbia in 1820. While he later achieved fame for his 1825 edition of Lempriere's<i>Classical Dictionary,</i>at the time of Harris's visit in 1828 Anthon was but an adjunct professor of Greek and Latin--more an accomplished grammarian than a prestigious scholar.<br><br>His first love was the classics, especially the works of Homer and Herodotus. While he had superb mastery of Greek, Latin, German, and French, there is little indication that he knew much about Egyptian, Hebrew, or any other Middle Eastern language. But because of his love of languages, he was probably aware of emerging research interests in Egyptian hieroglyphics and knew that Champollion had recently deciphered the ancient Egyptian writings on the Rosetta Stone.<br><br>By force of his own brusque personality, he laid claim to much greater knowledge in this area than he actually possessed. A bachelor, crotchety recluse, and strict disciplinarian with an iron constitution, Anthon rose early and retired late. A personal interview might elicit an unpleasant experience, as Anthon hated interruptions, whether from college administrators or lowly students. He shunned faculty parties and all forms of social life. His life was his books and the halls of academia. A man of decisive mannerisms, authoritarian bearing, ready wit, and "sometimes biting sarcasm," Anthon was clearly a "man to be obeyed."<sup>13</sup><br><h2><b>Samuel L. Mitchill: "A Chaos of Knowledge"</b></h2><br>The third man in our story was the leading natural scientist in America: Professor Samuel Latham Mitchill, formerly of Columbia College and, at the time of Harris's visit, vice president of Rutgers Medical College in New York City. A Quaker from birth who was "rather short and inclining to corpulency," full faced with a "large double chin and a pleasant open countenance," Mitchill in 1828 was sixty-four and nearing the end of an illustrious career. He was regarded by presidents and paupers, farmers and fishermen, as one of America's greatest minds and scholars, a man of the many and a friend of every class. He possessed a voracious curiosity and a "taste for . . . new discoveries."<sup>14</sup>Eager to learn from everyone, no matter what their station in life, he was as gracious as Anthon was abrupt.<br><br>Born in Long Island, New York, in 1764, Mitchill graduated in medicine from the University of Edinburgh in 1786. Upon returning to America, he joined the faculty of Columbia College (formerly King's College under the recently terminated British rule) as professor of chemistry, natural history, and agriculture. Here he taught for eleven years. In 1797 Mitchill launched America's first medical/scientific journal, the<i>Medical Repository,</i>and he remained its chief editor for eighteen years. He also founded and edited the<i>American Chemist</i>and was a pioneer in the study of hydrogen and evaporation.<br><br>In 1799 he married Catharine ("Kate") Ackerly; from their voluminous correspondence they enjoyed a most felicitous relationship. A popular public figure, Mitchill served as an assemblyman in the New York Legislature (1797–1800), then resigned from Columbia in 1801 to serve until 1805 in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was then elected U.S. senator, a post he held until 1809. He was an ardent supporter of Robert Fulton's efforts to build the first steamboat, which churned up the Hudson River in 1808, and was also an enthusiastic proponent of the Erie Canal, a major project of his friend Governor De Witt Clinton. As senator, Mitchill had supported President Jefferson's efforts to explore "certain remote and unknown parts of Louisiana" and worked hard to gain funding for the Louisiana Purchase.<sup>15</sup>Jefferson sent Mitchill and the American Philosophical Society several new specimens of flora and fauna forwarded to him by Lewis and Clark during their famous explorations westward.<br><br>A member of forty-nine different learned societies in eleven countries, he lectured widely and published papers on geography, earthquakes, hurricanes, hydrography, botany, and zoology. Author of several books and scores of articles on topics ranging from his groundbreaking study of the importance of sanitation in fighting pestilential disease to his massive report on the state's ichthyology and fish species,<sup>16</sup>by the time he died on September 7, 1831, he had earned the plaudits of the great and the small. Benjamin Moore called him "a chaos of knowledge."<sup>17</sup>He was known among his colleagues as "the Nestor of American science,"<sup>18</sup>also the "Stalking Library,"<sup>19</sup>and "the Delphic Oracle of New York."<sup>20</sup>And even President Thomas Jefferson referred to him as the "Congressional Dictionary."<sup>21</sup>At his burial in Greenwood Cemetery in New York City, the sexton described Mitchill with the following: "A great character. One who knew all things on earth, and in the waters of the great deep."<sup>22</sup><br><h2><b>"A Nation Now Extinct Which He Named"</b></h2><br>In addition, Mitchill possessed special interests and experiences that may have prompted Bradish and Anthon to send Harris to see him: his intimate knowledge of the American Indian and New York State's geology and mineralogy; a marked familiarity with western New York, including Ontario County, as well as with American antiquities; a knowledge of ancient languages and hieroglyphics; and finally, his genuine love of people.<br><br>His interest in America's native peoples grew directly out of his careful observations and prodigious knowledge as perhaps the leading mineralogist and geologist of his time. A frequent visitor to Niagara, Ontario, Genesee, Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga counties, he had found and catalogued a great many salt-based sea fossils from this region.<br><br>Mitchill's many expeditions significantly contributed to his massive collection or "museum" of geological specimens, which formed the basis of his "Mitchillian Cabinet" packed with fossils, rocks, skeletons, ancient artifacts, and specimens. His research interests had led him to discover several ancient Indian burial mounds and fortifications stretching across upstate New York from Sacketts Harbor to Boughton Hill in Ontario County and from Canandaigua to Onondaga. His lifelong friend and fervent admirer De Witt Clinton likewise came to consider such constructions to be of ancient origin, the places of great battles between ancient Indian tribes long before the arrival of the European races.<br><br>Trusted and highly respected, Mitchill had been adopted into the Mohawk fraternity, had learned their language, and had translated into English many of their Indian war songs. The Oneidas and the Onondagas had even bestowed personal names on him.<sup>23</sup>He sustained an abiding interest in Indian languages and later concluded that all tribal languages were derived from the same linguistic root. A longtime member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia; the Natural History Society of New York City; the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts; and many other contemporary centers of research; he shared his findings freely with contemporary colleagues and students of the American Indian at a time when much discussion focused on their origins and culture.<br><br>Stemming from his work with the Indian nations and from his years in the U.S. Senate as chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Mitchill had developed his own theory on the origin of the ancient American Indians. He had come to the conviction that "three races of Malays, Tartars, and Scandinavians, contribute to make up the American population."<sup>24</sup>Mitchill believed that the "Tartars" (as he called the originating stock) were primarily from northeastern Russia and China.<sup>25</sup><br><br>After visiting various caves in Kentucky and carefully examining mummies and bones found there and elsewhere, he originated the idea that another "more delicate race" had once co-inhabited ancient America. He believed that this delicate race, whom he termed "Australasians" or "Malays," had originated in the Polynesian Islands. Their physical size and physiognomy "all have a perfect resemblance" to those of "the Sandwich, the Caroline, and the Fegee [Fiji] Islands," he asserted.<sup>26</sup>These tribes of "the lower latitudes" had "greater proficients [<i>sic</i>] in the arts" than their northern enemies, "particularly of making cloths, clearing the ground, and erecting works of defence."<sup>27</sup>They began with<br><br><i>colonies of Australasians, or Malays,</i>[who]<i>landed in North America, and penetrated across the continent, to the region lying between the Great Lakes and the Gulph of Mexico. There they resided, and constructed the fortifications, mounds, and other ancient structures, which every person who beholds them admires.</i><br><br><i>What has become of them? They have probably been overcome by the more warlike and ferocious hordes that entered our hemisphere from the northeast of Asia. These Tartars of the higher latitudes have issued from the great hive of nations, and desolated, in the course of their migrations, the southern tribes of America, as they have done to those of Asia and Europe. The greater part of the present American natives are of the Tartar stock, the descendants of the hardy warriours who destroyed the weaker Malays that preceded them.</i><sup>28</sup><br><br>Mitchill had advanced his theory to the point that the Iroquois of New York were of "Tartar descent, who expelled or destroyed the former possessors of the fertile tracts reaching from Lake Ontario south westwardly to the River Ohio."<sup>29</sup><br><br>Stanley Kimball argued that Mitchill knew little or nothing about ancient languages or hieroglyphics and therefore could not have substantiated much of what Anthon was saying.<sup>30</sup>That description may not be entirely accurate. When Martin Harris brought the characters to Mitchill, it was not the first time that Mitchill had received or had been shown hieroglyphics and transcriptions from other languages. He had already received hand-drawn hieroglyphics with possible translations from various regions of the globe. And he had on hand writings that he could compare to the characters Harris showed him. For instance, he had studied many such "Indian hieroglyphics" from the Mohawk languages.<sup>31</sup>Furthermore, along with his ability to read and translate classical Greek and Latin, he had also studied Oriental tongues and Hebrew. As early as 1817 American explorers to the Middle East had been sending to him writings and hieroglyphics from ancient Babylonian tombs and temples for his review, if not verification.<br><br>There remain two other significant reasons why Mitchill showed such interest in his Palmyra visitor. The first was the simple matter of timing. Harris could not have caught the good professor at a more propitious moment. For the previous eight years Mitchill had been busily propounding and publishing one aspect or another of his "two-races" theory of ancient America.<sup>32</sup>His interest in the history of the ancient American Indians was at a peak when Harris arrived. The second was Mitchill's boundless curiosity, kindliness, and open and engaging personality. As important as anything the two men said to one another was the simple matter of personality, for Mitchill was a man who delighted in listening to, and learning from, all kinds of people. As one put it, he was "an interpreter to all their queries."<sup>33</sup>People from every walk or station of life felt comfortable talking with him about their discoveries and found in him a warm and receptive audience. Unlike Anthon, he was<br><br><i>never disconcerted by intruders, however ignorant, or idle, or indiscreet--and managed to send each away contented. . . . No man was ever more universally accessible than he--holding so high a place in society, yet he condescended to the lowest without ostentation--descending even to the capacity of a child, to instruct, to encourage the love of study, or to amuse.</i><sup>34</sup><br><br>Finally, there remains the intriguing possibility that historians for all these many years have viewed the whole story in reverse. In what might be the very first written record of Harris' visit--predating Joseph Smith's 1832 history, E. D. Howe's 1834 account, Lucy Mack Smith's 1844 story, and certainly B. H. Roberts's version in the<i>History of the Church--</i>the celebrated Scottish-born New York journalist James Gordon Bennett, then associate editor of the<i>Morning Courier and New York Enquirer,</i>wrote in 1831 that Harris carried the engravings from the plates to New York and<br><br><i>showed them to Professor Anthon who said that he did not know what language they were--told him to carry them to Dr. Mitchell</i>[sic].<i>Dr. Mitchell examined them--and compared them with other hieroglyphics--thought them very curious--and</i>[said]<i>they were the characters of a nation now extinct which he named--Harris returned to Anthon who put some questions to him and got angry with Harris.</i><sup>35</sup><br><br>This account is elaborated upon in James Gordon Bennett's article, published in September 1831:<br><br><i>They attempted to get the Book printed, but could not raise the means till Harris stept</i>[sic]<i>forward, and raised money on his farm for that purpose. Harris with several manuscripts in his pocket, went to the city of New York, and called upon one of the Professors of Columbia College for the purpose of shewing them to him. Harris says that the Professor thought them very curious, but admitted that he could not decypher them. Said he to Harris, "Mr. Harris you had better go to the celebrated Doct. Mitchell and shew them to him. He is very learned in these ancient languages, and I have no doubt will be able to give you some satisfaction." "Where does he live," asked Harris. He was told, and off he posted with the engravings from the Golden Plates to submit to Doc. Mitchell--Harris says that the Doctor received him very "purlitely," looked at his engravings--made a learned dissertation on them--compared them with the hieroglyphics discovered by Champollion in Egypt--and set them down as the language of a people formerly in existence in the East, but now no more.</i><sup>36</sup><br><br>Four elements in Bennett's account demand serious study. First, written in 1831, it is the earliest known record of Harris' visit to New York City. Second, Bennett states that Anthon "did not know what language they were." This we now understand is correct, since Anthon was a grammarian, a promising but youthful scholar who knew virtually nothing about Egyptian, reformed Egyptian, or whatever kind of writings or characters were on the "Anthon Transcript." Third, the statement that Mitchill "compared" the transcript that Harris brought him with "other hieroglyphics" conforms to what we now know of Mitchill. He not only had many such writings on hand in his cabinets of antiquities, but he had also translated ancient writings for others. Whether he tried to translate Harris' characters on the spot is not known, but he certainly seems to have studied them carefully enough to deliver a "learned dissertation" on them and to identify them as those of "a nation now extinct which he named." Finally, and almost certainly, he saw in these characters additional evidence for his own richly developed theories on the extinct "delicate" Australasian race that had been destroyed by the more ferocious Tartars somewhere in upstate New York not far from where Harris lived in Palmyra.<br><br>We may never know the full extent of the conversations Martin Harris had with Luther Bradish, Samuel Mitchill, or Charles Anthon that winter of 1828. While it is probably safe to say that the discussions between Harris and Anthon will ever prove more popular among Latter-day Saint readers as a fulfillment of prophecy, the fact remains that Harris found encouragement to pursue his sponsorship of the Book of Mormon not only from Anthon. It may well be that the secondary characters in this story--Luther Bradish and Samuel L. Mitchill--were far more important than we have previously supposed.<br><br><i>Richard E.

He therefore with his wife Drew of[f] the Caricters exactley like the ancient and sent Martin Harris to see if he Could git them Translated. He went to Albeny and to Philadelpha and to new york and he found men that Could Translate some of the Carictors in all those places. Mitchel [Samuel L. Mitchill] and Anthony [Charles Anthon] of New York ware the most Larded [learned] But there were some Caricters they could not well understand. Therefore Anthony told him that he thot if he had the original he culd translate it. And he rote a very good piece to Joseph and said if he would send the original he would translate it.

Mr Harris, seeing he was in a passion, he said, 'well I will go home and see, and if they can be had I will wright to you immeditely.' So he Came home and told how it was and they went to him no more. Then was fulfild the 29th Chapter of Isiah."

<h1> Spiritual Drift - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
In my lab on the ground floor of the Benson Building I have a marvelous piece of instrumentation called an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, or ICP-MS for short. Used properly, it is capable of telling me about the elemental composition of a sample, from the major constituents to the minutest traces of contamination. It is so sensitive that I could take any one of you into the lab, have you stir some clean water with your finger, and then detect traces of uranium that the water has washed from your finger. There is a catch, though. If I use the instrument without careful preparation, all it gives me is a series of meaningless numbers. I can't assign the numbers to any particular element, and I have no way of relating the number to the concentration of an element in the sample. To use the ICP-MS properly, I first have to calibrate it with appropriate standards. Because I already know what is in the standards and at what concentration, I can compare the numbers from my sample to those from the standards, and I can use that comparison to accurately characterize my sample. I can say with certainty what elements are present and how concentrated they are.<br><br>It would be nice if I could just calibrate the instrument once and be done with it, but life isn't that simple. The instrument tends to drift, so that yesterday's calibration is no longer good today. In fact, the most rigorous laboratory practices demand that I alternate standards and samples, in effect calibrating the instrument every few minutes. The process works best when the makeup of the standards is very similar to the makeup of my samples.<br><br>You can imagine that the quality of the standards I use is extremely important. If I use a standard that is of poor quality, or one that has in some way been contaminated, I will get bad results from my instrument. It isn't always easy to come up with good standards, yet they are essential for the smooth operation of our highly technological society. Good standards are so important that governments around the world have established laboratories whose primary mission is to create and distribute reliable standards. The laboratory in the United States is called the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. If I purchase a standard from NIST, I can use it with confidence to calibrate my instrument and to get good experimental results.<br><br>By now you are probably convinced that the absentminded professor picked up the wrong set of notes as he left his house this morning and that I'll be giving a devotional address to my analytical chemistry students tomorrow. There is, however, method to my madness. We make frequent reference to standards in the Church, and like the analytical chemist, we must choose our standards carefully. Instead of using them to measure concentrations, we use them to gauge our moral and spiritual progress. The choice of poor standards can lead, on one extreme, to smugness and spiritual complacency and, on the other, to feelings of worthlessness and depression. The use of defective standards can lead us to modes of behavior that may be perfectly acceptable to society in general but are inappropriate for members of the restored Church. Only by choosing the correct spiritual standards can we reach the divine potential that each of us possesses.<br><br>Let me begin by discussing some of the poor standards that we tend to adopt unless we make a conscious effort to avoid them. I think that one of the most insidious, yet most common, standards that we use is comparison with the lives of those around us. This corrupt standard expresses itself in a variety of ways. One is a kind of cutthroat competitiveness that surfaces often in our Latter-day Saint culture. We tend to confuse excellence with being better than the next guy.<br><br>A trivial example from my distant past may serve to illustrate the point. Based on this example, I will call this standard the "Lyle standard." When I was an undergraduate at BYU, I sat through two physical chemistry courses with a chemical engineering major named Lyle. We both did well in the courses and soon developed the habit of comparing scores after each exam. Before long, my measure of success was not how well I had mastered the material, but whether I had beaten Lyle out for the number one spot in the class. Lost in the competition was the fact that our instructor was giving us only superficial coverage of quantum chemistry. Lyle and I finished as the top students in the class, but neither of us understood quantum mechanics. I doubt the gaps in our training had much effect on Lyle. I don't think the Schrodinger equation figured much in his work as a practicing chemical engineer. For me it was a different matter. A graduate course in molecular spectroscopy painfully exposed gaps in my understanding that the Lyle standard had failed to reveal.<br><br>The problem with the Lyle standard isn't confined to academic pursuits. It surfaces in Sunday School lessons, particularly those that deal with topics with which we are a little uncomfortable. It is much easier to talk about the evils of the world around us than it is to humbly consider what we might be doing better to live more Christlike lives. A destructive byproduct of the use of others as standards is that it is easier to find a comparison that makes us feel good than it is to improve our own behavior. How many of us have felt a sense of pride and accomplishment as we have read the recent headlines stating that Utah is number one in the nation in volunteer service? Leading the nation in volunteerism isn't important. Giving generously of our time and resources is. Using national statistics as a measure of our commitment to service is like having worthiness interviews with questions such as "Is your attendance at sacrament meeting at least 10 percent above the stake average?"<br><br>President Ezra Taft Benson pointed out the pitfalls of the Lyle standard in his classic conference address on pride when he said:<br><br><i>The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, or any other worldly measuring device against others. In the words of C.S. Lewis: "Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. ... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition has gone, pride has gone."</i>(<i>Mere Christianity, New York: Macmillan, 1952, pp. 109–10.)</i>[Ezra Taft Benson, "Beware of Pride,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1989, 4]<br><br>In some, the comparison with neighbors and friends yields not a sense of moral superiority but an equally damaging sense of inadequacy. Again, a trivial example from my own experience illustrates the point. I enjoy cycling. Early this summer I was riding up the South Fork of Provo Canyon. It was a beautiful evening, the temperature was perfect, and a tailwind was gently helping me up the canyon at a pace that would be a personal best for me. I felt great. Then I heard the gentle clicking of another bicycle chain to my left. A young man rode past me, giving me the obligatory "How's it going?" which I interpreted as "Eat my dust." All too quickly he passed from sight up the road ahead of me. My euphoria vanished and my spirits sank. I thought, "I will never ride that fast."<br><br>What a shame that I let comparison to a completely inappropriate standard destroy the pleasure of the moment. My circumstances and native abilities, not to mention my age, were obviously completely different from those of the other cyclist. It's sometimes less obvious that each of us has different spiritual gifts and backgrounds. That unawareness of differences in circumstances or abilities leads to danger in the use of others as gauges of our spiritual progress. The same destructive feelings that ruined my bike ride are manifest in a much more serious way in the young mother who sinks into depression because her mothering skills don't seem to measure up to those of her supermom neighbor, or in the returned missionary whose mission experiences don't seem to compare to those of his friend who baptized dozens and was assistant to the president.<br><br>When I am feeling spiritually inadequate, Ifind comfort in the words of Moroni:<br><br><i>And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.</i>[Moroni 10:8]<br><br>Moroni then lists spiritual gifts in a way that makes clear that they are not all given to everyone and reemphasizes the point in a beautifully symmetric verse:<br><br><i>And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as he will.</i>[Moroni 10:17]<br><br>These verses remind me that the spiritual gifts that I have are unique to me, as are the challenges and opportunities on which I can bring them to bear. My accomplishments compared to those of others are not important. What is important is how I use the gifts God has given me to build His kingdom.<br><br>I need to draw an important distinction at this point between using others as measuring sticks for our own progress and turning to the examples that others set for inspiration. We can find motivation and inspiration in the accomplishments and gifts of others without making the kind of comparisons that lead to pride or depression. Good examples are not particularly rare, and they aren't confined to our LDS community. I have learned a lot about being a scientist and a Christian from a non-LDS friend whom I admire not only for his keen intellect and hard work but also for the generosity with which he shares his ideas and talents with students and colleagues. I learned about selflessness from the students in my BYU ward who never failed to show up for a moving party. I learn daily about love and compassion by watching my wife care for her elderly mother. You may learn about spirituality by watching a Church leader, about friendship from a roommate, about sacrifice from a parent, or about service by reading about the efforts of a total stranger to better lives in the third world.<br><br>The pitfalls of the Lyle standard don't lie in recognizing strengths or deficiencies in those around us, but in using those observations as measures of our own value.<br><br>In the quote I read from President Benson, he alludes to a second pervasive and defective standard that I will call the "Madison Avenue standard." Each year commercial interests spend billions of dollars to persuade us to buy goods and services, most of which we really don't need. The advertising contains a less-than-subtle subtext that tells you that your value as a person lies in what you own, spend, and consume.<br><br>Although there is no correlation between wealth and virtue, we are prone to judge ourselves and each other by the size of our incomes, the brand of our cars, the clothes we wear, or the size of our houses. I saw ample evidence of the destructive effects of the Madison Avenue standard during my service as bishop of a BYU married student ward. I spent many hours counseling with young couples that were burdened with excessive debt. In most cases the debt had been incurred for the purchase of nonessentials, like his and hers new cars, health club and cable TV contracts, high-end entertainment systems, and even the oversized chunk of carbon that had seemed so impressive on the bride-to-be's finger during the engagement. The couples' financial problems were often traceable back to their single days. The marriages had not been a joining of assets, but rather a merging of liabilities. The debt often had heart-wrenching consequences. Young mothers who wanted desperately to give full time to their children were forced to work at menial jobs to make ends meet. Educational goals were abandoned because husband or wife, or both, had to work full time to pay off the debts.<br><br>Our society's emphasis on material success is a constant force that, if not resisted, can distort priorities and cause permanent damage to ourselves and our families. Even in the friendly confines of BYU, I am faced with such questions as "Should I go in to work on Saturday to finish a paper or spend the time working on a project with my wife?" or "How can I take a family vacation and still be prepared for the classes that start in two weeks?" You will be asking yourselves similar difficult questions throughout your lives. If our standard of success is a strictly material one, chances are that we will come up with the wrong answers. I need frequent reminders of the Saviors words found in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i><br><br><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i><br><br><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i>[Matthew 6:19–21]<br><br>These simple verses help me remember that my real treasures are friendships, family, and opportunities to serve.<br><br>The last defective standard I'll discuss is what I will call the "Hollywood standard." This one is hard to pin down because it emerges from a culture that is largely without moral roots. It tends to be a standard of violence and profanity and promiscuity. While occasionally such a standard serves to warn us against its own evils, more often it attempts to attract us. When was the last time we saw a hero in an action movie turn the other cheek or complete a thought without using profanity, or a movie couple avoid extramarital sex because they considered intimacy and marriage sacred? If we immerse ourselves in such a culture, we can, without realizing it, set ourselves morally adrift.<br><br>I think that most of us, with a little introspection, could find the influence of the Hollywood standard in our behavior. We may see it in our response to a driver who cuts us off in traffic, in the language we use when we are hurt or surprised, or in the excuses we make for ourselves when watching questionable material in a movie or TV show. The Hollywood standard is guiding our behavior when we let the ever-shifting values of the motion picture, TV, or video game ratings decide for us what is appropriate to watch or consume, without any consideration of our own whether the material is appropriate.<br><br>As pervasive as these worldly standards are, we need never be far removed from the correct ones. Nephi, in discussing the baptism of Jesus, made it clear who our standard should be. Hesaid:<br><br><i>And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</i><br><br><i>And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and bebaptized in the name of my Beloved Son.</i><br><br><i>And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do.</i>[2 Nephi 31:9–12]<br><br>Few, if any, of us have had Nephi's privilege of seeing the Savior's life in a vision, but accounts of what He did and said are no further away than our scriptures. The scriptures, combined with the teachings of the modern prophets, are our most important standards.<br><br>Nephi's father, Lehi, was clearly aware of the need for written standards in protecting his family and his descendents from spiritual drift. I imagine that it was difficult for him to send his sons into danger to retrieve the brass plates, but he understood, as did Nephi, that the records would serve as critical guides for generations to come. Lehi's prophetic dream of the tree of life places added emphasis on the importance of God's word as a standard. We sing in a hymn about holding to the iron rod, but the verb used in the scripture is "clinging." The image of clinging to the iron rod implies constant reference to scripture and prophetic guidance. We are a lot like my analytical instrument in that we require frequent and regular reference to good quality standards to keep ourselves spiritually calibrated. It doesn't take years or generations for the effects of spiritual drift to appear. Our weekly sacrament meeting attendance, daily scripture reading, and personal prayer all serve as protection against short-term spiritual drift.<br><br>I'd like to push my analytical chemistry analogy a little further. I noted that the best standards for my instrument are those that are closely matched to the samples that are going to be analyzed. We too need standards that match the context of the challenges that we face. The experiences of the Israelites, of Alma, or even of the 19th-century Saints may seem remote to us, and the language of the scriptures is increasingly challenging to modern readers.<br><br>We can turn to two standards that are matched to our circumstances. The first is in the counsel that we receive every six months in our general conferences. I had an experience during the last October conference of a type that I'm sure many of you will relate to. There was a conference talk just for me. My wife, Elizabeth, had purchased a used horse trailer, and I inherited the task of adapting the wiring on the trailer and a new brake controller to the hitch on our truck. A series of mishaps turned what should have been a straightforward task into a long ordeal that included hours with me crammed awkwardly under the dashboard of our pickup. I had planned to finish the job in the two hours between the Saturday conference sessions, but it dragged on, and I worked steadily into the evening, listening to conference on the truck radio. Finally, it was time to go to the priesthood session. I cleaned myself up and left for our stake center in a black mood. I was mad at the previous owner of the trailer who had wired it incorrectly. I was mad at the manufacturer of the brake controller for specifying the wrong wire size. I was mad at Toyota for putting the wires in places that only a contortionist could reach. And, worst of all, I was mad at my wife for expecting me to be able to make the whole thing work. That evening President Monson gave a talk in the priesthood session that was directed right at me, a personal call to repentance. It was entitled "School Thy Feelings, O My Brother." He spoke of the destructive influence of anger. Chastened and repentant I returned home. Ihad come dangerously close to damaging my relationship with my wife over some uncooperative but inanimate strands of copper wire. President Monson's talk provided me with a timely and important recalibration of my response to frustration. With a better attitude Iwas able to step back and rethink my approach to the job, and I was able to finish it easily during the next week.<br><br>We all have access to a second standard that helps us recognize Christlike behavior in the immediate context of our lives today as opposed to the remote context of the scriptural world. Nephi, in the same discourse from which I just quoted, anticipated our need for help in applying the scriptures. He said:<br><br><i>Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.</i><br><br><i>For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.</i>[2Nephi 32:4–5]<br><br>In the course of a lifetime, each of us will face challenges and difficult questions for which there is no obvious scriptural precedent. They will be questions relating to our professions, our families, or our church service. We can take comfort in the knowledge that we are entitled to personal revelation through the gift of the Holy Ghost. As I reflect on the difficult decisions that I have faced, I am grateful for the assurance and guidance that I have received from this essential personal standard.<br><br>I think that for most of us the greatest challenge lies not in recognizing what or who our standard is, but in avoiding the influence of the worldly standards that intrude themselves upon us. We can't remove ourselves from the world, and, like my analytical instrument, we tend to drift. It is by frequent reference to the correct standard that Christ has provided us that we avoid such drift. In regular scripture reading we have constant reminders of Christ's teachings and example. In church attendance we have weekly recommitment to the Savior and association with others who share that commitment. In the conference addresses from the brethren we have timely warnings of the challenges that we will face and council on how to surmount them. Through daily prayer we remain susceptible to the guidance of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>The admonitions that we receive from our leaders to attend church, pray, read the scriptures, and remain worthy of the influence of the Holy Ghost can be viewed as reminders to regularly correct our courses by reference to divine standards. It is my prayer that we will do so, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Paul B.

<h1>d I: Getting Our Stories Straight - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Imagine a scene early in the Book of Mormon: Zoram is minding his own business in Laban's household one night, perhaps securing the records or telling stories with other servants. His master is out. Then he hears a voice calling, "Zoram, I need to take the plates to some elder brethren. I want you to follow me." He gets the plates and follows. He recognizes Laban's clothes. When Zoram arrives outside the city walls, he sees two other men, but they're young, not old. He senses something isn't as it should be. Suddenly, the man he's been following turns, grabs him forcefully, and says: "Hold still. If you do what I say, we'll spare your life. I swear that if you follow us you will have a place with us and be a free man like us. You need to understand that what we're doing has been commanded by God."<br><br>Zoram has to make a quick decision. To save himself from harm, he agrees. Not only that, he "did take courage" from Nephi's words. Zoram promised "he would go down into the wilderness" and "made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth." After this oath, Nephi says, "Our fears did cease concerning him" (1 Nephi 4:35, 37).<br><br>Remember that at this point Nephi can't tell Zoram where they are going for one simple reason: he doesn't know.<br><br>Will Zoram understand that he is the beneficiary of an extraordinary opportunity? Will he believe and be free even though he is being constrained to do so? Will he stay true to his oath, even though it was made under duress? Or will he bristle at being physically assaulted and forced to make a decision in unfair circumstances? Imagine the stories Zoram could tell his children and that later generations could tell each other.<br><br>Zoram could say:<br><br><i>At first I thought I was caught in a trap, but in the longer view, my presence was planned and prepared for. When Ishmael and his family arrived, I was the extra male needed to marry a daughter of Ishmael. Out of all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, I was given a chance to live with a prophet's family, marry as an equal, and inherit the promised land along with them and on equal terms, even though my status in Jerusalem society would probably never have afforded me the opportunity to associate with them. I witnessed miracles as God brought us from Jerusalem to a promised land. More to the point, I learned about the true God and my place before Him. We have been extraordinarily blessed. What I could see as a problem was actually the circumstance the Lord used to bless me and my posterity.</i><br><br>Or he could tell himself and his children:<br><br><i>I went along because I had to, but the truth is they kidnapped me and hijacked my life. I had to leave behind a good job and my beloved family. I was in line to move up socially and even become a scribe. I never saw my mother again. I was forced to make a promise against my will, and I'll never know what I gave up. Not only that, my trust was abused. Nephi led me away knowing that I thought he was Laban. Because he led me on in error, he was a liar, and that's not what prophets do. I have no further obligation to him or his offspring. He said we would be free like them, but I've always felt different.</i><br><br>As strange as it may seem, I assert that Zoram's story is like all of ours. He could see God's providence or man's manipulation. In conditions not of his choosing, he had to decide how to view himself and whether to nurse a justifiable grievance. He had to choose among the competing truths by which he could interpret his life. He had to decide whether to exercise faith and, in so doing, see his difficult, even unfair, circumstances as the very means by which God would bless him if he acted right. He had to decide whether to obey a commandment of God that at the time could be read as inappropriate and even unbelievable. His choice would influence his posterity far into the future. And he had to do all this without fully understanding the situation. That'slife.<br><br>I'm going to use Zoram as a launching pad to talk about the personal narratives we tell ourselves as we live our lives. These narratives have a powerful effect on us and, most likely, on others around us, including our own children. I will also talk of the narrative that God keeps wanting to tell us about who we are and what He wants us to be. But first a disclaimer: Personal narrative is not a gospel principle. You won't find it in the Topical Guide. But our stories are a real part of our lives, and they influence how we see ourselves in relation to the circumstances in which we find ourselves. If you don't believe this, just ask yourself how many people you know who choose wrong, lie,get angry, seek revenge, quit when the going gets tough, or play nasty emotional games without feeling justified? I am going to talk about personal narratives not as a principle of the gospel but as a means of seeing how gospel principles apply in the inner recesses of ourminds.<br><br>The Savior's parables give us a glimpse of the power of our narratives. Matthew states of Christ that on occasion "without a parable spake he not" (Matthew 13:34). When Jesus said that He taught in parables so that "seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand" (Luke 8:10), He knew how certain listeners would interpret His simple stories. To interpret a story is often to position ourselves in relation to it. Jesus' listeners did that, and so do we. We do this with stories we hear, and we do this with our own experiences. Think of the parables in relation to judgments we make: When we judge someone who has offended us or is in our debt, do we remember that we have received far more mercy than we want to extend? Do we receive God's love and life's bounty as a prodigal son who snatches it and runs or as the faithful son who begrudges the ring and robe given to the brother who returns after being beaten by life? And do we recognize the love in that father who ran to meet his wayward son? What kind of neighbor are we on our way up to Jerusalem to fulfill our priestly duties?<br><br>Christ's parables can trap us into seeing truths about ourselves we might not want to see. Our personal narratives--the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and why we act the way we do--can trap us in a different way. If we're not careful, they can keep us from seeing the truth.<br><br>We all, to some degree, have circumstances we can control and many we can't. We mold our character and our view of life around the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and how these circumstances affect us. Some of the things that are largely beyond our control are the family we are born into, which includes the traits of our parents and siblings; our gender; our body and stature; the place we are born and where we grow up (and by the way, it has been said that geography is destiny, especially on a world scale); the schools we attend and most of the teachers we have; and what people around us think and do. And there are many in-between areas in which some people have learned to shape and influence attributes that seem to others to be beyond control: Are we dumb or highly intelligent, shy or socially comfortable? Are we the one who doesn't fit in, while all those around us seem to belong? How do we help create the family we are born into? Do we really need other people around us who seem to know exactly what we are feeling and who respond according to<i>our</i>needs? Or do we whine when what we seem to get is a Nephi who grabs us and tells us how it's going to be? Are we jealous of those who seem to get more attention or love than we do? Do we watch others receive blessings that we pray for, while we wait, our prayers seemingly unanswered? In almost all these areas we actually have the ability to choose what we will experience and the direction we will go. To quote President Samuelson in a recent devotional talk, "You are really and quite completely in control of those things of ultimate importance" (Cecil O. Samuelson, "Your Future," BYU devotional, 8 September 2009).<br><br>Please understand that I don't in any way deny that individual people, groups, families, and whole nations have been cruelly victimized. Nor do I wish to minimize their suffering. Nor do I deny that sometimes we must do all we can to change our circumstances. Rather, I focus on things we can't change and those we can only change a little by how we interpret them. There is a huge difference in the way people respond to difficult situations, as we will now see by turning to different generations of Zoramites.<br><br>We know that Zoram married a daughter of Ishmael and that his descendants usually aligned themselves with the Nephites. Lehi blessed Zoram for being forever a true friend of Nephi. I like that. Zoram and Nephi became true friends. Lehi promised Zoram that his descendants would dwell in prosperity along with Nephi's and that nothing would harm them or disturb their thriving but their own iniquity (see 2 Nephi 1:30–32). We might ask how iniquity would enter among the Zoramites. Well, in addition to the temptations and choices every generation faces, they also had the old story that could be told in different ways.<br><br>For many generations the Zoramites seem to have told the right story. For about five hundred years after Lehi left Jerusalem we don't hear of the Zoramites--which is a good sign. They had blended and intermarried with the Nephites and migrated with them three times. Then things start to happen. The next Zoram we meet, in Alma 16, is the general who defeats the Lamanite army that destroyed the city of Ammonihah, a general who sought counsel from Alma and who named one of his own sons Lehi. Also among the descendants of Zoram are the traitors Amalickiah, who rebelled against Helaman and joined the Lamanites and then murdered and seduced his way to the Lamanite throne, and his brother Ammoron, who commanded the armies that fought General Moroni and made things far worse for the Nephites (see Alma 52–54). It's so much easier to betray your friends when you feel, "I never did really belong; I always felt different." We next meet the Zoramites when they lead astray the children of Lamanite converts in 3 Nephi 1:29. We can just picture this generation saying to the converts, "Hey, we've lived with the Nephites, so let us tell you a few things." In 4 Nephi, Zoramites are counted among the faithful Nephites when other peoples have apostatized generations after Christ's visit. As we can see, the Zoramites were torn from time to time between faithfulness and rebellion, and I suspect that their family narratives had a lot to do with their conduct.<br><br>At least we see this troubled narrative of the Zoramites in the middle chapters of Alma. One of the first things we learn about Zoramites in this generation is that they trampled Korihor to death (see Alma 30:59). What do we make of that? Then in Alma, chapters 30 and 31, we learn of a Zoram who led a group of dissenters (the same ones who trampled Korihor?) away from the Nephite communities and set up their own form of public worship. Listen to their prayer as written in Alma 31, keeping in mind what I've said about their tough choice of narrative:<br><br><i>Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.</i><br><br><i>But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, OGod, we thank thee. . . .</i><br><br><i>And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people. Amen.</i>[Alma 31:16–18]<br><br>Wouldn't you know it? The Zoramites of all people are the ones who pray openly about how chosen they are, while those around them are destined to feel God's wrath and be damned! It's as if the burden of interpretation, the press of how to square their growing feelings of separateness with their place among the Nephites and believers, led this Zoramite generation not to humility, gratitude, and obedience but to a twisted view of themselves. Once there, they also twisted God's doctrine to accommodate their feelings. There is a parable in that. The Zoramites made their need for separation into a matter of divine will, and in their hands the doctrines of holiness and election have become narrowly elitist and--note this--divorced from compliance. The Zoramites are chosen not because they have chosen obedience but because God likes them so much and expects merely that they acknowledge His favoritism--once a week.<br><br>The Zoramite experience should make us stop and ask how God figures in our own personal narratives. It's wonderful to feel chosen and special, but the story warns us against certain kinds of feeling chosen. When we feel selected and favored to a degree that we neglect obedience, humility, effort, hard work, unity, and preparation, thinking that no matter what we do, God will make things turn out well, we make God an accomplice of our foolishness. Does our God really play favorites? Or does He offer every person the same opportunity to grow and feel even more of His love if they exercise faith and keep the commandments?<br><br>To make the ironies more interesting, the Zoramites have also excluded the poor who helped build their synagogue. We don't know whether these poor, rejected ones are other Zoramites or Nephites who lived in the area before the Zoramites moved in, but I like to think that it's actually the latter. If I'm right, the Zoramites have now turned the tables on the descendants of Lehi, but instead of telling them, "Be free like unto us," they tell them, "You're different. Stay away. And by the way, you'll never be like us no matter how hard you try because God likes us better."<br><br>These poor rejects give Alma a golden opportunity to win them over if he'll just sympathize with them and denounce the injustice. Imagine how an unwise Alma could have responded. He could have called in a platoon of soldiers to restore order or mobilized a demonstration of poor outcasts. At the very least he might have validated their feelings. Just think of the long-term consequences of any of those actions. Think of how it would influence their personal narratives. Instead, Alma tells them, "It is well that ye are cast out" (Alma 32:12). Then he uses the occasion to offer them the one thing that would fundamentally change the way they saw themselves and their situation.<br><br>No, it's not a lesson on self-esteem. It's far more profound and truthful than that concept. He teaches them about faith. In a sense, he tells them, "If you want to change your situation, your story, yourself, shift your attention away from where it is now, and believe. Plant the seed of faith. You'll notice two things if youdo."<br><br>Listen to what he says of the seed of faith:<br><br><i>Behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</i>[Alma 32:28]<br><br>This experience further increases faith, which further blesses the believer. In verse 34 Alma continues:<br><br><i>Ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</i>[Alma 32:34]<br><br>I see two effects of growing the seed of faith. First, we find the truth. Faith will sprout and be delicious to our souls, and if we nourish it, it will further strengthen our belief in God, His Son, and His teachings. Second, it will change us. Is there anyone here who does not want an enlarged soul, an expanded mind, and an enlightened understanding? Alma promises that these come not from clinging to personal narratives that make us feel different or rejected or even elect, but from cultivating the seed of faith. To cultivate faith is to receive the healing influence of the Spirit. Alma makes reference to this healing power in the next chapter (see Alma 33:20–21). It's clear from Alma's message that we are to exercise faith. We are to do this in circumstances that seem to afflict us and that we cannot easily change. In those circumstances,<i>we</i>can be changed.<br><br>Alma teaches that as our faith grows it can lead to a perfect knowledge. That is so, but what interests me more in relation to changing ourselves is two additional points. First, although we can attain certain kinds of perfect knowledge, we need that feeling of growing faith, enlarged soul, and enlightened understanding many times. I doubt if we can ever be done with that. Second, I read into Alma's account the implication that faith can help us in ways we may not perceive or understand. In that sense our narratives become stories of faith of which we don't know the outcome any more than Zoram knew where Nephi was taking him. To nurture faith is to turn ourselves over to God and to experience His healing, even though we may not fully understand precisely what our problems are.<br><br>As taught by Alma, one of the great lessons of faith is that it can happen to you. Yes, you may feel vulnerable as you plant the seed, or in other words, as you believe in Christ and His gospel. But I see a promise there, that if you do plant it and nourish it, it will begin to be delicious to you. What greater evidence can we have that God loves us equally--all of us, including each of you sitting here in the auditorium or reading this talk?<br><br>This is also the message of the great discourse on faith in Hebrews. We often dwell on the definition given in the first verse of chapter 11, but I prefer the definition and promise implicit in verse 6: "But without faith it is impossible to please him [God]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." God rewards anyone's faith. Hebrews also confirms what many believers have felt, that faith in God brings to us a feeling of being "strangers and pilgrims on the earth" (11:13). In connection with our personal narratives, we note that a certain kind of feeling different goes with the commitment to believe in God and His Son and follow their commandments. Listen as the passage continues, building on the sense of being "strangers and pilgrims":<br><br><i>For they that say such things declare plainly thatthey seek a country.</i><br><br><i>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</i><br><br><i>But now they desire a better country, that is, anheavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</i>[Hebrews 11:14–16]<br><br>If we overlay this on the story of Zoram, we will see an application. Zoram had to leave a country and become a pilgrim in literal and figurative senses. In choosing an unknown destination and trusting in Nephi's teachings, he pleased God, the same God who was, I dare say, ashamed of those of Zoram's descendants who wanted a country of their own making<br><br>I would now like to tell you some dramatic stories from my own life, but my experiences tend to be subtle. And I think you'll understand when you hear that the principles I've been talking about are often higher than my ability to master them. I have dozens of narratives I can bring to mind, depending on how difficult my challenges are. One of them goes, "I am but one. I cannot blame everyone, but I can blame someone." Seriously, one lesson I've learned is that however difficult some of my challenges have been, my troubles have been far worse when they've resulted from my own bad choices. Once I get past my impulse to blame someone else, I find I'm on the path to clarity (enlightened understanding) and healing, and I am more able to experience the change that comes by faith.<br><br>One of my great blessings is to live surrounded by people who have in difficult situations held fast to their faith and shown largeness of soul. I am referring to my wife, our parents, our children and their spouses, siblings, extended family, friends, and colleagues. I can tell you of my children, uprooted from one place amid difficult family circumstances and thrust into new schools, who drifted at first toward the easy crowd who seemed to accept them, until they recognized that that crowd was taking them places they didn't want to go, and they had the courage to seek out new friends. That took an ability to see the end of a story from the middle and to change direction.<br><br>I can tell you of the time I first attended church in a new ward as an older single adult--that is, without family around me to help buffer me and to help me fit in. I felt so out of place, so alienated, so unnecessary. I almost felt that attending church was too much to ask. As I sat there, I was blessed with this thought and just enough courage to do it: Get up and bear your testimony. I did, beginning this way: "You'll probably wonder who this man over here is, so let me tell you a little about myself." That changed everything, because it changed how I placed myself in relation to the rest of the ward, who, after all, came to church that day not to make me feel conspicuous but to worship and go away greatly instructed. Perhaps my testimony touched someone that day, maybe not. I know it affected me.<br><br>I can tell you about setting goals and accepting assignments in spite of a gripping fear that I couldn't really succeed, and of directing my fears to just sit over there for a moment while Iquietly went to work. When I looked back, fear had slipped out.<br><br>With sadness I can tell you about young people I know who seem to be telling themselves, in the words of a song, I "never fool myself that my dreams will come true. . . . Anyone can hurt me, and they do" (Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, "Another Suitcase in Another Hall," from the musical<i>Evita,</i>1976). This kind of story can appeal to us because it makes us not really responsible for what happens in our lives. By direct contrast, I can tell you about a ward member who grew up in a home where she didn't feel safe and battled feelings of depression and worthlessness. When she received her patriarchal blessing, she asked herself, "Who is this person being talked about here? It isn't me." But over the years she has consulted that blessing to remind herself how Heavenly Father sees her. As her faith grew, she came to believe the promises in her blessing. Or I can talk about a recently released bishop who told his ward, "I'm just one of the weak things the Lord talks about, and any good I've done has been His doing."<br><br>As a literary critic, I can't help but pause a moment on the concept of story. It turns out that stories are among the most common, natural ways we have of making sense of things, yet stories prove to have something fairly arbitrary about them. A sense of story requires us to put starts and stops in our narrative. However, many experiences lack definite starting and ending points because our experience is a continuum that takes different shapes as we interpret it. Additionally, in order to be organized and coherent, stories need focalization; they need to be about someone or from someone's point of view. Yet we know that almost all stories have other people and other points of view within them. Some writers have made a name telling old stories from new points of view--perhaps from those of minor characters. We can learn at least two things from these facts. First, we actually can have a measure of control over our stories, and second, we have a lot to learn from other people's narratives, which matter to them just as much as ours do to us. Literature is partly about competing narratives, and anyone who adopts a story as their paradigm for reality probably needs to read a lot more.<br><br>Because every situation we are in will offer us different versions of itself, we need to pay special attention to the story God seems to keep telling us about who we are. It's a two-fold story, at least, and it may seem contradictory, but the contradiction contains more truth than either part separately.<br><br>One story God keeps conveying to us about ourselves is highly positive and assuring:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br> 	<li>You are my son or daughter already. I love you, I know you, and I will help you to become my heir.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>The power is within you to do much good, and you should not need to be commanded in all things (D&amp;amp;C 58:26–28).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Every soul, including yours, is precious in the sight of God (D&amp;amp;C 18:10, 15). In fact, you are the purpose behind the immense and beautiful creation in which you live. Nothing in it surpasses you in importance or majesty.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>If you have desires to serve God, ye are called to the work (D&amp;amp;C 4:3).</li><br></ul><br>On the other hand, the Lord keeps telling us:<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ul><br> 	<li>We are less than the dust of the earth (Helaman 12:7).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Man is nothing (Mosiah 4:5, 11; Moses 1:10). In fact, "how great is the nothingness of the children of men" (Helaman 12:7).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We are unworthy. "Acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times" (Alma 38:14).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>We need to repent, right now.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Those called of God in this dispensation are among the weak things of the earth (D&amp;amp;C 1:19).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Left to our natural impulses, we are enemies to God (Mosiah 3:19).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Our wisdom is foolishness before Him (2Nephi 9:28).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>Wisdom equals keeping the commandments (Alma 37:35).</li><br></ul><br>In the space between the two stories that God tells us about ourselves, our faith can operate in relation to<i>both</i>messages, a greater freedom is born, and opportunities can be seen more perceptively. In the tension we experience between the two tales, we recognize that there are many things beyond our control. We recognize that we are not wholly of our own making, but that our character--our souls--are in our own keeping; that the power is within us to do much good, but that we can do little of lasting spiritual worth on our own; that if we make the one crucial choice that leads to all others, if we choose to submit to God and be patient, easily entreated, quick to do good, and willing to bear others' burdens, God can, through us, accomplish His purposes.<br><br>Among the heroes of the Book of Mormon from whom we learn, I suggest we consider Zoram. Perhaps there are people here who can relate to his story. He was, after all, needed on that expedition. Although he had to endure a little rough handling, the trap he was caught in was the very situation through which God had determined to bless him. Though he had to give up his homeland, God was preparing a better one. His choice of how to interpret the events that happened to him would not only influence what he would become--a true friend of Nephi forever--but would influence his children and many generations to come.<br><br>I bear testimony that faith in Jesus Christ has the power to help us get our stories straight, and I pray that, like Zoram, we will see that our life's circumstances are often the very conditions in which God has chosen to bless us as He helps us work out our lives, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>David B.

<br>
If there is one thing that distinguishes the university from other institutions of learning, it is the expectation to advance knowledge. The mission of most educational institutions is to pass on what is already known. Our high school teachers distilled their lessons from books that had already been written. At the university we engage in this dissemination too, but we have the further obligation to add to the bank of human knowledge by asking new questions or using new sources and methods to find better answers to old questions. Increasingly, through programs such as mentored learning, rather than just giving students the answers to the questions that have already been asked, we are inviting you to join us in the asking of the questions. We want you to experience the university as a place to actively pursue knowledge rather than only passively acquire it.<br><br>Justly or not, we often credit the Greeks for this inquisitive approach to the world. They did invent<i>historia,</i>a word that for them had a more encompassing meaning than the word<i>history</i>has for us today. For the Greeks, history meant knowledge, but only of a particular kind: history was any knowledge that had been acquired through inquiry, by asking questions. This was a significant development that made the Greeks among the most learned of cultures in multiple fields. When Herodotus, who we like to call the first historian, wrote<i>The Histories,</i>also called<i>The Inquiries,</i>of the origins of the Greco-Persian wars and of the cultures of the Near East, he did so based not on hearsay, rumor, and prejudice, which had been the common practice, but by asking lots of questions and engaging in extensive travel in the places he wrote about. He did not always get the facts right, but what is important is that he made every effort--by careful and persistent questioning--to get them right.<br><br>Today I'd like to address the value and practice of learning, particularly learning by asking questions. Of all the lessons Christ taught in the Sermon on the Mount, the counsel "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find"<sup>1</sup>is among the most cited in later scripture. What is the import of that exhortation for those of us who should be engaged in the pursuit of secular knowledge, eternal truths, and personal virtues?<br><br>Most of what you and I know we picked up passively: in conversations overheard, from unsolicited lectures from our parents, from TV productions, and in casual reading. In other words, most of what I know came to me without my seeking it, without my asking questions that led to new knowledge, and hence that knowledge doesn't qualify as "history" by the Greek definition. There is nothing at all wrong with passive learning; it will forever be an essential means of both cultural and academic transmission. As a professional student, I have sat through what must be hundreds of hours of lectures, and I have learned a great deal. As a member of the Church, I've sat through yet many more hours of meetings filled with lessons, talks, and testimonies. The lecture remains one of the most efficient methods of teaching that by itself can inform, entertain, inspire, and convert. Herodotus'<i>Inquiries</i>were first published in lectures; general conference is a weekend marathon of lecturing; and Christ lectured frequently, including at the Sermon on the Mount. However, while showing up is essential (it was Paul after all who said that "faith cometh by hearing"<sup>2</sup>), it is probably insufficient if we are to fully keep the commandment we have been given to seek learning--whether by study or by faith.<sup>3</sup><br><br>The Lord has given us a heavy homework assignment for this life, one so large as to seem overwhelming. We have been instructed to learn<br><br><i>of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>And also we are<br><br><i>to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Brigham Young, who was largely self-schooled, taught repeatedly that "the object of existence is to learn."<sup>6</sup>Elsewhere President Young described converted Church members as having a fervor for learning. He wrote that "the religion embraced by the Latter-day Saints, if only slightly understood, prompts them to search diligently after knowledge. There is no other people in existence more eager to see, hear, learn, and understand truth."<sup>7</sup><br><br>How eager are we to actively seek knowledge? Curiosity should be a palpable trait in the children of an all-knowing Father. In our efforts to become like Him, we must advance in knowledge; as Elder Jeffrey R. Holland put it when he was president of this university: "God's glory is his intelligence, and . . . it is to be our glory as well."<sup>8</sup>If God knows all things and we are to be like Him, learning is not just a recommendation but also an essential trait of those who seek eternal life.<br><br>I find, however, that we often resist knowledge. Part of it is simple indolence. Learning is hard work that requires substantial effort and time that I am sometimes reluctant to invest. And if your mind tends toward wandering, like mine, even listening passively can be something of a challenge. The challenge increases if we invite distractions. A few years ago I sat in the back of one of our classrooms and was surprised by the number of students fully engaged with their glowing laptops in e-mail, Facebook, solitaire, and shopping--what we might call a passive resistance to passive learning. If passive learning takes effort and attention, active learning, where we ask questions of our own creation and pursue answers with our own research, imposes far greater demands on our powers of concentration.<br><br>We may also resist knowledge because, out of hand, we judge it to be of little value or even dismiss it as erroneous. All knowledge is not of equal value to us, but much of what we can learn has great value, and it is not in our best interest to summarily dismiss the chance of learning something new. God knows all things, both true and false. He knows all the philosophies of men in addition to the truths of the eternities. Be open-minded. It is good that a biology major knows some history and that a history major knows some botany. It is good that an accountant knows how to cook and that a cook knows how to keep accounts. This is why general education is such an important component of this university. To know something of chemistry, economics, history, languages, literature, and physics is to gain in intelligence and become more like our Father, and this knowledge will boost our abilities to serve our families and build the kingdom.<br><br>I strongly agree that there are no stupid questions; but there are some sterile questions. One of the least fruitful is "Is this going to be on the test?" because it is usually asked to limit the bounds of our responsibility toward knowledge. It serves the same purpose as the question "Who is my neighbor?" The lawyer who directed that question to Jesus sought to limit the boundaries of those he would love. Christ's response was a startling parable, the Good Samaritan, followed by an unexpected question. The question Jesus put to the lawyer wasn't "Who is your neighbor?" but "Who was neighbor to this man?" that is, to the man bleeding on the side of the road. The question was an instructive turn of the tables that showed that the term<i>neighbor</i>was not at all a definition of others, as the lawyer had desired, but a definition of ourselves. The question we should ask is not "Who is my neighbor?" but "Am I a neighbor?" It is a question of identity, not categorization. When we try to limit the bounds of our knowledge with questions like "Is this going to be on the test?" we might contemplate the question "Who knows all things?" If God knows all things, and we are to be like Him, we should make an effort to embrace useful knowledge rather than look for reasons to pass itby.<br><br>When I was an undergraduate, there were a number of classes I refused to take, and there were a few I did take in which my heart waxed hard or my ears grew dull of hearing. I deemed the content of those classes boring, useless, or trivial. I look back on them as lost opportunities. Fortunately, there were many other courses in which I did see value and from which I did benefit. One of the first classes I took out of high school, at a local community college, was an introduction to anthropology. We read book after book on exotic cultures that did appalling things from the point of view of a little-traveled freshman. The professor taught me that it was more important to understand than it was to judge, because fair judgment could only come from understanding. Soon thereafter, I was sent on a mission to an exotic place and was a better prepared representative of the gospel for having taken the course. My first semester at BYU, I took Biology 100. Iwas fascinated by the recent research our professors shared on human genetics. We were, in essence, examining the blueprints of the human body, an eternal entity made expressly in God's image. My second semester I took a course in astronomy. At times during the course, I got a narrow glimpse of worlds created without end, of the incomprehensible scale of God's glory, and of my own nothingness. I took a course in family history that taught me something about who I was and where I came from. The knowledge I gained turned my heart to fathers and mothers I had never met but to whom I owed much. These subjects changed me.<br><br>Increasing our vocabularies is one area in which we should take greater interest. All knowledge, as far as I know, is conveyed by the medium of language, and our mastery of a language's components, its words, will decide to a great extent what we can understand and what we can teach. There may be no greater barrier to learning than a small vocabulary. There are about 50,000 word families in the English language. Five-year-old children can have vocabularies of about 5,000 words, which is pretty good, as this accounts for 90 percent of all spoken words, although a much smaller fraction of the written word. Students of foreign languages, even after six years of instruction, average vocabularies of less than 3,500 words, suggesting the difficulty of all language acquisition. As children in school we can learn thousands of new words each year, as many as eight per day, and by the time we graduate from college we may know some 20,000 words. Most of us, however, plateau at that point, largely because we stop reading, and we could learn a lot more at every stage of our lives if we inquired about the unfamiliar words we read and hear each day. Write them down, look them up, raise your hand. Asking "What does that word mean?" raises a fertile question indeed. Every word you learn can open up a new little world. You may begin to see that word everywhere, even though previously you had never noticed it, and someday it will roll glibly off your tongue or purposefully off your pen, thus making the full transition from passive incomprehension to deliberate deployment.<br><br>The beauty of knowledge is that understanding brings joy, appreciation, power, and even comfort. Simply learning a little history at home or abroad will peel back the layers of our unawareness, change the way we see the world and others, and heighten our ability to enjoy them. I can think of many personal examples, but I'll share a recent one. One student in my environmental history course wrote an enlightening paper on the history of human burial in the United States. She addressed the following questions: "How have Americans buried their dead?" "How has that changed?" and "What role has the environmental movement played in recent burial alternatives?" Embalming became a common practice as a result of the Civil War, and by the early 20th century, undertakers marketed numerous services to grieving families. She found one advertisement from 1920 that offered, for $1, to compose the deceased's facial features, which probably meant to seal the eyes and mouth closed; for $2 the undertaker would give the face a look of quiet resignation; and for $5 he could give the countenance "the appearance of Christian hope and contentment."<sup>9</sup>The paper opened my eyes, sparked my curiosity, and I did some further reading based on her bibliography. Death is something we will all face, and we will probably face it many times in our lives as loved ones pass on. How we care for our dead is a question worth asking. I have found the funerals of some loved ones more alienating than soothing, and learning of the history of burial answered in part why that is the case, at least for me. Just a little knowledge has been a great comfort, and it has also changed the way I look at even the landscapes around me, something Iwould not have predicted.<br><br>Seeking knowledge also can be an effective antidote to worldliness. We invest a great deal in the acquisition of stuff. Companies bombard us with slick, relentless propaganda as to why we must have their stuff, and we judge an individual's success by their stuff's sheer quantity and supposed quality. I like stuff--I especially like the word<i>stuff.</i>But consumption never was creativity. It brings few lasting satisfactions and can bring burdensome debts. Stuff beyond our basic needs does not liberate. Consider the overall investment of your time. You have to shop for stuff. You have to clean, maintain, and organize stuff. You lose stuff. You look for stuff. You polish stuff, secure it against theft, trip over it, recharge it, upgrade it, accessorize it, pack it, move it, unpack it, insure it, fix it, and eventually sell, trash, or bequeath it. Stuff has no use beyond this life, and it takes a lot fromus.<br><br>Very much unlike stuff, knowledge has few such liabilities. Knowledge does not depreciate but grows deeper, stronger, and more valuable with each use. Unlike stuff, knowledge has neither mass nor volume and does not take up any space outside the bounds of our cranium. Unlike in the accumulation of stuff, in getting knowledge you will never have to build a three-car garage on the side of your head. Your mind has no upper limit of mega-, giga-, or terabytes. Some estimate that the Internet, the space that increasingly serves as my mental three-car garage, has a total size of 5 billion gigabytes, but even this amounts to a fraction of what our minds are capable. Also unlike stuff, knowledge can be given to others without diminishing our stock. In fact, sharing knowledge tends to better burnish it in the giver's mind.<br><br>Best of all, knowledge you can take with you. What you learn, unlike what you buy, will pass with you from this life to the next. You cannot take your advanced degrees, professional awards, job titles, or even your Boy Scout merit badges, but you will take everything you've learned in acquiring them. Of course, in this life, as Alfred North Whitehead wrote, "Knowledge does not keep any better than fish."<sup>10</sup>We forget so readily. I am sometimes discouraged by my feeble memory. Why read that book when I'm going to forget 95 percent of the content within the year, which will probably include the author's name and the book's title? When I was a student I wondered why I should memorize Latin conjugations when they would slip away soon after the final exam, if not just before it. However, we should not despair because our mortal bodies are imperfect. I believe we will take all our knowledge with us when we go to the other side, even that which we've lost due to the limits of mortal faculties and the aging process. Whatever function our brains provide, the knowledge we acquire in this life will go with our spirits and eventually be reunited with our immortal bodies. At judgment day we are told we will have a perfect recollection of all we did, good or ill.<sup>11</sup>We probably retain more than we think. Much of what we forget can come rushing back when circumstances call on it. The Holy Ghost has the power to bring all things to our remembrance despite our mortal, cerebral imperfections.<sup>12</sup>But we can't remember what we didn't take the time to learn in the first place. Every forgetting has the possibility of remembering. Ignorance, on the other hand, has unlimited impossibilities. And not only can we take what we've learned with us, we have been promised that it will advantage us in the next life.<sup>13</sup>That makes knowledge a pretty good long-term investment in contrast to the time we devote to consumer goods. Is it a wonder a wise man once said, "How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding . . . than silver!"?<sup>14</sup>Seeking knowledge is a distinct way of laying up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<br><br>One of the central skills university students should acquire is the ability to ask useful questions to seek new knowledge, and in my experience that seems to be one of the most difficult aptitudes to develop in my students. Iwas certainly deficient in that skill when I was a student. Each field across the breadth of the arts, sciences, and administration goes about asking questions and advancing knowledge in different ways, but there are many parallels. On the first day of my first graduate history seminar, my advisor handed each of us a pile of primary source documents, all Jesuit letters written in 16th-century Portuguese, and said, "Come back in two weeks with an original paper based only on these sources." My selection was a long treatise on Brazil's tropical animals, most of them biting, venomous, and dangerous. I enjoyed it immensely. I was proud I could read it at all, considering the document's age and difficult handwriting. I read it twice, I read it three times, but I still didn't know what to do with it. I brought my creative block to my advisor, and he gave me the kind look that said, "You are probably not going to make it here, young man." He suggested a simple question: "What are this Jesuit's attitudes toward nature?" Lights went on, bells rang. In part, I already knew the answer. But with that question in mind, I read it again and saw so much more than I could in the previous readings. I could not see what I was not looking for. I did not receive knowledge, because I had not asked. But then, in relatively short order, I wrote a lovely little paper. My advisor liked it, but both he and I knew that paper was not mine. The research was mine and the writing was mine, but the conception was his, and in academia, creativity is the essential aptitude. I made it through graduate school because I learned to ask my own questions. I have gotten better at it over the years, but it is still the hardest thing I do in my research.<br><br>Learning to ask questions in the academic setting of the university is a useful skill, but one cannot acquire it in passive effort. Your success in a career, a business, and even the home will be shaped as much by the knowledge you can create as by the knowledge you have already acquired. Knowledge and experience are to be enhanced by the rarer traits of creativity and inquiry. Ultimately, a university education should teach you how to ask, think, and gain new knowledge. One should be able to look at a problem, a spreadsheet, a business plan, a blueprint, or a medical condition and, with effort, see things not at all obvious to the passive observer. Again, what should make you unique as a university graduate is not just what you know but what you will know.<br><br>I believe it is similar in the gospel. There are questions, what we might call saving questions, that we all must ask, and only we can ask them. Church leaders, scriptures, good books, and good friends might help point us in the right direction, but we must seek the essential truths of the gospel on our own initiative. Elder David A. Bednar notes that this kind of learning, by faith,<br><br><i>requires spiritual, mental, and physical exertion and not just passive reception. . . .</i><br><br>. . . [It]<i>reaches far beyond mere cognitive comprehension and the retaining and recalling of information. . . . Learning by faith cannot be transferred from an instructor to a student through a lecture, a demonstration, or</i>[even]<i>an experiential exercise; rather, a student must exercise faith and act in order to obtain the knowledge for himself orherself.</i><sup>15</sup><br><br>Of course, you do not need a university education to engage in this kind of learning, but learning by study and by faith are in the same spirit. Hence, it is important to learn how to ask questions because there is knowledge, saving knowledge, that you cannot find but byasking.<br><br>What are these questions of faith and salvation? Some of them are epistemological, that is, they seek to know what is true and lead inevitably, if asked sincerely, to the gift of a testimony. The questions of testimony we must ask are: Is there a God? Where do I find salvation? Is Christ my Savior? Is the Book of Mormon true? Did Joseph Smith restore Christ's church and priesthood?<br><br>There is another set of questions that are ontological, that is, that seek to answer questions of identity and being. Some questions of identity are: Who am I? Am I good? Am I right before the Lord? Who should I become, and how do I get there? Am I forgiven of my sins? These two lines of questioning Elder Holland has reduced to the pursuit of truth and the pursuit of virtue, and both of these lines of questioning are of great importance to our salvation.<sup>16</sup><br><br>Joseph Smith, who is among the greatest of inquisitors, serves as a wonderful model for us. He received revelation upon revelation, not as bolts out of the blue while he was minding his own business, but because he asked God question upon question. So much of the Restoration was based upon questions Joseph asked. When Joseph set off for the Sacred Grove, he had these two questions in mind, one seeking truth and one seeking virtue. We tend to emphasize the former, because the answer to his question about which church was true, about where he could find salvation, has universal application. But Joseph had another question, which he emphasized in his 1832 account, which was whether or not he could be forgiven of his sins. Joseph sought not only to be right but also to be righteous. When Joseph received his first visit from Moroni, it was also in answer to a prayer for forgiveness, "that I might know my state and standing before [God.]"<sup>17</sup><br><br>So in addition to going to God with questions whose answers will bless us with atestimony, we need to consistently ask questions that will develop our virtue and inform us of our moral identity. An essential element of this earthly life is to discover who you truly are, your divine self. That should be an exciting process, the ultimate novel in which each day of life another page is turned and every ending is a cliff-hanger. Too many are under the mistaken impression that as we become good we become boring, that heaven will be full of people who all think and dress and act exactly alike. Even Tolstoy in the first line of<i>Anna Karenina</i>writes, "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way," as if there were diversity only in misery. I couldn't disagree more. In my experience it is the unhappy that are all the same. They are sullen, bitter, argumentative, and disheartened, all of which can make for great drama, but most of which work to effectively smother any discernible personality trait under dark moods. Happy people, on the other hand, tend to become distinct individuals, unique maybe in all the eternities. The miserable people I know are all the same, regardless of cause. The good people I know well, many of them my students who are apparently well along in the process of becoming who they truly are, stand out to me distinctly, and it is a pleasure to know them, to see their divine self peeking through. This is an exciting process you work out between yourself and Heavenly Father, daily, in prayer and repentance. Ask: "Who am I, really?" and "How do I get there?"<br><br>In all your asking, come to the Lord with humility and sincerity. These two things are key to learning both secular and spiritual knowledge. At the outset of an academic study or at the beginning of a prayer, we should be able to sincerely say three hard words:<i>"I don't know."</i>And we must be prepared for unexpected answers, not simply look to confirm what we think we already know about the world or what we want to believe about ourselves. The rich young man who came running to Christ, to ask on his knees what he needed to do to have eternal life, may have been neither humble nor sincere. He may have only wanted to justify himself, to declare, like the Zoramites, how much better he was than average already. Jesus loved him anyway and gave him a direct answer. But it was not the answer the young man expected or wanted. It was a lost opportunity--to arrive at the door, to knock, and to be welcomed inside, to "come and follow me," only to turn away because the answer is not what we were looking for.<br><br>The divine attributes we are trying to acquire in this life are as much about knowing as they are about doing. Becoming new creatures requires knowing new things. Truth and virtue, of course, are related. As we strive to keep commandments, we come to understand better why we keep them, not just in an academic sense, but in our very hearts and beings. This is important knowledge. In an 1852 epistle, the First Presidency wrote:<br><br><i>That man who does the best he knows how to-day, should so continue to live in the exercise of faith and intelligence . . . so as to be better and more useful to-morrow. . . . Strive to know what God knows, and use that knowledge as God uses it, and then you will be like him; will see as you are seen, and know as you are known; and have charity, love one another, and do each other good continually.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>In other words, charity, something Moroni specifically instructs us to ask for, is to know our brothers and sisters in the same way Christ knows them--precious knowledge indeed.<br><br>When our faith leads to repentance, God will give us understanding line upon line, precept upon precept, and to those who receive, He gives more.<sup>19</sup>Thus it is that we grow from grace to grace. Knowing is becoming.<br><br>There is so much to learn. So be curious. Keep your sense of wonder about the world. Learn the names of the trees, flowers, and birds around you. Adam made the effort to name them; take the time to learn them. Show up for class--and ask questions. Can I just insert that nothing saves the professor struggling in front of a class better than a student with a sincere, thoughtful question. Show up for personal prayer--and ask questions. Read a good newspaper regularly. Save a little money by buying less stuff so you can travel a bit. Keep a good book or two on your nightstandand in your carry-on luggage. Be curious, like Joseph Smith, about your own salvation. Ask for forgiveness, the sweetest knowledge we can find. Inquire, as did Enos, after the salvation of others. We have been given a great promise over and over again. Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Shawn W.

<h1>or Optimism - August 2010 Graduates - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Graduates, families, faculty, brothers, sisters, and friends: It is a signal privilege to welcome each of you to Brigham Young University's commencement exercises. We are gathered to celebrate, to honor you, and to reflect on what has been accomplished and what is yet facing each of you as your circumstances change and your lives encounter needed adjustment. We, of course, sincerely congratulate all who have achieved so much, often with distinction and frequently with challenges more significant than anticipated at the outset. In doing so, we also acknowledge the contributions of those whose names do not appear in the program of the day but who without their involvement these accolades would not be possible or appropriate. In this we include spouses, parents, children, and other family members; friends, classmates, faculty members, teachers, and mentors; Church leaders and contributors of tithes, offerings, and donations; and all who have enriched the experiences and education of today's graduates.<br><br>We have been richly blessed to be at BYU and certainly have wonderful advantages and opportunities that far exceed the usual in this large and complicated world; yet we live in an age of uncertainty and considerable challenges that can be very distressing, should we allow them to be so. The employment situation for graduates is not rosy in every discipline. The national and world economy makes us all, including the experts, more than a little nervous. In fulfillment of prophecy we live with "wars and rumors of wars," massive oil spills, extremes in weather, and aggressive political regimes--and the list goes on and on. If we look to be discouraged or choose to be so, we have ample evidence to support such a case.<br><br>I, for one, feel differently, and I hope that is also true for each of you. I believe that with all of our problems, difficulties, and uncertainties, we have the best reasons for optimism regarding the things of greatest importance. In this Ido not discount the ambiguities, disappointments, or dilemmas we all face, including those yet to come. Perhaps a personal experience will best help you understand why I feel the way Ido.<br><br>Eight and a half years ago the 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City. At that time one of my assignments was to serve on the Public Affairs Committee of the Church. As you might know, many prominent people from around the world visited Salt Lake City. All of us at Church headquarters and many others had multiple opportunities to host these special visitors. On one of these occasions Sister Samuelson and I had the privilege of accompanying Mr. Mike Wallace--the host of the<i>60 Minutes</i>television program--and his producer to the special cultural event presented at the LDS Conference Center during the Olympic Games.<br><br>You may recall that Mike Wallace twice interviewed President Gordon B. Hinckley on his television program. While Mr. Wallace could never trip up or confuse President Hinckley with his penetrating questions, they became good friends as a result of these interviews, and Mike Wallace came to Salt Lake City for the Olympics as a guest of the Church. As we sat with these good people, it was clear that they were impressed, and Mr. Wallace frequently made very complimentary comments about President Hinckley.<br><br>At the conclusion of the performance, we accompanied these VIPS to their limousine. On the way we met President and Sister James E. Faust of the First Presidency, who had also attended the performance.<br><br>As I introduced President Faust to Mike Wallace and explained the close relationship President Faust and President Hinckley enjoyed in the First Presidency, Mr. Wallace said to President Faust, "You are just the man to answer a question Ihave had for some time. Gordon Hinckley isthe most optimistic man Ihave ever met. Can you tell me why?"<br><br>President Faust didn't hesitate for even a moment and replied with a twinkle in his eye, "President Hinckley knows how all this is going to turn out."<br><br>Mike Wallace, a self-described agnostic Jew, knew exactly what President Faust meant.<br><br>Of all the graduates from every university in the world, you should also know how things are going to turn out. Through the living prophets and scriptures we know that the gospel of Jesus Christ must be carried throughout the world and that when the work is completed, the Savior Jesus Christ will come triumphantly to the earth again. The question then is not how the world will turn out but how will we as individuals turn out?<br><br>Your Brigham Young University education positions you uniquely to turn out to become or accomplish what you should and must. There is no guarantee, however, and the course of your life depends on you and on your following the Lord as you should. While your accomplishments to this point are impressive and significant, you have "miles to go before [you] sleep," as we are reminded by Robert Frost ("Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" [1923]).<br><br>Each of you has learned a great deal in your major and other areas of interest, but no one in this room has learned all there is to know. Thus the most important skill you have acquired at BYU is likely your understanding of how to learn, because this is a talent or capacity that is transferable to virtually every topic and to every situation. You have learned to learn "by study and also by faith" and must remember that this pattern of effort and rigorous scholarship must be continually combined with equally intensive and serious faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in your Heavenly Father's plan for you and for all His children.<br><br>If you keep these principles and truths clearly in focus and in your top priorities as you leave this phase of your learning, then you will be successful whether you are going on for further education and training, entering the world of employment, or focusing your energies primarily on your homes and families.<br><br>We know how things in the big picture will turn out and have great confidence that you also in your individual lives and careers will turn out as you wish and as heaven intends. Because BYU is a very special place, as are those who study here, you have been richly blessed and will continue to be so as part of this grand legacy established by the Lord's prophets here upon the earth. We invoke a loving Heavenly Father's richest blessings upon you and yours at this wonderful and special time. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was president of Brigham Young University when this commencement address was given on 12 August 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1>d in the Arms of Love - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Elder Clayton, President Samuelson, faculty, graduates, family, and guests: It is an honor to stand before you today on this momentous occasion. I am grateful for this opportunity to share a few words with you.<br><br>Several months ago I embarked on one of the longest drives I have ever made by myself. A dear friend had passed away, and I was determined to attend his funeral, even if that meant traveling alone. I confess that as I prepared to leave home, I felt some strong misgivings about the upcoming journey. Our car is not the most reliable, and I doubted my ability to effectively handle our vehicle if an emergency should arise. Although I had carefully studied a map and tried to familiarize myself with the route, I feared road conditions that I could not foresee or anticipate. I expressed my concerns to my husband, who quickly assured me that everything would be all right. But his reassurances did not assuage my fears nor make me feel better about the upcoming trip.<br><br>Sensing my unspoken discomfort, my husband asked if I would sit down for a few minutes before my departure. "Shannon," he said, "I can't come with you, but let's practice the drive together." He stood behind me, put his arms around me, and instructed me to pretend like we were in our car. My protestations that I felt very foolish were of no avail; my husband gently insisted that we practice the route together. As I held an imaginary steering wheel, he asked me to verbalize the directions and to move my hands and feet the way Iwould if I were really driving.<br><br>We practiced the entire trip together, rehearsing every turn, every stop, and every exit. It was comforting to feel and hear my husband, who knew the roads, give me a clear picture of what to expect. At the end of our pretend drive, my husband once again expressed confidence in my ability to complete the journey and promised me that if I had any problems, I could always call him.<br><br>During the actual drive, when doubts arose, I felt the memory of my husband's arms around my own, guiding and comforting me. The trip started smoothly, and I was finally beginning to relax and even enjoy the ride when I discovered--to my great anxiety--that I had taken a wrong turn and had gone many miles in the wrong direction. I called my husband and frantically explained my situation. With his help I was eventually able to get back on course and arrive safely at my destination.<br><br>Today we are assembled to celebrate our graduation from this great university. Perhaps many of us feel that we have finally reached a long-anticipated destination. I am sure that, for each of us, our years at BYU have presented challenges and expectations that have stretched our capabilities both intellectually and spiritually. Although our personal progression over the past few years may sometimes have felt lonely, we have been surrounded by marvelous family members, friends, professors, mentors, and spiritual leaders who have helped us navigate the obstacles of college life: companions who have--in effect--put their arms around us and guided us so that we might be prepared to stand confident in the face of an uncertain future. How grateful we should feel for those whose experience and support during our times of need have given us foresight, wisdom, and strength to do all that has been required ofus.<br><br>For most of us, graduation heralds a challenging new beginning filled with unknown variables and weighty responsibilities. I know that as I have made preparations for the next stages of my life, I have had doubts that have caused me to wonder if the future is really as bright as our leaders assure us it is. During these periods of worry and sometimes even anguish, the memory of one who perceives "sorrow that the eye can't see,"<sup>1</sup>even Jesus Christ, who has personally traveled the roads of my life, has reassured me that "all is well"<sup>2</sup>and that with His help I will be able to complete my goals with excellence and honor.<br><br>We may be assured that our all-knowing Heavenly Father is likewise well aware of the stops, the right turns, the wrong turns, and the exits that await us. We can feel certain that as we turn to Him in full trust, laying before Him our innermost feelings and thoughts, He will lead us by His hand and "will take [us]"<sup>3</sup>and encircle us "about eternally in the arms of his love"<sup>4</sup>and direct our paths<sup>5</sup>for our good.<br><br>Our educational experiences here at BYU have prepared us to be leaders in whatever capacity we will serve. Of our generation the Lord has repeatedly expressed His absolute confidence that we can and will achieve great things and overcome insurmountable odds, even if the journey is daunting. The awareness of God's love for us, of His unreserved guidance and support, should inspire us to likewise extend our reach to those who look to us for direction and relief. In our gratitude for those who have so faithfully traveled with us on our own life's journey, let us also extend all that we have to offer to our families, our friends, our communities, and the world.<br><br><i>Shannon Stimpson spoke as the representative of her graduating class at BYU commencement on 12 August 2010.</i><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>1.

<h1>Until the Clock Reads Double Zero - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am honored to represent the Brigham Young University Alumni Association at these commencement exercises and hope the opportunity you have had to attend BYU fills your heart with gratitude. This university embodies sacred strength as part of the Lord's work. Petr Ruda, a native of the Czech Republic who graduated last December with a degree in nursing, said:<br><br><i>BYU makes me happy; it connects me to Heavenly Father--even by just walking on campus. This place significantly changed me, and I'm grateful to those who made it possible for me to come.</i>[In "Nurse, Immigrant from Czech Republic Cares for U.S. Veterans,"<i>President's Report,</i>winter 2009–2010, 8]<br><br>I trust we all feel that same kind of gratitude for our BYU experience.<br><br>Our family has a tradition related to sporting events: When we attend, we stay until the clock is at "double zero." No matter how bleak the end might appear, or how miserable the weather, we wait until the clock reads double zero--even when others are exiting the sports arena. Staying until double zero has often yielded a victory for both fans and players. Consider these defining events in the history ofBYU sports:<br><br><ul><br>	<li>The 13-second football miracle when quarterback John Beck passed to tight end Jonny Harline at the University of Utah in 2006 for BYU to win 33-31.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The 2007 Pioneer Las Vegas Bowl: With three seconds left in the game and BYU leading 17-16, UCLA kicker Kai Forbath lined up for a 28-yard chip shot field goal. BYU freshman defensive lineman Eathyn Manumaleuna blocked the kick to give BYU the victory.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>The NCAA basketball tournament last March in which No. 7 seed BYU, led by Jimmer Fredette's 37 points, held off No. 10 seed Florida in double overtime to defeat the Gators 99-92 and give the Cougars their first tournament victory in 17 years.</li><br></ul><br>The players did not give up, and we did not give up on them. Staying or perhaps "enduring to the end" enriched the experience for both fans and players.<br><br>Just like waiting until the clock reads double zero, you have prepared for the proper educational plays, emerged victorious, and received your hard-earned degree. We applaud you--and no one gave up on you. Professors, family, friends, and unknown benefactors trusted in you and have high expectations for the rest of your life.<br><br>We are confident you will<br><br><ul><br>	<li>live a Christ-centered life</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>serve in the Church and your community</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>be a good parent and supportive spouse</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>use the fruits of your BYU experience to build the kingdom of God on the earth</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>remain virtuous</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>be strong in your gospel testimony</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>work hard</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>pursue learning throughout your life</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>stay "connected for good" to BYU</li><br></ul><br>There is something else.<br><br>Remember how excited you were when you opened your acceptance letter? Qualification for this university requires exceptional academic performance and moral excellence. To participate in the experiences that touched the social, spiritual, and intellectual pieces of your life was a profound blessing. Our sponsoring organization, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has made a tremendous investment in you. You have received a "loan" from the Church in the subsidizing of your education in the form of low tuition relative to the value of your education. Many generous benefactors have supplemented the costs of your education. You are indeed fortunate, and we anticipate that as you prosper, you will follow this vital tradition of giving back to your alma mater.<br><br>Chris Giovarelli, the 2006 BYU student-body president and 2008 Student Alumni Association president, once shared these thoughts:<br><br><i>As we reflect on our BYU experiences and see how far the university has come, basking in the light of national ranking and acclaim, let us remember that the work is not done. Our founders sacrificed time, talent, and treasure to build the foundation of this university, and through similar small and simple offerings we can continue that work today.</i>["Return to Give Back,"<i>Emeritimes Newsletter,</i>spring 2008, 1]<br><br>My hope is that you will replenish BYU. Commit to advancing the educations of future students. Nourish the university with your resources through volunteer service or financial support for the outstanding programs and disciplines developed at BYU. Many of us wear a CTR ring that reminds us to "choose the right." Let me suggest another meaning for the acronym: "choose to replenish."<br><br>When you look at your CTR ring, consider BYU as a unique and sacred place. Choose to replenish the university so your children and grandchildren will also enjoy the benefits of BYU.<br><br>As its president, I hereby confer on each of you lifetime membership in the Brigham Young University Alumni Association. We offer our congratulations and welcome you into this great association of more than 378,000. You will have many opportunities to join your fellow alumni in meaningful activities associated with the university.<br><br>We are proud of you. Your efforts to persist until the double zero will reward you abundantly throughout your life.<br><br>May the Spirit of the Y live in you as you embark on your journey of lifelong learning and service. May your Christlike influence be felt wherever you may be found throughout the world, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Chris Feinauer was president of the BYU Alumni Association when this commencement address was given on 12 August 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<br>
President Samuelson, members of the faculty, family members, guests, and graduates: my wife, Kathy, and I are honored to celebrate this day and all the accomplishments that have led to it with each of you. We rejoice in the accomplishments and achievements recognized by these proceedings and in the privilege of being with you.<br><br>We feel profound respect for Brigham Young University and for the Church that supports it. With you we recognize that heaven's hand rests upon this school. It is an honor to be invited to study here and a rare, even remarkable, blessing to graduate from a university that bears the Lord's imprimatur.<br><br>Four of our seven children are BYU graduates. Our youngest son is enrolled here now and continues with his undergraduate studies. When he finishes his course work, he'll be the fifth of our children to graduate from BYU. One of our daughters is a member of the faculty. We are greatly indebted to BYU and to all whose contributions to the school have made possible these great blessings to our family.<br><br>We are delighted to congratulate all who this day receive a degree from BYU. We salute you, your spouses, children, family, and any others, including future family members, who have contributed to your success. You know and we know that this culminating day in your scholastic careers would not have been possible without the loving and generous support of others. You have immediate benefactors, as has been mentioned: your parents, spouses, children, family, and friends, as well as BYU faculty and staff--all have contributed immeasurably to your experience here.<br><br>There are other unseen but very real benefactors, as President Samuelson observed. Their faith and actions have blessed you. If we think for a moment, we will recognize and feel to honor Latter-day Saints across the world whose faithful contributions, whether measured in multiple millions of dollars or in priceless pennies, have paid for the floors you've walked on, the air conditioning you've enjoyed on a hot summer's day, the scientific instruments you've utilized, and the books you've checked out from the library. For many hundreds of thousands of your brothers and sisters, the opportunity to know what you have known here, and may have even taken for granted, is completely out of reach, even unimaginable. The standard of living and abundance commonplace at BYU vastly exceed what most of our brothers and sisters will ever experience. The cumulative power of faith and tithing are demonstrated by everything we see at BYU.<br><br>Like you, I have been reading the Old Testament this year as the assigned course of study for Sunday School. I have been intrigued by something I've read. You will remember that Moses and the children of Israel sojourned 40 years in the wilderness after fleeing Egypt. Near the end of his life, having been told that he wouldn't be allowed to cross the River Jordan into Israel, the promised land, Moses did everything he knew to prepare the children of Israel to enter that promised land. The book of Deuteronomy records Moses' preaching and encouragement and warnings to try to help the children of Israel become and remain worthy. They had proven themselves wearyingly difficult to lead, not just across the Sinai wilderness but, more important, along the paths of righteousness. Theirs wasn't just a journey toward a geographic destination, although they still had to cover the mileage--their journey was also a pathway toward the level of obedience required to live in their promised land flowing with milk and honey. The text from the books of Exodus through Joshua tells the story of the wandering hearts and the frequent unfaithfulness of the children of Israel. Moses was able to take the Israelites out of Egypt comparatively quickly, but it took 40 years to take Egypt out of the Israelites.<br><br>After those 40 years, Moses and the children of Israel stood on the bank of the River Jordan and on the edge of their future, looking toward the promised land. That land was inhabited by the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. The Lord promised to fight the Israelites' battles with those nations, but as a condition to His doing so, He required that the children of Israel be righteous. And so, just before they crossed the river, Moses reminded them what God required of them in the promised land. He set before them the bounteous blessings on the one hand and the curses on the other hand that awaited them, depending on whether they kept the commandments.<br><br>In the Book of Mormon we see something similar. Both before and after they crossed the great sea, Lehi and Nephi tried to prepare their family for their promised land with repeated admonitions from God: "Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence" (2 Nephi 1:20). Those words or their close cousins appear in the Book of Mormon multiple times. Yet we see repeated instances of the Nephites fluctuating between righteousness and degradation. As the centuries passed, their spiritual yo-yoing became more exaggerated, and it occurred "in the space of not many years" (Helaman 4:26, 6:32, 7:6, 11:26).<br><br>Our latter-day pioneers stood at the edge of the Mississippi River in February 1845 and looked across that river toward Iowa. They doubtless wondered what awaited them once they crossed those freezing waters. It could have been neither comfortable nor comforting to walk away from houses and farms or to contemplate camping in the snow and trudging west. But they were confident that they would "find the place which God for [them] prepared, Far away in the West"--their own promised land ("Come, Come, Ye Saints,"<i>Hymns,</i>1985, no. 30). Their strength and courage as they faced their uncertain futures now inspire countless Church members worldwide.<br><br>You who graduate today stand on your own riverbank or your own ocean shore, on the edge of your futures. You look off into the distant years before you, searching the horizon for your own promised land that flows with milk and honey. In a sense, we all do, every day.<br><br>As you try to discern the future, you likely see some challenges ahead that are the modern equivalents of Amorites, Canaanites, and Jebusites. As mentioned, unemployment is higher than it has been in many years. Unresolved wars and stifling deficits obscure our view of tomorrow. Cultural enemies stalk the horizon, trying to conform the world to their own dangerous views of morality. One could lose heart, seeing a future that awaits but doesn't entice. It could look like a land of promise without much promise. But the Lord<i>always</i>offers each of us a promised land. You can be sure of that. The promised land--your promised land--really is there. If you follow the admonition of the Lord, you really will inhabit that rich land and harvest its blessings--milk, honey, and all. Everything you have learned at BYU points toward a land laden with promise, luxuriant in opportunity, and waiting with wonder. May I offer you some thoughts about the promised land?<br><br>First, the promised land today is not likely to be a<i>place</i>like it was in Old Testament times or even for the pioneers. Instead, the promised land is a way of life. It is found in living life in a manner that qualifies for the fulfillment of divine promises. This is achieved when we follow the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). King Benjamin taught, "Moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual" (Mosiah 2:41). "Blessed in all things" usually does not mean blessed<i>with</i>all things. The promised land means that we will have sufficient resources for our needs and even some of our desires. But, more important, it means that as a result of our sincere striving and our earnest efforts, we will be blessed with freedom from contention, from envying, and from strife in our homes (see 4 Nephi 1:18) and sustained with forgiveness of sins, peace of conscience, charity, meekness, joy and rejoicing in our posterity, and peace with our neighbors.<br><br>Second, since today the promised land usually isn't a place, we can find it wherever we are. While we naturally look out to the horizon and plan for and work toward a future day, the promised land is here and now. It is found in the way we live each day, confront each challenge, and move forward with faith. There is no such thing as finally arriving anywhere in life, for life extends ahead of us with a constantly receding horizon, offering both new opportunities and new trials. Thus we should seek to make every day and every hour count. It is too easy to hang our hopes on some future event or some new situation and forget what life offers us now.<br><br>When the Church was barely a year old, new members (they were<i>all</i>new members) moved from some of the eastern states to Ohio. The Lord consecrated land in Ohio to them "for a<i>little</i>season, until [He would] provide for them otherwise, and command them to go hence" (D&amp;amp;C 51:16; emphasis added). To these Saints He said, "Let them act upon<i>this</i>land as for years, and<i>this</i>shall turn unto them for their good" (D&amp;amp;C 51:17; emphasis added).<br><br>A few years ago I saw an example of this principle in nature. We have a large pot filled with flowers on the walkway leading to our front door. The pot sits under a scrub oak tree. One fall a few acorns fell from the scrub oak tree into the pot. The next year the oak sprouts became visible by early summer, when I started to pull them out so the flowers in the pot could look their best. Just a leaf or two of each acorn's new tiny scrub oak seedling had become visible. As I pulled the little seedlings from the pot, the roots kept coming and coming. The seedlings had long, skinny roots that were thrusting themselves ever deeper into the soil. The roots<i>in</i>the soil were much longer than the seedlings<i>above</i>the soil.<br><br>Likewise, we would be wise to sink our roots into the pot in which we are planted and not wait for a later time or a different place or a new pot. No matter how "little [our] season," we should act upon<i>this,</i>our land, "as for years." We sink our roots by getting involved, making friends, seeking opportunities for service, accepting and then magnifying callings, attending the temple, and joining in community efforts. Sending our roots deep will enrich our experience and bless others as well. We may be plucked up and moved to some new place when our friendships or jobs are just tiny seedlings, still with barely a leaf to be seen, but sinking our roots gives us experience and will "turn unto [us] for [our] good." This is particularly applicable to those who are single, in graduate school, or know they will soon move and who may be tempted to hold back and let others do the heavy lifting of earnest Church work. It's a mistake to put our baptismal covenants on hold that way. You may not think you will be in this particular pot for very long, and you probably won't be, but your life will be richer and your opportunities enhanced if you treat this time and this place and this situation as your promised land.<br><br>Third, our promised lands may and probably will change from time to time, and occasionally very abruptly. A phone call from a close family member this very week proves the point. He and his wife have loved living where they are living and doing what they are doing. He has enjoyed an exciting professional opportunity. An event completely unforeseen by them and by many others changed their situation in a heartbeat. Their employment world was turned upside down. We need to expect changes and be prepared for reversals. People nowadays change jobs and even careers several times during their working years. Economic cycles can act like tsunamis. Accidents can rearrange our futures in just a moment, just as disease can do so slowly but inexorably. The loss of a spouse or a child or a parent or a friend can change our circumstances and the substance of our promised land. We have never been promised that those promised lands would be trouble free; thus the need to be deeply rooted, or, as the Savior put it, to be built upon a rock:<br><br><i>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</i><br><br><i>And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</i><br><br><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</i>[Matthew 7:24–27]<br><br>Fourth, there will always be something of the miraculous in your journeys to your promised lands. Sometimes that miracle may be just that you got there at all and you arrived sweating and weary and feeling that you pulled the handcart alone through the heat of the day across the whole of the prairie. At other times the miracle may be that there was a wall of water and you went across the seabed or the river bottom on dry ground and didn't even get your feet muddy. Either way, we should recognize heaven's gracious hand in seeing us through challenges as we seek our promised lands.<br><br>Fifth, and finally, Dorothy in the<i>Wizard of Oz</i>said it exactly right with these words: "There's no place like home." The geographic center of the promised land is a loving home. Some of you are married or soon will be. Some are already raising children. For others, marriage may be still in the distance, perhaps a long way off. No matter. Marriage is a promised land like no other. Its opportunities for love, growth, education, refining, and service are without compare. Still, good marriages require real work. The most difficult adversaries ever to appear on any promised land's horizon--enemies like pride, personal weakness, and bad habits--must be vanquished for marriage to prosper. These enemies lurk in our souls and can be very difficult to discern and even harder to defeat. Subduing these foes is the challenge of a lifetime, but "there's no place like home" to do so and no path to the promised land<i>without</i>doing so.<br><br>The Lord is gracious unto those who truly seek Him. He promises:<br><br><i>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</i>[Ether 12:27]<br><br>Obedience to the second commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (Leviticus 19:18), is a foundational principle in the promised land of a happy marriage and a happy home. Obedience to this commandment is better learned and more profitably practiced at home than anywhere else.<br><br>When Moses' life and ministry were drawing to an end, he gave a charge to Joshua to "be strong and of a good courage" (Deuteronomy 31:23). The Lord repeated that charge three times to Joshua when he became the prophet (see Joshua 1:6, 7, 9). The Lord said, "Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest" (Joshua 1:9). The promised land awaited the children of Israel.<i>They</i>crossed the River Jordan on dry ground and moved into that land. They did so in the strength of the Lord, with courage and without fear.<br><br>Today<i>you</i>cross a modern Red Sea or River Jordan as you graduate from BYU and move on. No generation has been better trained or more richly prepared for its future. As you move out and move on:<br><ul><br>	<li>May God bless you that you will "be strong and of a good courage" and unafraid.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>May your lives be your promised lands, worthy in every way for the promised blessings of heaven.</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>With those blessings, may you find a promised land<i>wherever you are, wherever you go, and all the time</i>.</li><br></ul><br>The promises of heaven are extended to you. We wish you every blessing and much happiness. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>L.

<h1>of Truth - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Brothers and sisters, it is wonderful to be with you this morning. You are a beautiful sight. Each time I come on campus, I can't help but think of many years ago when I came for a stake conference here with one of the BYU student stakes. We spent the evening with the stake president and his family and had a wonderful dinner. During the evening we visited, and the stake president asked Sister Snow, Phyllis, about serving with me. She said, "Oh, it's very enjoyable." She said she loved coming. The only thing that bothered her, she said, was that "I am often introduced as his lovely wife." He made note of that. The next morning we were in the Provo Tabernacle with all of these students--coeds and young men. President Roney stood up to introduce us. He said, "Wewould like to welcome Elder Snow and his lov . . . " And he stopped. Then he said, "I would like to welcome Elder Snow and his drop-dead gorgeous wife."<br><br>And I still feel the same. I think he got it. So I am grateful that she could be here this morning.<br><br>Now I know many of you come each year for this important week, and I applaud you for your desire to pursue learning. You who are here for the first time, I hope you find this week of learning stimulating and rewarding.<br><br>I made the attempt to learn a little bit more about the history of Campus Education Week. So of course I googled "BYU education week" and learned that this has gone on since 1922 and that it is one of the largest continuing education efforts in the world. I thought that was remarkable. And if we had more time, knowing many of you come year after year, I would see who has come the most times, who is the oldest participant, and who has come the farthest. I think that would be fun. But we don't have that time this morning, so I will continue my remarks.<br><br>My thoughts today address our responsibility to be seekers of truth. The inspiration for what I will say comes from the theme of this year's Campus Education Week, Doctrine and Covenants 88:118: "Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." I hope to address our responsibility to learn and teach one another and to identify opportunities to do both.<br><br>For the past several months the eyes of the world have been on the small country of South Africa, which hosted the World Cup, the largest sporting event on the planet. Every four years for the past 80 years, countries of the world have competed for the World Cup, the most prestigious of all sporting championships. The level of interest in soccer--or football, as it is known outside of the United States--is at an all-time high. Even here in the United States, where past interest in the World Cup has been rather marginal, soccer madness was at a fever pitch as the U.S. advanced to the top 16 international teams. It seemed like all those soccer kids that we raised grew up and became rabidfans.<br><br>This was the first time the competition had been held on the African continent, and South Africa was honored with the right to host the competition. This is an amazing honor for a country that less than 20 years ago teetered on the brink of civil war. South Africa is a country that until 16 years ago did not allow the majority of its citizens the right to vote. In a country of 48 million, the predominantly white government denied 38 million blacks the opportunity to go to the polls and cast a vote. How does a country once known as an international pariah and banned from worldwide sport competition in such a short time earn the right to host one of sport's most prestigious competitions?<br><br>The story of this amazing transformation features two important individuals who have left their mark on modern history. The first is F.W. de Klerk, former president of South Africa, who was elected from the National Party, a political party that had perpetuated apartheid, the policy of separation of the races, since they came to power in 1948. He had the foresight to understand the continuation of such policies could not be sustained and would ultimately lead his country into further isolation internationally and likely result in a bloody civil war. De Klerk had the courage to face those in his party who disagreed and set in place negotiations that led to free elections in 1994. He also had the courage to release Nelson Mandela and lift the ban on Mandela's political party, the African National Congress.<br><br>Nelson Mandela is the other important individual in this fascinating drama. An early political activist, he campaigned for political reforms in his country in the 1940s and 1950s and into the early 1960s. Initially, he followed Gandhi's model of nonviolent resistance. However, as the years of struggle passed with no meaningful progress with the white government, his rhetoric turned more strident as he eventually concluded change would not come without armed resistance.<br><br>Ultimately this stance ended in his arrest and trial for treason, which culminated in his conviction in 1963. Narrowly avoiding the death penalty, Mandela spent the next 27 years in prison. Much of this time was spent in a small cell in a prison on Robben Island, a small island located in Table Bay near Cape Town, South Africa. I have stood in the tiny cell where Mandela spent so many years. In this cell, the floor and a mat were his bed, and a bucket served as the toilet. I visited the limestone quarry where he and other prisoners were forced to labor in the hot African sun. He was allowed few visitors and was allowed to receive and write few letters. I wondered then and I marvel now on how one could survive such an experience.<br><br>One would understand if Nelson Mandela, convicted by a government he despised, was full of hate and vengeance. But that was not the case. As an inmate he taught his fellow prisoners tolerance and understanding. He turned the direst of circumstances into an opportunity--petitioning prison officials for educational opportunities and organizing classes and correspondence courses for those political activists who were imprisoned with him on Robben Island. "We will make this prison our university," he told his fellow inmates. For the better part of 20 years, Mandela had a profound influence on all those who entered through the prison doors and provided opportunities for a generation of political activists to prepare to lead their country when freedom came. At one time a proponent of violence, Nelson Mandela would later say on a visit to the United States, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world" (quoted in Peter J. Howe and Diane E. Lewis, "Mandela and Boston Embrace in a Daylong Celebration of Unity,"<i>Boston Globe,</i>24 June 1990, 1).<br><br>After 27 years, freedom came for Nelson Mandela when he was freed by President F.W. de Klerk. He then led the opposition in negotiations with the government that brought about free elections. It was in this election in 1994 that Nelson Mandela was elected as South Africa's first black president. Attitudes of forgiveness and reconciliation were the hallmarks of his leadership as president. He brought his country together and led them back from the brink of what could have been years of armed conflict. He was instrumental in forming the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has become a model for the entire world for overcoming past wrongs and prejudices. This example of leadership took root in those long years of confinement when he chose learning and understanding over hatred and fear.<br><br>In March of 1886, Elder Lorenzo Snow, then 71 years of age and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, became the most prominent LDS leader to be incarcerated for the practice of plural marriage. He entered the Utah Territorial Prison in Sugar House, Utah, convicted under the federal anti-polygamy Edmunds Act, which was passed in 1882. For those persecuting the Mormon people for their religious practices and beliefs, this was considered a great victory.<br><br>Lorenzo Snow joined the Church in 1836 in Kirtland, Ohio, along with his sister Eliza R. Snow. As an early member of the Church he served missions in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky before beginning extensive missionary service in Great Britain. Brother Snow arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1848, and in 1849 he was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. After returning from additional missionary service in Europe, Elder Snow was called to preside in Box Elder County. Eventually he settled his large family in Brigham City, where he happily remained until he became president of the Church in 1898.<br><br>This peaceful period was interrupted in November 1885 when he was arrested for the practice of plural marriage. A non-Mormon jury convicted him, and he was sentenced in January to 18 months in prison.<br><br>While awaiting sentencing, Elder Snow spoke to a group of Saints in Brigham City:<br><br><i>I go to prison with the full assurance that I can serve God and His purposes--magnify my calling, and prove to the world, my faith and sincerity in the principles I have taught, during fifty years, among many nations--that Jesus is the Son of God--that He has revealed His Priesthood, and the fulness of the ancient Gospel, and established His Church by revelation. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . In a few days I must leave family, kind friends and associates with whom I have spent so many pleasant hours in "The City I love so well"--proceed to Ogden--receive my sentence, then retire to private life, within my prison walls, for "The word of God and testimony of Jesus."</i>[<i>JD</i>26:365–66, 368]<br><br>It would be easy to understand if Elder Snow entered prison embittered and resentful of a government that convicted him for practicing his religious beliefs. Certainly a natural reaction would be to withdraw and suffer in silence the long months of incarceration that lay ahead. This was not to be the case with Elder Snow. Accepting his lot, he immediately went about helping his fellow prisoners. He organized classes in reading, writing, math, and bookkeeping. One prisoner recorded:<br><br><i>Some six weeks ago Apostle Snow, feeling a deepening interest in the school, kindly volunteered to give two lectures a week on grammar. A class of fifteen members was organized and has since been under his kind and able tutelage and it has brought new life into the study and his lectures are looked forward to with the warmest interest. His able, kind, and genial manners have found way into the hearts of the entire school.</i>[H. T. B. Grey, in "ThePenitentiary School,"<i>Utah Journal,</i>14 July 1886,1]<br><br>Rudger Clawson, a fellow Mormon polygamist convicted in 1884, said this about his time of incarceration with Lorenzo Snow:<br><br><i>He was considered an excellent authority on doctrinal points, and his views were frequently sought; as we sat around the table during the long hours of the evening, he often discoursed interestingly upon matters pertaining to the past, present, and future conditions of man. I shall ever look back to those hours--hours passed in prison--as among the most profitable of my life.</i>[<i>Prisoner for Polygamy: The Memoirs and Letters of Rudger Clawson at the Utah Territorial Penitentiary, 1884–87,</i>ed. Stan Larson (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois, 1993), 128]<br><br>Elder Lorenzo Snow is another example of someone turning an impossible situation into an environment of learning and faith, replacing fear and hatred. He lived the words of the Lord included in the Doctrine and Covenants and adopted as the theme for this Campus Education Week:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br>Such individuals teach us that even in impossible circumstances we have a responsibility to educate ourselves and to teach others. Lorenzo Snow and Nelson Mandela are not the only ones who have learned and taught under trying conditions.<br><br>Most biblical scholars agree that Paul probably wrote many of his epistles while incarcerated for his beliefs. The books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and 2 Timothy are often referred to as the prison letters.<br><br>During his imprisonment in Liberty Jail the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote many letters to his family and to the Saints. Extracts from a long letter written in March of 1839 later became sections 121 through 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 121 begins with the plaintive cry from the Prophet, "O God, where art thou?" The Lord comforts Joseph by saying:<br><br><i>My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</i><br><br><i>And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 121:7–8]<br><br>Then, as if to make a further point, the Lord instructed the Prophet in section 122:<br><br><i>And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good.</i><br><br><i>The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?</i>[D&amp;amp;C 122:7–8]<br><br>comes the great lesson to the Prophet Joseph and to us all: "Therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 122:9).<br><br>Sometimes life's greatest lessons come to us at the most dreadful times of our lives. How we respond at such times of crisis determines if such challenges will be times for progression or merely times of suffering. The Apostle Erastus Snow taught:<br><br><i>The various pains and sorrows to be endured in life are all necessary in their time and place; the trials as we term them . . . are all a part of the scheme of education or training to prepare us for the future.</i>[<i>JD</i>21:25]<br><br>In late February of 1834, the Prophet Joseph Smith was inspired to organize a group of brethren to travel to Missouri to assist the Saints who were being severely persecuted for their religious beliefs. This group, which became known as Zion's Camp, was to resist the unlawful mobs that were harassing members of the Church and help restore the Saints to their lands, which had been unlawfully taken from them.<br><br>Zion's Camp, a group of over 200 brethren and a few women and children, left Ohio in early May of 1834. Led by the Prophet Joseph, they marched a thousand miles in 45 days, finally arriving in Clay County, Missouri.<br><br>From the start the expedition was fraught with suffering and hardship. Some members of the group murmured against the Prophet and questioned his ability to lead. The majority, however, remained true to his counsel and continued on.<br><br>Zion's Camp did not achieve its political or military objectives. Having been met by a superior force of Missourian ruffians, the Prophet Joseph resisted the bloodshed that would have certainly come from armed conflict. In early July, Zion's Camp was disbanded and its members were honorably discharged.<br><br>Later the Prophet explained the outcome and purpose of the march:<br><br><i>God did not want you to fight. He could not organize His kingdom with twelve men to open theGospel door to the nations of the earth, and with seventy men under their direction to follow in their tracks, unless He took them from a body of men who had offered their lives, and who had made as great a sacrifice as did Abraham.</i>[<i>HC</i>2:182, note†]<br><br>Wilford Woodruff, a member of Zion's Camp and fourth president of the Church, said:<br><br><i>We gained an experience that we never could have gained in any other way. We had the privilege of beholding the face of the prophet, and we had the privilege of travelling a thousand miles with him, and seeing the workings of the Spirit of God with him, and the revelations of Jesus Christ unto him and the fulfilment of those revelations.</i>[<i>JD</i>13:158]<br><br>Within a few months after the discharge of Zion's Camp, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Quorum of the Seventy were organized. Seventy-nine of the 82 positions filled in these quorums were filled by those who had served and been proven in the march of Zion's Camp. Men like Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff, and many other members of Zion's Camp were strengthened spiritually and gained practical experience that would be of great assistance to them in the future as they were called to lead the Saints west.<br><br>Just as with those who faithfully endured the hardships of Zion's Camp, the Lord expects us to learn and progress during this mortal experience. Sometimes our learning comes from our everyday experiences. It is important we learn from these experiences, even those that seem mundane. Much of the success in life comes from simply showing up, working hard, and paying attention. Invariably what we learn in school or on the job can assist us later, sometimes in circumstances we do not expect.<br><br>Clearly our time here on earth can be a rich time of learning, simply by taking advantage of and learning from these experiences. Sometimes life can be a cruel and difficult teacher as we learn through trials and challenges we do not expect and do not welcome. But as we have learned from the lives of those discussed today, those are the lessons that are often emblazoned in our souls, never to be forgotten.<br><br>But the "school of hard knocks," or life's experiences, will not teach us all we need to know to return to the presence of the Father. The Lord does not desire we simply be acted upon in order to learn. We are taught to seek wisdom from the scriptures, to build our faith through study and prayer, to seek and rely upon the Holy Spirit, to serve others, and to endure to the end.<br><br>Section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants speaks to our responsibilities to be seekers of truth. In verses 77 through 78 the Lord commands us to "teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom . . . in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God." President Harold B. Lee said, "He [the Lord] counsels as to the wide sweep of learning about which we should seek. His church was not to be an ignorant ministry in various fields of secular learning" (<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>[Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1974], 358).<br><br><i>Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--</i><br><br><i>That ye may be prepared in all things.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:79–80]<br><br>That's a pretty exhaustive list. When you think of the cumulative knowledge in the world and realize what some experts believe, that all of that knowledge doubles every five years, then the Lord has given us no small charge. Needless to say, He does not expect us to know everything, but He does expect us to know something. He expects us to have some understanding of history, to be aware of current events, and to understand the marvels of His creation that surround us every day. He expects us to pay attention and to learn so we may be prepared to better serve Him.<br><br>In this same revelation the Lord goes on to address others who may not have faith:<br><br><i>And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:118]<br><br>What does it mean to seek learning by faith? In the prophet Alma's wonderful chapter on faith in the Book of Mormon we learn valuable insights on what it means to learn by faith. According to President Harold B. Lee, Alma instructs us to<br><br><i>arouse</i>[our]<i>faculties and experiment on the words of the Lord and desire to believe. Let this desire work in you until you believe in a manner that you can give place even to a portion of the word of the Lord. Then, like a planted seed, it must be cultivated and not resist the Spirit of the Lord, which is that which lighteneth everyone born into the world. You can then begin to feel within yourselves that it must be good, for it enlarges your soul and enlightens your understanding and, like the fruit of the tree in Lehi'svision, it becomes delicious to the taste. (See Alma 32.)</i><br><br><i>It was an English novelist who was quoted as saying: "He who seeks God has already found Him."</i>[Harold B. Lee,<i>Stand Ye,</i>358; see also Blaise Pascal,<i>Pensées</i>(1670), no. 553]<br><br>This process in the Book of Mormon described by President Harold B. Lee in his book<i>Stand Ye in Holy Places</i>applies not only to us as individuals as we expand our spiritual knowledge; it is the same process we use to help others whose faith may not be as strong as ours. You see, the scriptural charge is to "teach one another." Expanding our own knowledge is not enough. We have been commanded to teach our family, friends, and neighbors in the gospel as well as share the gospel with friends and neighbors, even strangers, who may not be of our faith.<br><br>Let me suggest some ways we come closer to achieving this scriptural mandate to be seekers of truth.<br><br>First, never stop learning. You alone are responsible for your spiritual growth and accumulation of worldly knowledge. The prophets of old and those of today constantly remind us of the importance of reading and studying God's word in the holy scriptures. Such study is essential for our spiritual growth. If you do not now have a study program, set reasonable, attainable goals regarding your study of the standard works. Enhance your spiritual growth through prayer, service, regular church attendance, and service in a calling.<br><br>But the Lord does not want us to only study the scriptures. In section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord seems to be telling us to study history, science, foreign lands, current events, even political science, among other things. He also tells us to study these things out of the best books. The Lord does not want the members of His Church to be ignorant and uninformed. We have a responsibility to know what is going on in our world. We cannot be experts in all things, but an expanded general knowledge will help us to be better parents, citizens, teachers, and members of the Church. Develop habits that will help you seek wisdom from the best books or from your Kindle, iPad, or laptop. Be aware of current events and seek to understand what is happening in our world. Seek to understand all points of view and do not let your opinions be influenced by those talking heads in the media whose shrill rhetoric reinforces divisiveness and fear. Rise above such things, be a bit more objective in your thinking and your judgments, and, above all, move forward with faith, for as the Lord told the Prophet Joseph in Liberty Jail: "Fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever" (D&amp;amp;C 122:9).<br><br>Second, take opportunities to teach your children. John captured the feelings of all parents when he said, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth" (3 John 1:4). In order to help our children grow up in righteousness, prophets of this dispensation have counseled us to pray with our children, hold family home evenings, study the gospel together, and have wholesome family activities.<br><br>The spiritual growth of our children is directly dependent on our efforts to teach them truth and to stand as an example to them. Occasionally we as parents are rewarded for our efforts when we see in them the beginnings of spiritual growth and development. Such was the case years ago with one of our boys when I took my three young sons fishing. Those of you who have had this experience understand that taking small boys out fishing can be quite a project. Young boys are impatient. They often wish to check their hooks to see if they have a fish. In their haste, their fishing lines often become entangled with each other. Patience certainly is a not a virtue of the very young. We arrived very early at a lake near our home in southern Utah and immediately began fishing. We fished all morning with all of the challenges I have recited. I was beginning to wonder if there were any fish in the reservoir, as we had not even had a bite all morning long. It was late in the morning when I realized my five-year-old was missing. I walked back into the tree line near the shore and soon found him behind a large ponderosa pine, kneeling in fervent prayer. I quietly withdrew and returned to the shore. After a few minutes he rejoined his brothers and me.<br><br>"Where have you been, Riley?" I asked.<br><br>"I've been praying, Dad," he responded. "Iprayed I would catch a fish."<br><br>I started to explain to him that perhaps Heavenly Father really didn't care if we caught a fish that morning, but he went on: "I promised Heavenly Father if I could catch a fish, I'd never do drugs!"<br><br>Remember, he was five years old. Now I was worried. I started to pray at that point. We caught just one fish that day. I don't think I need to tell you who caught the fish. It was the little five-year-old. And, honestly, it really wasn't much of a fish, but it was the best-looking fish I have ever seen. I am grateful for a loving Heavenly Father who could take a moment out of a very busy schedule to answer the fervent prayer of a five-year-old. But I was perhaps even more grateful for a young son who was beginning to learn the importance of going to his Heavenly Father for answers to things that were very important to him. You see, I wasn't always going to be with Riley, but his Heavenly Father will always be there to provide answers and to help him through the difficult times. Now he has three young sons of his own, and they do things together. And it is wonderful to observe.<br><br>The Lord has commanded us to "bring up [our] children in light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:40). Much of that responsibility lies in their spiritual growth and development, but we also have the duty to teach them to become responsible citizens and parents. We do our children no favors by neglecting their secular education and development. We must encourage them in their school studies and provide a quiet place where they can study and complete their homework assignments. We must take an interest in their schooling and do our best to support and strengthen our local schools. Reading aloud to our children from the best children's books is a wonderful way to spark their curiosity and stimulate their desire to learn.<br><br>Dinnertime can be a wonderful opportunity to conduct discussions on matters of local or world interest. This provides an example and an opportunity for our children to learn and be motivated to learn more. Well-informed, well-educated children are more likely to grow up successful in their own homes and careers. This success then provides opportunities for them to give meaningful service to others in the Church and in their communities.<br><br>Third, participate in class discussions in Sunday School, priesthood, Relief Society, and other gospel study settings. Read the lessons beforehand and come prepared to share your insights in the class discussion. Participation in a gospel-teaching setting provides added opportunities for the Holy Ghost to act upon those in attendance (see D&amp;amp;C 50:14–22). The Holy Ghost, you see, enhances and quickens learning (see D&amp;amp;C 33:16). The Spirit comes in greater abundance when class members come prepared to act, not just to be acted upon. By participating in class discussions we fulfill the charge in the Doctrine and Covenants to "teach one another." A question or comment expressed during a class discussion can many times be more effective than the most well prepared gospel lecture. We cannot afford to come to gospel classes simply expecting to be entertained. Real learning occurs if we come prepared and then participate in the gospel discussion.<br><br>In conclusion, pay attention to your life experiences, not just the challenges and trials. While there will be many, and these will be great opportunities to learn, appreciate what is happening in your everyday life. Appreciate the opportunity to learn from what you observe and experience. Develop curiosity about the world and all that is in it. Improve your personal study habits of the gospel, particularly the standard works. Likewise, spend time in searching wisdom from the best books so you might be more aware of this wonderful world and all that is in it.<br><br>Remember, we are not in this alone. We have a responsibility to teach our children and to teach and instruct one another. We cannot accomplish this if we don't invest the time and effort to study, prepare, and then engage with our children and those around us both in and out of the Church.<br><br>All of us know of some large family that inadvertently left a child behind after a short stop on a long journey. Perhaps it has happened to you. Most often this occurs because someone forgot to take a count as everyone loaded into the minivan following lunch or a rest stop. Several miles down the freeway the error is discovered, and panicked parents retrace their steps until the little one (by now scarred for life) is found and restored to his mother's arms.<br><br>Such was the case two thousand years ago when Mary and Joseph left their home in Nazareth and journeyed to Jerusalem with their kinfolk and acquaintances for the Feast of the Passover. Three days into their return trip from Jerusalem they discovered Jesus, now 12 years of age, was not in the party. Full of panic, they retraced their three-day journey back to Jerusalem and found Him in the temple. The scriptures tell us He was<br><br><i>sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</i><br><br><i>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</i>[Luke 2:46–47]<br><br>While the Joseph Smith Translation tells us the doctors were hearing Him and asking Him questions, I like to imagine the Savior taking the opportunity to learn and to teach in a gospel discussion in the temple.<br><br>Mary's reaction when they finally found Jesus is understandable: "Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing" (Luke 2:48).<br><br>His response was powerful and probably not surprising to His parents, who knew Him well: "How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke 2:49).<br><br>The business of the Savior was about learning and teaching--a fitting example to all of us. The Lord has promised us that what we learn in this world will be a benefit to us in the worlds to come.<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>Brothers and sisters, it is my prayer that we all may be seekers of the truth in our personal and spiritual lives. I pray as well that we will strive to expand our knowledge of this wonderful world in which we live and that we will use this spiritual and secular knowledge we obtain to bless the lives of our children and all with whom we associate.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Steven E. Snow was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was delivered on 17 August 2010 during Campus Education Week.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>d the Spirit World: Latter-day Saint Teachings - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am honored to have been invited to speak to you today. The topic that I have been assigned to speak on may seem a little strange to some of you for a setting like Campus Education Week, but I hope and pray that it will be both interesting and inspiring. The subject is death.<br><br>Someone once said that life is a terminal illness; no one gets out of it alive. Death is both fascinating and somewhat frightening--­frightening in that there is normal apprehension about it. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "the Lord in his wisdom had implanted the fear of death in every person that [we] might cling to life and thus accomplish the designs of [our] creator" (quoted by Wilford Woodruff in <i>Diary of Charles Lowell Walker,</i> ed. A.Karl Larson and Katherine Miles Larson [Logan: Utah State University Press, 1980], 1:465–66).<br><br>Death is uncharted territory. No matter what our age or circumstance, death will be a new experience for all of us. Some look forward to passing to the other side, where they can be free from pains and sicknesses and toils and troubles or be reunited with a loved one from whom they have been separated--sometimes for decades. On the other hand, some spend their lives in search of a fountain of youth with the hope that they will never die. Still others just ignore death, finding it too unpleasant to think or talk much about. But ignoring it doesn't eliminate it. In fact, death is a vital gateway to immortality--an important milestone along the road of eternal progress. For this reason we should learn all we can about it.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>All men know that they must die. And it is important that we should understand the reasons and causes of our exposure to the vicissitudes of life and of death, and the designs and purposes of God in our coming into the world, our sufferings here, and our departure hence. ... It is but reasonable to suppose that God would reveal something in reference to the matter, and it is a subject we ought to study more than any other. We ought to study it day and night, for the world is ignorant in reference to their true condition and relation. If we have any claim on our Heavenly Father for anything, it is for knowledge on this important subject.</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:50]<br><br>Our Heavenly Father has indeed revealed many things to us about "the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8) and the next estate. From the ­scriptures--both ancient and modern--and the inspired teachings and experiences of prophets, seers, and revelators, we can glimpse beyond the veil of death and gain greater understanding of the role of death and the conditions of the spirit world. The knowledge gained from the restored gospel is both interesting and inspiring, fascinating and comforting.<br><br>While attending the funeral of a friend, Presi­dent GordonB. Hinckley penned a poem about death that speaks of this comfort and knowledge. I have loved this poem from the first time I read it, but I was deeply touched by the musical rendition of it composed by Janice Kapp Perry that was sung by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir at President Hinckley's funeral. The first stanza goes like this:<br><br><i>What is this thing that men call death,</i><br><i>This quiet passing in the night?</i><br><i>'Tis not the end, but genesis</i><br><i>Of better worlds and greater light.</i><br>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/05/the-empty-tomb-bore-testimony?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"The Empty Tomb Bore Testimony,"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> May 1988; also <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2010/02/what-is-this-thing-man-calls-death?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"What Is This Thing Man Calls Death?"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> February 2010]<br><br>It is of these "better worlds and greater light" that I wish to speak today. I would like to share with you a few of the many important truths we learn about the spirit world through the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. There are three specific questions that I would like to address by letting the words of Restoration scriptures and latter-day prophets and apostles answer them:<br><br>1. What do we as Latter-day Saints uniquely understand regarding the attributes and abilities of the Spirit?<br><br>2. What does the Restoration teach us about the spirit world: where is it, what is it like, and what goes on there?<br><br>3. How does this important latter-day revealed knowledge about death and the spirit world affect our lives right here and now?<br><h2><b>The Attributes and Abilities of the Spirit</b></h2><br>The gospel teaches us that our physical body is indeed the outer shell or tabernacle that houses our immortal spirit. Modern revelation teaches us that "the spirit of man [is] in the likeness of his person" (D&amp;amp;C 77:2).<br><br>In 1909 the First Presidency stated that the body "is only the clothing of the spirit" and that "the spirit of man is in the form of man" ("Editor's Table: The Origin of Man," <i>Improvement Era</i> 8<i>, </i>no. 1 [November 1909]: 78).<br><br>President BoydK. Packer compared the body and the spirit to a glove and a hand. The glove covers the hand, but the hand is the real living part. Death is like taking off the glove (see <i>CR,</i> April 1973, 79).<br><br>President Brigham Young stated, "Take the spirit from the body, and the body is lifeless" (<i>JD</i> 9:287).<br><br>This doctrine helps us understand our feelings when we stand before the open casket bearing the remains of a dear loved one. There is the distinct feeling of "that is not him (or her)." The body of our loved one is not the "real" person we have loved. The "real" person is gone. You can feel it; you can see it!<br><br>The gospel teaches us another important truth about the spirit body: it is perfect, not hampered or hindered by physical defects or disabilities. At death the spirit body is liberated from the adverse effects of aging, disease, or handicaps.<br><br>Elder Orson Pratt taught:<br><br><i>We, as Latter-day Saints, believe that the spirits that occupy these tabernacles have form and likeness similar to the human tabernacle. Of course there may be deformities existing in connection with the outward tabernacle which do not exist in connection with the spirit that inhabits it. These tabernacles become deformed by accident in various ways, sometimes at birth, but this may not altogether or in any degree deform the spirits that dwell within them.</i> [<i>JD</i> 15:242–43]<br><br>President Young said:<br><br><i>I can say with regard to parting with our friends, and going ourselves, that I have been near enough to understand eternity so that I have had to exercise a great deal more faith to desire to live than I ever exercised in my whole life to live. The brightness and glory of the next apartment is inexpressible. It is not encumbered</i> [as we are] <i>here so that when we advance in years we have to be stubbing along and to be careful lest we fall down. ... But yonder, how different! ...</i><br><br><i> . . . Here, we are continually troubled with ills and ailments of various kinds ... ; but in the spirit world we are free from all this and enjoy life, glory, and intelligence.</i> [<i>JD</i> 14:231]<br><br>What a comforting doctrine that is--to know that physical limitations will fall away, that disease and sickness will be nonexistent, and that aging and handicaps will be nowhere to be found.<br><br>From the restored gospel we also learn that thepowers and capacities of the spirit body even surpass those of bodies in the physical world when it comes to communication and feelings, movement and travel, and learning and comprehension. From the Doctrine and Covenants we learn that "spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes" (D&amp;amp;C 131:7). Because of this refined nature, as Elder ParleyP. Pratt taught, spirit matter with "itsrefined particles penetrate amid the other ­elements with greater ease, and meet with less resistance ... than would the more gross ­elements" (<i>JD</i>1:8).<br><br>I am not a physicist, and I don't profess to understand how it all works, but I find the scriptural statements about matter and the statements of early prophets and apostles about spirit capacities fascinating. Take, for example, these amazing statements by President Young:<br><br><i>As quickly as the spirit is unlocked from this house of clay, it is free to travel with lightning speed to any planet, or fixed star, or to the uttermost part of the earth, or to the depths of the sea, </i><b><i>according to the will of Him</i></b> <b><i>who dictates.</i></b> [<i>JD</i> 13:77; emphasis added]<br><br>[Spirits] <i>move with ease and like lightning. If we want to visit Jerusalem, or this, that, or the other place--and I presume we will be permitted if we desire--there we are, looking at its streets. If we want to behold Jerusalem as it was in the days of the Savior; or if we want to see the Garden of Eden as it was when created, there we are, and we see it as it existed spiritually, for it was created first spiritually and then temporally, and spiritually it still remains. ... God has revealed some little things with regard to His movements and power, and the operation and motion of the lightning furnish a fine illustration of the ability and power of the Almighty. ...</i><br><br><i> When we pass into the spirit world we shall possess a measure of this power.</i> [<i>JD</i> 14:231]<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 8:2 the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith that the means whereby God communicates with man is in the mind and in the heart. The spirit of revelation is the divine means of communication not only here in mortality but also in the next life. Such divine communication transcends words and language.<br><br>Elder Orson Pratt taught:<br><br><i>How do you suppose that spirits after they leave these bodies, communicate one with another? Do they communicate their ideas by the actual vibrations of the atmosphere the same as we do? I think not. I think if we could be made acquainted with the kind of language by which spirits converse with spirits, we would find that ... they have undoubtedly a more refined system among them of communicating their ideas. ...</i><br><br><i> Well inquires one, "Can you imagine up any such system, or language in this world?"</i> [<i>JD</i> 3:100–101]<br><br>Elder Pratt then went on to answer his own question:<br><br><i>I can imagine up one, but it cannot be made practicable here, from the fact that the mind of man is unable to use it. For instance, the Book of Mormon tells us, that the angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost, and man when under the influence of it, speaks the language of angels. Why does he speak in this language? Because the Holy Ghost suggests the ideas which he speaks; and it gives him utterance to convey them to the people. ... Suppose, instead of having arbitrary sounds, such as we have here, to communicate these ideas, that the Holy Ghost itself, through a certain process and power, should enable him to unfold that knowledge to another spirit, all in an instant.</i> [<i>JD</i> 3:101]<br><br>With such perfect communication in that realm, no wonder those who come back from a spirit-world encounter have difficulty putting into human words what they learned, what they heard, what they felt, and what they experienced.<br><br>Another important capacity of the spirit body is the ability to learn and comprehend. We know that the spirit world is a place of learning. The gospel teaches us that the most important learning is acquired though spiritual means. President Young stated, "I shall not cease learning while I live, nor when I arrive in the spirit-world; but shall there learn with greater facility" (<i>JD</i> 8:10).<br><br>Likewise, Elder Orson Pratt taught that our ability to absorb, comprehend, and remember information will be "greatly enlarged" (<i>JD</i> 2:243). He said:<br><br><i>I believe we shall be freed, in the next world, in a great measure, from these narrow, contracted methods of thinking. Instead of thinking in one channel, and following up one certain course of reasoning to find a certain truth, knowledge will rush in from all quarters; it will come in like the light which flows from the sun, penetrating every part, informing the spirit, and giving understanding concerning ten thousand things at the same time; and the mind will be capable of receiving and retaining all.</i> [<i>JD</i> 2:246]<br><br>I look forward to that enhanced capacity to learn. In addition, there is one capacity of spirit learning that really appeals to me: not only will I learn faster and better, but I will also actually remember it! Elder Orson Pratt taught:<br><br><i>We read or learn a thing by observation yesterday, and today or tomorrow it is gone.</i> [Can you relate to that?] ... <i>Some of the knowledge we receive here at one time becomes so completely obliterated, through the weakness</i> [of our physical bodies], <i>that we cannot call it to mind, no association of ideas will again suggest it to our minds; it is gone, erased, eradicated from the tablet of our memories.</i> [Why?] ... <i>There is imperfection in the organization of the flesh and bones, and in things pertaining to the tabernacle; it is this that erases from our memory many things that would be useful. ... It is not so with the spirit when it is released from this tabernacle.</i><br><br><i> ... Wait until these mortal bodies are laid in the tomb ...; then is the time we shall have the most vivid knowledge</i> [and memory]. [<i>JD</i> 2:239]<br><br>These descriptions of the learning that takes place in the spirit world illustrate perfectly what the Prophet Joseph Smith was referring to when he declared, "Could you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject" (<i>Teachings,</i> 324).<br><h2><b>Where the Spirit World Is and What It Is Like</b></h2><br>We have talked about the nature of our ­spirits--what they are like and what they can do. Now let us address the issue of the spirit world, the habitation of our immortal spirits when they leave our bodies at death.<br><br>People often think of the spirit world, or heaven, as being up in the sky or out in outer space somewhere. From the Restoration of the ­gospel, we know that is not the case.<br><br>President Young said:<br><br><i>Where is the spirit world? It is right here. Do the good and evil spirits go together? Yes, they do. ... Do they go to the sun</i> [or some other planet]<i>? No. Do they go beyond the boundaries of this organized earth? No, they do not. They are brought forth upon this earth for the express purpose of inhabiting it to all eternity.</i> [<i>JD</i>3:369]<br><br>How is it that the spirit world can be right here on this earth? Is it like a different dimension? Elder ParleyP. Pratt perhaps explained it best, ­saying that the spirit world is here on the very planet where we were born; or, in other words,<br><br><i>the earth and other planets of a like sphere, have their inward or spiritual spheres, as well as their outward, ortemporal. The one is peopled by temporal ­tabernacles, and the other by spirits. A vail is drawn between the one sphere and the other, whereby all the objects in the spiritual sphere are rendered invisible to those in the temporal.</i> [<i>Key to the Science of Theology,</i> 3rd ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Steam Printing Establishment, 1874), 129–30]<br><br>These statements illustrate so well why we speak of death as "passing through the veil." Ilikethe imagery of a veil rather than a wall or a faraway planet. The spirit world is right here around us.<br><br>President JosephF. Smith declared:<br><br><i>I believe we move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. We are not separate from them. ... Therefore, I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever.</i> [<i>CR,</i> April 1916, 2–3]<br><br>The Lord revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Doctrine and Covenants 77:2</span></a> that "that which is temporal [is] in the likeness of that which is spiritual." From this we can assume that the spirit world is much like this world.<br><br>President Young, who had himself seen the spirit world on more than one occasion, declared:<br><br><i>When you are in the spirit world, everything there will appear as natural as things now do. Spirits will be familiar with spirits in the spirit world--will converse, behold, and exercise every variety of communication one with another as familiarly and naturally as while here in tabernacles. There, as here, all things will be natural, and you will understand them as you now understand natural things.</i> [<i>JD</i> 7:239]<br><br>While the scriptures and prophets teach us that the spirit world will appear natural to us and be much like this world, I think we can assume that it will be what I like to call "natural plus," or, as Joseph Smith taught, "It will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.2?lang=eng#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 130:2</span></a>). I guess we could compare it to the quality of regular television broadcasts in years past with the best high-definition broadcasts of today.<br><br>JedediahM. Grant, counselor to President Young and father to President HeberJ. Grant, saw the spirit world shortly before his death and recounted what he saw to President HeberC. Kimball:<br><br><i>Brother Heber, I have been into the spirit world two nights in succession, and, of all the dreads that ever came across me, the worst was to have to again return to my body, though I had to do it. </i>[<i>JD</i> 4:135]<br><br>President Kimball shared more of President JedediahM. Grant's experience:<br><br><i> He also spoke of the buildings he saw there, remarking that the Lord gave Solomon wisdom and poured gold and silver into his hands that he might display his skill and ability, and said that the temple erected by Solomon was much inferior to the most ordinary buildings he saw in the spirit world.</i><br><br><i>In regard to gardens, says brother Grant, "I have seen good gardens on this earth, but I never saw any to compare with those that were there. I saw flowers of numerous kinds, and some with from fifty to a hundred different colored flowers growing upon one stalk." We have many kinds of flowers on the earth, and I suppose those very articles came from heaven, or they would not be here. ...</i><br><br><i>After speaking of the gardens and the beauty of every thing there, brother Grant said that he felt extremely sorrowful at having to leave so beautiful a place and come back to earth, for he looked upon his body with loathing, but was obliged to enter it again.</i> [<i>JD</i> 4:136]<br><br>President Grant's experience is strikingly similar to many of the experiences and descriptions given by others, including President Young. No wonder President Young said that it took far greater faith than he had ever before exercised for him to desire to continue to live in mortality (see <i>JD</i> 14:231).<br><br>In <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.8?lang=eng#7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Doctrine and Covenants 132:8</span></a>, the Lord declared, "Behold, mine house is a house of order ... and not a house of confusion." Order and organization are certainly important characteristics in the spirit world paradise.<br><br>President EzraTaft Benson taught:<br><br><i>Righteous spirits are close by us. They are organized according to priesthood order in family organizations as we are here; only there they exist in a more perfect order. This was revealed to the Prophet Joseph.</i> [<i>TETB,</i> 35–36]<br><br>President Heber C. Kimball related how President Jedediah Grant also marveled at the extensive order and organization in the spirit world:<br><br><i>But O, ... the order and government that were there! When in the spirit world, I saw the order of righteous men and women; beheld them organized in their several grades, and there appeared to be no obstruction to my vision; I could see every man and woman in their grade and order. I looked to see whether there was any disorder there, but there was none. ... The people ... were organized in family capacities; and when </i>[I]<i> looked at them </i>[I] <i>saw grade after grade, and all were organized and in perfect harmony.</i> [<i>JD</i> 4:135–36]<br><br>Alma taught that, for the righteous, the spirit world will be a paradise--"a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.12?lang=eng#11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Alma 40:12</span></a>). I have often wondered how we can be in a place of rest and yet be busy and deeply involved in intense activity. It reminds me of an account that one of my colleagues shared with me. His aged mother-in-law, who had been widowed for decades, saw into the spirit world shortly before her passing. She told the family that she had seen departed family members, including her beloved husband.<br><br>"Well, doesn't that make you want to go join them?" a daughter asked her.<br><br>She responded, "Oh, no. They were so busy. It made me tired watching them."<br><br>President Wilford Woodruff learned why people on the other side are so busy through a vision he received of the spirit world in which he spoke with the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br><br><i>I saw him at the door of the temple in heaven. He came and spoke to me. He said he could not stop to talk with me because he was in a hurry. The next man I met was Father Smith </i>[JosephSr.]<i>; he could not talk with me because he was in a hurry. I met half a dozen brethren who had held high positions on earth, and none of them could stop to talk with me because they were in a hurry. I was much astonished. By and by I saw the Prophet again, and I got the privilege to ask him a question. "Now," said I, "I want to know why you are in a hurry. I have been in a hurry all through my life; but I expected my hurry would be over when I got into the kingdom of heaven, if I ever did." Joseph said: "I will tell you, Brother Woodruff. Every dispensation that has had the Priesthood on the earth and has gone into the celestial kingdom, has had a certain amount of work to do to prepare to go to the earth with the Savior when He goes to reign on the earth. Each dispensation has had ample time to do this work. We have not. We are the last dispensation, and so much work has to be done, and we need to be in a hurry in order to accomplish it."</i> ["Discourse Delivered at the Weber Stake Conference, Ogden, Monday, October 19th, 1896," <i>Deseret Weekly,</i> 7 November 1896, 642–43; also <i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i> sel. G.Homer Durham (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1946), 288–89]<br><br><i>Hurry</i> is the operative word. <i>Urgency</i> would describe the work on the other side of the veil. We know what that work is in which the righteous spirits are so busily engaged. It is the preaching ofthe gospel of Jesus Christ--proclaiming, as Isaiah described it, "liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/61.1?lang=eng#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Isaiah 61:1</span></a>).<br><br>In one of the great revelations of the Restoration, President JosephF. Smith saw in vision the opening of this vital work in the world of the spirits. On October 3, 1918, President Smith sat in his room pondering the scriptures when, as he said, "the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.11?lang=eng#10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 138:11</span></a>). Of the righteous spirits, President Smith said:<br><br><i>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.</i><br><br><i>They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death. ...</i><br><br><i>While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful;</i><br><br><i>And there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from individual sins on conditions of repentance.</i><br><br><i>But unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant who had defiled themselves while in the flesh, his voice was not raised;</i><br><br><i>Neither did the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the warnings of the ancient prophets behold his presence, nor look upon his face.</i><br><br><i>Where these were, darkness reigned, but among the righteous there was peace.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.15-16,18-22?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 138:15–16, 18–22</span></a>]<br><br>After seeing in vision the Savior's ministry among the righteous in the spirit world, President Smith wondered how the gospel would go forth to all the other spirits in that realm. He then saw how the Lord<br><br><i>organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138.30?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 138:30</span></a>]<br><br>That is the urgent work in which all faithful spirits will find themselves engaged when they depart this life and enter into the world of the spirits. There is no doubt in my mind that the work of the Lord in the spirit world follows much the same pattern as the work of the Lord in this life--leading, teaching, fellowshipping, ­strengthening--all under the direction of the priesthood.<br><br>President Woodruff declared:<br><br><i>The same Priesthood exists on the other side of the vail. Every man who is faithful in his quorum here will join his quorum there. When a man dies and his body is laid in the tomb, he does not lose his position. The Prophet Joseph Smith held the keys of this dispensation on this side of the vail, and he will hold them throughout the countless ages of eternity. He went into the spirit world to unlock the prison doors and to preach the Gospel to the millions of spirits who are in darkness, and every Apostle, every Seventy </i>[every high priest],<i> every Elder, etc., who has died in the faith as soon as he passes to the other side of the vail, enters into the work of the ministry, and there is a thousand times more to preach there than there is here.</i> [<i>JD</i> 22:333–34; also <i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,</i> 77]<br><br>President Woodruff highlighted the work in the spirit world done by priesthood holders. But we know that much of the Lord's work on this side of the veil is also done by faithful sisters, and it is the same on the other side.<br><br>President JosephF. Smith observed:<br><br><i>Among all these millions and thousands of ­millions of spirits that have lived in the earth and have passed away, from generation to generation, since the beginning of the world, without the knowledge of the Gospel--among them you may count that at least one-half are women. Who is going to preach the Gospel to the women? Who is going to carry the testimony of Jesus Christ to the hearts of the women who have passed away without a knowledge of the Gospel? Well, to my mind, it is simple thing.</i> [Faithful sisters] <i>will be fully authorized and empowered to preach the Gospel and minister to the women while the elders and prophets are preaching it to the men. </i><b><i>The things we experience here are typical of the things of God and the life beyond us.</i></b> ["Address of President JosephF. Smith Delivered at the Funeral Services of Sister MaryA. Freeze," <i>Young Woman's Journal</i> 23, no. 3 (March 1912): 130; emphasis added]<br><br>Because of the importance and urgency of the work of the Lord in the spirit world, there are times when faithful men and women are called to that work before we might think that they are ready to die. No righteous person dies "before their time." But just like calls here in mortality, calls to the other side sometimes are unexpected and come at what we may think are inopportune times.<br><br>Elder NealA. Maxwell gave an insightful observation of this fact:<br><br><i>A mortal life may need to be "shortened" by twenty years as we might view it--but if so, it may be done in order for special services to be rendered by that individual in the spirit world, services that will benefit thousands of new neighbors.</i> [<i>All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience</i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1979), 99]<br><br>Elder Maxwell also said:<br><br><i>On the other side of the veil, there are perhaps seventy billion people. They need the same gospel, and releases occur here to aid the Lord's work there. Each release of a righteous individual from this life is also a call to new labors. Those who have true hope understand this.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, though we miss the departed righteous so much here, hundreds may feel their touch there. One day, those hundreds will thank the bereaved for gracefully forgoing the extended association with choice individuals here, in order that they could help hundreds there. In God's ecology, talent and love are never wasted.</i> [<i>Notwithstanding My Weakness </i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1981), 55]<br><br>Certainly Elder Maxwell was one of those who died before we were ready to let him go. He now continues to serve and bless others on the other side of the veil. We know of many others whose labors continue, though they are transferred to a different mission field. Though the work of the Lord will be much the same on that side of the veil, the success attending it will be much greater there than it is here.<br><br>President Lorenzo Snow said:<br><br><i>I believe, strongly too, that when the Gospel is preached to the spirits in prison, the success attending that preaching will be far greater than that attending the preaching of our Elders in this life. I believe there will be very few indeed of those spirits who will not gladly receive the Gospel when it is carried to them. The circumstances there will be a thousand times more favorable.</i> ["Discourse by President Lorenzo Snow," <i>Millennial Star</i> 56, no. 4 (22 January 1894):50]<br><br>One of the great heartaches that my mother and father experienced in this life was the death of a child. Next to the graves of my mom and dad is a small grave that holds the earthly remains of my brother whom I never knew in mortality. He died as a four-day-old baby.<br><br>What is the spirit world like for him? What is he doing now? I am sure that every parent who has lost a child has wondered those same things. The restored gospel gives us some valuable insight and profound comfort regarding this subject.<br><br>President JosephF. Smith declared:<br><br><i>The spirits of our children are immortal before they come to us, and their spirits, after bodily death, are like they were before they came. They are as they would have appeared if they had lived in the flesh, to grow to maturity, or to develop their physical bodies to the full stature of their spirits. If you see one of your children that has passed away it may appear to you in the form in which you would recognize it, the form of ­childhood; but if it came to you as a messenger bearing some important truth, it would perhaps come ... in the ­stature of full-grown manhood</i> [or womanhood]. ...<br><br><i>Father</i> [remember that President Smith's father was Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch of the Church and the brother of the Prophet Joseph] [taught] <i>that the Spirit of Jesus Christ was full-grown before he was born into the world; and so our children were full-grown and possessed their full stature in the spirit, before they entered mortality.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 455]<br><br>I find that so interesting. My brother who died as a baby is now a full-grown, spiritually mature man in the spirit world. If I were to see him today, that is how he would appear. I believe that my brother who died as a baby was indeed, as the Prophet Joseph Smith taught concerning little ­children who die before accountability, "too pure, too lovely, to live on earth" (<i>HC</i> 4:553). That doctrine comforts grieving mothers and fathers. Iknow it comforted my mother.<br><br>In light of what the prophets have declared, I believe that my parents, at their deaths, were reunited with their son and are laboring side by side with him in the great work of the Lord in the spirit world--sharing the gospel, teaching, and blessing and strengthening others--and that my brother will continue that great service until the morning of the First Resurrection. Then my mother and father will realize another one of the most comforting promises of the gospel: they will be able to raise my brother in the Resurrection. When they come forth on the morning of the First Resurrection, my mother will once again have a babe in arms to love and nurture and rear.<br><br>President JosephF. Smith stated:<br><br><i>Joseph Smith declared that the mother who laid down her little child, being deprived of the privilege, the joy, and the satisfaction of bringing it up to manhood or womanhood in this world, would, after the resurrection, have all the joy, satisfaction and pleasure, </i><b><i>and even more than it would have been possible to have had in mortality,</i></b><i> in seeing her child grow to the full measure of the stature of its spirit.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 453; emphasis added]<br><br>I can only imagine the glorious reunion of my parents with their long-departed son. They had been separated for nearly sixty years. Reunion with loved ones is one of the most significant and most joyful conditions of the spirit world. The Prophet Joseph Smith himself looked forward to the joyful reunion with his loved ones on the other side of the veil of death. He said:<br><br><i> I have a father, brothers, children, and friends who have gone to a world of spirits. They are only absent for a moment. They are in the spirit, and we shall soon meet again. ... When we depart</i> [from this life], <i>we shall hail our mothers, fathers, friends, and all whom we love, who have fallen asleep in Jesus. ... It will be an eternity of felicity.</i> [<i>HC</i> 6:316]<br><br>President Young said:<br><br><i> We have more friends behind the vail than on this side, and they will hail us more joyfully than you were ever welcomed by your parents and friends in this world; and you will rejoice more when you meet them than you ever rejoiced to see a friend in this life.</i> [<i>JD</i> 6:349]<br><br>The doctrine of the spirit world being a place of joyous and loving reunion with family and friends is a glorious and comforting doctrine. President JosephF. Smith said of this doctrine, "What is there for any religion superior to that? I know of nothing." He also said:<br><br><i>What is more desirable than that we should meet with our fathers and our mothers, with our brethren and our sisters, with our wives and our children, with our beloved associates and kindred in the spirit world, knowing each other, identifying each other ... by the associations that familiarize each to the other in mortal life? What do you want better than that?</i> ["The Resurrection," <i>Liahona: The Elders' Journal</i> 6, no. 8 (8 August 1908): 178]<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 130:2 we read that the "same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there, only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now enjoy."<br><br>What does that mean? What is sociality? It seems to indicate that the same kinds of social interactions and feelings that we enjoy here in this life will be in that realm--only to a greater and more glorious degree. I hope that means fun and laughter as well as rejoicing and praising. My sociality involves joking and teasing and a lot of laughing and enthusiastic cheering for my favorite sports teams. I hope that continues on the other side.<br><br>I once heard someone say, "I am not afraid of death. It is what I have to do to get there that scares me."<br><br>President Young said that when we pass through the veil, we will view death as one of life's great blessings, not something to be dreaded. He said:<br><br><i>If we could see things as they are, and as we shall see and understand them, this dark shadow and valley</i> [of death] <i>is so trifling that we shall turn round and look upon it and think, when we have crossed it, why this is the greatest advantage of my whole existence, for I have passed from a state of sorrow, grief, mourning, woe, misery, pain, anguish and disappointment into a state of existence where I can enjoy life to the fullest extent as far as that can be done without a body. My spirit is set free, I thirst no more, I want to sleep no more, I hunger no more, I tire no more, I run, I walk, I labor, Igo, I come, I do this, I do that, whatever is required of me, nothing like pain or weariness, I am full of life, full of vigor, and I enjoy the presence of my heavenly Father, by the power of his Spirit.</i> [<i>JD</i> 17:142]<br><br>Wow! Isn't that appealing? Doesn't that just make you want to die? It reminds me of what a colleague once said to me: "When we get over to the other side and see how good things are there, we will wonder why we ate so much whole wheat!"<br><h2><b>How This Knowledge Affects Our Lives</b></h2><br>Now, to my last point: how a uniquely Latter-day Saint view of death and the spirit world should affect our lives today. President HaroldB. Lee once quoted a man he met at a stake conference: "What we are hereafter depends on what we are after here" ("Place of Mothers in the Plan of Teaching the Gospel in the Home," <i>Relief Society Magazine </i>51<i>, </i>no. 12 [December 1964]: 9; also <i>The Teachings of Harold B. Lee,</i> ed. ClydeJ. Williams [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996], 75). I like that play on words. Let me say it in a little different way: what we know about the hereafter can influence what we do and become hereafter. Or there is another way of saying it: our knowledge of what it will be like <i>then</i> and <i>there</i> helps us to know what we should be like <i>here</i> and <i>now.</i><br><br>The restored gospel of Jesus Christ doesn't just teach us about and prepare us for eternity; it also blesses and enriches our lives right now. That is certainly true with regard to the doctrine of death and the spirit world. The gospel insights about <i>dying</i> teach us a great deal about <i>living.</i> The scriptures teach that "if ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">D&amp;amp;C 38:30</span></a>).<br><br>Not only biologically but spiritually we begin preparation for death the moment we are born. How we live is how we prepare.<br><br>The early Christian father and Bible translator Jerome taught in the fourth century, "Begin to be now what you will be hereafter" (Letter XXII, to Eustochium, "The Virgin's Profession," AD 384).<br><br>Epictetus, the first-century Greek philosopher, likewise taught, "Let death ... be daily before your eyes...; and you will never entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything" (<i>Enchiridion </i>[AD c. 125], XXI).<br><br>I like that phrase--"let death be daily before your eyes." It may sound morbid to say, "Think about death all the time," but we can "let death be daily before our eyes" by keeping our eyes focused on eternity and on those things that ­matter most.<br><br>In our day the Lord declared, "Let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds" (D&amp;amp;C 43:34). That is the way whereby we are not only better prepared to die but also better equipped to really live.<br><br>There are two places in particular where we feel the closeness of the spirit world and where we are reminded most profoundly of the need to prepare for death: at funerals and in the temple.<br><br>First, funerals. My wife, Wendy, loves funerals. I tease her that she ought to read the obituaries in the newspaper and then just randomly select a funeral to attend. Like "an apple a day," she could do a funeral a day. She probably would do that--and really enjoy it.<br><br>At funerals our hearts are more tender and our minds are more focused on death. I have felt the Spirit powerfully testifying of the truths of the gospel at funerals. For me, there is probably more spiritual introspection at a funeral service than at any other time--except maybe during the administration of the sacrament.<br><br>Speaking at a funeral, President HowardW. Hunter said:<br><br><i>In the quiet of this chapel today, our souls have been on their knees.</i> [Let me interject at this point. I love the phrase "our souls have been on their knees." Ireally like that imagery.] <i>We have contemplated the uncertainties of life and the certainty of death. Each of us in his turn will follow the same course--only the point of time is the difference. Will we be ready? Will the things we intend to accomplish be completed? Will we make right the little wrongs and replace the harsh words with kindness before our call comes? Will we accept the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ by following his teachings, keeping his commandments, being of service to our fellowman, ready to enter the tomb, partake of the glorious resurrection, and stand at the judgment as worthy servants?</i> [<i>The Teachings of Howard</i><i>W. Hunter,</i> ed. ClydeJ. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1997), 15–16]<br><br>Those are important questions that we all need to frequently consider. Not long ago I attended the funeral service of a dear friend and colleague. It was deeply moving, and the Spirit was there in rich abundance. Most touching were the tributes paid by the children. There was no mention of his positions of prominence or his scholarly publications. Little was said of his career contributions. Instead the focus was on his love for others; his thoughtfulness and kindness; his role as husband, father, and grandfather; and, most of all, his faith and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ. (I was so impressed that I wondered if I could "rent" his children to give the same tributes at my funeral!)<br><br>As I left that funeral, I wondered what my ­family and friends would say about me. What mark in this world am I leaving in the hearts and lives of those around me? Are my priorities right? Am I putting first things first, or am I distracted and diverted, pursuing things that, when the moment of death comes, will not seem very important atall?<br><br>As I took a spiritual inventory of my life, I realized that every day, every moment, I am writing my own eulogy. My words, my actions, my thoughts, and my love are being "written" in my heart and soul and are likewise being recorded in the hearts of my family and fellowmen. If I don't like how that eulogy is being written, then I need to change it, and I can do that through repentance and through striving to do better and be better. That is one of the great blessings of the gospel. Daily preparing for <i>dying,</i> as strange as that may sound, powerfully affects our daily <i>living.</i> As Shakespeare wrote, "Be [still prepared] for death; either death <i>or</i> life / Shall thereby be the sweeter" (<i>Measure for Measure,</i> act 3, scene 1, lines 5–6; emphasis added).<br><br>Now the second place: temples. I have heard it said that temples are where heaven and earth meet--the crossroad between mortality and eternity. Everything we do in the temple is focused on preparing for the next life <i>and</i> enriching our lives here and now. Our minds are continually centered on the relationship between the two. Think about it: from picking up the name of a deceased person for whom we are doing the work to passing through the veil, we are continually reminded in the temple about death and how it is a gateway to immortality and eternal life. Even as we are focused on that next life and on those in the spirit world, we are also reminded by instruction and covenant of the importance of this life and how living in harmony with those eternal principles will bless our own lives and families right here and now.<br><br>What a blessing it is to have temples and temple ordinances to keep our minds centered on the things of eternity. President Hinckley taught that if we worthily attend the temple on a regular basis, "we will be a better people, we will be better fathers and husbands, we will be better wives and mothers." He then added this: "I know your lives are busy. I know that you have much to do. But I make you a promise that if you will go to the house of the Lord, you will be blessed, <i>life will be better for you</i>" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1997/07/excerpts-from-recent-addresses-of-president-gordon-b-hinckley?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Excerpts from Recent Addresses of President GordonB. Hinckley,"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> July 1997; emphasis added).<br><br>President Hinckley's promise about temples reminds me of a principle that I often teach my students. I like to call it "the principle of indirection." You find it in the scriptures a great deal--it's just not called that. The principle works this way: You focus on one thing, and another thing results, kind of like a boomerang. You throw it one direction, and it comes back in another.<br><br>The most famous example in the scriptures ofthis is Matthew 10:39: "He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." This is an interesting irony. Those who spend their lives focused solely on this life--living for now, giving little thought about what lies beyond--will come to realize that they have lost the substance while seeking after the shadow (see Charles Churchill, "Dedication to Churchill's Sermons" [1765], line 157).<br><br>In a spiritual way, focusing only on <i>today</i> diminishes our <i>tomorrow.</i> In contrast, if we prepare for death each day of our lives, we will not only obtain eternal life--"better worlds and greater light"--but also our here and now will be abundantly enhanced (in Hinckley, "Empty Tomb"; also Hinckley, "What Is This Thing?").<br><br>Several years ago, as my parents were getting older and slowing down considerably, I invited them to come and visit us in Utah. Mother's health wasn't that great, and she responded, "I don't know if we can come next week because I don't know what next week will bring. We are just ­living day by day."<br><br>I thought a great deal about that phrase: "We are just living day by day." Each of us--whether we are nine or ninety--is, in reality, living day by day. I may have plans and goals for weeks and months and years to come, but, nonetheless, my life is in the Lord's hands. For me, the phrase "living day by day" doesn't mean that I don't have a long-range view. In fact, it is just the opposite. Living day by day means doing everything each day with an eternal perspective--­recognizing that <i>today</i> might be <i>the</i> day when I am called home.<br><br>Alma posed a series of questions that should guide our daily introspection:<br><br><i>Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ ...?</i><br><br><i>Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly. ...</i><br><br>. . . <i>Is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and Iwould that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come. ...</i><br><br>. . . <i>Is there one among you that doth make a mock ofhis brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?</i><br><br><i>Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent or he cannot besaved!</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.27-31?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">Alma 5:27–31</span></a>]<br><br>As I consider these questions, think about my own mortality, and consider how I need to daily prepare for death, I am reminded of the words of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who counseled the Saints: "Search your hearts, and see if you are like God. I have searched mine, and feel to repent of all my sins" (<i>Teachings,</i> 216). With repentance should come a reexamination of our priorities in life.<br><br>An understanding of the doctrine of death andthe spirit world, as revealed in these last days through the Restoration, inspires me to repent, reexamine my priorities, and reorder them as necessary. But there is something else it does for me--and that word also starts with the letter <i>R--rejoice.</i> Because of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, I rejoice in my understanding of the purpose of this estate and the meaning of death. I rejoice to know that death is not the end of life and love. I rejoice to know that my loved ones whom I am separated from for a season are not far from me. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that our departed loved ones "are not far from us" and that they continue to feel deeply about us (<i>Teachings,</i> 326).<br><br>I am reminded of a story about Elder BruceR. McConkie's father, Oscar McConkieSr. As he was close to death, Brother McConkie called his family together to express his love and to give some departing counsel. He told them, "I am going to die. When I die, I shall not cease to love you. I shall not cease to pray for you. I shall not cease to labor in your behalf" (quoted in Robert L. Millet, <i>When a Child Wanders</i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1996], 133).<br><br>It makes perfect sense to me that just as we continue to think about and love those who are separated from us by death, they continue to think about and love us.<br><br>President JosephF. Smith taught:<br><br><i>Sometimes the Lord expands our vision from this point of view and this side of the veil, that we feel and seem to realize that we can look beyond the thin veil which separates us from that other sphere. ... We begin to realize more and more fully, as we become acquainted with the principles of the gospel, as they have been revealed anew in this dispensation, that we are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends and associates and co-laborers who have preceded us into the spirit world. We cannot forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are associated and united to them by ties that we cannot break, that we cannot dissolve or free ourselves from. ... For now they see the dangers that beset us; they can comprehend better than ever before, the weaknesses that are liable to mislead us into dark and forbidden paths. They see the temptations and the evils that beset us in life, and the proneness of mortal beings to yield to temptation and to wrong doing; hence their solicitude for us and their love for us and their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel for ourselves.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 430–31]<br><br>What a comforting thought to know that we are not alone in facing our challenges or in dealing with our difficulties.<br><br>President Benson testified:<br><br><i>There are people over there who are pulling for us--­people who have faith in us and who have great hopes for us, who are hoping and praying that we will measure up--our loved ones (parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, and friends) who have passed on.</i> [<i>TETB,</i>31]<br><br>In Doctrine and Covenants 84:88 the Lord promised: "I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, <i>and mine angels round about you, to bear you up</i>" (emphasis added). You have probably read that passage many times, as I have. Perhaps you have wondered too, who are those angels? Because of the restored gospel's teachings about the spirit world and eternal families, we know the answer.<br><br>President JosephF. Smith taught it clearly. He said:<br><br><i>When messengers are sent to minister to the inhabitants of this earth, they are not strangers, but from the ranks of our kindred </i>[and]<i> friends. ... In like manner our fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and friends who have passed away from this earth, having been faithful, and worthy to enjoy these rights and privileges, may have a mission given them to visit their relatives and friends upon the earth again, bringing from the divine Presence messages of love, of warning, or reproof and instruction, to those whom they had learned to love in the flesh.</i> [<i>GD,</i> 435–36]<br><br>That makes perfect sense. If there is to be help from beyond the veil, it will come from those who know and love us best and who desire to help us most. Do you realize what a blessing that can be to us as parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters? Sometimes we know when the veil is being parted on our behalf, but most times we don't. Whether that help is seen or unseen, it is real.<br><br>Speaking specifically to parents who have children who have strayed from the path, President JamesE. Faust, not long before his own death, gave this comforting assurance:<br><br><i>Perhaps in this life we are not given to fully understand how enduring the sealing cords of righteous parents are to their children. It may very well be that there are more helpful sources at work than we know. I believe there is a strong familial pull as the influence of beloved ancestors continues with us from the other side of the veil.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2003/05/dear-are-the-sheep-that-have-wandered?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">"Dear Are the Sheep That Have Wandered,"</span></a> <i>Ensign,</i> May 2003]<br><br>At the beginning of this talk I shared with you the first stanza of President Hinckley's poem. Let me share it again and this time give you the rest of President Hinckley's inspired words:<br><br><i>What is this thing that men call death,</i><br><i>This quiet passing in the night?</i><br><i>'Tis not the end, but genesis</i><br><i>Of better worlds and greater light.</i><br><br><i>O God, touch Thou my aching heart,</i><br><i>And calm my troubled, haunting fears.</i><br><i>Let hope and faith, transcendent, pure,</i><br><i>Give strength and peace beyond my tears.</i><br><br><i>There is no death, but only change</i><br><i>With recompense for victory won;</i><br><i>The gift of Him who loved all men,</i><br><i>The Son of God, the Holy One.</i><br>[Hinckley, "Empty Tomb"; also Hinckley, "What Is This Thing?"]<br><br>I rejoice with you in knowing that there is indeed strength and peace beyond our tears. Irejoice in and bear testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ. I know He lives. I know that because He lives there is no death but only change and "better worlds and greater light." How grateful I am for the peace the gospel brings. I add my testimony to the words of the apostle Paul:<br><br><i>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? ...</i><br><br><i>. . . Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> [<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.55,57?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #33cccc;">1 Corinthians 15:55, 57</span></a>]<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br>BrentL.

<h1> - Cecil O. Samuelson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Once again it is my happy privilege to welcome you to our annual university conference and to wish each of you an enthusiastic Happy New Year! While that statement would seem strange to those outside the academic tradition, for us this is the beginning of another new year in the university calendar. I'm excited for the opportunities that await us and hope you feel the same.<br><br>For some of you, this is your first experience with us in this setting, and we are grateful that you have joined us. While you are fewer in number than in some years because of the economic realities we face, your importance to the success and progress of the university is magnified. We also welcome back those of you who have been away on missions, leaves, or otherassignments.<br><br>Some of you have been coming here for many years, and we are most appreciative of your splendid, consistent, and productive contributions. We especially are pleased to see retirees and companions with us as well. All members of this community appreciably add to the excellence, spirit, and accomplishments of this wonderful institution initiated and sustained by the Lord's servants.<br><br>Almost 11 years ago, in the October 1999 general conference of the Church, President Gordon B. Hinckley addressed the priesthood session by discussing "why we do some of the things we do." Of the several topics he covered that evening, the first on his list was to discuss this question: Why does the Church sponsor BYU? Even though at that time I had absolutely no inkling that my current responsibility would ever be mine, I was very interested in what he said, and I recommend his address to you in its entirety. Since my appointment Ihave reflected on this question regularly and frequently, and it continues to inform me and us in our decisions, our priorities, our commitments, and our efforts. Some may remember that I have spoken about this on other occasions.<br><br>First, President Hinckley noted the Church's sponsorship of BYU has "a doctrinal root." The scriptures he quoted will be largely familiar to this group, and our Church's history from the beginning with respect to education is likewise well known.<br><br>Second, even though the Church is not able to provide a university education to more than a small fraction of worthy Church members, it is important to do the most we can. Said he, "The number who can be accommodated on campus is finite, but the influence of the university is infinite." Not only do our graduates bless the lives of others throughout the world, but BYU has "brought much favorable notice to the Church." He went on to give several examples that you easily recognize.<sup>1</sup><br><br>While President Hinckley--and, I might add, our current First Presidency feels the same way--recognized how extremely expensive this institution is to the Church, he also was clear in his endorsement of continued support and recognition of the tremendous contribution Brigham Young University makes to the cause of the Church. This confidence is inspiring but also daunting as we consider together our possibilities and responsibilities at the start of the new academic year.<br><br>Our university conference theme this year is taken from Doctrine and Covenants 88:122: "That All May Be Edified of All." This divine imperative for all to be edified is a wonderful goal and expectation. That all should also be involved in edifying others provides a construct that is not the pattern of the world generally but must be part of the culture of Brigham Young University. This reminds us of the heavenly expectation that we should practice courtesy, civility, and mutual respect in every encounter we have. I'm grateful that so many do this so well and encourage each of us to be both attentive to our own conduct as well as of assistance to others in their own growth and struggles to be edifiers.<br><br>If there are any in our university community who are intentionally malicious, then they must be very few. Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others. Unfortunately, our general society seems to be more polarized than ever. We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional.<br><br>I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another. Please read "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" carefully and be sure that you are not misinterpreting or misrepresenting the words of the prophets orinjecting your own bias or preferences.<br><br>All of us have probably heard reports in recent years about prominent athletes, politicians, or business people whose lives have come crashing down when their path to prominence was exposed as one built upon fraud and deceit. Perhaps you have also heard of other individuals--less well known--who became entangled in lies designed to cover fraud committed against their employers, aspouse, or others.<br><br>The social, political, and personal costs of this dishonest conduct are high. Twenty years ago President Gordon B. Hinckley thoughtfully observed:<br><br><i>What was once controlled by the moral and ethical standards of the people, we now seek to handle by public law. And so the statutes multiply, enforcement agencies consume ever-increasing billions, and prison facilities are constantly expanded--but the torrent of dishonesty pours on and grows in volume.</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>If anything, this unfortunate trend has accelerated in recent years. Institutions like ours must increasingly respond to these laws and enforcement actions, which in turn increase our costs as we diligently devote time, money, and human effort to ensure compliance. In addition, while dishonest acts are disappointing, disruptive, and costly to investigate for the institution, they also result in untold spiritual, personal, and family devastation for the individual involved. Acts of dishonesty may cause you to lose your job, be criminally prosecuted, and face prison time and restitution damages as well as to compromise your standing in the Church and with family and friends.<br><br>At BYU we are committed to the highest standard of honesty and integrity in maintaining our sacred resources. At a 1992 BYU devotional, President Gordon B. Hinckley stated:<br><br><i>Every one of us who is here has accepted a sacred and compelling trust. With that trust, there must be accountability. That trust involves standards of behavior as well as standards of academic excellence. For each of us it carries with it a larger interest than our own interest. It carries with it the interest of the university, and the interest of the Church, which must be the interest of each and all of us.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>All of us have committed and recommitted to be honest in all our dealings as a condition of our employment here. Indeed, as taught in Alma, may we be "perfectly honest and upright in all things" (Alma 27:27).<br><br>Yesterday, in our regularly scheduled annualuniversity conference session with deans, directors, and department chairs, we were instructed and edified by our special guest, President Henry B. Eyring, first counselor in the First Presidency and an officer of the Brigham Young University Board of Trustees. President Eyring occupies the same position as did President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., when he (President Clark) shared his foundational statement "The Charted Course of the Church in Education."<sup>4</sup>Like President Hinckley's address previously referenced, Ihighly recommend a reading or rereading ofPresident Clark's masterful discourse.<br><br>President Eyring also shared his remarkable vision and insights about the role of Church education and particularly the critical part BYU plays. He was clear in reaffirming the support the current First Presidency gives to the important work done here. I think no other university of substance enjoys the consistent support and encouragement that we receive from our board of trustees.<br><br>Now, for a few moments, let me give some updates on happenings across campus that may be of some interest to you. At the outset you will appreciate that I cannot touch on every activity, initiative, or matter of importance. My inclusions are arbitrary, and others could have been substituted or added to the list. I will mention briefly in this order the following: athletics, BYU Broadcasting, planning for a new life sciences building, and the current situation as I know it with respect to the economy and the ongoing hiring freeze. Other updates on such matters as accreditation, admissions, and various recognitions will alsobe touched upon in our time together.<br><h2><b>Athletics</b></h2><br>Much is frequently said and written about athletics at BYU. We are grateful to the individuals and teams who represent BYU so well on and off the fields, tracks, courts, and other venues in which we compete so successfully. When we rarely stub our toes, our athletics administration proceeds carefully but expeditiously to see that the matters are appropriately resolved in a manner consistent with all that we do at BYU.<br><br>Occasionally, naysayers have said that BYU could choose student-athletes who would abide by our Honor Code or BYU could choose student-athletes who could win athletic competitions. Happily, through the leadership and commitment of our athletic directors, coaches, and especially our BYU student-athletes, we are proving that BYU student-athletes can win on and off the field in all the ways that really matter because of, not in spite of, the honesty, integrity, and commitments we uphold in our BYU Honor Code.<br><br>As athletic conference alignments and contracts of various kinds change, we extend best wishes to our neighboring institutions, even as we at BYU continue to focus on what we consider the primary mission of BYU and thereby of our constituent BYU programs and activities, including athletics.<br><br>Early this year I appointed a presidential commission on sportsmanship jointly chaired by vice president Kevin Worthen and athletic director Tom Holmoe to make recommendations on improving our sportsmanship and respect for others. Very shortly their report will be published and their recommendations will begin to be implemented. I express my appreciation to this entire group chosen from across the wide BYU community, and we will have more to say in the immediate weeks ahead.<br><h2><b>BYU Broadcasting</b></h2><br>Our new BYU Broadcasting building is coming along on schedule, and you now can anticipate its final appearance. Equally important, the installation of the highly sophisticated, state-of-the-art equipment is also proceeding apace. Because of the tremendous generosity of many donors and the very large investment of the Church, we will be able to provide better than ever before regularly refreshed, inviting, inspiring, and appropriate programming content to ever-increasing audiences within the United States and abroad. With the 24/7 streaming of content over the Internet, many more people than I could imagine when I came to BYU a few short years ago now have regular access to content that is both educational and faith promoting. We have had the motto "The world is our campus" for many years, and we now have this much more recent manifestation that it is true in ways most would have only dared imagine in the past. We learned recently, for example, according to CBSSports.com data, that the BYU–University of Florida basketball game during the last NCAA tournament was the most-watched live sporting event ever online with 1,115,097 visitors.<br><h2><b>Life Sciences</b></h2><br>For a number of years we have talked about the need to modernize our campus and keep up to speed with appropriate developments. For decades it has been noted by BYU leaders that as a university we may not be able to do everything, but what we commit to do, we will do well. Among the discipline areas in which BYU is committed to do well is life sciences. With the support and encouragement of our board of trustees, the College of Life Sciences and our physical facilities staff are carefully planning and exploring options for a new facility to replace the Widtsoe Building and other spaces that have reached their reasonable life expectancy. These times of some economic uncertainty require especially great care in considering the replacement of facilities. We, therefore, are grateful for the opportunity to proceed carefully where our academic mission and available resources justify some focused replacements and additions. As part of this effort, new greenhouses will be constructed east of campus to make possible site preparations for the new building.<br><h2><b>Economy and Hiring Freeze</b></h2><br>One of the few certainties about our current economy and the economic outlook for the future is that it is uncertain. While the various media have much to say and the opinions vary, it is clear that our current economic situation is unlike any before. Another situation unlike others is that Brigham Young University has done relatively well during this difficult period. Where other educational institutions--including those in this state--have had to lay off faculty and staff and cut student programs, majors, and other activities, we have been able to keep current BYU faculty and staff and do some internal reallocating. Virtually everyone has made sacrifices of various sorts, and I am grateful, as is our board.<br><br>The board has permitted us to make some carefully considered exception requests for critical positions, and they have been granted. In addition, we have been able to bring on more temporary and visiting faculty than would be the norm, but the hiring freeze still has been very difficult. It is my belief that the board may find a way to ease the freeze in the months ahead, but, in the meantime, we must continue as we have with their support and appreciation.<br><br>Many students depend on campus employment for learning opportunities and for paying for school. We are grateful the hiring freeze has not included them. Demand for student jobs has been very strong, as might be expected, and we have had a significant increase in the number of students employed over the past 30 months. With some fluctuations due to the academic calendar, we have continued to increase the number of student employees. It was reported to me that we reached a high point for employing students in March 2010, when 13,595 students earned paychecks on campus.<br><br>Let me emphasize again our appreciation for the tremendous efforts and sacrifices of so many across the campus. We are living the familiar phrase "Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without." In many cases the university is stronger for it. When the economic tensions subside a little, I'm confident that we will be even better managers of our resources, allowing our impressive progress to accelerate. Let me share just two examples of positive outcomes that have been achieved in these difficult times.<br><br>Working closely with our university administrative vice president and chief financial officer, Brian Evans, and other campus leaders responsible for budget and financial matters, many deans, directors, faculty, and staff have found ways to use existing funds instead of drawing on endowments when the markets have been so down. Preserving "seed corn," to use an agrarian analogy, makes good sense. Likewise, the situation has given us all greater insight into the differences between wants and needs.<br><br>Our university chief information officer, Kelly Flanagan, created something called a CIO Lab, which involves 27 student interns, of whom most work 20 hours per week to develop portlets for students. Instead of facing the lack of adequate personnel and other delays until at least early 2011, the project makes time available for brainstorming and innovation, creates easier-to-use interfaces for existing solutions, and gives students rich onthe-job training.<br><br>While these increased employment opportunities for students have been a blessing for many, we also have concerns about those students who work excessive hours. For example, we find that students working more than 31 hours per week do significantly poorer in their academic studies. This is one of the reasons that increasing financial aid for truly needy students has such a high priority with the administration.<br><br>There are other BYU enrollment challenges that we are monitoring as well. Our continuing student population is burgeoning. Because of the external employment situation, some students are delaying graduation to stay in school and delay the onset of student loan repayment. While we have great sympathy for them, we are also concerned that it further limits our capacity to serve worthy and otherwise eligible new students. There are other examples of the increased challenges the economy creates for the university, but you will appreciate that there is very little we do that is not affected.<br><br>As I stated earlier, our board of trustees does not see the hiring freeze as a way to reduce the size or capacity of BYU. The hiring freeze is not intended to establish what some have called a "new normal"--the shrinking on a permanent basis the number of BYU faculty, staff, or students. In the face of current circumstances, the support for and the faith in BYU by our prophet leaders is truly extraordinary.<br><br>As we have seen, challenges very often also offer opportunities. It would be a great disappointment to our board and other interested, knowledgeable observers if someday, when the hiring freeze is lifted or modified, we just slid back to doing old things in old ways. Hopefully the lessons of this unique season of sacrifice will continue to encourage each of us to adjust and adapt, to find and create new opportunities and ways to do different things better. Likewise, when we again achieve more flexibility in hiring, we will want to take the appropriate time to choose very carefully those we invite in a gradual, measured way to repopulate the ranks of the BYU faculty and staff. How and when that will happen will be the topic for another university conference.<br><br>Now, let me move from these update snapshots to some other matters of both current and future interest. Again, these issues and areas are neither all-inclusive nor necessarily the most important or urgent. They are things we do and need to think about and consider.<br><br>While we have one of the most beautiful of campuses anywhere, in some areas ours is physically aging. Where appropriate and possible, weighing carefully both short- and long-term considerations, we are planning or undertaking needed renovations and regularly scheduled maintenance. For those who have been on campus this summer, you will be aware that, over time, we are placing all of our utilities in service tunnels. Initially, the standard practice was to bury them in trenches across the campus. We have learned that it is safer, less expensive, more efficient, and less intrusive on campus life to have water, gas, power, and other utilities so housed in service tunnels.<br><br>The Marriott Center has been a remarkable asset to this campus for many years. You have witnessed some modifications to our corner entryways and efforts to make egress and ingress safer and more efficient. Over the years the asbestos has been removed, the floor replaced, and so forth. Even though many of us are larger than were our predecessors when the building was constructed, it is not possible without starting completely over to make the chair upon which you sit wider or the distance between rows greater. We will be very grateful for this facility as it is and promise not to keep you today longer than necessary!<br><br>BYU is truly unique in so many ways. Yet we are also pleased to demonstrate to the world that we uphold appropriate, generally accepted academic values and standards--including those set through the established procedures of both discipline and institutional accreditation.<br><br>Brigham Young University's commitment to quality assurance and continuing improvement is rooted in our relentless pursuit of academic excellence and effectiveness and the invitation and expectation expressed by the chairman and our board of trustees that we each do all we can to make BYU the best it can be.<br><br>We all know President Thomas S. Monson's statement of principle and practice: "When performance is measured, performance improves. When performance is measured and reported, the rate of improvement accelerates."<sup>5</sup>While not everything that is important can or should be visibly measured, many things that matter most in a BYU education can and do improve by appropriate measurement, by sensible reporting, and by focused attention to both genuine improvement and the rate of improvement, particularly for the benefit of students.<br><br>As part of a voluntary, nongovernmental peer-review system of higher education accreditation, Brigham Young University is also committed to the principles of quality assurance and continuing improvement, peer review, protection of public interest, institutional participation and adherence to academic principles, mission-centered evaluation of each institution, and institutional autonomy and academic freedom administered in our case under the auspices of our regional accrediting agency, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU).<br><br>Over the last many years, all of this has been led admirably and with distinction by Dr. Gerrit W. Gong. Since he was recently called as a General Authority of the Church, he has now retired from Brigham Young University. We will miss him and his tremendous expertise, his devotion to BYU, and his innate intelligence and wisdom. Like all members of the President's Council, he has been a valuable colleague and friend. While I have not mentioned all the President's Council members by name thus far, I would be remiss if I did not publicly acknowledge my gratitude for all that they do so very well in service to BYU. Many of you will know them: Carri Jenkins, Mike Orme, Sandra Rogers, Jan Scharman, John Tanner, and Kevin Worthen, in addition to Brian Evans and Kelly Flanagan, who were previously mentioned. We are also ably assisted by Jan Ekeroth and Elaine Alger. This is really a terrific team, and BYU is most fortunate to have them. In this commendation I also include our deans, directors, and other leaders.<br><br>The President's Council has now been joined by Professor Jim Gordon, our new assistant to the president for Planning and Assessment. Jim has served in the administration previously and was also professor of law and interim dean of the J. Reuben Clark Law School. He will be spearheading our accreditation preparation, working closely with many across campus as we gear up to submit in spring 2011 a regularly scheduled report to the Northwest Commission as part of the new accreditation guidelines recently approved by NWCCU institutions, including BYU.<br><br>Professor Gordon and each of us can ask ourselves questions such as these:<br><br>Where and to what can I and BYU commit as we submit in writing Northwest Commission accreditation reports this coming year (spring 2011) and spring 2014?<br><br>Where and what will I and BYU want to show peer visitors when they come to BYU in spring 2012 and in spring 2015?<br><br>You know the phrase captured from the carpenter's lexicon: "measure twice, cut once." In our case, you might say we are measuring more than twice to cut once. It is important that we identify carefully our mission, core themes and objectives, and key indicators of achievement we submit to the Northwest Commission. We want to focus on matters of consequence to us in ways in which we can gather demonstrable evidence of improvement--both as we invite others to help evaluate how we are doing and, most important, as we do so ourselves.<br><br>Much good effort has established student learning outcomes for each BYU degree program. Now we want to add appreciable evidence that students are achieving those outcomes and that we are using feedback information to improve.<br><h2><b>Learning to Learn</b></h2><br>Fundamentally we are seeking to instill interest, skills, and internalized desire so our students actually and really "learn how to learn." At some point this may involve student opportunity for written personal reflection, perhaps as part of a personal student portfolio or integrated in a capstone course and interview. It may involve new or broader ways for students to learn from and teach one another. As our academic vice president John Tanner notes, he best learned to write when he began teaching writing.<br><h2><b>Student Achievement</b></h2><br>Across campus there are myriad evidences of student academic achievement. These include student presentations, student performances, joint student-faculty scholarship, creative works, and publications. Our students do well in competitions of all kinds and contribute with poise, expertise, and insight that thrill us all. Indeed, as faculty and staff at Brigham Young University, we understand our most enduring legacy may well be the ongoing, continuing contributions and service of our students and their families . . . and their families . . . and their families. Many of the successes we value most are multigenerational in all the splendor of their flowering in individuals, families, professions, communities, and countries.<br><h2><b>Faculty and Staff Achievement</b></h2><br>Overall, we recognize the remarkable commitment of members of the BYU community to the mission of BYU. This includes the emphasis we place, as determined by our board of trustees, on BYU as an undergraduate teaching institution with some graduate programs of distinction. I have spoken on other occasions of how a student-centric lens lends specific perspective to all of what we do in scholarship and creative works, teaching, and citizenship. Thank you for your faith and commitment, your discipline and dedication, your living every day in ways that continue to make BYU better on our way toward best.<br><br>And that brings us to longer-term opportunities and challenges.<br><h2><b>Longer Term</b></h2><br>Today, perhaps in ways as never before, Brigham Young University is coming out of obscurity. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell used to point out, coming out of obscurity means showing our warts and all. The better we become known for all the many accomplishments and achievements of our students, faculty, staff, and athletic teams and the better we become known for our scholarship, editorial boards, professional society service and leadership, and so forth, the more also the expectations will rise that will judge BYU and our sponsoring Church by the way we conduct ourselves.<br><br>The reputation of BYU continues to grow. We are now known not only regionally but nationally and internationally. Individuals and groups from BYU are welcome and contribute around the world, and BYU welcomes individuals and groups from all around the world who contribute here at BYU while they gain from what we offer them in return. All the while we understand our most important focus and work is within the walls of our own campus. Even though "the world is our campus" and we do "go forth to serve," our primary emphasis remains on the quality and importance of what we do here at home.<br><br>We frequently ask ourselves this question: How can and will BYU be equal to our increasingly exceptional students? By every measure, students being admitted, enrolling, learning in and out of classes, and graduating are more prepared in faith, testimony, leadership, and service as well as in academic preparation and achievement and in natural and developed aptitude and multifaceted talent than ever before.<br><br>On average, undergraduate students come to BYU for about four to six years, not counting time away for missions or military service. This suggests that the average cycle time for a student's BYU experience that includes learning, maturation, and improvement is the same--or four to six years. In fact, students tend to change much faster than that because of missions and moving between dorms, apartments, and wards--often every semester. In comparison, faculty and staff come to BYU for about 30to 40 years. We have already noted with great appreciation the continuity and strength that come with such a dedicated commitment to BYU. At the same time, as BYU faculty, staff, and administrators, we can always ask ourselves questions such as<br><br>Are we doing all we can to fulfill the trust these students and their families place in us when they come to BYU?<br><br>Could we update the concepts or illustrations in our lecture notes or PowerPoint slides?<br><br>Could we help more students learn work skills and responsibilities beyond just the job athand?<br><br>To come full circle and close where we began, I express gratitude for a place where we are under divine injunction to let each speak and for all to listen that all may be edified of all. Our BYU mission is chartered in the great opportunity and challenge to be learning and teaching all the time in a world of change while remaining true and firm in our values and moral compass, which do not change. This annual university conference and this coming year hold great promise as we continue forward in the great cause we know as Brigham Young University.<br><br>I hope you know that my conviction about BYU and its vital place in the economy and future of the Church is absolutely firm. I bear my solemn witness of the reality of our living Heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. The gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored, and we are led by living prophets. Central to my certitude of these truths is the understanding of the importance of continuing learning as we strive to prove ourselves to return to the Father and the Son. How grateful I am for the privilege of being at Brigham Young University at this special time and having a small part, as do each of you, in accomplishing the tremendous work we have been trusted to do. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O.

<h1>l May Be Edified of All” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Temple and School</b></h2><br>This year's conference theme is drawn, as they so often are, from Doctrine and Covenants 88, the revelation that directed the Saints to build the Kirtland Temple and a school of the prophets. In 1977, then president Dallin H. Oaks described section 88 as "the first and greatest revelation of this dispensation on the subject of education." He went on to state that this revelation, "which defined the objectives of the School of the Prophets and gave related commandments, counsel, and knowledge, is still the basic constitution of Church education. It defines Brigham Young University's role in the kingdom" ("A House of Faith," BYU annual university conference address, 31 August 1977; see also<i>Educating Zion,</i>eds. John W. Welch and Don E. Norton (Provo: BYU Studies, 1996), 115). This scriptural constitution effectively links Kirtland to Provo, temple to school.<br><br>I very much admire the marvelous murals that face each other in the main gallery of the Education in Zion exhibit in the Joseph F. Smith Building. (These magnificent murals, by the way, are the work of a student!) The murals dramatically make the point that temple and school are homologous in LDS tradition. They are part of a "unified work," as President Oaks said ("House of Faith"). The positioning of these murals across from each other in the gallery visually draws the connection between temple and school, as do the similarities between the treatments of the subjects in the murals. In both paintings the buildings are dwarfed by towering clouds and stunning skies; in both the buildings are bathed in light from the heavens. These artistic elements suggest to me how our humble human effort to seek enlightenment is illuminated by the grander, sublime light that God sheds forth upon the world. The paintings recall for me these verses from Doctrine and Covenants 88:<br><br><i>And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings;</i><br><br><i>Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:11–12]<br><br>The purpose of the School of the Prophets was to prepare the first Church leaders for their ministries. Historically, the school lasted only a few months. Imaginatively, the School of the Prophets remains with us still. Principles revealed in section 88 for this temple-like school articulate enduring ideals for every school in Zion and, indeed, for the education of every Latter-day Saint. They establish the pattern. The injunctions "sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God," "teach ye diligently," "seek learning, even by study and also by faith," "clothe yourselves with the bond of charity," and so forth have never been rescinded (D&amp;amp;C 88:68, 78, 118, 125). Nor has the Lord's curriculum. He expects His people to be instructed "in theory, in principle," "of things both in heaven and in the earth," obtaining "a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms" and "the best books" as well as "languages, tongues, and people" and the "laws of God and man" (D&amp;amp;C 88:78–79, 118; 90:15; 93:53). All these remain foundational to BYU's mission, which is to prepare, if not prophets, then disciples thoroughly educated in the academic and spiritual disciplines. BYU is to be a school of disciplined disciples.<br><br>Today I want to weave my remarks around a few phrases from this constitutional revelation describing the School of the Prophets, beginning with the conference theme.<br><h2><b>"That All May Be Edified of All"</b></h2><br>The theme scripture "that all may be edified of all" (D&amp;amp;C 88:122) is rich with implications for BYU to plumb and put into practice.<br><br><i>Edify:</i>Consider first the word<i>edify. Edify</i>comes from the Latin for "build up or construct." By extension, it came to mean to build up morally or spiritually. Everything we do here should be up-building, edifying. Our classes; our scholarship; our cultural and athletic events; our relationships with faculty, staff, and students: all should edify.<br><br>Now this does not mean we must focus only on the positive or never criticize folly and error. Critical thinking lies at the heart of higher education. Not surprisingly, it is one of the most ubiquitous learning outcomes for BYU degree programs, and it will be core to the outcomes being developed for our general education program. I hope that critical thinking is taught in every class at BYU. This educational aim is not incompatible with edification. After all, to erect learning on firm foundations, it is sometimes necessary to break down false suppositions and premature certainties.<br><br>Nor does the Lord expect an edifying education to leave disciples ignorant of the negative, perplexing realities of this fallen world. Indeed, He specifically enjoins us to know about such matters when He lays out a curriculum that includes knowledge of things "which have been" and "are," including "the wars and the perplexities of the nations" (D&amp;amp;C 88:79). Section 88 suggests that knowledge of the world as it exists is essential in preparing us topreach redemption to the world and make itbetter (see D&amp;amp;C 88:80).<br><br>Similarly, the Prophet Joseph Smith taught:<br><br><i>Thy mind, O man! if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity--thou must commune with God.</i>[<i>HC</i>3:295]<br><br>Note that to lead a soul upward, it is sometimes necessary to "search into and contemplate the darkest abyss," where many souls are trapped. But also note that the intent of searching the abyss is ultimately to lead souls heavenward to salvation--that is to edify--not to sojourn in the abyss or to revel in darkness or to "call evil good" (Isaiah 5:20). As guides to the culture and wisdom of a fallen world, we need to take care not to fall into the abyss ourselves--a common professional pitfall--or to cause our students to fall into the pit. To edify those we teach, we must commune with God.<br><br>An education that edifies does not destroy innocence but pushes back ignorance. It does not eradicate faith but enables educated believers to articulate reasons for the hope that is in them (see 1 Peter 3:15). Hence our students must be taught to analyze and argue, to weigh evidence regarding competing ideas, to make well-reasoned inferences, and to criticize their own opinions as well as those of others. We must diligently seek learning. We do our students no service if they are not able to parry the best arguments of the adversary. But we do them ill service if we become the adversary. Iam not a fan of playing the devil's advocate if by this students fail to ever feel our testimony.<br><br>Some believers enjoy the precious gift of childlike faith. Others are more like Dostoyevsky, who said: "It is not as a child that I believe and confess Jesus Christ. My hosanna is born of a furnace of doubt" (Fyodor Dostoyevsky, written in his last notebook [1880–1881]; see<i>Literaturnoe Nasledstvo</i>[Moscow: Nauka, 1971], 83:696]). In either case, an edifying education fits us for hosanna shouts.<br><br><i>All of all:</i>The principle that<i>all</i>are to learn<i>of all</i>is rich with implications for BYU. I've explored some of these with you in past conferences. Likewise, Jeffrey Keith has highlighted today how this philosophy informs new interactive pedagogical tools. It also applies to nontechnological, active learning strategies we discussed last year in which students learn from each other.<br><br>This same principle of "all edifying all" is congruent with our ongoing assessment efforts, which have required us to think of ourselves as part of an ensemble rather than as soloists, to borrow Dean Rosenberg's metaphor. Assessment has made us more intentional about whether and how our programs are educating students in the ways we say they will. Jeff Keith, however, tells me that not all programs have closed the assessment loop, to use the common jargon. You can see how close we are to having all programs close the loop on a pie chart he has prepared. Not all programs even have learning outcomes. This is unacceptable. In the future, the University Curriculum Council will not accept program modifications unless they are tied to learning outcomes.<br><br>Many programs are also developing what might be termed "scholarship outcomes" to guide annual stewardship evaluations and rank and status reviews. Faculty have come together to agree on disciplinary norms for assessing scholarly and creative productivity. I commend this. This is another way that all are edifying all. I hope that by clarifying standards, we can lift up (i.e., edify) the quality of our scholarship in each discipline and thereby have a greater impact on our students and the world.<br><br>Perhaps, however, it is in mentoring that we have seen the most dramatic results from applying the pedagogy of all edifying all. We are continuing to see impressive results as faculty engage students, including undergraduate students, in substantive scholarly and creative work. I wish I had time to share with you some of the reports I receive about the results of mentoring. In spite of the freeze and efforts to trim back elsewhere, we are committed to continued funding for mentored student learning. This investment in student learning pays great dividends in their development.<br><br>Undergraduate Education is also introducing a new Freshman Mentoring program this fall. It promotes another kind of mentoring: student-to-student peer mentoring. This alters the traditional mentoring model, which is one of mentor-protégé. Traditionally, a mentor is a surrogate parent. The word<i>mentor,</i>you will recall, does not derive from a verb "to ment," as<i>conductor</i>derives from<i>conduct.</i>(Hence<i>mentee</i>is an illogical back-formation.)<i>Mentor</i>comes from the name of an old man whom Odysseus entrusted to be surrogate father for his son Telemachus when Odysseus went off to fight at Troy. The man's name was Mentor. Thus a mentor came to designate anyone who fills the role of surrogate father.<br><br>Peers provide a different kind of mentor: they are not surrogate parents but surrogate older siblings. Older brothers and sisters can also serve as important guides. Sometimes they can be even more effective than more knowledgeable teachers, as C. S. Lewis remarked in the introduction to his book onthePsalms. He wrote:<br><br><i>This is not a work of scholarship. . . . I write for the unlearned about things in which I am unlearned myself. If an excuse is needed . . . for writing such a book, my excuse would be something like this. It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can. When you took the problem to a master, as we all remember, he was very likely to explain what you understood already, to add a great deal of information which you didn't want, and say nothing at all about the thing that was puzzling you.... The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met.</i>[<i>Reflections onthe Psalms,</i>a Harvest Book (New York: Harcourt, 1958), 1]<br><br>Freshman peer mentors will not replace TAs for particular courses (as one might mistakenly infer from the quote from C. S. Lewis). They will serve as general guides to university life. They are supposed to function much like older siblings.<br><br>A recent study by two BYU faculty has documented the critical role played by siblings in flourishing families (see Laura M. Padilla-Walker, James M. Harper, and Alexander C. Jensen, "Self-Regulation as a Mediator Between Sibling Relationship Quality and Early Adolescents' Positive and Negative Outcomes,"<i>Journal of Family Psychology</i>24, no. 4 [August 2010]: 419–28). I know from personal experience about the importance of good siblings. I have 12 of them. My parents were quite intentional about enlisting all of us in helping to raise the family by transmitting positive family values and culture.<br><br>As a BYU freshman, I was fortunate to have been mentored by three older sisters and several roommates who served as surrogate older brothers. Istill bless the memory of these crucial guides to BYU for what they did for me as a young freshman. They set me on the right course academically, socially, and spiritually. They were, frankly, more valuable and influential mentors than my professors that first year at BYU. Our intent is to provide something like an older sibling through the new Freshman Mentoring program.<br><br>I say "new," but the idea is old at BYU. We have been using peer mentors in Freshman Academy for many years. The new program merely extends this tested model to the entire freshman class. The program also harks back to the founding of BYU. In the early days of Brigham Young Academy, Karl G. Maeser introduced a similar program, called the "monitorial system," that became the hallmark of Maeser's pedagogical practice and of the students' experience at BYA (see "The Monitorial System," Church School Department,<i>Juvenile Instructor,</i>1 March 1901, 153–54; see also Maeser,<i>School and Fireside</i>[Salt Lake City: Skelton and Co., 1898], 25, 37, 249, 272; also see Fred Pinnegar, "The Spiritual and Historical Roots of Freshman Mentoring," unpublished talk at Freshman Mentoring, 11 May 2010).<br><br>The monitorial system in turn was based on scriptural precedents described in section 88 for the School of the Prophets, particularly on the concept found therein that those who taught and studied in this temple-school were expected to act toward each other as brothers and friends.<br><br>So the concept of peer mentoring has long, deep roots at BYU. Nevertheless, as a new program for us, I expect some bumps as it is rolled out. I am cautiously hopeful about its ultimate success, mainly because it is based on principles consistent with our scriptural constitution.<br><br><i>"Save he is clean":</i>Another key element of that constitution is that those who participate in Church schools and temples must be worthy. The revelation says, "Ye shall not receive any among you into this school save he is clean" (D&amp;amp;C 88:138).Those who entered the school washed themselves and put on clean clothes. Zebedee Coltrin reported:<br><br><i>Every time we were called together to attend to any business, we came together in the morning about sunrise, fasting, and partook of the sacrament each time; and before going to school we washed ourselves and put on clean linen.</i>[Remarks of Zebedee Coltrin on Kirtland, Ohio, history of the Church, Salt Lake School of the Prophets, 1883 Minute Book, 3 October 1883, 38]<br><br>Likewise, BYU cannot fulfill its prophetic mission unless we live lives of integrity, honor, and virtue. Over the past six-plus years, I have occasionally been involved with difficult decisions to dismiss faculty who had violated our standards. These decisions are so painful for everyone involved. I plead with you to guard against wrongdoing, including small compromises that can lead to ever more serious misconduct. Be scrupulously true to your covenants and to your commitment to abide by the Honor Code and basic principles of professional ethics.<br><br>Thankfully, egregious violations that lead to dismissal are rare. But these are not the only failings that prevent us from realizing our potential to "become the fully anointed university of the Lord about which so much has been spoken" (Spencer W. Kimball, "The Second Century of Brigham Young University," BYU devotional, 10 October 1975). What most often impedes our growth, individually and institutionally, are small shortcomings--often faults of omission rather than of commission. Those who attended the School of the Prophets "were to prepare themselves by repenting of all covetousness, pride, light-mindedness, idleness, oversleeping, lustful desires, fault-finding, contention, and every other sin" (Education in Zion exhibit text [http://lib.byu.edu/sites/educationinzion/files/2010/05/Education-in-Zion-Text.pdf]; see D&amp;amp;C 88:121). As William Blake recognized, virtue resides in "minute particulars." "He who would do good to another must do it in minute particulars" (<i>Jerusalem</i>[c. 1818–1820], chapter 3, plate 55, line 60). It is in the minutia of our lives, in our quotidian conduct as Christians, that we qualify for the companionship of the Spirit, without which we cannot teach (see D&amp;amp;C 42:14).<br><h2><b>"Cease to Be Covetous"</b></h2><br>One of these seemingly minute matters singled out in section 88 is covetousness. In fact, this is no small sin. "Thou shalt not covet" is one of the Ten Commandments. As the last of the 10, perhaps it receives less attention than it deserves, especially from those of us in the academy. Covetousness and envy, along with their cousin pride, are among the chief occupational hazards, spiritually, of the academy. Faculty culture in most universities is notoriously beset by petty jealousies, envy, rivalry, and contention. Knowing full well "the nature and disposition of almost all men" (D&amp;amp;C 121:39)--and especially those accustomed to receiving the honors of men as the best and the brightest, the top of the class--the Lord instructs the future leadership of the Church:<br><br><i>See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:123]<br><br>This admonition follows immediately upon the counsel that everyone should be listened to and allowed a chance to speak, "that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege" (D&amp;amp;C 88:122). It can be hard for us to allow others their turn to shine and contribute. When we ourselves are desperate to succeed, it can be difficult to rejoice in the successes of others.<br><br>You may remember the delightful children's story<i>A Birthday for Frances</i>(Russell Hoban [New York: Harper and Row, 1976]) and how Frances struggled to give her little sister Gloria a chocolate "Chompo Bar," which she squeezed lovingly and longingly all the way home from the store. We've all been there with Frances. I was taught the lesson Frances had to learn by my life in a large family. In my family you had only a one-in-15 chance that the birthday was going to be yours. So we learned to take pleasure in the birthdays and good things that happened to our siblings. We developed a tradition of "oohing and aahing" and cheering for the one opening presents on birthdays or Christmas. My dad drummed into us this saying: "Learn to rejoice in the successes of others!"<br><br>Similarly Paul taught that we should "rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep" (Romans 12:15). Most of us are better at the latter than the former--better at sympathizing for misfortune than celebrating good fortune.<br><br>I mention the danger of covetousness, envy, and pride not because I detect a major problem here but because in the nature of things these lurk as ever-present perils on the edges of excellence. My remarks are intended to be prophylactic. As we pursue academic excellence--and pursue it we must with great diligence; this is our privilege and responsibility--let us be ever vigilant to eschew envy and pride. Few, if any, may ever be fired or excommunicated for these sins, but they can be fatal to our mission and to our souls nonetheless. Remember that the War in Heaven began in sibling rivalry; so did the first homicide. Civilization itself has been regarded as the attempt to regulate the internecine sibling rivalry prevalent in a state of nature, which Thomas Hobbes famously described as "bellum omnium contra omnes": "the war of all against all" (<i>De Cive</i>[1642], preface). This is just the opposite of the condition that must prevail in Zion and her schools, where all are to be edified of all. The gospel replaces sibling rivalry with sibling amity. It enables "pax omnium pro omnibus": "the peace of all for all," to reverse Hobbes. Schools, temples, homes, and churches in Zion are intended to be places of such peace and love, where "all may be edified of all." No wonder that the Prophet Joseph, having learned such principles in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants, referred to the revelation as "the 'olive leaf' which we have plucked from the Tree of Paradise, the Lord's message of peace to us" (letter from Joseph Smith to William W. Phelps, 14 January 1833;<i>HC</i>1:316). Section 88 is a great revelation of peace. It stands in sharp contrast to section 87, a revelation on war. I like to think of these sections as War and Peace, which stand side by side each other like the images ofwar and peace on Achilles' shield.<br><br><i>"Your friend and brother . . . in the bonds of love":</i>The Lord provided rituals to remind those who attended the School of the Prophets to live peaceably together as brothers, sisters, and friends. The attendants administered the sacrament and participated in the sacred ordinance of the washing of the feet. They also greeted each other before every class with this formal salutation:<br><br><i>I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother through the grace of God in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 88:133]<br><br>We do not now so greet each other here at BYU, of course, nor do I expect this practice to be reinstituted here any time soon. But in our hearts this is exactly how we should regard those with whom we associate if we would be faithful to the legacy of the School of the Prophets and follow the spirit of our scriptural constitution. Think what it would mean if we said in our hearts to each student who arrives in our classes next week: "I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . . . in a determination . . . to be your friend and brother [orsister] in the bonds of love."<br><br>What if we interacted with the staff, who serve us and the university so well, and with our faculty colleagues having this same salutation engraved in our hearts? Occasionally I am troubled to hear reports of arrogance or contempt by faculty for colleagues and staff. Occasionally, we also hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets.<br><br>I am persuaded that one of BYU's greatest institutional strengths, though rarely acknowledged as such, is our shared belief that each person is a child of God--loved by Him and endowed by birthright with infinite worth and almost unimaginable potential. People are not merely means to our own ends; they are themselves ends. We live in what Kant called a kingdom of ends, among immortals. And, as C.S. Lewis reminded us, "It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses" (<i>The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses</i>[New York: Macmillan, 1949], 14–15).<br><br>Let us always remember that our deepest and most lasting relationship with each other is as brothers and sisters. We were siblings before we came to this earth. We will remain brothers and sisters long after we have shed the professional titles and temporary distinctions that divide us into faculty, staff, student; full, associate, assistant, and adjunct professor. Let us ever walk together "through the grace of God in the bonds of love."<br><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><br>In this spirit, please grant me a point of privilege to conclude by expressing appreciation for you, my dear colleagues, brothers, sisters, and friends. You make this difficult job much less difficult. As Sir Francis Bacon says of friends, you multiply my joys and divide my griefs (see "Of Friendship,"<i>Essays</i>[1625]). I have felt particularly grateful for you during the past couple of years as we have all coped with the hiring freeze. I have felt in you a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood as we have met the challenge together. I have seen you put the needs of others first, especially students, as you have tried to accommodate shortages in faculty and staff. I have seen you express a deeper sense of appreciation for the staff as we have had to go without their help. I appreciate your patience through it all, including your patience with me.<br><br>Thank you, and may God bless you this coming year. I salute you in the name of Jesus Christ, as your friend and brother, amen.<br><br><i>John S. Tanner was academic vice president when this address was delivered at the BYU annual university conference faculty session on 24 August 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Brigham Young University.

<h1>ate Zeal: The Dangers of Being Overzealous - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
As is always the case at this wonderful time of year, I have the great privilege and pleasure of welcoming you to a new semester at Brigham Young University. I hope and trust you have had productive summer months and now begin this academic year full of enthusiasm, optimism, energy, and commitment to and for the opportunities and tasks ahead. I anticipate you are excited to be here because there is much about which to be energized and encouraged this fall term at BYU. More so than ever before, there are many who would love to be in your positions who are not able to be so.<br><br>For some months I have been pondering about my message to you today. In the years that we have occupied these positions, Sister Samuelson and I have had the high honor of addressing the campus community in devotionals twice a year. While we stand before you in this setting typically at the beginning of each fall and winter semester, we tend to think and pray about what we should discuss with you almost constantly. And it is not rare that someone might feel impressed to offer counsel as to what we might say next or what we should have said today or last winter. In all candor, we need all the help we can get, but we give highest priority to seeking the guidance of the Holy Ghost in what we consider in these precious moments we have with you.<br><br>Last spring--in the context of a number of opportunities, concerns, and issues we were facing here at BYU--I read, as I have many times over the years, of a Book of Mormon personality who has seemed largely a peripheral figure. I speak of the Nephite Zeniff. As Itried to "liken all scriptures" unto myself, as we are counseled by Nephi (1 Nephi 19:23), I perceived perhaps for the first time some interesting parallels or character traits that I also observe in our community and even in myself from time to time. The applications are many, and I will have time for only a few that seem particularly pertinent on this occasion.<br><br>While I will leave the detailed study of Zeniff, his times, and circumstances to you, I need to summarize briefly in order to provide further context to what I feel to comment about today. You will recall that Zeniff's son, King Noah, and his grandson, King Limhi, were both more prominent in Book of Mormon history than was he. Zeniff lived roughly 400 years after Father Lehi and his people arrived in the promised land. Because of the wars and struggles between the Nephites and the Lamanites, the Nephites had been driven from their first ancestral lands in the new world and were primarily located in a place called Zarahemla. Zeniff had been a participant with a group of Nephites who were committed to taking back or reestablishing the Nephite nation in their initial place of residence. Not everyone shared his politics or his priorities, and, in fact, this issue led to considerable conflict and carnage among the Nephites themselves.<br><br>Now to the central point of this account. After describing the horrible contention and bloodshed these disagreements engendered, Zeniff said:<br><br><i>I being</i>over-zealous<i>to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.</i>[Mosiah 9:3; emphasis added]<br><br>To my knowledge, there is only one other place in the scriptures where the term<i>overzealous</i>is found. This is where the Book of Mormon editor is describing the man Zeniff (see Mosiah 7:21) and comments that because he was overzealous, he allowed himself to be deceived by wicked King Laman, which led to the captivity, suffering, and disadvantage of the group of people he led. Earlier in the chronology of the Book of Mormon, Zeniff is also described as "a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man" (see Omni1:28).<br><br>It apparently was not necessarily so that Zeniff was inherently wicked or intentionally unwise, but he was<i>overzealous.</i>It is also clear that his misplaced zeal led to other poor decisions that not only affected him personally in adverse ways but also caused tremendous difficulties for others under his influence. It didn't help that he was also stiff-necked, which means that he was haughty and stubborn too. Can you see any potential dangers in a man who is strong, forceful, passionate, enthusiastic, stubborn, full of himself, and overzealous too? I know that all of you can perceive these interesting traits or character flaws in others, but do they ever creep into your own persona as well? I hope that is something we all try to consider at least a little, and correct if necessary, on a regular basis.<br><br>Now let me be clear. We are in favor of correctly focused zeal. We admire courageous leaders and those who are willing to sacrifice or stand for what they know is right. The scriptures are replete with references to<i>zeal,</i>and the word is often attached to Deity. Without zeal and other associated virtues in courageous leaders and followers of previous days, we would not have this nation or this university, the gospel would not have been restored, and many other events of extreme importance would not have happened.<br><br>Likewise, we abhor slothful behavior and thinking, which are antithetical to righteous and appropriate zeal. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob described the failings of those he knew about who missed "the mark" or appropriate target of concern (Jacob 4:14).<br><br>Thus we must be careful that we do not overdo or underdo any of the important things that demand and deserve our attention. While there are many applications of these principles that we might profitably address, I will mention only a few that have fairly wide applicability in our campus community and beyond. You will be able to think of additional themes and examples, and I suggest you tailor a list that best meets your own concerns, potential weaknesses or strengths, and most important priorities.<br><br>Because of the season, I think of two areas in which examples of the extreme are quite prevalent. I speak, of course, of politics and sports. In the political arena, we are in an election year, and emotions are already beginning to be evident with strong opinions, advocacy, and criticism rampant among us. I encourage you to become informed, to register to vote if you are eligible and have not done so, and to vote your educated conscience on Election Day. Participate in the process as your time and inclinations allow, but please be sure to be considerate of other opinions, people, and perspectives. Please also remember that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Brigham Young University are firm in our positions about protecting our institutional political neutrality.<br><br>Likewise, we are now in football season and will have almost continuous and various athletic contests during the entire school year. While most of our students and community are exemplary in their sportsmanship, we as a group of avid boosters can do better and must do better in respecting our opponents and, frankly, ourselves by acting the way representatives of Brigham Young University should act.<br><br>We applaud your enthusiasm, and our student athletes recognize and appreciate your support. However, in both athletics and politics we see far too many examples of overzealous behavior, and I caution and admonish you to help solve the problems and not be the creators or promoters of offensive and boorish behavior. It doesn't matter what others do. Their poor judgments or actions do not justify imitation. They certainly do not justify acting or behaving in unseemly ways by those who have made the commitments that members of this community have made. I think I don't need to say more about these matters today, but I invite your help and support in improving our conduct and that of others. In the days ahead, the report and recommendations of the BYU Presidential Commission on sportsmanship will be released. I endorse both the work and the suggestions of this important group chosen broadly from across our community.<br><br>In a similar vein, we occasionally witness among us those who give counsel or criticism when they themselves do not have all the facts or the responsibility to so comment. Inappropriate observations about the personal choices of others when differing from their own preferences unfortunately are not restricted to just politics and athletics. Intensely personal decisions about whom to marry, when to have children if married (as if every couple can automatically cause these things to happen on their own timetable--they cannot!), opinions about proper and improper majors or career choices for women or men, and other intrusive verbal or behavioral assaults should never be heard or found in the BYU community. Happily, they are rare, but when they do happen, they are extremely hurtful. Above all, none should ever attempt to impose guilt or distress upon another by being overzealous in interpreting the directions and counsel of the living prophets. The Brethren are extremely careful and clear about what they say and mean, and we should follow their example.<br><br>I like the response of the prophet Alma when asked a question by his son. Note that Alma didn't say, "I don't have an opinion." Rather, this was his response: "Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear" (Alma 37:11). We all should forbear more often and more thoughtfully.<br><br>I also do need to offer counsel about keeping your zeal in proper boundaries with respect to some other matters such as your hobbies, your creativity, and even your studies. As you know, or are now finding out firsthand, BYU is a very no-nonsense place when it comes to scholarship and academic activities, even though we also really know how to have appropriate fun. All of you are bright and able or you would not have been invited to enroll. All of you will need to study hard to succeed and will need to take your course work and other academic endeavors very seriously. But even here you can become overzealous and miss the mark if you are not careful.<br><br>There are those who believe some come to BYU just to socialize or to meet others with similar values and goals and hopefully to find an eventual eternal companion. While this is not the only reason for attending BYU or even perhaps your primary motivation in coming here, please do not wait until you have ordered your cap and gown as you anticipate your pending graduation to do all you can to meet and get to know people with whom you might wish to spend your lives in creating a new eternal family together. If finding a mate is your only concern, BYU is the wrong place for you. But if you leave BYU without doing all you can to fulfill this important obligation in Heavenly Father's plan, you will have missed a great opportunity and may pay a very heavy price inthe future.<br><br>Make no mistake, even with the best of intentions and efforts, some of you will likely not find that special someone while you are here. If that is the case and you have done your best, I promise you that heaven will help you and cause it to happen, even if it takes a very long time and extends beyond your mortal probation. Just be sure that you are doing what you can and should in all that you do here. Hanging out occasionally may be fine, but appropriate dating at the right time and in theright way is very important.<br><br>On a different topic but with the same theme, let me speak candidly with you about the tremendous opportunities you have before you at BYU to grow in the gospel as well as to mature in your academic specialty and general education. I regularly meet students who are so focused on gaining a specific credential, on getting admission to a particular professional school or graduate program, or on receiving well-earned distinction at the time of graduation that they fail to have the full experience of participating in their student wards and stakes and in the spiritually strengthening activities and events on campus such as these devotionals. I can promise you that if you will plan your time, discipline your activities, and set your priorities properly, you will grow and develop in all spheres of your lives in ways that would not be possible elsewhere. You need to be intellectually stretched but also spiritually strengthened.<br><br>As I visit in various stakes on assignment around the world, I frequently meet Church leaders who express gratitude for three things: First, that they had the opportunity to meet their eternal companion at BYU; second, that they learned important lessons in Church administration and leadership in their student wards; and third--often mentioned third--that they received a wonderful education that has prepared them well for the careers they are pursuing. Be zealous in all of the good things your BYU experience offers you but avoid being overzealous in any one dimension that will lead you to being restrictive, confused, and misled in your quest to achieve all that you might gain here at BYU. Being overzealous will also cause you to miss opportunities to be of service to others in ways that might have been very beneficial to all involved while you are at BYU as well as limit your capacities for significant future service throughout your lives.<br><br>The Lord is aware of the tendency of the natural man and natural woman in all of us to be overzealous about some things and as a result be slothful and neglectful about others. As I conclude, let me turn to the scriptures for some important counsel.<br><br>First, from the concluding instruction of King Benjamin in his great benedictory address: He had spoken directly and clearly to his people about their tremendous responsibilities in living the gospel as he had taught it. He saw that they were anxious to be not only good and obedient but to do everything their prophet-king and the Lord asked of them. Think carefully and invite the Spirit to teach you while you consider these words:<br><br><i>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man</i>[or a woman]<i>should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</i>[Mosiah 4:27]<br><br>Second, from the counsel of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith after Joseph had made a very serious mistake when he was close to the age of most of you: You recall that while in the process of translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph let Martin Harris temporarily take 116 pages of the manuscript that were subsequently lost. Because of this terrible error, Joseph lost his gift of translation for a season, and he was terribly depressed and disappointed in the situation. After a period of repentance, the gift to translate was restored to young Joseph, and he was admonished to finish the work that he had been given to do. It was at this time that the Lord gave this wonderful tutorial that I likewise share with you:<br><br><i>Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent unto the end.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 10:4]<br><br>My counsel to you, my dear young friends, as you embark on this very important new academic semester, is to be clear in your priorities, in your understanding, in your faith, and in all your endeavors. Don't be like Zeniff, overzealous and stiff-necked. Be like King Benjamin, who received his message from an angel, and Joseph Smith, who was taught directly by the Lord.<br><br>Do what you do with wisdom and order. Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means, but be diligent always.<br><br>Thanks be to God our Heavenly Father and to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, for all Their blessings, and among the most precious currently is the privilege of being at Brigham Young University. That we might all demonstrate our love and appreciation for what we have and the possibilities before us I pray. Goddoes live and we are part of His great work. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Cecil O. Samuelson was BYU president when this devotional address was delivered on 7 September 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>e-A Commandment of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It has been my honor and privilege to greet several thousands of scholars such as you who have come to pursue an education at Brigham Young University. I love the excitement and energy you bring to campus when you are here. So, whether you are a returning BYU student, one who is transferring from another institution, or a new student who is beginning your experience here, welcome to fall semester 2010. I am grateful for the opportunity I have to associate with you during your days on this campus and express this gratitude often to my Heavenly Father.<br><br>Maybe some of you can recall your elementary school years and your return from summer vacation. More often than not, it seems, on the first day of school we were given an assignment to write about or draw a picture of something we did that summer. We would then have the opportunity to tell our fellow classmates about our summer vacation. I have not had to complete such an assignment for many years, and I doubt you did either on your first day of classes last week.<br><br>For several different reasons, however, this summer has been one in which I have been prompted to reflect often on my gratitude to my Heavenly Father for that which I have been given. If I were to write a paragraph on my summer experiences, it would express this: It was a summer that included deaths and disappointments as well as joys, successes, and many blessings. I had, as I do each day, many reminders of the love the Lord has for all of us.<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told: "Ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with" (D&amp;amp;C 46:32). In fact, the Lord has said:<br><br><i>And in nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things, and obey not his commandments.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 59:21]<br><br>Once we realize and understand that we can kindle God's wrath by neglecting to express to Him constantly our appreciation and thankfulness for His gifts to us, we hopefully will always acknowledge the source of all our blessings. In fact, ingratitude is a distressing sin in the eyes of the Lord.<br><br>We all are familiar with the parable of the 10 men who were lepers. Leprosy was a loathsome disease in which those suffering from it were isolated and called unclean. Each of us can imagine the horrible lives led by its sufferers. As Jesus entered into a certain village, there were 10 lepers who were not permitted to approach Him, and they stood away from Him. However, their pleading voices must have touched the heart of the Savior. Weread:<br><br><i>And when he saw them, he said unto them, Goshew yourselves unto the priests. And it came topass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</i><br><br><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i><br><br><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i><br><br><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i><br><br><i>There are not found that returned to give glory toGod, save this stranger.</i><br><br><i>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</i>[Luke 17:14–19]<br><br>One cannot help but wonder why the other nine did not return to thank their Master. Once cured from this devastating disease, they were clean and acceptable to enter society once again, and they could also be with their loved ones. Their happiness must have been overwhelming, and they must have been filled with amazement.<br><br>Then why did they not return to express their thankfulness? Were they so caught up with such joy at their miraculous recovery that they thought only of themselves and not of the Source of their healing? Did they think the priests were the ones who cured them? It is hard to imagine their ingratitude to the Lord. We read that the thankful leper was told that his faith had made him whole. We do not know what happened to the other nine. Could it be possible their future lives were not full and in the days that followed they did not receive such blessings as did the thankful leper? We do know that their ingratitude was a disappointment to Jesus. I would not want to belong to that party of nine. Would you? I think, however, that sometimes our behavior is similar.<br><br>We see in the world of today that many of us take for granted what we have. Our lives are often filled with so many activities--pulling us in different directions from dawn to dusk--that we may forget to "count our many blessings" and to be thankful for each one.<br><br>Do we find ourselves expressing our thanks for the obvious blessings in our lives such as family, home, gospel, educational opportunities, and so forth and then neglecting what one might consider "the little blessings"? I asked three of my grandchildren what they were thankful for and received the usual expected responses such as Mom, Dad, cousins, and so forth. Their expressions to me also included their thankfulness for a walk with Charlie, the neighbor's dog; Toby, a goldfish; and Milo, a friend. Children are excited about life and see and appreciate many things of great value that grown-ups sometimes overlook. We can learn much from youngsters about finding joy and gratitude in life's small blessings.<br><br>How often do we dwell on and worry about the things we don't have?<br><br><i>The story is told of a person who noticed that his friend was always happy. If there were gray skies, he celebrated the shapes of the clouds; if it stormed, he went out on the front porch to watch and wonder. At each day, he awakened not with anxiety or depression but with rejoicing. Finally, the one friend asked the other, "What is the secret of your happiness? You are not a wealthy man. You are not exempt from the heaviness and pain of this world, yet you are happier than most."</i><br><br><i>And the happy man answered in one word: "Gratitude."</i>[Given by J. Spencer Kinard, "The Power of Gratitude," in<i>A Moment's Pause: From the Spoken Word</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1989), 109–10]<br><br>This is a lesson for all of us--to be grateful for what we have in life. Gratitude is a virtue as well as a commandment. We should each have a thankful heart and acknowledge our bounteous gifts continuously.<br><br>One of my favorite definitions of happiness is not having what you like but liking what you have. Many hours may be wasted in thinking about what one may not have rather than what one does have. Gratitude and happiness seem to be linked together in our lives. Gratitude enables us to have peace and happiness.<br><br>There is a book that I have always remembered since I first read it many years ago. I feel it illustrates the scripture found in 1Thessalonians 5:18, which reads, "In every thing give thanks." Many of you may be acquainted with Corrie ten Boom's book entitled<i>The Hiding Place.</i>It is the true story of two Dutch women who were imprisoned during World War II for harboring Jewish refugees. Itsmessage bears reminding.<br><br>Corrie and Betsie ten Boom lived by the precepts of Christ and found great comfort in reading the Bible. Their prison barracks were dimly lit, dirty, foul smelling, crowded, and constantly patrolled by guards. Corrie was put into a cell with her sister, which was a blessing for them both. Her constant worry was that the guards would see their Bible and take it away, since it was a great source of hope and comfort to them.<br><br>The place was so infested with fleas that the sisters could not move without instantly being covered with the bugs. They were very familiar with scriptures concerning gratitude and thankfulness in the Bible. Betsie told Corrie that they should thank God for the fleas. Corrie wasn't sure she could do this, but she and Betsie bowed their heads and thanked God even for the fleas.<br><br>Weeks later Corrie was struck by the blessing that came from her obedience to thank God in all circumstances. Betsie had heard a supervisor say she wouldn't step through the door of their cell because of all the fleas, and neither would the guards. It was because of the fleas that they were able to continue to keep their Bible without the guards finding it. They were also able to hold worship meetings and share Christ's message with other prisoners. God asks us to give thanks even when there may seem to be little for which to be thankful. The ten Boom sisters fully understood this admonition. (See Corrie ten Boom, with John and Elizabeth Sherrill,<i>The Hiding Place</i>[New York: Bantam, 1971], 197–99, 208–9.)<br><br>When reflecting on what our expressions of gratitude should include, we might refer to section 46 of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which we are told that the Lord gives unto every man a gift by the spirit of God and that it comes for our benefit. Gifts such as listening, seeking that which is righteous, caring for others, and bearing a mighty testimony are mentioned along with others. Each of you has been blessed with such gifts and talents. I see this every day when I am in your midst. You are bright and talented, and your futures are filled with promise as you magnify and acknowledge the individual gifts and talents with which you have been blessed. Since we do not have time to discuss this section fully, Iwould encourage you to take the opportunity to study it as well as other writings relating to Christ's ministry in the New World in which you can gain further knowledge and insight.<br><br>I would imagine that each of you has at times asked the question "What is my gift or talent?" or maybe thought, "I don't have any." The Lord, however, has said that you do. It is your responsibility to recognize, develop, and share your gifts and talents so you can make the world a better place. Each of you has been endowed with different gifts, and what is given to one may not be given to another. Seeking after and developing them is expected of you by Heavenly Father, who gave them to you. Reliance on the Spirit can help you discover your innate capabilities.<br><br>You must also remember not to compete with or imitate others. Avoid comparisons. Value and be grateful for your own uniqueness. Constantly comparing yourself to others and using them to measure your self-worth is destructive. If you find an area in which you may feel you excel, focusing on that is not positive if it causes you to develop a feeling of superiority and smugness. If you find an area in which you feel you fall short, focusing on that is negative and can make you feel hopelessly inferior.<br><br>All of you are sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father. He loves you and has given you many blessings to help you build a testimony of Him and His teachings. Find your gifts and talents, acknowledge them in the spirit of thankfulness, develop them, and use them to serve others as well as His kingdom.<br><br>Each of us shows our gratitude by the way we live and our willingness to serve the Lord and keep His commandments. Gratitude is a commandment with a promise, as is taught in Doctrine and Covenants 78:19:<br><br><i>And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.</i><br><br>May we all have a grateful heart, count our many blessings, and use our gifts and talents to serve Him who loves each one of us is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Sharon G.

<h1>Peace and Happiness - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I have prayerfully prepared a message designed to bring you peace and happiness in a troubled world. I know that the truths it contains provide solutions because my precious wife, Jeanene, and I have proven their worth in our own lives.<br><br>For you to obtain the maximum benefit from our time together, I suggest that you carefully write down any impressions that come to you. They are personalized messages from the Lord sent through the Holy Ghost for your guidance.<br><h2><b>Temple Ordinances Strengthen the Family and the Home</b></h2><br>Two of the vital pillars that sustain Father in Heaven's plan of happiness are the family and the home. Their lofty significance is underscored by Satan's relentless efforts to splinter the family and to undermine the significance of temple ordinances, which bind the family together for eternity. He does this by constant encouragement to promote promiscuity and to defile the sacred, intimate expression of love between a husband and wife that results in the birth of children.<br><br>Fifty-seven years ago, on July 16, 1953, my beloved Jeanene and I knelt as a young couple at an altar in the Manti Utah Temple. President Lewis R. Anderson exercised the sealing authority and pronounced us husband and wife, wedded for time and for all eternity. Ihave no power to describe the peace and serenity that come from the assurance that, as I continue to live to qualify, I will be able to be with my beloved Jeanene and our obedient children forever because of that sacred ordinance performed with the proper priesthood authority in a house of the Lord.<br><br>Our seven children are bound to us by the sacred ordinances of the temple. My precious wife, Jeanene, and two of our children are beyond the veil. They provide a powerful motivation for each remaining member of our family to live so that together we can receive all of the eternal blessings promised in the temple.<br><br>The sealing in the temple has greater meaning as life unfolds and you discover the beauty of the differing characteristics between you, your spouse, and your children. You can share your love for each other and your gratitude for the blessing of being together. You can draw ever closer together and find greater fulfillment in mortality.<br><br>When my wife was carrying our third child, our second child was severely ill. Jeanene would hold him on her lap while they did fluoroscopic examinations. She received excessive radiation, and as a result she was unable to have additional children, and the one that she was carrying passed away prematurely. But we have them. They were born to us in the covenant. That is the blessing of the ordinances of the temple. Even though this mortal probation was for different lengths, those who were sealed to us with the holy priesthood through the ordinances of the holy temple will be ours for forever.<br><br>I know that I will have the privilege of being with that beautiful wife, whom I love with all my heart, and with those children who are with her on the other side of the veil, because of the opportunities made possible through the eternal ordinances that were performed in the Manti Temple. What a blessing to have once again on the earth the sealing authority, effective not only for this mortal life but for the eternities. I am grateful that the Lord has restored His gospel in its fulness, including the ordinances that are required for us to be happy in the world and to live everlastingly joyous lives in the hereafter.<br><br>What to me has become a vitally important part of remembering the blessings that come from the temple is that I love my wife more each day. I recognize that my sealing to my wife is in a sense not yet eternally conferred. We have lived the commandments. We have obtained the blessings of the ordinances in the temple. We have honored those commandments, but she and I both must be found worthy beyond the veil so that those ordinances can be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.<br><br>The requirement that it be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise is how Father in Heaven and the Savior assure that no one will gain those blessings unworthily. An individual may be able to deceive mortals by appearing to be righteous, but there can be no such deception with the Holy Ghost.<br><h2><b>Discussion with a Recently Married Young Couple</b></h2><br>I have asked Rebecca and Ben Marlowe, a recently married couple, to assist me as I try tohelp you prepare for eternal marriage.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Ben Marlowe, you are one extraordinarily blessed man. How did you capture the heart of an angel?<br><br><i>Ben Marlowe:</i>I know. She is beautiful.<br><br><i>Rebecca Marlowe:</i>It's the other way around.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>She is not only beautiful; she is very intelligent.<br><br><i>Ben:</i>Yes, she is.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>I know you are going to find that a blessing in your life as you continue your plans for the future. I would like to ask you some questions, if I may. Rebecca, has your sealing to Ben brought all the happiness you dreamed that it would?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>It's brought all that happiness and more, and the reason why is because, now that we're sealed, we can do everything together. That was something I didn't fully comprehend before we were sealed. Being able to do everything together and go through everything together has been such a blessing. And just knowing that no matter what happens we'll betogether forever is a wonderful blessing.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>How does Ben show his appreciation for you?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>Ben is so good at doing the little things, and for me that shows appreciation. It'snot a big thing here or a big thing there, but it is consistently doing little things to show that he is grateful for me.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>What does Rebecca do to make your life happy?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>Everything she does makes me happy.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Men, remember that phrase when you become a husband! That's outstanding. Do you make the vital decisions together? How do you do that?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>We do. We have had a lot of opportunities since we've been sealed to talk and discuss things that are coming up in both of our futures. Sometimes we may not totally agree, and that is something that is great for us because then we know that we can rely on Heavenly Father. That is something that we both always agree on.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>So, if there is a difference of opinion, you then work it out together through prayer with Heavenly Father.<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>Absolutely.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>That is a wonderful, wonderful pattern for life. How do you determine what should be the highest priority in your marriage?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>One thing that has been such a blessing for us is that ever since we've known each other we have had the same priorities in our lives. That has helped our marriage a great deal because we are both working together toward the same goals. We've determined that our priorities are, first, the Lord and the gospel--and that's really helped our marriage--then each other, our families, and the family that we have created together. Everything else just kind of falls into place when you put those things first.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>You can't go wrong when you have prayed to know what the will of the Lord is and then ask Him to help you fulfill it. That sounds like a wonderful pattern for a happy, productive, joyous life. Thank you. Have you ever disagreed on anything in your marriage?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>We have. Like I said earlier, we've had some opportunities where we have been able to learn and grow together.<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>I think that because of our backgrounds and different perspectives, of course there are going to be disagreements in marriage. But I think how you resolve them is the important thing. Like Ben said earlier, no matter what we disagree on, we always agree about going to the Lord. So that's how we resolve any disagreements that we may have.<br><br><i>Ben:</i>But I don't know how you can disagree with Rebecca.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>I think he is going to be a diplomat! Do you study the scriptures together?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>We do. It is such a special occasion when every morning or every night we have that opportunity to come together. One thing that we've really tried to do after we have had our personal study is to think of questions--maybe something we didn't understand. Then, as we come together as companions, we talk about those questions. She gives her insight because she has been blessed with a wonderful family who has given her so much knowledge of the gospel. And my mission and my family have helped me so much to gain gospel knowledge and also everyday knowledge that everybody needs.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>You are both blessed to be supported by parents who love you and who agree with what you are doing. That is an enormous blessing in life.<br><br>When I studied scriptures with my wife, she would read, I would read, and we would comment. We didn't necessarily read the passages together. Is that the pattern you've found useful or do you do it some other way?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>We always do our personal scripture study. Sometimes we will come together and, like Ben said, we will ask each other questions that we might have. I always have a lot more questions than he has. Sometimes we look at what is going on in our lives and the decisions that we are making or the challenges that we may be having, and we direct our personal study toward those things so that we can possibly find answers to our questions in the scriptures.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Do you have any counsel for the single and married young people who are listening to this about how you have found happiness in your marriage together?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>I think the greatest thing for myself is being able to spend personal time with Rebecca--always pushing aside work or school to make sure we have some time together so that we can talk, we can communicate, and we just continue to fall in love with one another.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Do you have a night when you normally date, when you can go out and do things?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>Yes, Friday night. He works at the MTC on Saturday nights because, I guess, they have the married people work on the weekend so that the single people can date. So Friday night is our date night.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Oh, that must be fun. What are some of the things you do on your date night?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>We love movies, so that is probably one of our favorite things to do--just sit and enjoy a movie--because it blocks out the things that we are worrying about or stressing about, and it is just that time we can be together.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>That may be great for a married couple, but I think it is a stupid idea for two people trying to get to know each other! If you are a young man trying to get to know a young girl, for heaven's sake, don't take her to a movie! Now, if you are married to an angel, Ican understand why you would do that.<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>I would agree with that, though.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Do exciting things. Do something that will make it an interesting evening. But don't do what I did. When I dated my wife, one night I passed a police car on the wrong side. They took us to the station. Can you imagine trying to impress a young lady by being in a police station?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>It is more exciting than the movies!<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>That is just like Rebecca. She always turns everything into a positive and always makes life happy. Are you planning to have your own family?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>Yes, we are. Absolutely. It is something that we constantly have on our minds because we recognize it is a commandment of Heavenly Father. Because we have had such wonderful families, we understand why it is so important in the gospel, and we desire to have that for ourselves.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Are you going to decide on how many children come, or are you going to let the Lord decide that?<br><br><i>Ben:</i>She has a number. I'm letting the Lord decide.<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>We'll let the Lord decide.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>I really want to thank you both for being so good to do this tonight. It is just a joy. Whenever I am around either one of you, my life is enriched. You know, Ben, that years ago when this angel was just a young child and my wife had passed away, she knew my spirit needed to be lifted. She would call me, and I would hear those words that would just thrill my heart: "Hi, Elder Scott. This is Rebecca." And from then on it has just been a wonderful blessing to know you and now to see you both so very, very happy in marriage.<br><br><i>Ben:</i>We are indeed very, very happy.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Is there anything you would like to comment on? You've got the world at your hand. Any suggestion you'd like to make?<br><br><i>Rebecca:</i>I think one thing that Ben is really, really good at that I have appreciated in our marriage is doing the little things. Do the little things that help your relationship keep going. Also spiritually--to read your scriptures every day, and pray together and individually every day, and go to the temple, and do those little things. I know that Ben's mission has blessed us so much because he was able to create those habits on his mission that he has implemented into our marriage and made it so much better.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Thank you.<br><br><i>Ben:</i>My only advice would be to say "Ilove you" every day. That is one thing that I have done in our marriage that has blessed us greatly. And not only to say it with your mouth--to mean it with your heart as well.<br><br><i>Elder Scott:</i>Thank you both very, very much.<br><h2><b>Focus on Building Family Relationships</b></h2><br>Once I learned an important lesson from my wife. I traveled extensively in my profession. I had been gone almost two weeks and returned home one Saturday morning. I had four hours before going to a meeting. I noticed that our little washing machine had broken down and my wife was washing the clothes by hand. Having an engineering background, I began to fix the machine.<br><br>Jeanene came by and said, "Rich, what are you doing?"<br><br>I said, "I'm repairing the washing machine so you don't have to do this by hand."<br><br>She said, "No. Go play with the children."<br><br>I said, "I can play with them anytime. I want to help you."<br><br>She said, "Richard, please go play with the children."<br><br>When she spoke to me that authoritatively, Isaluted and obeyed.<br><br>I had a marvelous time with our children. We chased each other around and rolled in the fall leaves. Later I went to my meeting. I probably would have forgotten that experience, were it not for the lesson that she wanted me tolearn.<br><br>The next morning, about 4:00 a.m., I was awakened as I felt two little arms around my neck, a kiss on the cheek, and these words whispered in my ear, which I will never forget: "Dad, I love you. You are my best, best friend."<br><br>Are you having that kind of experience with your children? If you are not, you are missing one of the supernal joys of life. If you have not yet married, you can decide now that when you are a parent the happiness of your children will be a very high priority in your life.<br><h2><b>Obedience Qualifies Us to Be Led by the Lord</b></h2><br>When you live the commandments of Jesus Christ, you qualify to be led by the Lord. Therefore, you will not participate in the wrong things that go on around you. You can identify an eternal companion with whom you will have a marvelous life as you both express faith in the Savior and His power and live worthily through your courtship.<br><br>Make the place where you live, no matter how humble or temporary, the embodiment of a clean, righteous environment where the Spirit can dwell. Keep it a haven of peace, free of conflict or dissension. This advice is given for both those who are married and those who are single. If you begin now to make your home an environment where the Spirit can dwell, it will be all the more likely that you will be able to do so when you have a family of your own.<br><br>Young men, don't waste time in idle pursuits. Serve a worthy mission. Then make your highest priority that of finding a worthy, eternal companion. Get on with life and work at it. Don't just coast through this period of life. It goes by too rapidly. When you find you are developing a strong interest in a young woman, show her that you are an exceptional person that she would find interesting to know better. Take her to places that are worthwhile. Show some ingenuity. It is all right to go to the movie after you are married, but it is stupid to do it beforehand. Get to know each other. If you want to have a wonderful wife, you have got to be attractive to her.<br><br>If you have found someone, begin to righteously grow those feelings together. You can form an extraordinarily wonderful courtship and marriage and be very, very happy eternally by staying within the bounds of worthiness the Lord has set.<br><br>How can two people in love avoid crossing the boundary and falling into temptation? Let us define love: To love another righteously is to protect, to elevate, to keep pure and undefiled, and to sacrifice one's self for the benefit of the other. To love is to hold in reserve sacred, intimate experiences for the sanctity of marriage. When these experiences are appropriately shared in marriage, they draw a husband and wife together and strengthen them for the growing responsibilities of parenthood. These sacred acts result in the formation of physical bodies for the spirit children Father in Heaven entrusts to a mother and father. In that sacred setting, appropriate intimate expression is beautiful and purposeful. When you remember these facts, you will want to keep your courtship clean and pure.<br><h2><b>Counsel to Married Couples</b></h2><br>Now I would like to speak to you who have already found your eternal companion. I invite those who are not yet married to listen closely so that when that time comes you can make your marriage the best it can be.<br><br>The family proclamation states that a husband and wife should be equal partners (see "The Family: A Proclamation to the World,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1995, 102). Many couples practice equal partnership with their companion to the benefit of both and to the blessing of their children. However, many do not. I encourage anyone who is reluctant to develop an equal partnership with his or her spouse to obey the inspired counsel of the Lord and do it. Equal partnership yields its greatest benefit when both husband and wife seek the will of the Lord in making important decisions for themselves and their family, as Ben and Rebecca have told us they do.<br><br>If you are married, are you faithful to your spouse mentally as well as physically? Are you loyal to your marriage covenants by never engaging in conversation with another person that you wouldn't want your spouse to overhear? Are you kind and supportive of your spouse and children?<br><br>Brethren, do you assist your wife by doing some of the household chores? Do you lead out in family activities such as scripture study, family prayer, and family home evening, or does your wife fill in the gap your lack of attention leaves in the home? Do you tell your wife often how very much you love her?<br><br>Express gratitude for what your spouse does for you. Express that love and gratitude often. That will make life far richer, more pleasant, and purposeful. Many women seldom hear a complimentary comment and are not thanked for the multitude of good they do. That's a tragedy. As a husband, when you sense that your wife needs lifting, hold her in your arms and tell her how very much you love her. May each of us ever be tender and appreciative of the special companion who enriches our lives.<br><br>As a husband, be aware of what you might unconsciously communicate by how you treat your wife in public. As I shake hands with members at the end of a meeting, occasionally I note that a man is in line in front of his wife. That is inappropriate--as a matter of fact, it's just plain stupid. It is demeaning to her. The simple gestures like opening the door on the car or in a room for a woman show you want to give her the respect she deserves.<br><br>As husband and wife, work as a partnership to build on each other's strengths. Listen to each other and help each other. I have seen men reject counsel from a wife who likely has struggled for a long time to find just the right moment to mention something the husband needed to change. Don't do that.<br><br>I will share an example to illustrate what Imean: Early in our marriage, Jeanene found just the right time to talk to me about something I know she had probably noticed ever since we had met. She said, "Rich, when you talk to people, look in their eyes. You look at the ceiling and the walls and the floor, but you never look in their eyes." That suggestion profoundly changed my life. My precious companion loved me enough to help me by telling me what I needed to know.<br><br>I learned from my wife the importance of exchanging notes. Early in our marriage Iwould open my scriptures to give a message and I would see an affectionate, supportive note slipped into the pages. Sometimes they were so tender that I could hardly talk. Those precious notes from a loving wife were and are a priceless treasure of comfort.<br><br>I began to do the same thing with her, not realizing how much they truly meant to her. When she passed away, I found in her private things how much she appreciated the simple messages we shared with each other. I found that she not only kept the notes, but she protected them with plastic coverings as if they were a valuable treasure. There is only one that she didn't put with the others. It is still behind the glass of our kitchen clock. It reads, "Jeanene, it is time to tell you I love you." It remains there to remind me constantly of that exceptional daughter of Father in Heaven.<br><br>In her final days of illness, I tried to find supporting scriptures that would help her. Iput printed copies of them around the house. I found each one of those messages carefully protected as if they were very valuable. In like manner, I have kept the precious notes she has given me.<br><br>As I have thought back over our life together, I realize how blessed we've been. There has never been an argument in our home, never an unkind word between us. Now I realize that blessing came because of her. It resulted from her willingness to give, to share, and to never think of herself. In our later life together, I tried to emulate her example. Isuggest that as husband and wife you do the same in your home, and when you singles are married, plan to do the same with your companion.<br><h2><b>Pure Love Brings Happiness</b></h2><br>Now I would speak of something that is most sacred. When we were created, Father in Heaven put in our body the capacity to stir powerful emotions. Within the covenant of marriage, when properly used in ways acceptable to both husband and wife and to the Lord, those emotions open the doors for children to come to earth. Such sacred expressions of love are an essential part of the covenant of marriage. Within marriage those emotions should be used to allow a couple to draw closer in oneness through the beautiful, appropriate expression of these feelings between a husband and wife. There are times in her life, brethren, when you need to constrain those feelings. There are times when you need to allow their full expression. Always be sensitive to her feelings. Let the Lord guide you in ways that will enrich your marriage.<br><br>There are men, and unfortunately some women, who experiment with stimulating those emotions by influences outside of the covenant of marriage. There is a powerful difference between love and lust. Pure love yields happiness and engenders trust. It is the foundation of eternal joy. Lust will destroy that which is enriching and beautiful. A married couple must have no private, hidden activities that are kept a secret from each other. That pattern of life provides powerful spiritual insurance. When you travel, take along a picture of your wife. Set it before you so that you can constantly see it, to remember how you are loved and trusted. You will not be tempted to contaminate your mind or violate your covenants.<br><br>Pure love is an incomparable, potent power for good. Righteous love is the foundation of a successful marriage. It is the primary cause of contented, well-developed children. Who can justly measure the righteous influence of a mother's love? What enduring fruits will result from the seeds of truth that you as a mother can carefully plant and lovingly cultivate in the fertile soil of your own child's trusting mind and heart? As a mother, you have been given divine instincts to help you sense your child's special talents and unique capacities. With your husband, you can nurture, strengthen, and cause those traits to flower.<br><br>Brethren, as a husband, consistently tell your wife how much you love her. It will bring her great happiness. I've heard men tell me when I say that, "Oh, she knows." You need to tell her. A woman needs that reassurance. She flowers and grows and is greatly blessed by it. Don't withhold those natural expressions of love. And it works a lot better if you are holding her close while you are telling her. As a son, tell your mother how you love her. It will give her great joy.<br><br>Let us be grateful to our Father in Heaven for His precious daughters. Let us help them as much as we can. Let us encourage every woman who questions her value to turn to her Heavenly Father and His glorified Son for a supernal confirmation of her immense individual worth. I testify that as each woman seeks that assurance in faith and obedience, the Savior will continually provide it through the Holy Ghost. That guidance will lead her to fulfillment, peace, and consuming joy through magnifying her divinely appointed, sacred womanhood.<br><h2><b>Blessings of Marriage</b></h2><br>Marriage is so wonderful. I feel sorry for you who haven't yet made that choice or haven't had the opportunity. You get to know each other very well. In time you begin to think alike and have the same ideas and impressions. You have times when you are extremely happy, times of testing, and times of trial, but the Lord guides you through all of those growth experiences together. I remember one occasion with a little boy who was very ill. He was in a hospital and passed away. As Jeanene and I drove from the hospital, we pulled over to the side of the road. I held her in my arms. Each of us cried a little, but we realized that we would have him beyond the veil because we had made those covenants in the temple, and that made itmuch easier.<br><br>Jeanene's kindness taught me so many valuable things. I was so immature, and she was so disciplined, so mature, and so spiritual.<br><br>It is so rewarding to be married. One night our little boy with a heart problem awoke. The two of us heard it. Normally my wife always got up to take care of a crying baby, but this time I said, "I'll take care of him."<br><br>Because of his problem, when he began to cry, his little heart would pound very rapidly. He would lose any food that he had eaten and soil the bed clothing. I knew that had happened, so I held him very close to try to calm his racing heart and stop his crying as I changed his clothes and put on new bedsheets. I held him until he went to sleep. I didn't know then that just a few months later he would pass away. I will always remember holding him in my arms.<br><br>Some parents are not physically able to have the children they most desire to form their own family. I am a witness that the Lord can guide such parents to spirits He would have in their home through the process of adoption. Later, when those children are sealed in the temple by the authority of the priesthood, they are in every sense equivalent to children born in the covenant to that couple.<br><br>Marriage enables you to really find out who you are. It provides an ideal setting for overcoming any tendency to be selfish or self-centered. I think one of the reasons that you are counseled to get married early in life is so that you won't develop inappropriate character traits that are hard to change.<br><h2><b>Tribute to My Wife, Jeanene</b></h2><br>I am grateful that Father in Heaven made women more sensitive, with greater capacity to express love, and more able to show patience and to keep things on an even keel. For women, the difference between right and wrong is as vivid as black and white, while many of us men see a wide range of gray. We haven't had arguments in our home, but that was because of a compassionate wife who always kept things in proper balance.<br><br>My precious wife, Jeanene, although afflicted with an aggressive terminal disease, consistently found joy in life. She understood the plan of happiness, had received the temple ordinances, and was doing her best to qualify for the promised blessings. Her personal journal records: "It is a beautiful fall day. I picked up the mail and sat down on the swing. I was so happy and content in the warm sun, the sweet smell of nature and the trees around me. I just sat and gloried in the fact that I am still alive on this beautiful earth. . . . The Lord is so good to me. How I thank Him that I am still here and feeling so good. I am soooooo happy I just want to shout and dance through this beautiful house as the sun streams into the big windows. I love being alive."<br><br>I know what it is to love a daughter of Father in Heaven who with grace and devotion lived the full feminine splendor of her righteous womanhood. I love my dearest wife, Jeanene. She was always joyously happy, and much of it came from service to others. Even while very ill, in her morning prayer she would ask her Father in Heaven to lead her to someone she could help. That sincere supplication was answered time and again. The burdens of many were eased; their lives were brightened. She was blessed continually for being an instrument directed by the Lord.<br><br>Please pardon me for speaking of my precious wife, Jeanene. But we are an eternal family. Although she is on the other side of the veil, that love and appreciation for each other continues to grow and mature. I am confident that when, in our future, I see her again beyond the veil, we will recognize that we are more deeply in love. We will appreciate each other even more, having spent this time separated by the veil. We have grown closer together through the kindness of the Lord.<br><h2><b>The Lord Keeps His Promises</b></h2><br>Some of you may feel lonely and unappreciated and cannot see how it will be possible for you to have the blessings of marriage and children or your own family. All things are possible to the Lord, and He keeps the promises He inspires His prophets to declare. Eternity is a long time. Have faith in those promises, and live to be worthy of them so that in His time the Lord can make them come true in your life. With certainty, you will receive every promised blessing for which you are worthy. I pray that it will be on this side of the veil.<br><br>In closing I share an eternal principle that will assure you of a rich, purposeful life whether you are single or married. I have found that the best way to live life is to seek to know the will of the Lord as guided by the Holy Spirit. He knows what is best for you. As you are obedient and exercise faith in Him, He will help you realize His will for you in your life. May the Lord inspire, guide, and richly bless each of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Richard G.

<h1>Our Essential Spiritual Gift - Robert D. Hales - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved young friends and associates, it is a joy for me to be with you, and I want you to know what a blessing it is to be on this beautiful campus! There really is nothing like it in the whole world. I want to thank President Samuelson and all who make BYU possible. You are a light to the world, and you will become a brighter light as we go through this dispensation.<br><br>Most of all, I am grateful for each of you, the students of this great university. Thank you for preparing yourselves to serve Heavenly Father's children. And thank you for standing as a witness of the Savior "at all times and in all things, and in all places."<sup>1</sup>We love you.<br><br>I believe you will look back on your decision to come to BYU as one of the most important choices of your life--a choice that will bless you and your families eternally. The choice to come to BYU is a choice that if you are obedient will make you independent of the things of the world. That is not easy.<br><br>I begin with a few questions that are so simple I hope you will not dismiss them too quickly: Do you know who you are? Do you know what you have been given and what a glorious future you have?<br><br>We are told we are children of God. We sing about it in Primary. We say it to others, hoping they will understand and believe it. But do we really know what it means?<br><br>How recently have we thanked Heavenly Father that we were born in the covenant, that we are members of the Church, that we are at this university? Or, if we weren't born in the covenant, have we thanked Him for the opportunities that we can make choices to be sealed in the temple so that we can receive the blessings of the covenant and pass them down to our posterity? For those born in the covenant or not, we have the same opportunities, if we make the right choices.<br><br>This morning I would like to visit with you about our choices and blessings. Before coming to this earth we lived with Heavenly Father. He gave us the incomparable gift of agency. We had an opportunity to use that gift in a Grand Council with all His children. On that momentous occasion Heavenly Father presented a plan to become like Him and inherit all that Hehas.<br><br>But Lucifer, our brother, rebelliously opposed this plan with one of his own--a plan that would give him the honor. He in fact said to the Father, "Give me thine honor."<sup>2</sup>But that would have destroyed the agency of man. Tragically, a third of our spiritual siblings used their agency to follow him. Like Cain, they "loved Satan more than God."<sup>3</sup><br><br>But we chose to follow our Savior, Jesus Christ. He chose, as we did, to accept our Heavenly Father's eternal plan. He offered to make that plan possible by being our Savior, saying, "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever."<sup>4</sup>Just the simple words: "Father, send me." By that singular choice, Jesus Christ made it possible for all of us to come to earth, exercise our agency, choose freely, repent of our sins, and become like our Heavenly Father.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, we are here now because we chose to follow Jesus Christ then. Today each of us has the opportunity to continue making the same choice: to come, to follow Him, and to be able to return to His presence. The scriptures say:<br><br><i>Wherefore,</i>[we]<i>are free according to the flesh; and all things are given</i>[us]<i>which are expedient unto</i>[us].<i>And</i>[we]<i>are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men</i>[Jesus Christ],<i>or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>It is our choice to choose light or darkness. This has been the plan for us and for all God's children from the beginning. From the scriptures we know that Adam was tempted by Lucifer, just as we are. For "it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet."<sup>6</sup>That is why there is and must be opposition in all things. It is for our growth and for our development here in mortality.<br><br>Because of that opposition, we have the essential spiritual agency to choose spiritual life here and eternal life in the world to come.<br><br>As we use our God-given agency to keep the commandments, we qualify for the life Heavenly Father wants us to have. In mortality, that life unfolds through a natural process of making choices and experiencing tests and trials. And the blessings come after the tests and trials and from how we handle them.<br><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith provides an ideal example. Think of the process of his life: He exercised his agency to seek which Church was right. He chose to talk to ministers and visit congregations. He chose to study the Bible. He chose to pray in the Sacred Grove. Through these choices he was developed to accomplish his foreordained mission.<br><br>This development always takes time and testing and faith. After the First Vision, Joseph was treated with suspicion, unkindness, and ridicule by members of the community. Three years later Moroni appeared to him and told him of the Book of Mormon. During the next four years, misunderstanding and hostility increased toward Joseph Smith and his family. He returned to the site to visit Moroni each year until finally he was deemed ready to receive the plates on which the Book of Mormon was written.<br><br>Through it all, the young Prophet was growing and maturing. He was learning to rely upon Heavenly Father and to seek guidance from His Holy Spirit.<br><br>So it is with all of us. We will be tested, often to our limit. Yet all of us know and are assured that we will never be tested more than that which we can endure. And the greatest blessings will be based on how<i>well</i>we<i></i>endure our tests.<br><br>I testify that whatever challenges or hardships we have, they are provided for a reason--so that we can become and accomplish what we were sent to the earth to be and to do.<br><br>This truth is taught in the scriptures: that we receive no witness until after the trial of our faith. Sometimes that trial consists of seeking understanding or waiting for an answer from the Lord. President David O. McKay prayed for a testimony in his boyhood, but it didn't come until several years later, while he was serving a mission in Scotland.<br><br>I had my own experience seeking and waiting on the Lord. As a boy I loved baseball and dreamed of becoming a professional ball player. I'm sure I didn't have major league talent, but I had the desire and the love for it. Baseball had surely captured my heart and soul. Then, when I was about 11 or 12, my father took me to the Sacred Grove. Through a simple but meaningful experience there, I began to sense that Heavenly Father had other things for me to do. We both had prayers. As time went on, divinely arranged opportunities helped me recognize that I was not meant to be a professional athlete. His plan for me was to put me on a course that led me to my calling to be an Apostle--and, I might add, led me to my sweetheart. I would not be here without her and have the opportunity to be with you this morning. I love my companion so much. She means so much to me, and I ask that you seek from your Heavenly Father that you might find that right companion who will have you be able to accomplish in this life what you are capable of becoming.<br><br>I testify that the life Heavenly Father has in store for each of us is more glorious than anything we can imagine or arrange for ourselves, but it won't come without challenges, and it won't come about all at once. His way is always to prepare us line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. And that always happens on His timetable.<br><br>In our fast-paced world, we are sometimes impatient for His plan to unfold. Popular culture tells us, "Get a life." My advice to all of us is, "Get an eternal life." By making right choices today, tomorrow, and for the rest of our time on earth, that eternal goal means the most to us.<br><br>As members of the Church, we are striving to make the right choices for the right reasons. Early in our marriage I suggested that we pay our tithing from out of our year-end bonus, which came after the first of the year. I was thinking about tithing like life insurance or fire insurance--something you pay to stay out of trouble. But my sweet wife and companion taught me: "No," she said, "we will pay tithing as we go, because we love the Lord and want to build His kingdom."<br><br>Where the kingdom is concerned, the willingness of our hearts is everything. We keep the commandments because we love Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. As we express that love, it is very simple. He said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments."<sup>7</sup>As we do, we lay the foundation of a great work, and out of these small things proceeds that which is great.<br><br>How do we lay that foundation? I'm going to tell you a story I have never told before. As a boy, I had the job of shellacking a wooden floor. As I neared the end of the task, my father found me in a terrible predicament. He literally stood at the door and laughed. I had worked from the only door to the far end of the room. I had painted myself into a corner, without a window. There was no escape! At that point I had two choices: sit down and accept being stuck for many hours until the varnish dried or walk back across the floor, undoing all I had done. I knew what it would take to refinish it properly. The sanding and refinishing--Iknew what was ahead of me, and so did my father. Because of the way I used my agency in painting the floor, my agency was diminished. In fact, my choices were not only drastically reduced but my agency was gone.<br><br>Whenever we use our agency, we are either choosing to move toward a new door with many possibilities or into a closed corner with very few options. If we do what is right, our opportunities increase. If we don't, our opportunities decrease.<br><br>You, my friends, are in the critical period Icall the decade of decisions. You must make many choices regarding education, employment, temple, missions, friends, dating, marriage, serving in the Church, and your family. As you choose, are your options and possibilities growing? Are you making the right choices? Is your future becoming brighter each day or are the lights dimming?<br><br>After the Prophet Joseph translated the first 116 pages of the Book of Mormon, Martin Harris insisted that he be loaned the manuscript. He wanted to show people what he was doing--his family and others. The Prophet responded by seeking the counsel of the Lord, who told him very clearly not to share the manuscript. But Brother Harris was undeterred, and the Prophet continued to ask the Lord. Finally, the Lord said, in effect, "All right, Joseph, have it your way." The Lord does not control or interfere with the exercise of our agency. The song in the hymnbook says He "will force no man to heav'n."<sup>8</sup><br><br>So the Prophet loaned the manuscript to Brother Harris. He listened to the people's voice, as Saul learned.<sup>9</sup>And then the manuscript disappeared. As a result, Joseph lost his ability to translate, and he had to come back and repent to the Lord. In this way the Prophet painted himself into a corner, and his options were reduced. Blessings were taken away from him. It was an agonizing experience until he was able to repent, to turn around, and to receive his power to translate once again so that he could fulfill the mission the Father had for him here on earth.<br><br>The Prophet's experience is just one way wepaint ourselves into a corner. Whenever we heed the opinions of men, we put ourselves in a corner. Whenever we become addicted to anything--drugs, money, shopping, adulation--we put ourselves in a corner. When we do not heed spiritual promptings and marry the wrong person, we put ourselves in a corner. When we don't do our homework or don't get the proper grades or don't prepare for a test or miss work or take offense or get angry or tell a lie--we put ourselves in a corner. There we are stuck, our options are limited, and our opportunities and power to choose are reduced.<br><br>Painting ourselves in a corner also happens when we do not pay heed to our own God-given gifts and talents, when we don't seek counsel from others, and when we don't obtain direction from the Lord.<br><br>When I was in college, I was blessed to audit a class in law school. As part of that class Iwas invited to go to a national debate conference and be a partner on a very fine debate team. While many thought I could be successful as an attorney and advised me to study the law, I found I didn't enjoy arguing oftentimes for a position that I could not agree with myself. The law is an important and valuable profession, and many have been prepared to serve the Lord through its practice. But it wasn't a work I enjoyed or that made the best use of my gifts. And it wasn't a work I had been prepared todo.<br><br>All of us should carefully consider what Heavenly Father wants us to do and how He may be preparing us. We should avoid trying to obtain the praise of the world and the honors of men.<br><br>When I was a little boy, my mother used to call me by saying as she went through the house, "Ding-ding, ding-ding. Calling Dr. Hales to surgery!" Being a doctor is a noble profession, but it wasn't right for me. I can't stand the sight of blood. Similarly, Harvard Law School is a highly valuable educational opportunity, but it wasn't what I was meant to do. I walked across a bridge and went to another school that I felt was better for me.<br><br>I caution all of us to avoid looking to the great and spacious building for answers to questions about our future pursuits, our companions, and our lifestyles. Instead, let us kneel and talk with our Heavenly Father, learn about our gifts and talents, find ways to develop them, make choices based on who we are and what we have been given, come to an understanding of what we are to accomplish here in mortality, and make the choices to bring it about.<br><br>Often the answers come when we seek the counsel of wise and trusted advisors--parents, priesthood leaders, teachers, and mature and dear friends. After I completed my master's degree, I went to a great leader at the university I was at and asked him for counsel. He agreed to give me counsel on two conditions: First, I had to come to him with a plan of my own; and, second, I had to follow his instructions and his counsel. "Otherwise," he told me, "the meeting would be a waste of both my time and yours."<br><br>Perhaps we should not agree in advance to take the counsel of anyone unless they have a spiritual stewardship for us. But aren't these the conditions for seeking counsel from the Lord in prayer?<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants we are taught that when we have a concern or question, we should study the matter out in our own mind and bring our plan to the Lord. Then, as we present that plan, we may either receive a burning in our heart or a stupor of thought. But these answers will not come unless we ask in faith--in other words, we have agreed in advance to accept the guidance of our Heavenly Father as delivered through His Spirit and through our obedience and to follow what we are told to do.<br><br>The principle of seeking this divine guidance is true for all decisions. The most naïve and destructive approach to life is to say, "I will do it my way. I can do it myself." Whoa. To succeed in mortality and to obtain eternal blessings, we should never act alone.<br><br>That is why we seek the advice of those who love us: our teachers, our parents, our priesthood leaders, and our eternal companions. That is why we seek the Lord--praying to know His will regarding the prayerful, diligent efforts we have made.<br><br>I am saddened when I think of the great potential of those who could have accomplished magnificent things in this life but who have lost the opportunity to do so by making wrong, foolish, or misguided choices.<br><br>I can hardly bear to think of those who squander their birthright because they misuse their agency. The servants of the Lord have reminded all of us: Pray daily. Study the scriptures. Get an education. Save your money and resist consumer debt--provident living. Avoid pornography. Exercise care in the media you consume. Keep the Word of Wisdom. Dress modestly and appropriately. Be morally clean. Obey the commandments and keep your covenants. Do they sound familiar? They are the most important choices we make to allow us tobe able to get the answers to our prayers and to be guided by the Spirit.<br><br>Exercising our essential spiritual agency isn't easy. Throughout His life the Savior sought to know and to do the will of His Father. In his 12th year he began to be about His Father's business. Throughout His ministry He lived the truths expressed in His great Intercessory Prayer: He was one with the Father. He did the will of His Father. He was totally obedient. He taught others what the Father had taught Him. He was always humble. He never took credit. He always glorified His Father.<br><br>But it wasn't easy! He was misunderstood, challenged, ridiculed, scorned, beaten, and ultimately crucified. He was the light shining in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended Him not.<sup>10</sup>For Him there were always pointing fingers and mocking voices. That is true for all who take upon them His name. We have to understand what comes from the great and spacious building and the world--it is pointing fingers and mocking voices. And, as Lehi learned, the same can be said for all who would sincerely, wholeheartedly follow Him.<br><br>Think of all the things that Job went through, yet he used his agency to remain faithful. Think of all that Joseph Smith had to go through. Think of Abraham, Abigail, Esther, Mary and Joseph, Peter, Nephi, Alma, Abinadi, Mormon, Moroni, Emma, and so many others. Think of our own ancestors and our pioneer forebears--the very heritage many of us have. Think of ourselves....<br><br>"And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name's sake, ... for great shall be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you."<sup>11</sup><br><br>A word of warning: When things get hard, the natural man looks for an easier way. The challenges of the latter days create the perfect environment for the doctrines of the anti-Christ to take root. The anti-Christ message is always the same: Don't do what is hard, don't follow the Savior, and don't use your agency to submit to the will of your Heavenly Father.<br><br>These perverted ideas were perfectly preached by Korihor and others like him, whotold the people:<br><br><i>Eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify</i>[us]<i>in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.</i><sup>12</sup><br><br>Don't you ever believe that. That is not the way it is. The way is through obedience and love. It is that sweet comment again of the Savior: "If ye love me, keep my commandments." In other words, be obedient.<br><br>This message the anti-Christ gives is the message of the secular movement in our world today. It robs us of our accountability and responsibility, diminishing our judgment and essential spiritual agency. Do not believe this destructive doctrine of men and of Lucifer. The closer we are to the Second Coming, the further we will be from being where the world is going. As the New Testament teaches, "Abstain from all appearance of evil."<sup>13</sup><br><br>Beloved young people, the world is getting darker, it is true. But we are called to walk in the light. We do not have to find a path for ourselves. As we did in our premortal life, we choose to follow Jesus Christ. He is the Light ofthe World.<br><br>He understands the challenge of walking His path. Remember, He "was in all points tempted like as we are<i>.</i>"<sup>14</sup>Even in the Garden of Gethsemane He had a choice. "All things are possible unto thee," He pled with His Father. "Take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."<sup>15</sup><br><br>When we end our prayers with "Thy will be done," we are doing what the Savior did in the Garden of Gethsemane, for what we are saying is, "Whatever the test, whatever I'm to learn, Iwill always love Thee."<br><br>The scenes leading to His crucifixion were filled with choices to suffer the cruel and ignorant behavior of His brothers and sisters. At times He used His agency to be silent. On the cross He chose mercy, praying, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."<sup>16</sup><br><br>In those awful hours He chose to endure not just the agony of physical death but the terrible separation from His Father, with whom He had always been. This was our Heavenly Father's plan--to allow His Son to fully exercise His agency to complete His work on His own. He called to His Father, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"<sup>17</sup><br><br>There may be moments in your life, as there have been in mine, when you'll have a moment like that--when you are in pain. He who could have called on legions of angels to carry Him home hung alone on the cross until that final moment when He chose to give up His life, His spirit--He being the only One who could do so--and He said: "It is finished."<sup>18</sup>For you and me, may we be able to finish this life and endure to the end and be able to say in our closing hours, "It is finished."<br><br>But the example of our Savior does not end there. He chose to preach unto the spirits in prison, who were filled with gladness and joy because "the Son of God appeared, declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful."<sup>19</sup><br><br>After three days in the Garden Tomb, He chose to take up His body again and break the bands of death. He appeared to Mary Magdalene and to many other believers, choosing to teach them, feed them, and encourage them in the work of the kingdom that was nowtheirs.<br><br>He chose to appear to the people on this continent--including the faithful who had been persecuted for believing in Him. In the thick darkness of destruction, the supernal confirmation that He had honorably kept His premortal promise was heard and felt by all: "Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name--hear ye him."<sup>20</sup><br><br>Then, high above the ruins of Bountiful, wearing a white robe and bearing the tokens of the Atonement in His hands and feet and side, He chose to descend--to call the people forth, to minister to them one by one, and to bless their children.<br><br>I express my eternal gratitude for the Savior's willingness to mark this path and His way for us by exercising His agency in righteousness. I bear my testimony and my special witness that our Savior freely and willingly chose to give His life for us. I pray we may freely and willingly choose to live our lives forHim and to lift and strengthen others.<br><br>I testify that His gospel is true. This is His Church. President Thomas S. Monson is His prophet. We are truly God's children with the essential spiritual agency to become like Him and to live with Him eternally. May this be our choice now and forever, I pray. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Robert D.

<br>
I admire those with musical talent. I sometimes wonder where I was when that type of talent was handed out. A best-selling book claims there is a way to excel. It claims that some of the greatest athletes, entrepreneurs, scientists, and musicians emerge after spending 10,000 hours in their chosen field as they master it. The book includes examples such as the musically talented Beatles and computer savvy Bill Gates, each of whom expended 10,000 hours of work in a specific field before achieving expertise.<sup>1</sup><br><br>I was raised in the mission field and had never seen more than 200 Latter-day Saints together. When 200 Church members were seen together it was either at a district conference or while visiting relatives in the small Mormon community of Virden, New Mexico.<br><br>Many of you can relate to having a similar background. Some of you can recall that the average Sunday meeting attendance was 25 people. Meetings were held in a rented building, and often cigarette butts and beer cans left by another group's Saturday night festivities had to be picked up.<br><br>My sister and I were the only Latter-day Saints in our high school. I remember receiving the advice that it is best to marry a Church member and that the marriage should be in the temple. As a teenager, I would look around and wonder, "Well, who is that going to be?"<br><br>My father received a promotion that necessitated moving to another town. In high school I was a stranger among my new classmates. On the first day in my American history class the teacher asked questions that served both as a preview of the course and as an attempt to arouse interest in history. Examples included<br><ul><br>	<li>Who really "discovered" America?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>What did Lewis and Clark do?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>Who was Pancho Villa?</li><br></ul><br><ul><br>	<li>What was Custer's Last Stand?</li><br></ul><br>One of the questions the teacher asked was: Do any of you know the real name of the Mormon Church? While my classmates had readily answered or attempted to answer the previous questions, no one responded to this one. After what seemed like a long period of silence, I slowly raised my hand and said, "The Mormon Church's name is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." Even today, many people do not know that answer. At the end of class, the teacher asked me to stay, and he politely asked if I was a Mormon. I replied, "Yes."<br><br>He became my advocate. I believe he was a factor in getting my name on the short list of nominees for various honors and recognitions during my high school years.<br><br>We all have an advocate and that is Jesus Christ. He is our Advocate with the Father, meaning that He pleads our case before the Father. It's part of the Atonement, of which I'll enlarge upon later.<sup>2</sup><br><h2><b>President Lorenzo Snow Was Rescued</b></h2><br>I've spent a career teaching and authoring books and other publications about helping injured people. During that time I've come across numerous rescue stories.<br><br>A story in Church history tells of the rescue of future Church president Lorenzo Snow. He was called on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands. After the ship's arrival Lorenzo and his companions were going ashore in a smaller boat when suddenly an immense wave capsized their tiny craft and washed them overboard. All were accounted for except Lorenzo. A frantic search turned up his lifeless body. His companions quickly made for the shore. Upon reaching land they rolled him over an empty barrel to expel the water. Then they were impressed to take turns applying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, a little-known technique at the time. Lorenzo miraculously recovered.<sup>3</sup><br><br>Here is a side note about the history of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The Paris Academy of Sciences in 1740 first suggested that for drowning victims mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should be tried. The technique did not catch on until two physicians promoted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in 1956. Between those dates, various methods such as blowing air into the victim's mouth with blacksmith billows and various ways of pushing on the back and chest and raising the arms were applied as attempts to revive nonbreathing victims. In 1960 researchers combined breaths and chest compressions to create CPR.<sup>4</sup><br><br>The American Heart Association and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines indicate that laypersons who are unable or unwilling to provide breaths should be encouraged to provide compression-only CPR to individuals suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, if a trained lay rescuer is able to perform breaths, then chest compressions and breaths should be provided. Breaths combined with compressions and compression-only CPR are currently considered equivalent.<sup>5</sup><br><h2><b>President Thomas S. Monson Was a Rescuer</b></h2><br>In many of his general conference addresses and talks to young men and women, President Thomas S. Monson has spoken about rescuers and heroes who have led lives worthy of emulation. He has reached into the scriptures for accounts, into history for anecdotes, and into newspapers and magazines for reports about individuals who have helped or even saved others. And he has shared a wealth of examples from his own experiences.<sup>6</sup><br><br>A little-known fact is that President Monson has rescued someone in distress. Here's how the story goes: A warm summer day found 12-year-old Thomas Monson floating in a large, inflated inner tube from a tractor tire down the river in Provo Canyon. Just as he was about to enter the swiftest part of the river, he heard frantic cries, "Save her! Save her!" A young woman had fallen into a deep part of the river. None of the people on the bank could swim to save her. President Monson reports that he saw the top of her head disappear several times under the water before he stretched forth his hand, grabbed her hair, and lifted her over the side of the tube. He paddled the tube with the young woman over to her relatives and friends, where he was hugged and kissed. He says that he was embarrassed and that he quickly returned to the tube and continued his float down the river.<sup>7</sup><br><br>President Monson's biography has a well-deserved title:<i>To the Rescue</i>.<sup>8</sup>The contents tell of his decades of saving people through his service.<br><h2><b>Rescue Stories</b></h2><br>In order to track their popularity, Hollywood movie stars, professional sports figures, politicians, companies, and organizations sometimes subscribe to a newspaper clipping service.<br><br>A number of years ago, I conducted a small research project dealing with rescues. There were no databases, so I subscribed to a newspaper clipping service for the purpose of collecting accounts of rescues from across the country.<br><br>In a single year, 520 news reports of rescues were collected. Excluded were professional rescuers such as lifeguards, police, and firefighters.<sup>9</sup><br><br>This project led me to search for other rescue stories. The press at that time carried an account of the rescue of a woman who had been swept downstream by a strong river current. Three teenagers riding their bicycles on a path near the river spotted the woman. While one of them went for help, the other two tried to catch up with the woman, who was helpless in the river. After about a mile they waded into the river and pulled the exhausted woman onto the bank. It was only then that one of the boys discovered that he had saved his own mother's life. This story should remind us that we never know who might need help.<br><h2><b>Helping Behavior</b></h2><br>You are being helpful when you provide directions to a lost driver, hold the door open for a stranger, pick up packages that have been dropped, or let someone in a hurry cut in line before you. These forms of helping are not very costly, and most of us give and receive such benefits every day.<br><br>Helping in these ways is so common that we often take them for granted as just a part of life. But other forms of helping can be more costly. People may go out of their way to return a lost wallet, offer assistance after a vehicle crash, or help free a stranger's car stuck in the snow. Not everyone does these things, but they happen frequently.<br><br>Some forms of helping are less tangible than holding open a door or pushing a car out of the snow. Often we are needed--or we need others--to provide moral support, encouraging words, or a shoulder to cry on. This kind of emotional help and social support is common among families and friends and is key to our having a happy and healthy life.<br><br>Most of you have heard the following: "Ishall pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now, . . . for Ishall not pass this way again."<sup>10</sup><br><h2><b>Decisions About Helping</b></h2><br>A good deal of research has been conducted on "bystander intervention." This describes the situation in which a person sees someone in trouble and must decide whether or not to help the victim.<sup>11</sup><br><br>As the preceding examples illustrate, there are many different ways in which a person can help others. Because of this diversity, I will focus upon spontaneous emergency help typically involving strangers.<br><br>At some time everyone will be faced with the decision of whether or not to help an injured victim. Making a quick decision to get involved is more likely to happen if we have already considered the possibility of facing an emergency and decided to help. With 180,000 injury-related deaths and 26 million disabling injuries each year in this country, everyone can expect to face an injured victim sometime during their lifetime.<sup>12</sup><br><br>Unless you were raised by Attila the Hun, you have been taught that it is good to help others. If you take a social psychology course, you will learn about a 28-year-old woman named Kitty Genovese, who was returning home from her job at about three o'clock in the morning. As she left her car, she was attacked and stabbed by a knife-wielding man. Her screams woke up the people in the building next to the parking lot, and the attacker fled but returned a few minutes later and stabbed her again. She screamed for help. Later investigations revealed that about a dozen people had either heard or seen the attack but did nothing.<sup>13</sup><br><br>The movie actor Sal Mineo, who starred in Hollywood classics such as<i>Giant</i>and<i>Exodus,</i>was returning to his apartment at about one o'clock in the morning. As he left his car, a knife-wielding man stabbed him. Several neighbors heard his screams for help and called the police. A man ran into the alley and gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as an effort to save him. The neighbors did not idly stand by.<sup>14</sup><br><br>The response of people to Sal Mineo being attacked shows that humans have compassion for others. However, the Kitty Genovese case demonstrates that people can have a callous disregard for another person's welfare.<br><h2><b>The Starfish Story</b></h2><br>Helping others can make a difference. Here's a story worth telling:<br><br>A man walking on an ocean beach noticed that a young man was reaching down, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean. As he came closer, he called out, "Good morning! What you are doing?"<br><br>The young man paused, looked up, and replied "Throwing starfish into the ocean."<br><br>"Why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?" asked the older man.<br><br>To this, the young man replied, "The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them in, they'll die."<br><br>Upon hearing this, the man said, "Young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish along every mile? You cannot possibly make adifference!"<br><br>At this the young man bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it landed in the water, he said, "It made a difference for that one."<sup>15</sup><br><br>Few stories have gained the Internet popularity the way the starfish story has. It's a story of the power within each one of us to make a difference in the lives of others. It's a strong reminder that we can help each other.<br><h2><b>Be Prepared to Help</b></h2><br>Thousands of people have spontaneously helped others. We should expect that if an earthquake or a car crash happens, many people will freely and willingly step forward tohelp.<br><br>The competency of a bystander plays a critical part in whether or not help will be offered. If the bystander has first-aid and CPR training, help is more likely to be given. Therefore, I strongly suggest that you obtain first-aid and CPR training. If you have already, you may need updating, because procedures have changed.<br><br>For example, first aiders no longer give syrup of ipecac for ingested poison, no longer apply pressure on the brachial or femoral arteries to help control bleeding, and no longer use suction for a venomous snakebite, and the list goes on. Also important to learn are a lot of new procedures replacing ineffective and unproven methods.<br><br>Sadly, less than one-third of the out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest victims receive CPR. But if effective and provided immediately, CPR doubles or triples a victim's chance of survival.<sup>16</sup><br><br>The rescuers we read about are not larger-than-life people; rather, they are ordinary people who have internalized a sense of empathy for others. They have developed a caring attitude and gained skills that prompt and enable them to respond to emergencies. Their moral values urge them to intervene.<br><h2><b>The Good Samaritan</b></h2><br>No discussion about helping others would be complete without covering the parable of the good Samaritan.<br><br>The parable appears only in the Gospel of Luke.<sup>17</sup>In the parable a Jewish traveler is beaten, robbed, and left half dead. First a priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan comes by and helps. Remember that Samaritans and Jews generally despised each other. The Samaritan helps by giving first aid to the victim, then transporting and staying with him until the next day. The Samaritan gives the innkeeper money to care for the victim with the understanding that if more was needed, on the next trip he would pay for the extra care.<br><br>There are two ways of looking at the parable of the good Samaritan, and both ways arecorrect.<br><br>One explanation has the parable being an allegory with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the man wounded by sins. For more information about the parable's symbolisms, BYU professor John W. Welch has authored a detailed analysis in Church magazines and<i>BYU Studies.</i><sup>18</sup><br><br>The second explanation has the parable exemplifying the ethics that Jesus espoused--that of helping our neighbor.<br><br>Of Jesus' parables, none has worked its way deeper into our beliefs. The phrase<i>good Samaritan</i>is used to describe any person who goes out of his or her way to help another. It's a theme that newspaper reporters love to feature, because it captures readers' attention and imagination. The largest recreational vehicle club in the United States gets its name, the Good Sam Club, from the idea of members helping one another. Numerous hospitals carry the name "Good Samaritan." The term<i>good Samaritan</i>appears as the title on one of my first-aid manuals.<sup>19</sup>Good Samaritan laws encourage people to help injured victims by granting them immunity against lawsuits.<br><br>In the parable, Jesus is not content just to define what<i>neighbor</i>means. He tells us to do as the Samaritan does, to help others who need help.<br><br>A California physician maintained a ledger that chronicled 120 people whose lives he had saved as a good Samaritan. The victims were not his patients in his office or a hospital. They were strangers. Most were involved in freeway car crashes. Others faced drowning, being thrown from a horse, electrocution, choking, cardiac arrest, and falling off a cliff. In all 120 cases, the doctor stepped in and saved a life.<sup>20</sup><br><h2><b>Jesus Christ Is Our Savior, Our Rescuer</b></h2><br>While the physician's story of saving 120 people is very commendable, the most significant rescuer that we have is Jesus Christ. He is known as our Savior for a good reason.<br><br>Only Jesus can save us. The clearest expression of this is given by King Benjamin in the Book of Mormon: "There shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name ofChrist."<sup>21</sup><br><br>To be saved by Jesus Christ means to be saved by the Atonement. There are several ways in which the Savior saves us:<sup>22</sup><br><br>1. All people will be resurrected from the dead and thus saved from physical death.<sup>23</sup><br><br>2. All people, except the sons of perdition, will be assigned to a kingdom of glory and thus be rescued from the influence of Satan.<sup>24</sup><br><br>3. The ultimate salvation, referred to in the scriptures, is known as exaltation. Exaltation is another way of saying "the type of life that God lives." This is life in the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom.<sup>25</sup><br><br>A simple explanation of how the Atonement works can be illustrated by a man falling into a pit so deep he cannot climb out. The man calls for help and a passerby puts a ladder down into the pit, allowing the man to climb out.<sup>26</sup><br><br>We are like the man in the pit. Committing sin is like falling into a pit, and we cannot get out by ourselves. Just as the passerby heard the man's cry for help, Heavenly Father sent His Only Begotten Son to provide the means for our escape. Jesus Christ's Atonement could be compared to the ladder; it gives us the means to climb out. Just as the man in the pit had to climb up the ladder, we must repent of our sins and obey the gospel principles and ordinances to climb out of our pit. Thus, "it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do."<sup>27</sup><br><h2><b>Closing</b></h2><br>We should be grateful that there is a way for us to overcome sin and physical death. I testify that Jesus Christ provides that way through the Atonement. He is our Savior, and it is in His name that I close, amen.<br><br><i>Alton L.

<h1>ed Matters - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I appreciate this opportunity very much. Iamgrateful for my loving wife of nearly 41 years, who is sitting near me on the stand today. She is a pillar of great strength in all that we do. I also acknowledge the attendance of family and friends and appreciate their support.<br><br>I was reflecting on the many special occasions I have experienced here in this building. My wife and I with our infant son moved here to BYU in January of 1971--nearly 40 years ago. The Marriott Center was just being completed at that time, and we were able to attend some of those early meetings and basketball games.<br><br>One of my fondest Marriott Center memories is the dedication of the Provo Temple in 1972. President Joseph Fielding Smith was presiding--we sat right about there, two-thirds of the way up. At the conclusion of that ceremony, with our white handkerchiefs in hand, thousands of young student voices sang "The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning." The Spirit of God was burning that day as we raised our voices in the glorious shout that concludes every dedication.<br><br>In like manner, I remember the quiet reverence of not too many months ago when we watched President Gordon B. Hinckley come through the portal right over there, waving his cane at us with fun in his eyes. That too was a time of deep emotion and connection with the Spirit.<br><br>Several years ago I was immersed in one of my favorite callings in the Church: I was working with the youth. On one outing we were deep in the middle of a several-day rafting trip on the Grande Ronde River in the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness of northeastern Oregon. After a long stretch of rapids and splashing each other's boats, we stopped for a rest, and the Varsity Scouts were anxious to run wild. As they began to run up the steep hillside, my co-Scout leader yelled at them with his best drill sergeant's voice: "STOP!" Surprisingly, two or three of them actually did stop, which Ifound amazing. He said, "Look around you." They looked and shrugged with a look of blank indifference. Then he said, "You are standing in the middle of a large patch of poison oak." Suddenly, the world looked very different to them. What had before been harmless brush now became dangerous, vivid, and brilliant. Their training about three shiny leaves jumped out at them in dazzling reality.<br><br>We have been asked to take a risky journey and plunge ourselves deep into the foliage of the world, and we are attempting to do so while avoiding the toxins that irritate and can potentially destroy the sensitive skin of our souls. The Savior said, "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but ... ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world" (John 15:19).<br><br>We often like to summarize the Savior's counsel and claim that we are in the world but not of the world. In a recent book by Charles Taylor entitled<i>A Secular Age,</i>the author suggests that society has transformed: we have shifted from a time within which it was virtually impossible not to believe in God to a time when the idea of God is, at best, elective. That is, we live in a time of ideological choice and preference. Today is a time within which faith, even for some devoted believers, is only a shaky possibility. We live in a unique era during which we are attempting to raise our families and transmit to them vital gospel themes and ideals, while we are concurrently bombarded by the deafening, pounding, and throbbing heartbeat of a secular age.<br><br>The primary point of my remarks today is to suggest that as we negotiate the challenging and dangerous paths of this life, we can draw on the power of the sacred, holy, divine, awe-inspiring, sanctified, and hallowed. And by doing so, there is value added: the strategies of the world can help us to achieve much of which is good, but when we add the power of the sacred to our lives, we are likely to acquire a distinctive and enhanced result that is stunning and even breathtaking.<br><br>One potentially toxic premise of a secular age is the notion of "flaming individualism." As a scripture says:<br><br><i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, ... disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</i><br><br><i>Without natural affection, ... despisers of those that are good,</i><br><br><i>... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</i>[2 Timothy 3:2–4]<br><br>While we scoff at those who once believed that the earth was the center of the universe, with sun and stars revolving around it, our world now teaches that<i>you</i>are the center of the universe. From this outlook everything is designed to make you personally happy, meet your desires, and convince us that life is about deserving the best. In a 1990 conference address, Elder Neal A. Maxwell described the attributes of personal selfishness:<br><br><i>We see in ourselves other familiar forms of selfishness: accepting or claiming undeserved credit; puffing deserved credit; being glad when others go wrong; resenting the genuine successes of others; preferring public vindication to private reconciliation; and taking "advantage of one because of his words." (2 Ne. 28:8.) All things are thus viewed selfishly--what are their implications for "me," much like the mattress on the highway which delayed traffic. When frustrated motorists finally got around the mattress, none stopped to remove it, because now there was nothing in it for him.</i><br><br><i>The Prophet Joseph Smith declared, "Mankind [is] naturally selfish, ambitious, and striving to excel one above another." (</i>The Words of Joseph Smith,<i>comp. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University, Religious Studies Center, 1980, p. 201.)</i>["Put Off the Natural Man, and Come Off Conqueror,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1990, 14]<br><br>In 2002, returning to the same theme, Elder Neal Maxwell declared:<br><br><i>Ultimate consecration is the yielding up of oneself to God</i>. Heart, soul,<i>and</i>mind<i>were the encompassing words of Christ in describing the first commandment, which is constantly, not periodically, operative (Matt. 22:37). If kept, then our performances will, in turn, be fully consecrated for the lasting welfare of our souls (see 2 Ne. 32:9).</i>["Consecrate Thy Performance,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 36]<br><br>The consecration that Elder Maxwell speaks of promotes the impression of a community of Saints bound together by love for one another, within which competition and rivalry are subdued. Such a community would also seek to diminish the gain ethic, discourage personal ambition, and promote activities that enhance the lasting welfare of our souls.<br><br>As we begin to think about the contrast between that which is sacred and that which is secular, I am reminded of the story of Joseph Smith, who for several years returned to the Hill Cumorah in attempts to secure the plates. Each time he was told that he wasn't ready. Moroni explained to Joseph that before he could receive the plates he must purify his soul and must not think upon the plates as having monetary worth.<br><br>When we view any activity, whether it be schoolwork, choosing a partner in marriage, leading or teaching in the Church, or whatever we engage in, we can see our "plates of gold" either with regard to their weight or with regard to their text and impact. If we think upon the weight of the gold, our results will become mundane, common, and shallow at best. However, when we see beyond the weight of the gold and look at the text on the plates through the sacred stones of the seer, then a vista of eternity is open to us.<br><br>Our primary resources in life are our time, our talents, our possessions, and our space. When we see those resources through the eyes of the world, we see only the weight of the gold and focus on selfishness and even on hoarding our resources for self-use. When we see the resources at hand through the eyes of the seer stone, then we see instead the power of consecration.<br><br>I have an example of how this works. I share the following story without the permission of my wife, Larri-Lea. I hope to get her permission shortly after this presentation at lunch--and I can say without a doubt that I amin serious trouble.<br><br>When we moved here in 1999, one of the key features of making the decision to come to BYU from another university was the opportunity for Larri-Lea to finish her undergraduate schooling. Her degree had been shelved and rerouted for many years as we raised our five children. Soon after we arrived at BYU, she began taking classes. The courses were sometimes challenging, but the joy in her eyes that came from being here on campus was marvelous to see: she loved it with all her heart (except for accounting).<br><br>In the fall and winter of 2001 and 2002, my mother became ill with cancer. At that time, my parents lived in Oregon and accessibility was difficult. It became clear, however, that extended assistance was needed. Without much fanfare--but with a great deal of determination--Larri-Lea quickly volunteered to go to my mother's bedside and be with her during the long weeks of her illness until her death. Again, without whining or complaint, she simply unenrolled from her classes and consecrated her most valuable resource--herself--tothe care of my mother during those months ofillness.<br><br>The more harsh versions of secular family life would suggest that when women take on care responsibilities and are not equally employed and contributing to personal self-enhancement, they are being taken advantage of. From the sacred point of view, Larri-Lea knew that her greatest and most important contribution was to provide loving care to a family member in need. We talked frequently about our consecrated responsibilities and what was needed at the time. I tried very hard not to insist, push, or demand that she stay and be a daily part of my life; nor did I pressure her to go to my mother's side. Instead, our discussions focused on consecration, sacred responsibilities, and what was best for that situation at that time for our family. The story does not end.<br><br>Later that year, after my mother's death, Larri-Lea did return to school for a short time, only to discover that her own mother was dying from cancer, also in Oregon. I remember the hot August day when we were purchasing a used car. The conversation again turned to consecration. We concluded that what was needed was not a car for our personal gratification (and we found one that was a beauty), but one that would be economical and dependable, get good gas mileage, have four doors, and could assist Larri-Lea in this second errand of mercy. In other words, because of our knowledge of and belief in the sacred, the decision was transformed, and we saw the choice through different eyes.<br><br>Once again Larri-Lea abandoned her beloved studies and made the long journey to southern Oregon several times over the following year, staying for weeks at a time to care for her mother. Her mother died in the spring 2005--thousands of miles were logged on the car--thousands of hours of selfless consecrated service were given.<br><br>Once again Larri-Lea started classes, but interruptions and diversions continued to slow her down. During this time she was called to serve as the Relief Society president in our ward. The schooling was again shelved.<br><br>In the summer of 2009, she was considering again reentering school with the goal of finishing her degree. But once again an unexpected family crisis intervened. With some discouragement that soon changed into resolve, she put her notebooks back on the shelf as she became primary caretaker for our two grandchildren who now live with us along with their mother. Through the lens of the sacred, choices were made and adjustments were put in place.<br><br>She is a wonderful, loving grandmother, who has made a huge difference in the lives of these two beautiful children. No wonder some of our family members refer to Larri-Lea as St.Lea. And with that last comment, I am now seriously in the doghouse.<br><br>This short story illuminates clearly how turning toward and employing a sacred principle can strengthen and enhance the quality of daily family life. I hasten to add that I am not necessarily proposing that all women should abandon their education or careers to do such service. And I am not suggesting that only LDS women and men make those kinds of Christlike decisions. However, I do believe that, for many of us, seeing the world through a sacred lens means that decisions we make will be transformed into something better and more powerful when we see them through sacred eyes.<br><br>When Larri-Lea saw this dilemma through a sacred lens, I know the words of King Benjamin came to her mind, when he declared that when we are in the service of our fellow man (and women and children) we are in the service of God (see Mosiah 2:17).<br><br>As an aside, we talked a few days ago about Larri-Lea reentering school the upcoming winter term. My first thought was to wonder which family member was going to need help next.<br><br>My next example of how the sacred matters comes from my study of family conflict. From a research point of view, family science researchers have been studying the nature of family conflict for many years. I am currently the project director for a large-scale study of about 700 families living here in Utah County and in Washington State. Each year for the past four years our research team, including a small army of undergraduates, has spent its summers in the homes of each of these families as we record and track their progress, problems, strengths, and challenges. One of the areas we track is family conflict. We note in our research that when marital conflict is high, so is an imbalance of power in families. Children are less likely to report that their family members are kind to one another, and the amount of relational aggression soars. Relational aggression is when one partner says of the other: "When we are not getting along, he ignores me when he is angry" or "She withholds affection when angry" or "She tries to get others to take sides with her, to get them upset also."<br><br>From a family science point of view, this is a serious issue and one that should be addressed. In our sample of families, both in Utah and in Washington, about a third of our couples struggled with moderate to fairly high levels of marital conflict. This is not unusual compared to other data about conflict, but it is troubling nonetheless. From a typical research point of view, we care about this issue because we know that often couple conflict leads to marital breakdown, it can frequently escalate to emotional and/or physical abuse, and it has significant effects on how children see the world, on how trusting they are, on how secure they feel, and even on their school performance.<br><br>For just a moment, however, let's turn away from thinking about this topic from a typical secular research viewpoint and consider the same issue from a sacred lens.<br><br>Think of the talk Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave in conference last week about the struggles Joseph had when he was translating the Book of Mormon. During his translating efforts, he was having a tiff with Emma. Some type of conflict arose and words were exchanged. The result was that he could not continue translation until that issue had been resolved.<br><br>Principle: When contention is high, the Spirit cannot reside with us, and the sacred lens goes dark.<br><br>Think of the scripture in Revelations 2:17:<br><br><i>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith ...</i>[to]<i>him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</i><br><br>Like Joseph the translator and communicator with God, we too can be given the "white stone" so that we can see past the gibberish of this world and into the majesty of eternity.<br><br>When the Spirit is with us, and we begin toreceive the hidden manna, our decisions aremore powerful--or directions are clearer--and our confidence is stronger. Brothers and sisters, we need the manna from God each day; it cannot be stored for future use, and it isvitalfor daily survival. That is particularly true when considering the trials and problems that face us in daily family life. In short, we need our daily manna--our daily bread--in the form of strokes of ideas that come fromhigh.<br><br>Joseph said once, as recorded in<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>that:<br><br><i>A person may profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.) those things that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ Jesus</i>. [<i>Teachings,</i>151]<br><br>So, a key way we can solve problems in families is by having strokes of ideas that will help us learn from the Spirit, and those ideas will take us well beyond our common understanding.<br><br>Now let's connect conflict to this issue. It turns out that we are much less likely to receive those ideas when there is conflict, intimidation, compulsion, coercion, contention, strife, control, and domination. Think of the Savior's words in 3 Nephi and consider this inspired counsel:<br><br><i>There shall be no disputations among you. ...</i><br><br><i>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</i><br><br><i>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away</i>. [3 Nephi 11:28–30]<br><br>Notice also that this pronouncement was one of the very first things that the Savior said to the people after He descended and walked among them. It is as if He were saying:<br><br><i>Unless you stop the contention, conflict, strife, control, and intimidation, I cannot be with you. If I am not with you, the Spirit will withdraw, the manna will cease, and the strokes of ideas will not come. You will be left on your own to spiritually starve.</i><br><br>This sacred view of power, conflict, and contention is further illuminated in Doctrine and Covenants 121:35–46. We note that the three defining and deadly elements of destructive relationships are control, dominion, and compulsion. By contrast, the Lord gives us His relationship manna on the other side of the page. Relationships are enhanced, decisions are stronger, and confidence is boosted when we approach others with genuine love, patience, persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, and meekness (see D&amp;amp;C 121:39).<br><br>In contrast to a relationship that is bathed in the gentle manna of kindness, patience, persuasion, and tolerance is the destructive havoc that reigns from unrighteous control and compulsion, clearly illuminated by President Gordon B. Hinckley in a conference talk:<br><br><i>You cannot afford to do anything that would place a curtain between you and the ministering of angels in your behalf.</i>[Think of the sudden strokes of ideas.]<br><br><i>You cannot be immoral in any sense. You cannot be dishonest. You cannot cheat or lie. You cannot take the name of God in vain or use filthy language and still have the right to the ministering of angels....</i><br><br><i>In the marriage companionship there is neither inferiority nor superiority. The woman does not walk ahead of the man; neither does the man walk ahead of the woman. They walk side by side as a son and daughter of God on an eternal journey.</i><br><br><i>She is not your servant, your chattel, nor anything of the kind.</i><br><br><i>How tragic and utterly disgusting a phenomenon is wife abuse. Any man in this Church who abuses his wife, who demeans her, who insults her, who exercises unrighteous dominion over her is unworthy to hold the priesthood. Though he may have been ordained, the heavens will withdraw, the Spirit of the Lord will be grieved, and it will be amen to the authority of the priesthood of that man.</i>["Personal Worthiness to Exercise the Priesthood,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 2002, 52–54]<br><br>The connection, then, is complete. We need strokes of ideas that transcend our frail attempts. It is very unlikely that those ideas will come if we are embroiled in conflict. That view of conflict is not to be found nor understood in secular understanding.<br><br>What I am gesturing at in this talk is that the ideological position we begin with is the foundation from which everything else flows. From our worldview flows everything we are and all that we try to accomplish. When we move beyond the secular, we will find light and strength through our own "white stone" of personal revelation. With that power, we will be given access to divine and astonishing secrets at every turn.<br><br>For me there is no more vivid image than the one suggested by a passage in the book of Helaman:<br><br><i>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</i>[Helaman 5:12]<br><br>I testify that the shafts<i>are</i>in the whirlwind: the hail and mighty storm is here. The forecast is for mighty storms, a deluge of worldly influence, complete with a tsunami of evil, with temperatures somewhere in the hundreds. Yes, there is a gulf of misery, and, no, this is not a metaphorical scare tactic. The effects are real, the devastation is palpable, and misery is vast. Like the Scoutmaster in my first story, I am asking you to stop just for a minute and look around. Are you standing knee-deep in poisonoak?<br><br>We can respond to the sting of this penetrating storm and strengthen our families by embracing a more sacred approach in all we do and by becoming worthy of the Second Comforter, even Jesus Christ, who will personally supply us with the "white-stone" revelation. I so testify in the holy name of Jesus of Nazareth, whom I know to be an ally and friend, and who is the Son of God, amen.<br><br><i>Randal D.

<h1>ener of Gethsemane - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that introduction, President Samuelson. Fellow students, today I feel much like King Benjamin did when he spoke to his people: "For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you."<sup>1</sup>I have anticipated the anxiety of this moment for many months.<br><br>Thinking that I would get a sympathetic reaction from my library colleagues, I told them about my invitation to give a devotional address. That news, however, was met with an almost universal reaction: laughter. That was not the sort of empathy I was hoping for. My exercise buddies in the Richards Building, however, were full of advice about what I could say to you--most of it worthless. But thanks anyway, guys. I owe you one.<br><br>In the summer of 1842, the British artist William Henry Bartlett visited the Holy Land. He described his first views of the city of Jerusalem:<br><br><i>We descend the steep broken path on the left of our view into the valley of the Kidron; and crossing its dry bed by a small arch, reach a remarkable group of objects, venerable in the traditions of the place. On our right is a stony plot of ground surrounded by a low wall, and enclosing eight olive-trees of very great antiquity. Our sketch will give an idea of the gnarled and time-worn character of these trees, supposed to be those of the Garden of Gethsemane. . . . The trees themselves reminded me of the celebrated cedars of Solomon on Mount Lebanon, in the disproportionate hugeness of their venerable trunks to the thin foliage above. For ages the pilgrim has knelt and kissed them with tears, carrying thence a few of the scattered fruit, or a portion of the bark, to remind him of the spot where, for his salvation, the soul of his Redeemer "was sorrowful even unto death."</i><sup>2</sup><br><br>Modern pilgrims still take away relics from this holy place. Just a few years ago my neighbors returned from Israel with olive leaves collected from the ground in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br><br>I have often thought of that holy garden and how, nearly two thousand years ago, the ancestors of today's trees witnessed the beginning of Christ's atoning sacrifice. If they now had a voice, what a story they could tell!<br><br>I have also often thought that surely, since it was a garden, there was no doubt a gardener who lovingly tended those trees: nourishing them with precious water in times of drought, carefully pruning them to encourage their fruit, and harvesting the ripened olives.<br><br>It is more than symbolic, I believe, that the scriptures often speak of the Savior as just such a gardener. Quoting the prophet Zenos, the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob said this:<br><br><i>Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of Israel, like unto a tame olive-tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.</i><br><br><i>And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive-tree began to decay; and he said: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>One of my favorite stories of how the Savior directs our lives is told by Elder Hugh B. Brown, who, throughout most of my teenage years, was a counselor to President David O. McKay and was much loved by Church members. I first heard this story when I was a missionary in Germany in the 1960s. One of my fellow missionaries was a grandson of President Brown and had a tape recording of his grandfather relating this experience, which he entitled "The Gardener and the Currant Bush." I'll use President Brown's own words:<br><br><i>In the early dawn, a young gardener was pruning his trees and shrubs. He had one choice currant bush which had gone too much to wood. He feared therefore that it would produce little, if any, fruit.</i><br><br><i>Accordingly, he trimmed and pruned the bush and cut it back. In fact, when he had finished, there was little left but stumps and roots.</i><br><br><i>Tenderly he considered what was left. It looked so sad and deeply hurt. On every stump there seemed to be a tear where the pruning knife had cut away the growth of early spring. The poor bush seemed to speak to him, and he thought he heard it say,</i>"<i>Oh, how could you be so cruel to me; you who claim to be my friend, who planted me and cared for me when I was young, and nurtured and encouraged me to grow? Could you not see that I was rapidly responding to your care? I was nearly half as large as the trees across the fence, and might soon have become like one of them. But now you've cut my branches back; the green, attractive leaves are gone, and I am in disgrace among my fellows."</i><br><br><i>The young gardener looked at the weeping bush and heard its plea with sympathetic understanding. His voice was full of kindness as he said,</i>"<i>Do not cry; what I have done to you was necessary that you might be a prize currant bush in my garden. . . .</i><br><br><i>". . . You must not weep; all this will be for your good; and some day, when you see more clearly, when you are richly laden with luscious fruit, you will thank me and say, 'Surely, he was a wise and loving gardener. He knew the purpose of my being, and I thank him now for what I then thought was cruelty.'"</i><br><br>At this point in the telling, Elder Brown's story became a personal reflection as he looked back 40 years to when he was an officer in the Canadian army, stationed in England during World War I. An opportunity for promotion had unexpectedly come up, and he was ordered to report to his commanding officer's quarters. Elder Brown had prepared for years for just such a position as the one he fully expected to be offered. He was confident that he would be given the promotion and the success of his military career would be assured.<br><br>As he entered the commanding officer's quarters, President Brown noticed his own personnel file lying open on the desk in front of his superior. He also noticed a note written in a clear hand saying, "This man is a Mormon." Elder Brown was informed that he would not be given the promotion he was expecting and was assigned what he considered a "relatively unimportant post." He was crushed. He was convinced that his fellow soldiers would view this assignment as a sign that he had failed.<br><br>He returned to his tent and knelt next to his cot and wept. He knew that he could never achieve his goals of becoming a high-ranking military officer. He cried out to God:<br><br><i>"Oh, how could you be so cruel to me? You who claim to be my friend--you who brought me here and nurtured and encouraged me to grow. Could you not see that I was almost equal to the other men whom I have so long admired? But now I have been cut down. I am in disgrace among my fellows. Oh, how could you do this to me?"</i><br><br>Elder Brown felt humiliated, and his heart was full of bitterness. Then he seemed to hear an echo from the past. The words that were in his mind were words he had heard before--but where? Then he realized that they were the words of the currant bush, and his memory whispered: "I'm the gardener here."<br><br>The remembrance of that long-forgotten incident in the garden came rushing back to him, and his own memory answered the bitter plea he had cast at God:<br><br><i>"Do not cry . . . what I have done to you was necessary . . . you were not intended for what you sought to be, . . . if I had allowed you to continue . . . you would have failed in the purpose for which I planted you and my plans for you would have been defeated. . . . Some day when you are richly laden with experience you will say, 'He was a wise gardener. He knew the purpose of my earth life. I thank him now for what I thought was cruel.'"</i><br><br>Remorseful, the bitterness washed from his heart, President Brown spoke humbly to God and confessed:<br><br><i>"I know you now. You are the gardener, and I the currant bush. Help me, dear God, to endure the pruning, and to grow as you would have me grow; to take my allotted place in life and ever more to say, 'Thy will not mine be done.'"</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>When I first heard this story as a missionary, I considered it a charming, moralistic tale with little relevance to my own life and aspirations. Looking back over 40 years, however, I see it more as a pattern of my life than I had ever anticipated.<br><br>When I graduated in 1970 with a BA in history, I considered many options for a career but decided to pursue a master's degree in library science, which was then offered here. In 1972 I began working at BYU as the assistant curator of Special Collections. The work was interesting, challenging, and satisfying. But for some reason--I can't even imagine what it was now--I was restless and wanted to do something different and more challenging.<br><br>I told my wife I wanted to go to law school. "Are you sure?" was her reply. "Oh yes, positive. No question about it," was no doubt my answer--or something like that. So I did everything aspiring law students do: LSAT, countless applications, prayer, fasting, and more prayer. Since my wife is from Vermont, we decided we'd apply to schools in the East. Iwas admitted to Syracuse University's School of Law in 1975, so we sold our house, packed up our belongings, and moved our family--two young girls and one more baby on the way--to Syracuse, New York.<br><br>Zenos described this process of transplantation: "And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will."<sup>5</sup>And so we were grafted in, inanother part of the kingdom.<br><br>I didn't realize it at the time, but I later learned that when young BYU graduates move into communities around the world, local ward and branch leaders have great expectations that they will arrive with strong leadership skills, a solid testimony of the gospel, and the ability to assume with confidence any calling in the Church. A BYU education is outstanding preparation for graduate school and successful careers. It also prepares you for leadership positions in the community and in the Church.<br><br>So we were welcomed by Church members in Syracuse with excitement and expectation. We felt the Lord had indeed grafted us into this ward by calling us to Church assignments of service.<br><br>But something felt surprisingly uneasy about my experience in law school. After the first year I knew I wouldn't be comfortable practicing law. When I discussed my uneasiness with my wife, she was less than sympathetic, saying something to this effect: "You've moved us halfway across the country; you're going to finish law school!" She's a tough lady; but she's also generally right.<br><br>So persevere I did, and, as instructed, I graduated. Somewhere during my last year of law school I got the idea of becoming an FBI agent. I suppose I was intrigued by what I thought would be the excitement of law enforcement and investigative work. The idea never occurred to me that perhaps I wouldn't be suited for such a profession. My patriarchal blessing contains language indicating that I would succeed at the vocation of my choice. In my own somewhat convoluted reasoning, I presumed that this meant that I only had to choose an honorable profession and success would be assured.<br><br>Those of you who have applied for a federal job know that the wheels of our national government can move painfully slow. I went through the psychological screening, personal interviews, foreign language testing, and physical examinations rather quickly. Then I waited . . . and waited . . . and waited for something to happen. Fifteen months after graduation I was finally invited to join a new agents class at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.<br><br>Needless to say, I was excited, nervous, and optimistic about my future. I felt like I stood on the threshold of a promising and successful career. I had talked with many FBI, CIA, and Secret Service agents and believed I truly could excel in law enforcement.<br><br>The first few weeks of new agent training went very well. There was classroom instruction in various aspects of case investigations, psychology, and constitutional law, along with challenging physical fitness goals to meet and firearms instruction. About four weeks into training we were introduced to the indoor firing range. As I stood on the firing line, ready to fire at the target some 25 yards away, the overhead lights went out. The only lights on in the range were over the target. I raised my gun and pointed it down range. I couldn't see the sight on the end of the barrel! I blinked my eyes--no change. There was just a blur where the sight should be. I fired six wildly inaccurate shots at the target. I couldn't believe what was happening! I had fired effectively on the outdoor range, but my eyes were doing strange things to me in the subdued lighting of the indoor range. My instructors pulled me aside and asked what was happening. I said I didn't know, but I was encouraged that they were willing to work with me to get through what we all thought would be a simple training problem.<br><br>One Saturday shortly after that, I checked out from the armory a "red handle," a weapon that had its firing pin removed, and went into the woods to practice dry firing at targets. It was a cloudy day, and I had the same experience as on the indoor range. The sight on the end of the barrel disappeared in a blur. "This can't be happening," I thought. "Maybe I should pray about this," I reasoned. Enos, the Book of Mormon prophet, had a "wrestle before God" that resulted in the remission of his sins.<sup>6</sup>But it wasn't sin I was trying to free myself of--it was a physical condition that seriously hampered my ability to fire my weapon accurately. So for hours I wandered the woods, alternately firing and praying. Things, however, didn't get better.<br><br>As luck would have it, my wife had our fourth child just a few days later, and I was given permission to fly back for the weekend to Connecticut, where she was staying with her parents. While in Hartford I was able to visit my eye doctor about my problem on the firing range. He told me that because of the severe astigmatism that I have in each eye, I couldn't hope for any vision improvement. My wife and I discussed our options, which were basically to try to stick with it and hope I could qualify on the firing range or to resign from the Bureau. On the flight back to Washington, D.C., I thought about my situation and remembered Elder Brown and his story of the gardener and the currant bush. Why was God doing this to me? Hadn't I been promised that I would succeed in the vocation of my choosing? Why was I being subjected to this painful pruning?<br><br>The next day I met with the special agent who was our class counselor and told him of my situation. I explained how uncomfortable Ifelt carrying a gun that I knew I would not be able to fire accurately in certain lighting conditions. I would not only be a danger to criminals, I'd be a hazard to my fellow agents! This burden was too much for me. I decided that Iwould resign my position as a special agent. Iwrote out a statement to this effect and handed it to him. He said he would pass it on to the FBI Academy director. I went back to my room and began to pack my bags.<br><br>As I sat alone in my room, I felt at peace in my heart, knowing I had done the right thing. I realized that the promise I had been given in my patriarchal blessing would be honored if I<i>carefully</i>and<i>prayerfully</i>chose a profession that the Lord wanted me to pursue--not one that I selected merely because it was glamorous or exciting.<br><br>As I pondered the future, my counselor returned and asked me if I would consider a non-agent position in the Bureau. There were several openings at the academy I might be qualified for, he explained. Since I didn't have anything else lined up, I told him I would consider it. I called Cindy and asked her what she thought about a position at the Bureau. Since she was eager to be together again as a family, she told me I should accept a position if I was offered one.<br><br>I spoke with several agents who had openings in their departments--or "units," as the Bureau calls them--and was offered a position in the Office of Institutional Research and Development. It turned out to be a valuable opportunity to meet important people in the Bureau and to learn new skills.<br><br>One of the people I eventually met was the chief of the director's speechwriting unit at FBI headquarters in Washington. A year or so later, when he had an opening in his unit for a speechwriter, he asked me to apply. I did and was offered the job.<br><br>It was the beginning of a new career for me. When people find out that for 15 years I was a speechwriter--not just for the FBI but later for the American Medical Association in Chicago, for Merck (a pharmaceutical company in New Jersey), and for Medtronic (a medical device company in Minneapolis)--they comment that this must have been interesting work. It was. But the most interesting parts of all of our experiences in these places were the wonderful people we met, both members of the Church and nonmembers. We enjoyed many choice opportunities to serve in the kingdom and to associate with some of God's noble and great ones. My wife and I have felt as though the Lord has cultivated us, just as the lord of the vineyard in Zenos' allegory had cultivated his precious olive trees. I hope that the fruit we have borne--and continue to bear--is sweet and satisfying to Him and to those we serve.<br><br>Nearly 15 years ago I went through another pruning when my position in Minnesota was restructured and I was no longer part of that structure. Again it was a trying time, but the lord of the vineyard tended to our needs through the caring hands of our neighbors and fellow Church members. We gained new experiences and talents that would be invaluable to us as we--Cindy and I--sought to reestablish ourselves in the working world.<br><br>One job I had during this three-year period of un- and underemployment was as an 1850s farmer on a living history farm run by the Minnesota State Historical Society. What a fun job that was! It was farming just like our ancestors did 150 years ago. I came away from that job with a greater appreciation for what they had to endure and with the knowledge that Icould have done it also.<br><br>That wasn't my only job. I had decided that I would try to find a library position again, since I enjoyed working with books, documents, and people. So I found several jobs that helped me get experience and gain new skills with computers that I had missed out on, having been gone from the library world for more than 20 years.<br><br>Nearly 12 years ago I was rehired at Special Collections in the Lee Library, the place I began my career decades before. During the interview process I felt an unusual calmness, a feeling that the Lord was in charge and that things would work out as they were supposed to. This was a testimony to me that God watches over us and directs us to the place where He wants us to stand.<br><br>I can honestly say that the job I have now--and I have had many others to compare it to--is the best job I've ever had. It's the place in which I am meant to be. I know that now. Let me relate an experience that gives me this assurance.<br><br>On the morning of October 13, 2003, I was in the book stacks in the L. Tom Perry Special Collections looking at a collection of 18th- and 19th-century American almanacs with Professor Madison Sowell and a few fellow librarians. I had been working with Dr. Sowell to assemble materials that we could exhibit in connection with his upcoming lecture on using almanacs as research sources. Professor Sowell reached into a box, pulled out one from 1781, and examined it. He handed it to me and mentioned that we should use this one, because it had writing paper interleaved with the calendar pages, which allowed the almanac to be used as a diary--which it indeed had been.<br><br>As I looked at the entries, I noticed frequent references to Stockbridge. "This man lives in western Massachusetts," I thought to myself. I examined the first leaf of writing paper and saw this inscription: "Diary of my Grandfather Wm. Partridge, b. 1753. --H. W. Partridge." I was shocked! I knew I had Partridge ancestors living in Pittsfield, not far from Stockbridge, at about this time. Maybe this was one of them--a distant cousin perhaps.<br><br>I excused myself and went to my computer, called up the FamilySearch database, and entered the name William Partridge and the birth year 1753. The search results displayed names I was familiar with: William's father, Oliver Partridge; his mother, Anna Williams; his wife, Jemima Bidwell; and one of his sons, Edward, first bishop of the Mormon Church, who was my great-great-great-grandfather. In case you've lost track, that would make William Partridge my fourth great-grandfather!<br><br>My colleagues were amazed at this discovery. After they left, it occurred to me thatif we had one diary, perhaps we might have more. So I looked through the 200 or so almanacs in our collection. Sure enough, there were more--45 more--each bearing William's characteristic marginal notations.<br><br>No one knows for sure how these diaries ended up at BYU. I speculate that they were acquired decades ago when the library purchased a collection of early American almanacs from a book dealer in Denver. Whatever the explanation, they were essentially lost to researchers until Dr. Sowell pulled one out of a box, examined it, and handed it to me. It was more than a coincidence.<br><br>In the April 1916 general conference, President Joseph F. Smith said this:<br><br><i>If we can see by the enlightening influence of the Spirit of God . . . beyond the veil that separates us from the spirit world, surely those who have passed beyond, can see more clearly . . . back here to us than it is possible for us to see to them. . . . I believe we move . . . in the presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. . . . We begin to realize more and more fully, as we become acquainted with the principles of the Gospel, . . . that we are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends and associates and co-laborers who have preceded us into the spirit world. We can not forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are associated and united to them by ties that we can not break, that we can not dissolve or free ourselves from.</i><sup>7</sup><br><br>I have come to feel that there are indeed bands that tie me to this man William Partridge. Seven years ago he reached across the veil and placed into my hands an account of his years here on earth, an account that he had always intended for his descendants to have.<br><br>This experience is just one of the many spiritual manifestations that I have felt that lead me to believe that our Father in Heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, are aware of us and will lead us if we will listen to the Holy Spirit. If we are looking, we will see the caring hands of the Gardener of Gethsemane shaping our lives in ways we cannot now imagine. I pray that we might yield to this pruning so that we can become the people God would have us be, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Russell C. Taylor was department chair of the L.

<h1>e Safe in the Harbor - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Years ago, while visiting one of our institute buildings, I saw a beautiful painting on the wall. It was of a 16th-century ship with the sails tied to the mast, anchored safely in the harbor. At the bottom of the painting was the inscription "A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for."<br><br>The phrase was in my native tongue of Portuguese. In that language the verb<i>to be</i>has two translations. One translation is the verb<i>ser,</i>and it means something that is fixed or permanent. The other translation is<i>estar,</i>and it is used to describe something that is transitory. For example, for me to state in Portuguese, "I am the son of Nelson Costa," I would use the verb<i>ser,</i>because I am his son and I will continue to be his son forever. It is unchangeable.<br><br>I am speaking to you now, and in about 20 minutes I will stop. To explain this in Portuguese, I would use the verb<i>estar.</i><br><br>The verb used in the inscription on the painting was<i>estar,</i>meaning that the ship, although anchored, was in the harbor temporarily--it would not be there forever. As you know, ships are not built to stay in the harbor. Looking at the beautiful painting on the wall of the institute building, I was reminded that ships are meant to navigate the oceans and to experience adventure. I was reminded that it is the same with us.<br><br>The same principle applies to us. While pondering the meaning of that painting, I thought about Lehi and his family. As you remember well, Lehi was a very prosperous man. He and his family lived in Jerusalem. I think they were very happy there. Lehi had some challenges because he was teaching the gospel to people who did not want to accept it, but his family was happy and comfortable with their gold and silver and the precious comforts of their day. In fact, Lehi and his family were safe in their harbor. But they left their comfortable home and went to the desert because the Lord commanded them to do it, and they did not take everything they owned. When you go on a trip for two weeks, how much luggage do you take? The scripture tells us that Lehi "took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents" (1 Nephi 2:4).<br><br>Also in the case of Lehi and his family, they got a ship because the Lord commanded Nephi to build a ship for their travel to the promised land (see 1 Nephi 17:8).<br><br>My thoughts then went to Alma the Father. He was one of the priests to the king; he was in a high social position for his time. He and his family had all of the comforts that people could enjoy in their day. After he listened to Abinadi teach the gospel, he believed and became a follower of Christ.<br><br><i>And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy them.</i><br><br><i>... Alma and the people of the Lord ... took their tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.</i>[Mosiah 18:33–34]<br><br>I also thought about many other persons in the scriptures and in the history of the Church who were very comfortable in their harbors but chose to navigate in unfamiliar oceans--people like Alma the Younger and Amulek, who were persecuted because they followed the Spirit and taught the gospel to the people in their day (see Alma 9–14).<br><br>My thoughts also went to Ammon, the great missionary of the Book of Mormon. I thought about when he received his mission call and gave the news to his friends and relatives. Do you think they told him he was called to serve a mission among the most wonderful people on the earth? I think that when he announced where he would serve, his friends told him, "Don't go! Are you crazy? The Lamanites hate us! They will not accept you; in fact, they will try to kill you!"<br><br>Ammon was safe in his home with his family. He lived in comfort, but he decided to leave the harbor and navigate to an extraordinary adventure. You know the result of his mission, the joy that he felt in his soul in all the years that he served as a missionary for the Lord. He declared to his son Helaman, "The Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors" (Alma 36:25).<br><br>The Garden of Eden was a safe harbor for Adam and Eve, but they would not have known their full potential if they had remained there (see Genesis 3).<br><br>Noah and his family left their safe harbor to live on the ark while it rained for "forty days and forty nights" (Genesis 7:12). By the time it was safe for them to leave, they had lived on the ark for one year (see Genesis 7:11, 8:13). What do you think that was like? Do you even want to imagine exactly how it would be to live for one year with a bull and a cow in your bedroom?<br><br>I thought about David, a shepherd taking care of his flock. He was a young man--he was not a soldier! He was in a safe harbor of his life, but he left the security of his harbor, and with courage and great faith he accepted the call to fight Goliath. And with the strength of the Lord, he won. (See 1 Samuel 17.)<br><br>I thought about the early members of the Church who sacrificed so much to do what the Lord asked them to do. Joseph Beecroft was among a group of 700 Saints who traveled by train from Boston to Iowa City. They began the<br><br><i>journey in cattle cars, using their luggage for seats.</i><br><br><i>... Joseph Beecroft reflected on how the gospel bonded people from different economic classes. For part of the way he rode next to a wealthy convert named Thomas Tennant. Joseph wrote about him with admiration and awe:</i><br><br><i>"We had among others Squire Tennant for a carriage passenger. ... He had his wife, her mother, and his child. What has Mormonism done? Such a spectacle was scarcely ever witnessed as to see one who has been so rich [and] so high in life come [to] be huddled together with the poorest of the poor. [To] see how patiently he endures all things is truly wonderful."</i><br><br><i>Before leaving England, Thomas Tennant paid $25,000 to buy a home that Brigham Young offered for sale to help replenish the Perpetual Emigration Fund. This purchase provided the greatest single contribution to financing the 1856 emigration. Thomas Tennant would never see the home, however, as he would die in October near Scotts Bluff, Nebraska.</i>[Andrew D. Olsen,<i>The Price We Paid: The Extraordinary Story of the Willie &amp;amp; Martin Handcart Pioneers</i>(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2006), 227–28]<br><br>Another example is George Careless, who was known as a musical pioneer. He was 11 years old when he joined the Church in England in 1850. George had a clear soprano voice and gave up a position in a cathedral choir, including a salary and a free musical education, when he accepted the gospel.<br><br><i>In 1859 George began formal studies at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He passed the four-year course of studies in only three years and in 1862 began playing professionally. During the next two years George played under many of the famous conductors then working in London. He also conducted the Goswell Branch choir and presented concerts for Church members and their friends as part of the London Conference meetings....</i><br><br><i>One Sunday evening early in 1864, Elder William Staines approached him. "Brother George," he said, "I had a dream about you last night, and was shown that you were advancing so rapidly in your profession that your fame and fortune would be made if you remained in London, and that you would not be able to sacrifice it if you did not immigrate to Zion this year." Elder Staines then counseled George to sail for Utah on the next ship, offering to advance him the money if need be. After laboring with George for half an hour, Elder Staines said, "You are wanted in Zion and I want you to go. What do you say?"</i><br><br><i>"I will go," said George.</i>[David Maxwell, "'The Morning Breaks': George Careless, Musical Pioneer,"<i>Ensign,</i>February 1984, 48]<br><br>George Careless went on to serve as the "Chief Musician of the Church" and was director of the Tabernacle Choir for a time. He is the author of many of our hymns. He sacrificed much and he received great honors in his lifetime; most important, he remained a willing servant of the Lord.<br><br>There are many stories of pioneers who left the safety and security of their homes to come to this beautiful valley. "We had to sell everything at a great sacrifice," wrote Robert Crookston. "But we wanted to come to Zion and be taught by the prophet of God" (Autobiography of Robert Crookston, Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 5; quoted in Fred E. Woods, "We Wanted to Come to Zion,"<i>Ensign,</i>March 2005, 30).<br><br>One more story is from the life of Ida Jensen Romney, wife of President Marion G. Romney, who served in the First Presidency. Her grandparents joined the Church in Denmark.<br><br>[My grandfather]<i>left a wet farmland, green with fertility, to come to Zion. The missionary told him how wonderful it was to live in Zion and that he would be given 40 acres of farmland when he came. He was sent down to Levan, Utah, to colonize a land that was not nearly as verdant as the land he had left behind. He wanted to get on the first wagon that would take him back to the old country. Grandmother insisted that they stay.</i>[Ida Jensen Romney, quoted in Maurine Jensen Ward, "General Authorities' Wives: Sister Ida Jensen Romney,"<i>New Era</i>, June 1975, 18]<br><br>As I thought about this subject and the painting of the ship in the harbor, my thoughts took me back many years ago when I heard for the first time the story of Jonathan Napela, who joined the Church in 1851 after being taught the gospel by the young missionary Elder George Q. Cannon. They became good friends, much like Alma and Amulek. Jonathan Napela (also Jonathon and Jonatana) was a judge and a brave pioneer for the Church in the islands of Hawaii. He helped Elder Cannon translate the Book of Mormon into the Hawaiian language. He organized a school to instruct the missionaries from Utah. He also served as a missionary. He was a good man, and he was married to a beautiful woman. In 1873 tragedy struck when Jonathan's beloved wife, Kitty, contracted leprosy. It was the custom of that time for persons with this terrible disease to be sent to live in confinement on another island. We can only imagine the intense suffering and degrading circumstances that had to be endured. Jonathan Napela chose to leave his safe harbor and move with his sweet wife to the leper colony. He loved her so much and could not leave her alone in that dreaded place. Jonathan Napela also contracted leprosy, but even in his own suffering he continued to serve the temporal and spiritual interests of his people in the leper colony. He died in 1879, two years before his sweet and eternal wife. (See Joseph H. Spurrier, "Jonathon Napela: Quiet Hero of Hawaii,"<i>Ensign</i>, August 1978, 49–51.)<br><br>I thought about my wife at the time we were married. She was safe and comfortable in the harbor of her family. As a single woman, she lived with her parents and had a high position in her profession. She was making good money. She left the security of her harbor and married me. She came to live with me in very humble conditions. We had a small studio apartment. This will help you understand just how small it was: When the sun shone in our window in the morning, we had to leave the apartment to make room for the sunbeams to enter. There was not room for both the sunbeams and us in our small home. But we were happy and blessed; we found a new harbor for ourselves.<br><br>I thought about the great adventures of our mortal lives when we decided to have a family. Each time one of our four children came into the world, it was like leaving the harbor and navigating the oceans in a new and marvelous adventure. Bringing children into the world brought more responsibility to us, and it also brought great joy.<br><br>I testify to you that every time we left the security of our harbors, it has brought more happiness to our lives. It has been much better than being anchored in the harbor with no progress, where we could not experience the color and excitement that has been present in our lives.<br><br>Even when turbulence caused by the storms of life naturally comes our way in this mortal existence, we can be led by the lighthouse of the gospel and by our testimonies of our Savior Jesus Christ.<br><br>I am also reminded, by the most tender feelings of my heart, of our Savior and Redeemer, who left the comfort of being at the right hand of His Father to give His life as an atoning sacrifice for all mankind. All that He did in this life He did because He loves us and to set the example for us. He had committed no sins but went to John the Baptist to be baptized "to fulfil all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15).<br><br>He stood against the temptations of Satan and admonished, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve" (Matthew 4:10).<br><br>Our Savior knew at all times what it was like to leave the safe harbor: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head" (Matthew 8:20). He taught us to have perfect faith: "Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? ... But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:31–33).<br><br>When Jesus was in Gethsemane, he "began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy" (Mark 14:33). Jesus was feeling the weight of sin and the injustices of mortality. He prayed, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:36).<br><br>It would have been easier to not experience the agony of Gethsemane, but Jesus chose to do the will of His Father. He chose to carry out His assignment because of His love for His Father and for us. Just as we might prefer to not suffer, Jesus prayed, "Take away this cup from me," and again He set the example for us in our suffering: "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly" (Luke 22:44).<br><br>In every way Christ set the example for how to live, how to serve, and how to find the answers we need to meet the daily challenges and decisions of life.<br><br>When I received the assignment to speak to you today, in the spirit of prayer I received a strong feeling that I should tell you that Brigham Young University is a marvelous and safe harbor. You are anchored here now, you have the comfort and security that you need in this brief moment of your life. But you, like the ship, were not made to be here in the harbor of Brigham Young University forever. You do not need to extend your years at BYU forever. You need to choose your career and, just like the ships, go to the open sea and navigate the oceans.<br><br>Many of you will leave BYU alone, others with a spouse and children, and others will leave for your wonderful ocean of a full-time mission. I know that when you make the decision about your future, the Lord will show you in which oceans you need to navigate. Don't be afraid to leave for the open sea. Don't be afraid to confront the waves of your future, the storms of professional challenges. Use your time in the harbor of BYU to prepare to the best of your ability for your career and the challenges of having a spouse and family.<br><br>Abraham took Isaac on that long walk to the altar believing it would be his last moments with his beloved son. The Lord had commanded Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, ... and offer him ... for a burnt offering" (Genesis 22:2). I am sure this was not a safe harbor for Abraham. But he was obedient to God's commandments. President Hugh B. Brown said that God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac because "Abraham needed to learn something about Abraham" (in Truman G. Madsen,<i>The Highest in Us</i>[Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1978], 49).<br><br>Of course this is the lesson for all of us: to grow in faith and obedience so that we will have the confidence to do what the Lord asks us to do. We have the examples from the scriptures and Church history of people who had faith to leave their safe harbors and accomplish great things. We have the capacity to follow their example.<br><br>I promise you that if you have faith in God, you will have the lighthouse of the gospel to help you and to bless your life. God will be with you. You are part of the most marvelous generation that has lived on the earth, and you are a great hope for the world. Your example and testimony will touch the lives of all you meet in the great adventure of your mortal life. Looking into your faces, how can I not believe in a bright future?<br><br>Remember what you see every day when you come to this beautiful campus: "Enter to learn; go forth to serve." I know that is what our Father in Heaven hopes for you to do.<br><br>I have a strong testimony of this Church. I am a convert. I prayed for 14 hours, and the Lord gave me the knowledge that Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Lord. I know that he saw in that beautiful morning in the Sacred Grove God the Father and Jesus Christ and They spoke with him. I know that Jesus is the Christ. He is our Savior and Redeemer. I testify to you that He gave His precious life for you and for me and for all mankind. I testify to you that Thomas S. Monson is the living prophet of God today and that the Book of Mormon is the most perfect book and can guide us back to the presence of God. I testify to you that you have a bright future and say to you that the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are prophets, seers, and revelators. And all of them and all of us General Authorities pray for you constantly. We love you, we respect you, and we honor you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Claudio R. M.

<h1>he Doctrine and Gospel of Jesus Christ - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
You are a wonderful sight and the best young men and young women in the whole world. You have the restored gospel of Jesus Christ to guide your footsteps of faith in today's ever-increasingly wicked world. It is good for me and Sister Ballard to be with you this evening, both here in the Marriott Center and with all of you gathered in other buildings around the world. With modern technology, I suppose some of you are also listening via podcast feeds or other electronic marvels. But regardless of where you are tonight, I am grateful to speak to you, and I pray the Lord will bless us so what I say will be of help to each one of you in your lives at this time.<br><br>I express thanks to the Logan Institute of Religion choir for the beautiful music and a special appreciation to President Tom Mullen, one of the stake presidents here, who is one of the wonderful missionaries who served with Sister Ballard and me in the Canada Toronto Mission many years ago.<br><h2><b>"O That Cunning Plan of the Evil One"</b></h2><br>Tonight I want to follow up on what I said at this past general conference. Those of you who were listening--and I hope that some of you might qualify--received counsel from the General Authorities and general officers of the Church. You may remember that in my talk I compared the artificial flies used by fly fishermen to those artificial lures used by Satan to catch us and to reel us in to his awful world ofmisery.<br><br>I received a letter a few days after conference from a wonderful young man named Chayton Snider. He is 11 years old. He listened to me and sent a drawing along with this personal note:<br><br><i>Fishermen reeling in the fish with an artificial lure symbolizes how Satan is "reeling" us in with addiction (the "artificial lure"). When the fisherman throws the fish onto the beach and the fish tries to "flop" back to the water, that "flopping" I think symbolizes how we struggle to get back to the safety of the "water" or the gospel, but we need help from Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to get away from those addictions.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>Thank you, Chayton, for your succinct synopsis of my conference address.<br><br>I quote from that talk:<br><br><i>Like the fly fisherman who knows that trout are driven by hunger, Lucifer knows our "hunger," or weaknesses, and tempts us with counterfeit lures which, if taken, can cause us to be yanked from the stream of life into his unmerciful influence. And unlike a fly fisherman who catches and releases the fish unharmed back into the water, Lucifer will not voluntarily let go. His goal is to make his victims as miserable as he is.</i><sup>2</sup><br><h2><b>Keep the Gospel of Jesus Christ Simple</b></h2><br>I pray the Lord will bless me in teaching a very important principle to you. The principle is "keep the gospel of Jesus Christ simple." Paul the Apostle had the same concern in his day when he said, "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent [the devil] beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:3).<br><br>In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Nephi explained the doctrine and gospel of Christ in these simple terms. I am referring to statements from 2 Nephi, chapter 31.<br><ul><br> 	<li>"For my soul delighteth in plainness" (verse3).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"Can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?" (verse 10).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son" (verse 11).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost" (verse 12).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved" (verse 15).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"For ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him" (verse 19).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"My beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God" (verse 21).</li><br></ul><br><ul><br> 	<li>"And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ" (verse 21).</li><br></ul><br>The Prophet Joseph Smith defined the first principles and ordinances of the gospel in the fourth article of faith: "First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost."<br><br>I want to focus on the doctrine and gospel of Christ tonight. My dear young people, there are many things going on in the world today that are in direct opposition to the principles of the gospel. You must know the doctrine of Christ and live and defend it all the days of your life.<br><h2><b>Give the Lord Equal Time</b></h2><br>Some years ago one of my missionaries came to see me. He said: "President, I am losing my testimony. I have some questions that no one will answer for me. My bishop and stake president just told me to forget them, and they had no answers."<br><br>I asked for his questions in writing and then suggested he come to see me in 10 days, and I would answer every one of his questions.<br><br>As he was leaving my office, I was prompted to ask him, "Elder, how long has it been since you have read from the scriptures?"<br><br>He acknowledged that it had been a long time.<br><br>I said: "You have given me an assignment; it's only fair that I give you one. You read at least one hour from the scriptures each day until you come back for your answers."<br><br>He agreed to do this.<br><br>When he came back, I was ready. He said: "President, I don't need the answers. I know the Book of Mormon is true. I know Joseph Smith is a prophet. I'm OK now."<br><br>I replied: "You will get your answers anyway. I worked hard on them!" All of this anti-Mormon stuff was what we were dealing with.<br><br>After our discussion I asked him, "Elder, what have you learned from all of this?"<br><br>And he gave me a very significant response: "I've learned to give the Lord equal time!"<br><br>Now, together let's review the basic doctrines and gospel of Christ.<br><h2><b>Doctrinal Principle 1: Faith in the Lord JesusChrist</b></h2><br><i>The first doctrinal principle is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Having faith in Christ includes having a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and Redeemer of the world.</i>[Our doctrine teaches]<i>that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying on His Son's grace and mercy. When we have faith in Christ, we accept and apply His Atonement and His teachings. We trust Him and what He says. We know that He has the power to keep His promises. Heavenly Father blesses those who have faith to obey His Son. . . .</i><br><br><i>We believe in Christ, and we believe that He wants us to keep all His commandments. We want to show our faith by obeying Him. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . Through our faith in Jesus Christ, He can heal us, both physically and spiritually.</i><sup>3</sup><br><br>My dear young friends, take a minute now and concentrate on your own faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as I ask you a few questions:<br><br>1. Are you happy with the direction of your life and the depth of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ?<br><br>2. Do you love God with all of your heart, soul, strength, and mind, as the Lord taught the lawyer in Luke 10? (See verse 27.)<br><br>3. Are you doing the simple things in your everyday life?<br><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><ol><br> 	<li style="list-style-type: none;"><br><ol>a. Are you saying your prayers every morning and every night?</ol><br></li><br></ol><br><ol><br> 	<li style="list-style-type: none;"><br><ol>b. Are you reading every day from the holy scriptures?</ol><br></li><br></ol><br><ol><br> 	<li style="list-style-type: none;"><br><ol>c. Are you using appropriate language?</ol><br></li><br></ol><br><ol><br> 	<li style="list-style-type: none;"><br><ol>d. Are you being honest?</ol><br></li><br></ol><br><ol><br> 	<li style="list-style-type: none;"><br><ol>e. Are you living the Word of Wisdom?</ol><br></li><br></ol><br>&amp;nbsp;<br><br>4. Are you being kind and thoughtful of the needs of those around you?<br><br>5. Are you following the counsel of the Brethren emphasized in this past conference to avoid completely<i>any kind</i>of pornography? Pornography cannot exist in our lives if we have true faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. I say with all the strength that I have: if this is a problem in your life, "Leave it alone!"<br><br>6. Are you living worthy of a temple recommend?<br><br>7. Are you actively participating in your Sunday meetings, especially sacrament meeting--partaking of the sacrament worthily and renewing your covenants withthe Lord?<br><br>8. Are you returned missionaries maintaining the dignity of a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ in your dress and in your personal demeanor?<br><br>9. Are you preparing for and actively pursuing finding your eternal companion?I could spend the rest of the evening on this question, but I am sure by now you understand that we do not endorse "hanging out." If you haven't gotten that yet, get it tonight. In your vernacular, "Cool it!" We recommend proper dating--you know, it's simple: a boy asks a girl for a date, and you have a good time together. Are you really looking for a companion who loves the Lord and honors His holy name?<br><br>10. Those of you who are married, are date nights a regular occurrence as you continue to build and strengthen your relationship?<br><br>There are other things, of course, that I could add to this list. However, if you are seriously striving to do your best to follow Christ, then you can answer questions like these with a resounding Yes!<br><br>As you have thought tonight about your personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, is there anything in your life now that you know is not what you want it to be? If there is anything that you know in your heart is not consistent with one who has real faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, then let me tell you how to fix it.<br><h2><b>Doctrinal Principle 2: Repentance</b></h2><br><i>Repentance is the second doctrinal principle of the gospel.</i><br><br><i>Our faith in Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent, or to change our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that are not in harmony with His will. ... When we repent, we feel godly sorrow, then we stop doing things that are wrong and</i>[increase our efforts to do]<i>things that are right. . . .</i><br><br><i>Sincere repentance brings several results. We feel God's forgiveness and His peace in our lives. Our guilt and sorrow are swept away.</i><sup>4</sup><br><br>Brothers and sisters, be grateful that by sincere repentance the gospel of Jesus Christ provides an escape from mistakes we may make. If one does not master the ability to repent, oftentimes little habits become an addiction. All of us can easily avoid being trapped by an addiction simply by not partaking of addictive substances or addictive practices. Make no mistake, my dear young friends, all of us are targets of Satan and his minions. He will use every deceitful lure or tactic he has to cause you and me to falter and drift in our commitments and faithful devotion to the Lord.<br><h2><b>Doctrinal Principle 3: Baptism</b></h2><br><i>The third doctrinal principle of the gospel is baptism.</i>This principle most all of you within the sound of my voice have participated in. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins is the first covenant that we make between ourselves and the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father. Baptism is an ordinance; it is "a sacred ceremony or rite that shows that we have entered into a covenant with God," and<br><br><i>God has always required His children to make covenants. A covenant is a binding and solemn agreement between God and man. God promises to bless us, and we promise to obey Him. . . . Keeping covenants brings blessings in this life and exaltation in the life to come.</i><sup>5</sup><br><br>Remember, Christ set the example for us by being baptized Himself. And we are blessed with the privilege of partaking of the sacrament each week, which "helps us remain worthy to have the Spirit with us always. It is a weekly reminder of our covenants"<sup>6</sup>and helps us to build our faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><h2><b>Doctrinal Principle 4: The Gift of the Holy Ghost</b></h2><br><i>The fourth doctrinal principle is the gift of the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br><i>Jesus taught that we must be baptized of water and also of the Spirit. Baptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit or it is incomplete. Only when we receive baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost can we receive a remission of our sins and become completely spiritually reborn. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . . The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ and helps us recognize the truth. He provides spiritual strength and helps us do what is right. He</i>[gives us peace and]<i>comforts us during times of trial or sorrow. He warns us of spiritual or physical danger. . . . Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can feel God's love and direction for us. This gift is a foretaste of eternal joy and a promise of eternal life.</i><sup>7</sup><br><h2><b>Doctrinal Principle 5: Endure to the End</b></h2><br><i>And finally, the fifth doctrinal principle: we must endure to the end.</i><br><br><i>Once we have entered the strait and narrow path by our faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and the ordinances of baptism and</i>[receiving the Holy Ghost],<i>we must exert every effort to stay on the path.</i><sup>8</sup><br><br>Years ago, our faithful stake patriarch, who was in his nineties, stood in fast and testimony meeting and said something I shall always remember: "I pray every night that God will see me safely dead with my testimony burning brightly."<br><br>I said to him after the meeting, "Patriarch, of all the people I know, certainly you don't need to worry about that anymore!"<br><br>He took hold of the lapels of my coat, jerked me up so that our faces were close together, looked me in the eyes, and said these words: "My boy"--I was married and had two children! "My boy, no one is secure until the very end."<br><br>May it be so for each of us that we are faithful to the very end.<br><br>So, the doctrine of faith in Christ, repentance, making and renewing and keeping covenants, and being directed by the Spirit will become a pattern of living. Our actions in daily life are shaped and governed by these doctrinal principles.<br><h2><b>The Gospel of Jesus Christ Is the Bridge Between Premortal Life and Eternal Life</b></h2><br>I know some of you returned missionaries are saying to yourselves, Elder Ballard is quoting some of this doctrine from the inspired<i>Preach My Gospel.</i>I hope you recognize some of these words and that you have internalized their meaning in your lives. Those of you young men and young women who have not served missions, may I suggest that it would be well for you to have a copy of<i>Preach My Gospel.</i>Study chapter three, the lesson entitled "The Gospel of Jesus Christ." It lays out very clearly and in more detail the basic steps necessary to avoid being caught by the artificial lures of Satan and being dragged away from the pathway that leads to eternal life.<br><br>How simple the gospel of Jesus Christ is! How important it is for us to stay on the only pathway defined by God as the way back home to His eternal presence. The gospel is the plan of happiness; it is simple and beautiful.<br><br>Let me illustrate how the first principles of the gospel are like a bridge between premortal life (represented by my raised left hand) and eternal life (represented by my raised right hand). The bridge between the two is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have come from the premortal world into mortality to strive to know and to live the principles of the gospel. We find ourselves now here on earth, making our way back, hopefully, to the presence of God. This requires understanding and obedience. Our goal as we strive to live the gospel is to become candidates to receive all of the blessings our Father has in store for His faithful and worthy children.<br><br>Jesus said:<br><br><i>Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.</i><br><br><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church.</i>[3 Nephi 27:20–21]<br><h2><b>You Have a Great Future to Look Forward To</b></h2><br>I come back and ask you again to think of your own life. How are you doing? Is there anything in your life causing you to drift from the teachings of the gospel into the influence of Satan? Are you giving the Lord equal time? You live in a world filled with technology, where there is such easy access to electronic information, entertainment, and social networks on your home computer, your iPad, or your iPhone. No generation before you has had so much technology available at their fingertips. Through Facebook and other social networks you can stay in touch with friends all over the world. While these are marvelous tools, I caution you not to let the use of technology capture your time to the point that you become addicted to constantly using them. Somehow you need to limit their use so they do not steal away from you what is essential, precious, and eternal.<br><br>We need only watch the nightly news and read the newspapers to realize that the world is in enormous distress. There are earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes in divers places. There are wars and rumors of wars. There is famine and suffering and genocide, not to mention murders and other acts of violence.<br><br>Some of you may think that in today's world the future doesn't hold much to strive toward. Ican remember as a young 13-year-old boy coming home from priesthood meeting on Sunday, December 7, 1941, to learn from my parents that Japan had just bombed Pearl Harbor. This propelled the United States into a world war that had already been raging in Europe for two years. It seemed like life as we knew it was going to come to an end. There was much uncertainty as many young men were swept up into military service. However, now, just as then, amidst all of the conflicts, struggles, and evil influences in the world, there is still much good.<br><br>When I was born--a long time ago, when all of you were still in the spirit world--there were only about 20 countries in the whole world that one could plausibly call democracies, where citizens enjoyed even a fraction of the freedoms we take for granted. Now there are more than 90. This means more of the world's people can live their lives in freedom and according to their own beliefs.<br><br>Today, worldwide, poverty is on the decline and health strides have been extraordinary, especially pertaining to sanitation and improved drinking water in developing countries. It's remarkable what's happening. Educational opportunities are also becoming more widely available.<br><br>There are many reasons for you to be filled with hope and optimism. Don't let Satan influence you and cause you to not believe in the great future you have to look forward to.<br><h2><b>You Are the Future Church Leaders</b></h2><br>We all prepare to enjoy life by the daily decisions we make. If you are true and faithful to the doctrine and gospel of Christ, many wonderful opportunities in life will be yours. In the Church, your leaders at the ward, stake, and general levels will be inspired to call you to serve in those callings that you have prepared yourself for as a result of your wise choices to keep the commandments of God.<br><br>Thirty years from now the leadership of the Church will largely depend on how well each one of you is prepared to fulfill the calls to serve in the Church that will come to you.<br><br>Think about this--it took the Church 98 years, from 1830 to 1928 (the year I was born), to organize its first 100 stakes. The second 100 stakes were organized during the next 24 years. Then we start to see a very interesting picture unfold. At the end of 1960, just eight years later, the 300th stake was organized in Toronto, Canada, during the time that President Thomas S. Monson was the mission president there. Two weeks ago Sister Ballard and I attended stake conference in the Toronto Ontario Stake, which was celebrating its jubilee, or 50th year.<br><br>In 1964, just four years after the creation of the 300th stake, the 400th stake was organized. Two hundred more stakes were organized during the next nine years, and the 900th stake was organized in March of 1978. Soon, the 3,000th stake will be organized.<br><br>How does this relate to you young men and young women? Suppose the Church creates 100 stakes a year. That means by 2040, just 30 years from now, the number of stakes will have doubled to approximately 6,000. You will be in your late 40s or early 50s. Now ask yourself--where are the 6,000 stake presidents? Where are their first counselors, second counselors, executive secretaries, clerks? Where are the 6,000 times 12, or 72,000, high councilors? And suppose that every stake has an average of 10 units--about the average in the stakes today--where are the 60,000 bishops, first counselors, second counselors, executive secretaries, clerks, elders quorum presidents and their counselors, high priests group leaders and their assistants, Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary presidents and counselors, and on and on? Where are they? I am speaking to them right now.<i>You are they!</i>Will you be ready to accept the callings that the Lord will extend to you?<br><h2><b>There Is an Eternal Plan for You</b></h2><br>Heavenly Father has an eternal plan for each one of you. Your birthright, the privilege you have of being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is like unto a miracle in a world of some six billion people. You made some very important promises and commitments to Heavenly Father while living with Him in the premortal world.<br><br>You may wonder how the names of auxiliary leaders, bishops, stake presidents, and General Authorities come to the minds of those who have the responsibility for extending calls to serve. How does a stake president know who the bishop should be? How does a General Authority know who the stake president should be? (Just today I laid my hands on the head of a brand-new stake president to set him apart. We reorganized the stake over the weekend. What a privilege that is--what an awesome responsibility!) How does the president of the Church know who a General Authority should be? It is by<i>revelation</i>that names are made known of those who have proven they are faithful and trustworthy and living the basic doctrines of Christ's gospel.<br><br>Do not let one day go by when you do not strive to be ready to serve. Remember, mortality is the time for all of us to prepare to meet God. In fact, Amulek taught:<br><br><i>For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</i><br><br><i>And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</i>[Alma 34:32–33]<br><br>Every day of your life the Lord will help you if you trust in Him and keep His commandments. The Lord makes it known to the responsible leader that you are ready to serve because you have stayed on the gospel path, you have lived up to the commitments you made before you were born, and the gospel of Jesus Christ guides your daily life.<br><br>May I suggest you begin now accepting callings. They will prepare you for future callings to serve in the Church.<br><br>Do what is necessary to build a real relationship with your Heavenly Father. You are His spiritual sons and daughters. Your divine parents love you with all Their hearts, as does the Lord Jesus Christ. They want you to follow the great plan of happiness that will lead you safely back home to Their presence.<br><h2><b>Stay Anchored to the Gospel of Jesus Christ</b></h2><br>As we come to the close of this meeting together, I pray that each of you will strive always to stay anchored to the doctrinal principles and ordinances of the gospel. Always give the Lord equal time so your testimonies will not drift to the false teachings of the world. Listen to the Brethren. We are doing everything we know to teach you the truth and encourage you to be anchored to those things that will keep you safe and free. Do the right things every day for the right reasons, and you will be just fine.<br><br>Prepare in every way to be ready when the Lord needs your service to His Church. As you get out into the world, you will continue to be tested. That is one of the purposes of life. We have been sent here to determine just how committed and dedicated we really are. It is exciting to believe that we can rise up and be great in following the commandments and teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>I like this poem; it applies to all of us. It is entitled "The Oak Tree" by Johnny Ray RyderJr.<br><br><i>A mighty wind blew night and day.<br>It stole the oak tree's leaves away,<br>Then snapped its boughs and pulled its bark<br>Until the oak was tired and stark.</i><br><br><i>But still the oak tree held its ground<br>While other trees fell all around.<br>The weary wind gave up and spoke,<br>"How can you still be standing, Oak?"</i><br><br><i>The oak tree said, "I know that you<br>Can break each branch of mine in two,<br>Carry every leaf away,<br>Shake my limbs, and make me sway.</i><br><br><i>But I have roots stretched in the earth,<br>Growing stronger since my birth.<br>You'll never touch them, for you see,<br>They are the deepest part of me.</i><br><br><i>Until today, I wasn't sure<br>Of just how much I could endure.<br>But now I've found, with thanks to you,<br>I'm stronger than I ever knew."</i><br><br>My beloved young brothers and sisters, be like the strong oak tree. Come to know how strong you are. Push your faith and trust in God and Christ down deep in gospel soil. Always be aware of the artificial flies being presented to us by the counterfeit fisher of men, Lucifer. May we have the wisdom and spiritual insight to discern and refuse his many dangerous offerings. Live the doctrine ofChrist, the simple and basic principles of the gospel, each day--have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repent, honor the covenant of baptism, live worthy of the Holy Ghost as your companion, and endure to the very end. Do this every day, and the Spirit of the Lord will be with you to keep you safely on the pathway that leads to eternal life.<br><h2><b>Testimony</b></h2><br>I bear my witness and testimony to you. Iwant you to know we love you. You will carry off on your shoulders the future of this Church. You have a great destiny. I pray with all of my heart that you'll do those things tonight that you need to do if you need to make some course corrections in the way you're living. And I bear my witness and testimony to you that Jesus is the Christ. He does live. This is His Church. We are on His errand. We are His covenant people. I know that. I bear that witness and pray now for the Lord to bless you. I invoke that blessing upon you in His holy name--that you may find peace, joy, and calm assurance in your own heart that you are doing the very best you can to be worthy of His holy name. May this be your blessing now and through all the days of your life is my humble prayer, testimony, and blessing in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>M.

<h1>t and a Willing Mind - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Diane and I are thrilled to be in Provo, where we met 39 years ago. We are always edified by the spirit of BYU. Thank you for your kindness and gracious hospitality and for what you will teach us during our brief time with you.<br><br>We love and respect President Samuelson, a valued colleague and friend, and his dear Sharon. As we consider the intellectual, leadership, and (most important) spiritual abilities of President Samuelson and those who administratively assist him, we know you are extraordinarily well led at this university. We love BYU. It is a lustrous jewel in the crown of the Church.<br><br>I wish to offer a brief insight into my life experience to provide some personal context for the subject I will address today. I was born in Hawaii when it was a territory of the United States, 10 years before statehood. Raised in the islands in a multicultural environment, Ileft for higher education on this campus and then for a mission to England. After marriage to a Canadian girl and our graduations here at this university, we returned to Hawaii to raise our family.<br><br>My father first went to Hawaii in 1940 as a young missionary for the Church. He was there when the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor violently thrust the U.S. into war. He served three years as a missionary, went home to Salt Lake City, and joined the army. After boot camp and officer candidate school, he married my mother in the Salt Lake Temple, and they were stationed in Hawaii. They spent the remainder of the war on Oahu in a tiny cottage with the windows painted black so no light would shine through as a protection against enemy bombers. In 1945 they returned to Salt Lake City, stayed nine months, and then returned to Hawaii as a permanent home. My mother passed away in 2001, and my father died last year--both in Hawaii. When my father died, it had been nearly 70 years since he first arrived in the islands. I treasure my upbringing in culturally diverse Hawaii; it has significantly influenced my perspective of the equality of God's children.<br><br>Ten years ago, after receiving my call as a General Authority, my wife, Diane, and I were assigned to the Asia North Area, which then comprised the countries of Japan and South Korea and included doing humanitarian work in North Korea. We lived in Tokyo and stayed three years in that assignment. After two years at Church headquarters, we then were sent to the Church's Asia Area, which encompasses 25 countries and territories and over one-half the world's population. After four years of living in Hong Kong, we have now been back at Church headquarters for nearly a year and a half. In my current assignment we assist the Quorum of the Twelve in supervising the Church throughout the world.<br><br>With this growing perspective of the people of the world, heightened by the fundamental purpose of my ecclesiastical responsibilities, I have spent much time pondering how the gospel is established in an individual life, in a family, in a country, and, indeed, throughout the world. The words of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith often come to my mind: "Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>The Lord, of course, understands the process of developing a testimony and the combined force of sincere and righteous people necessary to build His Church in any area of the world.<br><br>There are two ways the Church grows: (1)by converts, of which there are hundreds of thousands each year; and (2) multigenerationally, with children following the example of member parents. Both are essential to the future of the Lord's kingdom and complement one another, as the conversion of today is the multigenerational growth of tomorrow.<br><br>In this audience we have first generation members of the Church and also second generation, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and even those who represent the seventh generation of Church membership in this dispensation. For each of you first generation members there is a unique and significant story of how you came to your current place of spiritual understanding and commitment. For the rest of us, we have been blessed by the courage and humility of righteous ancestors who established a pattern for us to follow.<br><br>To exemplify the doctrine that "out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33), I tell you the story of Masako Kato. In 1951, when Masako was in her early twenties, she met the missionaries in her hometown of Yokohama, Japan, when she attended an English conversation class being taught by them. When the missionaries began to speak of spiritual things, she felt something and allowed them to begin teaching her about the Church and the restored gospel. During this time both Masako's older sister and mother died--within 30 days of each another. She was emotionally devastated but still attended the little branch of our church in the area, even the week after her mother passed away. When the opening hymn was sung, the power of the Spirit brought her to tears, and she understood for the first time the eternal nature of life.<br><br>Masako wanted to be baptized, but her father would not give his permission. Although she was of legal age, her respect for her father caused her not to proceed. However, she continued to attend church and participate like amember.<br><br>The missionaries suggested it would be good for her to share the glorious message she had come to know. Seemingly unafraid, even though the Church had little presence in Japan in 1951, she invited co-workers and even bosses at her company to come to church with her. A few came to some social activities, but one, Shozo Suzuki, a very new employee of the company, came to Sunday meetings. He had a good feeling about what he heard and consented after a time to receive the missionary discussions. Masako also joined him for her second time through the lessons. After several months Shozo accepted the challenge to be baptized. Masako again went to her father to seek permission, which he then gave because of the devotion he had witnessed in her. On August 4, 1952, Shozo and Masako were baptized in the same service.<br><br>One day a few months later, a young missionary approached Shozo and Masako and suggested they consider marriage--to each other! This surprised them, especially Shozo, as he had a nonmember girlfriend. However, it prompted him to think about Masako, the person who had introduced him to the gospel, in a different way than ever before. On April 29, 1953, they were married in a civil hall in Tokyo by the mission president. In 1965 they went to the Hawaii Temple to be sealed, as there was no temple in Japan until 1980.<br><br>Brother and Sister Suzuki were blessed with nine children--six daughters and three sons. Seven of their children served full-time missions for the Church. Of the nine, eight married, all in the temple, and seven of their spouses served full-time missions. The Suzukis had 35 grandchildren, with all eight years of age or older having been baptized members of the Church. Brother Suzuki has served as a branch president, district president, mission president, Japan Missionary Training Center president, regional representative, and a patriarch in three stakes. With the singular beginning of diminutive Masako, there are now 54 righteous members of the Suzuki family. Indeed, "out of small things proceedeth that which is great" (D&amp;amp;C 64:33).<br><br>This same miracle is found everywhere in the world where the Church is established. It has happened, or will happen, in your own family.<br><br>How does it happen? That question is answered in a companion verse to the one previously read: "Behold, the Lord requireth the<i>heart</i>and a<i>willing mind;</i>and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days" (D&amp;amp;C 64:34; emphasis added).<br><br>This doctrine is powerfully affirmed in the experience of Jesus with the Pharisee who was a lawyer. The Pharisee asked Him:<br><br><i>Master, which is the great commandment in thelaw?</i><br><br><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thyGod with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</i><br><br><i>This is the first and great commandment.</i>[Matthew 22:36–38]<br><br>So, from these and other prophetic words, we understand that both the<i>heart</i>and the<i>mind</i>must be fully engaged in this holy process. The conversion of our soul and the ongoing refinement of our life, as we adopt the attributes of godliness, is our earthly mission and is rewarded with "eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" (D&amp;amp;C 14:7).<br><br>The heart is symbolic of love and commitment. Love is the most powerful motivator of all. We will make sacrifices and bear burdens for those we love that we would not endure for any other reason--not for money, not for recognition, not for power. If love does not exist, our commitment will surely wane.<br><br>If we love the Lord with all our heart, we are willing to give Him everything we possess. Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, on this very campus:<br><br><i>The submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar. ... The many other things we give to God, however nice that may be of us, are actually things He has already given us, and He has loaned them to us. But when we begin to submit ourselves by letting our wills be swallowed up in God's will, then we are really giving something to Him. ... There is a part of us that is ultimately sovereign, the mind and heart, where we really do decide which way to go and what to do. And when we submit to His will, then we've really given Him the one thing He asks of us.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neal-a-maxwell_sharing-insights-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing Insights from My Life</a>," BYU devotional address, 12 January 1999]<br><br>Having a "willing mind" connotes giving our best effort, using our finest thinking, and seeking God's wisdom. It suggests that our most devoted lifetime study should be ofthings that are eternal in nature. It says to me that there must be an inextricable relationship between hearing the word of God and obeying it.<br><br>The first word in the Doctrine and Covenants is<i>hearken.</i>It appears repeatedly in this book of scripture, which is a compilation of "the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation" (D&amp;amp;C 1, preface). The meaning of the word is even specifically given in section 42: "Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey the law which Ishall give unto you" (D&amp;amp;C 42:2).<br><br>In the same chapter as the sacred verse that was a catalyst to the boy Joseph Smith before his profound experience in the Sacred Grove, the Apostle James said, "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves" (James 1:22).<br><br>Some of us "hear" selectively and "do" when it is convenient. One whose "heart" and "mind" are given to the Lord is consistent; whether the burden is light or heavy makes no difference.<br><br>I suggest five essential ways one can genuinely seek to give their heart and mind to the Lord.<br><h2><b>1. Gain and Constantly Nurture Your Own Testimony</b></h2><br>A Latter-day Saint's testimony should include a knowledge of and love for God the Eternal Father; Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son; and the Holy Ghost. It would know of the glorious gospel plan and the centrality of the Savior and His Atonement. It would have an understanding of the "marvelous work and [the] wonder" (2 Nephi 27:26) of the restoration of the Lord's Church in this last dispensation and the role of apostles and prophets from Joseph Smith to Thomas S. Monson.<br><br>If you do not feel the power and security that this knowledge brings, I ask you to study the exhortation of Moroni, often quoted by the full-time missionaries of the Church, but not always followed by investigators. We read:<br><br><i>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</i>[Moroni 10:4]<br><br>Take note that there are three essential requirements: faith in Christ, a sincere heart, and real intent. Perhaps the least understood of these is "real intent." In concert with the other conditions to receiving an answer, real intent means you are willing to do as directed. Consequently, if you are praying without a firm commitment to follow, it is unlikely that direction will come.<br><h2><b>2. Honor Priesthood Ordinances and Covenants</b></h2><br>To help us progress, God asks us to perform priesthood ordinances. Ordinances are sacred ceremonies in which we make commitments to Him, and He confers upon us the potential to receive the blessings of eternity. As covenant children, we have all that is required for eternal success if we are true to our promises. Prepare for the ordinances yet to be performed in your life and be guided in your life decisions by the covenants you have made. When you are evaluating alternatives, ask yourself, "Is this choice consistent with my covenants?"<br><br>Elder D. Todd Christofferson said:<br><br><i>The importance of having a sense of the sacred is simply this--if one does not appreciate holy things, he will lose them. Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself.</i>["<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/d-todd-christofferson_sense-sacred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Sense of the Sacred</a>," fireside address, 7November 2004]<br><br>Please follow the rallying cry of the early pioneers as they were organizing themselves for the treacherous journey westward: "And this shall be our covenant--that we will walk in all the ordinances of the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 136:4).<br><br>When we live by covenant and not convenience, our lives are directed toward our heavenly home.<br><h2><b>3. Root Out Duplicity</b></h2><br>Duplicity is acting one way in public and another way in private. The purpose of our deception is to hide our sins; but, as Jonah learned when he fled to Joppa, you cannot hide from God. Even to others, our deceit will be found out in time, and the damage caused to those closest to us may be irreversible.<br><br>One way to test whether we have "an eye single to the glory of God" (D&amp;amp;C 4:5) or a secondary eye to the evil of the world is to evaluate how we act when we are alone. What sites do we visit on the Internet? What television programs or DVDs do we watch? What kind of books and magazines do we read? Would we be comfortable in the same activities if others were watching?<br><br>James taught, "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways" (James 1:8). Our deceit will affect every facet of our life, impairing our ability to progress in earthly and eternal relationships.<br><h2><b>4. Continually Study the Doctrine</b></h2><br>President Boyd K. Packer has said, "The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior" ("<a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/11/little-children?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Children</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>November 1986, 17). When we know the commandments of God from the writings of the prophets and "liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning" (1 Nephi 19:23), it will change the way we think and act.<br><br>Studying and following the counsel of living prophets is vital. Having prophets of God on earth has become so commonplace for us in this Church that their profound importance and role is often woefully underappreciated.<br><br>In general conference in April 1997, President Henry B. Eyring stated:<br><br><i>Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with strong faith. When a prophet speaks, those with little faith may think that they hear only a wise man giving good advice. Then if his counsel seems comfortable and reasonable, squaring with what they want to do, they take it. If it does not, they consider it either faulty advice or they see their circumstances as justifying their being an exception to thecounsel....</i><br><br><i>Another fallacy is to believe that the choice to accept or not accept the counsel of prophets is no more than deciding whether to accept good advice and gain its benefits or to stay where we are. But the choice not to take prophetic counsel changes the very ground upon which we stand. It becomes more dangerous.</i>["<a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1997/04/finding-safety-in-counsel?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finding Safety in Counsel</a>,"<i>Ensign,</i>May 1997, 25]<br><h2><b>5. Establish a Life of Service</b></h2><br>The Lord simply stated, "If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me" (D&amp;amp;C 42:29). Still in my twenties, I was called to be the bishop of an 850-member ward. Two weeks prior, I, with a partner, founded a company that had just hired and was responsible for several new employees. At the time my wife and I had three active children, ages one to seven. The daunting responsibilities to properly care for my young family, to care for the Saints entrusted to my stewardship, and to create a viable business seemed impossible.<br><br>As I now reflect on the events of the ensuing years, I am convinced that service to others--most important, that to my family--has been one of the great blessings of my life. Without the continual humility and life perspective that service engenders, the allure of the world could easily have entrapped me.<br><br>Serving others emulates the ultimate act of service offered to each of us by the Redeemer of the world. It is a way for us to make partial payment for the opportunity of salvation that comes only through Jesus Christ.<br><br>When I was young, we lived adjacent to the Honolulu Hawaii Stake Tabernacle, a magnificent facility completed in 1941. In September 1954, a major meeting was held there. I was five and my brother was nine. Our mother had just returned from the hospital after giving birth to my parents' third child, a sister, so my mother was unable to attend the meeting. Our father had gone to the meeting early because of administrative responsibilities and was to sit on the stand. My brother and I walked down the lane on which we lived and over a small bridge leading to the tabernacle. We sat on about the tenth row in the large chapel. Presiding and speaking at the meeting was David O. McKay, then the president of the Church. I do not recall specifically anything he said, but I vividly remember what I saw and what I felt. President McKay was dressed in a cream-colored suit, and with his wavy white hair he looked quite regal. In the tradition of the islands, he wore a triple-thick, red-carnation lei. As he spoke, I felt something quite intense and very personal. I later understood that I was feeling the influence of the Holy Spirit. We sang the closing hymn; it is one that is still in our hymnbook, but we do not sing it as often in the Church now. "Who's on the Lord's side? Who? Now is the time to show. We ask it fearlessly: Who's on the Lord's side? Who?" (<i>Hymns</i>, 1985, no. 260). With those words being sung by 2,000 people, but seemingly just for me, I wanted to stand and say, "Iam!"<br><br>Are you "on the Lord's side"? Does He have your heart and willing mind?<br><br>Four weeks ago, Diane and I stood on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, not far from Tiberias. In my mind I could see Peter and six other disciples out fishing. The scriptures say they caught nothing all night. In the morning, the resurrected Jesus stood on the shore, but at first the disciples did not recognize Him. He asked if they had caught any fish. They said no. Jesus said, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find." They did so and caught so many fish they could not draw in their net. Peter then understood who it was on the shore, and he jumped into the water and swam to shore. The other disciples came to shore in a small ship, dragging the net of fishes. They began to cook the fish and eat them with bread. Then Jesus asked Peter what I believe is one of the most important questions in all scripture: "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?" Perhaps He was referring to the fish and the bread, or some other earthly circumstance, but what the Savior was really saying was, "Peter, do you love me more than you love the things of the world?" (See John 21:1–17.)<br><br>Do you love the Lord more than the world? Does He have your heart and willing mind?<br><br>My dear young friends, during this critical time of higher education and transition from youth to adulthood, it is profoundly important that you establish a foundation of loyalty to the Lord. Your very future, your family's future, and the future of the Church depend on it. I testify that "the great plan of happiness" (Alma 42:8) is real. I witness of God, our Heavenly Father, whose plan it is, and of Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, who is central to the plan. I testify of apostles and prophets, whom Iknow and love and gladly follow. With all my heart and all my mind I witness of these truths. They have made all the difference in mylife.<br><br>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br><br><i>Donald L. Hallstrom was a member of the Presidency of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given on 7 December 2010.</i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.
