<h1>Yourself to Raise a Family in the Lord - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is the most imposing congregation I think I have ever spoken to, and I haven't spoken to you yet. It is delightful to be with you here. I deem it a great honor and a privilege to greet you this evening on this Sabbath day in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We meet in his name; it is because of him that we are here. Everything we do in this life that is really worthwhile comes through the Master. If it hadn't been for him, this couldn't be done.<br><br>Down in the Alabama-Florida Mission, the southern part of the United States, I found that there are a lot of "good" people (<i>good</i>is, of course, a relative term) who do not believe that Latter-day Saints (Mormons, they call us) are really Christians. Of course, we are.<br><br>In the words of the great prophet Nephi, recorded in the twenty-fifth chapter of 2 Nephi, verse 26:<br><br><i>We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.</i><br><br>We are Christians. We are of Christ and we look to him as the author and finisher of our faith. It is so important that we understand our responsibilities to him. He has bought us with a price. Yes, he gave everything for us. He did it because he loved us. He took upon himself<i>our</i>sins that we might go free. He had no sins of his own. It was you and it was me that caused him to suffer, but he did it because he loved us, that we might be able to walk uprightly before him and come to know him, that we might know our Father.<br><h2><b>Inner and Outer Beauty</b></h2><br>You look good; you are a good-looking group. I think you are probably the best-looking group in all of this world, not because of the way you wear your hair or the clothes you wear or the false eyelashes you sometimes wear. (You see, you can louse up beauty if you're not careful.) No, you're beautiful because of the spirit that is within you. God is a spirit, but man is also a spirit the same as God is a spirit. That is the real you; that is what is inside and that is what makes you beautiful.<br><br>I had the opportunity some time ago to speak to a group in Pocatello, Idaho, at a Laurels Standards Night. I met a sister there who was eighty-four years old and had been playing the organ in the church since she was twelve years of age. I believe she is one of the most beautiful women that I have ever seen. Oh, she was wrinkled, sure; but to be wrinkled doesn't mean anything. The spirit that was inside of this good sister was radiant; and because it was, she was beautiful. I've known girls who were comely in face and figure but they weren't really beautiful because that radiance wasn't inside. We pretty much look on the outside like we are on the inside. It is almost impossible to hide what is inside. You can try, but it isn't usually successful.<br><br>My grandmother had a favorite expression: "Pretty is as pretty does." I'd see a young girl that I thought was pretty (and I know beauty when I see it, I can prove that) and I'd say, "Grandmother, she's pretty." She'd always say, "Pretty is as pretty does." The comic Andy Griffith claims that "beauty is only skin deep but ugliness goes clean through to the bone." Well, beauty goes all the way through too, and it's what we are inside that makes us look like we do on the outside. That is the reason the sisters in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the kingdom of God, are the most beautiful in all the world because of what they really are.<br><br>As I travel about the Church and have opportunities to visit the different stakes of Zion, I spend the biggest part of Saturday afternoon talking to the stake leadership--the brethren. In the evening I usually have an opportunity to have them invite their wives to accompany them, and they always look much better in the evening meetings than in the afternoon. It never ceases to amaze me (it always comes to my attention as I look into the faces of those lovely sisters sitting next to those not-so-handsome brethren)--now "just how did he talk her into that?" But I know how he did it really, because I've had some experience along that line too. If he loves her enough and he tells her often enough that he does, and then he does nice little things for her to prove that he does, why, he could talk her into almost anything. She can't turn down love--it's impossible.<br><h2><b>Obedience, Sacrifice, and Love</b></h2><br>Until missionaries learn this great lesson--that unless you love your contacts you can't baptize them--they're no good as missionaries. We go into the mission field to learn great lessons. The first great lesson is obedience. It is the first law of heaven. Coupled with obedience is sacrifice, which simply means that instead of endlessly doing what<i>you</i>want to do, you have to do what the<i>Lord</i>wants you to do. That is sacrifice, generally speaking, and when you learn these lessons you quit thinking about yourself and you fall in love with your contacts. You love the people, and if you love them you can baptize them.<br><br>The Lord says, "Love thy neighbor as thyself." He assumed that would be enough love for your neighbor. (Yes, and it usually is, since most of us have a pretty fair opinion of ourselves.) Isn't it interesting that he never tells us why we should love our neighbor? I believe I can tell you why he said that: it was so that you could baptize your neighbor. I don't believe you can baptize your neighbor unless you love your neighbor. But if you love him you can. He will let you. It is very much the same situation as with young girls who want diamond rings. Some say they don't but they're probably lying. All young girls want diamond rings, and that is as it should be. But I've never known a young girl who would take a diamond ring from a young man unless she knew that he loved her first. You see, it means too much. And so it is with our neighbors. If we love our neighbors they are much more apt to listen to us and accept the principles we teach. Then we can baptize our neighbors and the kingdom will roll forth, built on love and unselfishness.<br><h2><b>Unselfishness and Patience</b></h2><br>It is important that we be unselfish, so says the Lord. Sister Emma Riggs McKay came down here to BYU and spoke to the sisters some years ago. I think at least part of what she said could be repeated here. She was talking about the qualifications that women should have in order to be good mothers, and she said this:<br><br><i>There are many qualifications that a woman should have to be a good wife and a mother, but the most important is</i>patience<i>.</i>[<i>The Art of Rearing Children Peacefully,</i>p. 4]<br><br>Patience is a virtue that has to be learned. No one comes here with patience. Generally speaking, little children are the most impatient people in all the world. If they don't get their way they scream and holler and cry. Some beat their heads on the floor. I had one that did that. He came to this earth psychologically opposed to the word<i>no.</i>He couldn't stand to have anybody say no to him. If I said, "No, no, Kirk," he would turn around and beat his head on the floor or on the wall or anyplace he could reach. I don't think he learned that from me, though (generally speaking) I believe children do learn selfishness from their parents. We make them that way because we love them so we let them have their own way until they get to the point where they are spoiled rotten. Then all of a sudden we wake up to the fact that we've got to do something about Junior. He is spoiled rotten. After all, he's running our whole family; and that is a little too much responsibility for a child of four or five, to run a family of seven or eight, but they do it all the time. And so we embark on a long, concentrated program of trying to talk Junior out of being selfish. It usually only takes fifty to seventy years.<br><br>Sister McKay says that the sisters should be patient:<br><br>[Have]<i>patience with children's and husband's tempers, patience with their misunderstanding, with their desires, with their actions.</i><br><br><i>Suppose you ask your husband to carry a mattress downstairs, and instead of carrying it carefully so that not a speck of dirt touches its clean coverage, he throws it through the window upon the lawn below.</i>[Now, I'm not saying that President McKay threw a mattress through the window. Don't misunderstand. Sister McKay was saying this.]<i>He probably did not think of the grimy dirt from the window frame soiling the cover nor of the possible dirt that might be on the lawn. All he wanted was to save time and energy and get the thing over with in a hurry. Will you rave and rant at him, call him a stupid creature who never does things right, or will you think, "Oh, what's the use! The thing is done. Better make the best of it." Always the latter if you can make yourself be calm. Even a slightly sarcastic remark will bring a disagreeable answer, and you'll wish you had not said a word.</i>[<i>The Art of Rearing Children Peacefully,</i>pp. 4–5]<br><br>Sister McKay continues by telling of a time she and President McKay went down to California to dedicate a meetinghouse. She says:<br><br><i>I accompanied my husband to a dedication of a meetinghouse in Los Angeles. We stopped on Wilshire Boulevard to get our car washed.</i>[I think that is an interesting characteristic/personality trait of the prophet. He was going to dedicate a house to the Lord and he was not going to arrive in a dirty car.]<i>I sat on a bench and the President was standing over by the car. Suddenly at my elbow I heard a tiny voice say, "I guess that man over there loves you."</i><br><br><i>Surprised, I turned and saw a beautiful boy about seven years of age with dark curly hair and large brown eyes.</i><br><br><i>"What did you say?"</i><br><br><i>"I said, I guess that man over there loves you."</i><br><br><i>"Why, yes, he loves me; he is my husband. Why do you ask?"</i><br><br><i>"Oh, 'cuz, the way he smiled at you. Do you know, I'd give anything in the world if my Pop would smile at my Mom that way."</i><br><br><i>"Oh, I'm sorry he doesn't," I said.</i><br><br><i>"I guess you're not going to get a divorce, then."</i><br><br><i>"Oh, no, we're not going to get a divorce. We've been married nearly fifty years, and we are very happy. Why do you think that?"</i><br><br><i>"Oh, 'cuz everybody gets a divorce around here. My Pop is going to get a divorce from my Mom. I love my Pop and my Mom and I"--his voice broke and tears welled in his eyes, but he was too much of a little man to let them fall.</i><br><br><i>Then he came very close and whispered confidentially in my ear, "You'd better hurry out of Los Angeles, or you'll get a divorce, too." And he picked up his papers and shuffled down the sidewalk</i>. [<i>The Art of Rearing Children Peacefully,</i>p. 10]<br><br>Oh, what a tragedy it is when parents cannot love each other enough to give their children the security that they need to grow up strong in the faith, to give them a firm "foundation that gives them confidence and self-reliance. We desperately need confidence in ourselves and in our parents and in the Lord. The greatest blessing that you can ever give your children will be to love your mate with all your heart and cleave unto each other.<br><h2><b>Importance of the Family</b></h2><br>We are here upon this earth, each of us, to fill a great mission. Everyone that comes to this earth has a mission to fulfill. The Father had a mission with respect to this earth. His was the mission of creation. He has created everything that is here. We are all his handiwork; yes, we are his children. God, our Heavenly Father, is a family man, and he believes in families. If you don't think so, just look around you. We all belong to him. We are his family, and all of the great blessings that he has in store for his children will come through families. They don't come any other way. Of course, all of his children who are worthy will have the opportunity to have this blessing. Exaltation is a family affair, and so we build temples (houses dedicated to the Lord), but temples are<i>family</i>houses. They are set apart to create families for all eternity. The sealing room in the temple is a family room and the altar of the temple is a family altar. Why, I believe that if we just did the washings, the anointings, the baptisms, the confirmations, the endowments, and the ordinations that take place in the house of the Lord and we never did any sealings there, the house really wouldn't amount to very much. We could probably tear it down and it really wouldn't make much difference. Everything is preliminary to what happens when a man and a woman kneel across the altar of the temple and there make covenants with each other before witnesses in the sight of the Lord for time and all eternity. It is so important that we have this experience. That is the great purpose, the work and the glory of our Father in heaven. He believes in families.<br><br>Our elder Brother, the Lord Jesus Christ, in whose name we meet, also had a mission with respect to this earth, but his was the mission of redemption. He has redeemed all the creations of the Father. That was altogether necessary.<br><br>You can understand how important those two missions are, can't you? If it hadn't been for the Father, we wouldn't be here--none of us. If it hadn't been for the Son, it really would have made no difference whether we came here or not, for everything would have been wasted, but they were true and faithful and fulfilled their missions, and now<i>you</i>have a mission. Every one of you has a mission that is just as important as the mission of the Father and the Son. That mission is the same mission that was given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.<br><h2><b>The Mission of Adam and Eve</b></h2><br>I am aware that you know what happened in the Garden of Eden, but I think it might be profitable if I refreshed your memory just a little bit.<br><br>Adam found himself in a very favorable set of circumstances. He was resting comfortably in the garden. He had a job; yes, the Lord had told him to dress and keep the garden. That is all he had to do. That is no big deal if you don't have weeds growing in the garden, and there were no briars, thistles, and noxious weeds growing in the Garden of Eden. I rather imagine if you looked very closely you would find that Adam was playing around with a stick that was kind of crooked on the end, looking very much like a golf club. (Now, of course, there is nothing wrong with playing with a golf club as long as you fulfill your required responsibilities first.)<br><br>I heard President Joseph Fielding Smith say one time that Adam would still be in the Garden of Eden if it hadn't been for Eve. You see, he was enjoying it there. The Lord, looking upon that scene, saw that it was not good for man to be alone. I believe that he saw that if he didn't give Adam some help, he would never get out of the Garden of Eden. And so the Lord prepared a helpmeet for Adam, someone to help him out of the Garden of Eden. And Eve did her job marvelously well, as the sisters always do. You can depend on the sisters.<br><br>One time I was visiting with Sister Smith and Brother Joseph Fielding came in while we were talking. She turned to him and said, "President, would you tell Brother Rector what you're going to do when you meet Mother Eve."<br><br>Brother Smith said, "I'm going to go up to her and throw my arms around her and give her a big kiss. I'm going to tell her how happy I am that she did what she did in the Garden of Eden because if it hadn't been for her we wouldn't be here."<br><br>It is important that we realize that our first parents met their responsibilities. You see, Eve became dissatisfied with the status quo and I have found that the sisters have been dissatisfied with the status quo ever since. That's true, they are. Eve fulfilled a great mission in provoking her husband to good works. That seems to be the sisters' responsibility, and they do it marvelously well. I am sure that there is a list lying on top of my dresser right now. It is a very simple thing. It says things like "Hang the picture," "Fix the screen door"--you know, just simple things, nothing earthshaking. It isn't that she's trying to counsel the Brethren (you're not supposed to do that), but if I feel like doing something constructive, she would like me to start right here, and that's as it should be.<br><br>Eve and Adam were given a great commandment in the Garden of Eden. They were told that they shouldn't eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; yes, but I don't believe there is a tree of knowledge of good and evil today. I am from Missouri. I was living in Jackson County, Missouri, when I was recalled into the navy just before joining the Church, and I have looked it over pretty good. That commandment doesn't mean anything to us today. It was very important to Adam and Eve, but it doesn't mean anything to you and me.<br><h2><b>Raise a Family in the Lord</b></h2><br>The second great commandment (which was of first importance) was that they should be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. Why? A statement from the First Presidency quotes "that you may have joy and rejoicing in your posterity." You see, "men are that they might have joy" (2 Nephi 2:25). That is what the prophet Lehi said of man and the Prophet Joseph Smith added to that when he said that "joy and happiness are the object and design of our existence and will be the end thereof if we pursue the path that leads to it."<br><br>We are here, then, to be happy--each one of us--and to find real joy, but there is no real joy in this earth outside of fulfilling this great commandment of raising a family in the Lord. We are here to raise that family (not just raise a family, but raise a family<i>in the Lord</i>)<i>.</i>That will take the very best that's in you. Yes, it will take sacrifice and it will take obedience (those two great lessons that you learned in the mission field). Those lessons are primarily to get you in condition to fulfill your eternal mission of raising a family.<br><h2><b>Temple Marriage</b></h2><br>In order to be successful in fulfilling this mission, there are a few things you will have to keep in mind. First, you must be married in the temple. If you raise a family outside of the temple, you lose it and you will fail in your mission, and so you have to be married in the temple. That means you will have to be in condition to go there and then keep yourself in condition to go to the house of the Lord by living in obedience to the commandments. You might call those the "training rules" the Lord has established that you might have this great blessing in his house; in order to be married in the temple you will have to keep the commandments of God.<br><br>If you need to repent, do it. You see, the Master made that possible for us, and everyone of us needs it from time to time. There are things we haven't done that we should have done, or there are things we should have done that we didn't do, but he says that if you will come unto him and have faith in him, confess your sins and forsake them, and follow him, then you go free, for he has paid the price for us. Wouldn't we be silly not to take advantage of that great gift? So, if we need to repent, we should do it.<br><br>It is also very important that you not only be in condition to go to the house of the Lord but that you go there with someone who is worthy to go with you. You cannot go to the house of the Lord and be sealed by yourself. You have to have a companion, which means that you should date someone who can go to the house of the Lord. That means you have to date a Latter-day Saint, and not only a Latter-day Saint but one who is worthy to go to the house of the Lord, or you can't go and be sealed. It is a fact of life that we marry whom we date. Very few times in our culture has anyone ever married someone without dating that person first. And if they do, it doesn't usually work out very well because they weren't very well acquainted. Dating is to get acquainted, but don't be misled. Just because you have fallen in love and you are engaged to be married, you have no rights to each other until you kneel across the altar at the temple, and then things that just a moment before were absolutely forbidden of the Lord become not only acceptable to the Lord but highly recommended. You see, you don't lose anything when you do it the Lord's way, but you have to do it his way if you want his blessing, and so it is important that you be in condition to go to the house of the Lord and keep yourself that way. Go there with someone who is also "in condition." That privilege comes from living the "training rules," or, in other words, keeping the commandments.<br><h2><b>The Father's Responsibility</b></h2><br>Now, it is also important that you understand that there is a division of responsibility in raising a family. The father has the responsibility of providing for the family. It is not the mother's responsibility. The father is going to have to feed, clothe, shelter, and educate them and send them on missions, etc., so his children will have the same experiences that he has had. All this is very expensive today. It costs a lot of money, and that means that you are going to have to have a good job, which means you're going to need a good education. Generally speaking, you need a good education to get a good job today. So get your education--just what you're doing right here--but don't drop out!<br><br>When you find the right girl or boy, as the case may be, you should have a witness that he/she is the right person. You should have a testimony about the person that you marry, just like you have a testimony that the gospel is true, and you can get that kind of witness if you are in condition to get it. You know the gospel is true by studying and praying and attending Church, and you know the person that you marry is the right one by study and prayer and attending Church together. Spend time together; pray about it together (and alone), but be in condition to get that kind of an answer from the Lord. You need to get acquainted with each other under many different sets of circumstances.<br><h2><b>Premortal Covenants</b></h2><br>I am one who believes that many of you here this evening have made covenants with someone before you ever came to this earth. Maybe not everybody did, but many of you did. I did. That's right, and I was not a member of the Church. All you have to do to have such a covenant fulfilled is to live up to the light and knowledge that you have.<br><br>When I was eighteen years old, I saw this little black-haired girl who was just fourteen years old, walking down the street. Now, I know that is not MIA dating age, but I was not a member of the Church, so that didn't apply to me. The first time I saw her walk by I knew she was for me, and so I got acquainted with her and told her so. Yes, I told her she had four years to grow up in. I was going into the navy and I'd be back and marry her. So four years later I came back and married her. After all, I had told her I would, and that is the smartest thing that I have ever done.<br><br>Among other reasons, it was she who was home when those two young men came by and knocked on my door out in San Diego, California. They said they were taking a poll. Now, as a matter of fact, that was the kind of thing Moroni calls a stratagem. They weren't really taking a poll--they were tracting-- but they were using the survey technique. They were asking questions that I had been trying to answer all my life, such as: "Do you believe that God speaks to man today?" "Do you believe that God has a true church on earth?" Well, my wife expected them to come back and give her the answers to the poll questions: "Why, yes, five percent of your neighborhood believe that God speaks to man today, and perhaps ten percent believe that he has a true church on earth." But instead, they came back and gave her<i>Joseph Smith Tells His Own Story</i>(a pamphlet) and the Book of Mormon.<br><br>She wrote me a letter in Hawaii, where I was undergoing a very accelerated training course in the navy. In her letter she said two young men had come through the neighborhood and knocked on the door. Mormons, they were, which of course meant nothing to me because I'd never heard of a Mormon. I really had no idea what a Mormon was. The only thing that registered on me was that two young men had knocked on my door with my wife at home and me 2,000 miles away. I didn't care what they called themselves. What were they doing calling on my wife? In her letter she said, "You know, it is rather strange. They both have the same first name--Elder." You see, we don't understand sometimes that we in the Church have a vocabulary all of our own and that people outside the Church many times don't know what the Mormon elders are talking about. They also invited her to the "stake house." She didn't eat before she went, expecting to be fed. (It must have been an unusual meeting.) Often we do eat in the stake house, don't we? Sometimes it seems the Mormons meet to eat.<br><br>She didn't mention any more about the Church until I came home some thirteen weeks later, and then the first thing she told me when I walked into the house (after having been gone for thirteen weeks) was the Joseph Smith story. When she said that a man had seen a vision in almost modern times, I thought that was the most preposterous thing I had ever heard in my life, and I laughed at her. How could she be so gullible as to swallow this fabulous tale? She then did what the sisters have been doing since Eve's time: she cried. I could see that this really meant something to her, that she believed this fabulous story; so I said, "They must have left something for you to read." Everybody did--Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventists--everybody had been in my home and they all left something to read. I was sure these Mormons had too. "Yes," she said, and gave me<i>Joseph Smith Tells His Own Story,</i>and I read it.<br><br>The power of that testimony didn't come through the printed word to me. I believe that it is necessary to have the elder or the sister there to bear their witness that they know it is true, and when that happens the Holy Ghost can confirm it to the heart of the person and he knows it too. That didn't happen to me, and so I said, "They must have left something else," and she gave me a copy of the Book of Mormon. I took the book and looked through it: "Five hundred and twenty-two pages written by a man, no doubt. I'm sure it's full of errors. I'll shoot this down in fifteen minutes." You see, I had become a real expert on religion by this time. I had read Mary Baker Eddy's<i>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,</i>the Catholic Baltimore<i>Catechism, Father Smith Instructs Jackson,</i>and several other books on religion. I remember one book entitled<i>Human Life of Christ</i>by John Erskin, where he said that the way that Christ fed the 5,000 was that people who came out to hear him all brought their lunch with them and when he preached this sermon on giving of yourself they all opened their lunch and shared it with everybody. Isn't that a "beautiful explanation" of the Lord's miracle?<br><br>I was sure that all religions were man-made, and so I had made up my own religion. It seemed to be as good as anybody else's. I took the book and declared, "I'll shoot it down in fifteen minutes. I'll show you; this is another man-made book." And I started to read the Book of Mormon. I hadn't finished 1 Nephi before I found myself hoping above everything else in this world that this book was true. I said, "Dear God, please let it be the truth. Please let it be true, for if it is, it will answer all the questions I've been trying to answer all my life." And I read on.<br><br>I hadn't finished 2 Nephi before I knew it was true. I found myself reading that book--every word--as the word of the Lord to me. I had prayed one simple prayer to the Lord. If I had prayed it once I had prayed it a thousand times. It was simply, "Dear God, please show me the truth. Please lead me to the truth," and here, through no effort of my own, he had sent these two young men right into my living room with the truth. I knew it was true. I was sure after such a long search that if I ever found the truth it would be like a Cecil B. De Mille production--in technicolor, panavision, and stereophonic sound. No one who heard it could turn it down. It would be blared from the housetop--the truth! That's what I thought.<br><br>Well, you should have seen these two elders that knocked on my door. To begin with, they didn't like each other. No, they didn't get along well at all. One was a very happy soul. He had made up a joke for almost every discussion, and when he would tell his joke somewhere in our discussion his companion turned livid red all over. The companion was a very sober young man. He took Alma to heart when he said, "Be sober, my son." He seldom ever smiled. Their grammar was atrocious. Their diction was worse than mine. So far as knowledge of the world is concerned, they really didn't have any. I knew much more about what was going on in the world than they, but though they didn't particularly like each other, they both loved the Lord. They were willing to overlook these little idiosyncrasies that they each had which made them unacceptable to each other, in order to do the work the Lord had called them to do, and they did it marvelously well.<br><br>It is my witness that the Lord can speak through nineteen-year-olds and speak eloquently, for he did through them. They came to my home the first time (after I returned home), having fasted and prayed for two days. My wife had frightened them: I was going to be a tough nut to crack (or so my wife believed). But before they got to my home I'd finished 2 Nephi and I knew the book was true. I never argued with one word that they told me. But you see, they would have never gotten in my home if it hadn't been for my helpmeet.<br><br>The missionaries knocked on our door just one day after my wife moved into our home. She was what missionaries call a "new move-in," and they always make good contacts. She was also expecting our third child--a new birth in the family seems to make parents receptive to the gospel too. Well, I didn't know when I saw her walking down the street when she was fourteen how I knew her, but I know now. I'm sure we were very well acquainted before we ever came to this earth, and I am sure that many of you can find your covenanted mates if you will just keep the commandments and be in condition to recognize them when you see them. That is very important.<br><h2><b>The Responsibility to Have Children</b></h2><br>To continue, in order to fulfill your mission you have to first be married in the temple. Second, you must be able to provide for your family (that is the father's responsibility), which means he needs to have a good job. In order to get a good job he needs a good education, so get your education. Don't drop out. Stick with it. It may be tough--you may not be able to wear the kind of clothes you'd like to wear, live where you'd like to live, or drive the kind of car you'd like to drive--but those things don't make a real difference anyway. What<i>does</i>make a difference is that you get yourself in condition so that somebody will pay you for your services, that you can provide for your family. Make the material sacrifice to get your education, but don't sacrifice your family to get an education. You see, you don't sacrifice your family for anything. That is your reason for being here upon this earth--to raise a family in the Lord. It would be ridiculous to trade your family for a Ph.D., so it is important that you follow the admonition of the prophet.<br><br>There is a First Presidency statement of April 14, 1969, which has to do with birth control. I believe it is the only time that such a statement has ever been issued by the President of the Church. It is signed by President McKay, President Brown, and President Tanner. It is so important that I am going to read you three paragraphs from it. This is what the Lord has said through his prophet with respect to birth control:<br><br><i>We seriously regret that there should exist a sentiment or feeling among any members of the Church to curtail the birth of their children. We have been commanded to multiply and replenish the earth that we may have joy and rejoicing in our posterity.</i><br><br><i>Where husband and wife enjoy health and vigor and are free from impurities that would be entailed upon their posterity, it is contrary to the teachings of the Church artificially to curtail or prevent the birth of children. We believe that those who practice birth control will reap disappointment by and by.</i><br><br><i>However</i>[and there's always a<i>however;</i>here it is]<i>we feel that men must be considerate of their wives who bear the greater responsibility not only of bearing children, but of caring for them through childhood.</i>[Now we said there is a division of responsibility in raising a family. The father has to provide for the family, but the mother has to bear the children and care for them through childhood. It doesn't mean she can't have some help from her husband, but she'd better not expect too much because she probably won't get it. You see, he has a different responsibility.]<i>To this end</i>[the statement continues]<i>the mother's health and strength should be conserved and the husband's consideration for his wife is his first duty.</i><br><br>Now, I think that says it pretty plain. The Lord is saying that you should have your family when you can. You really can't make a decision when you're going to have children anyway. The Lord makes that decision. You can only decide that you're not going to have children. I doubt if you can afford that. So, have your family when you can but not so fast that you destroy the health of the mother. The mother's health is the only real judgment criterion.<br><br>You don't have to worry about whether you are going to overpopulate Utah, the United States, or the world. That is part of the wisdom of men that is foolishness to God. I flew in a private airplane from Yuma, Arizona, up to Las Vegas, Nevada, just a few hours ago to catch a commercial airplane. Looking down, I didn't believe that rich and fertile area is overpopulated. All it needs is water. What we need is to figure out a way to get water into the area and quit living like pigs and take care of the place where we do live. The Lord says that "the earth is full, and [there is enough] to spare." He didn't say that we are going to have any problem with feeding the people here upon this earth, and I don't believe we are either.<br><br>I worked for the Department of Agriculture for ten years. (I was born and raised on a farm back in Missouri.) It is a fact that for over forty years we have been paying farmers in this country<i>not</i>to produce, and they are still overproducing! That is right. Still we overproduce. If we just turned around and gave the farmer incentive to produce, I'm convinced we could do a fair job of feeding the whole world from right here in the United States of America. But the American farmer is kind of strange. He likes to be paid for what he does.<br><br>No, I don't believe we have to worry about overpopulation; all we have to worry about is keeping mothers healthy. So, have your family when you can but not so fast you destroy the health of the mother. Then you will have the right application with respect to birth control.<br><br>I think LeGrand Richards was number eleven out of thirteen. I heard him say one time he sure is glad they didn't stop with ten. I believe that is the right attitude.<br><h2><b>Church Activity</b></h2><br>It is also important that you raise this family in the Church. That means you have to be active in the Church, which means you have to pay your tithing. There is something about the payment of tithing that makes people active in the Church. I am not sure exactly what it is, but it sure works. I look at tithing records and activity records every weekend in conjunction with stake conferences and they always coincide. People who pay their tithing are active in the Church. I think the day will come when the Lord will divide the Church right down the tithing line. If you pay your tithing, then you have a promise from the Lord that you will always have sufficient for your needs. That is what he says--he will open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing which you will not be able to contain. You will be able to provide for all the choice spirits the Lord sees fit to send you and you will be happy and active and you will raise your children in the Church. It is important, a principle with great promise, and it couldn't be more important.<br><br>I have thought at times that the Church needs the tithing of the members of the Church or it couldn't operate, but I doubt seriously if the Church really needs the tithing of the members to carry on its operations. The Lord runs the Church and I am sure that he knows where all the gold is. That is right. I am convinced he could give one of my cohorts, Elder Loren Dunn (who is six feet six inches) a shovel and tell him where to dig and I believe that Loren could bring back enough gold in about one day to run the Church for the next fifty years. You see,<i>we need</i>to pay our tithing because we need to have the assurance that we can call upon the Lord at any time and he will be there. It is vitally important that we keep these commandments.<br><br>Now, that is about all you have to do to fulfill your mission here upon this earth. It is very simple, isn't it?<i>First,</i>you have to be married in the temple, and you should keep yourself in condition to go back there frequently so that you can renew that covenant. If you don't you will forget your covenants, and if you forget your covenants you will find yourself breaking them and you won't get away with that.<i>Second,</i>you should provide for your family, which means that you should get a good education so you can hold a good job. Get your education.<i>Third,</i>have your family when you can but remember the health of the mother. You must keep her healthy.<i>Fourth,</i>pay your tithing so that you will always be active in the Church and raise your family in the Church. Now, if you will do these four things, you can do just about anything else you want to do while you are here upon this earth and it won't make a whole lot of difference. Some things are important; others are not so much. These are vitally important.<br><h2><b>The Final Judgment</b></h2><br>Now, you know what you are supposed to do, right? Any doubt in anybody's mind what you are supposed to do while you are here? It won't do any good to stand before the bar of God and say, "I didn't understand. I'll do better next time." There won't be any next time when you stand before that bar; that is a one-time affair. You may say, "No, I didn't understand; as a matter of fact I've never heard it." The Lord will say, "Just a moment. Will you rerun that tape, please."<br><br>We are all going to attend the big movie, you know, and that is not my idea either. The Lord says that. It is in the 88th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 108:<br><br><i>And then shall the first angel again sound his trump in the ears of all living, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the mighty works of God in the first thousand years.</i><br><br>We are all going to be there. Yes, it is the great judgment day and we all are going to see everything just the way it happened. The first thousand years should be very exciting because we may even see the creation period. There may be some geologists that will want to dig a hole and sink in it. (Nothing against the geologists, you understand. It's just that I believe they should spend more time studying the scriptures and not looking at so many rocks.) In verse 109 we read:<br><br><i>And then shall the second angel sound his trump, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the thoughts and intents of their hearts, and the mighty works of God in the second thousand years.</i><br><br>Everything that man ever did or thought is going to be revealed for everybody to see.<br><br>When we come to the sixth thousand years, that is really going to be an interesting little segment of this movie because we all are going to be there and be main characters as well. We are going to know exactly what you said and what you thought; it will be displayed for everybody to see right up there in front of everyone. Now if you want something removed from that tape there is a way to do it. You must sincerely and truly repent. This is precisely what the Lord says--he uses the term "blotted out." He says that "their sins will be blotted out" (those that you have fully and truly repented of). Suppose we are all there watching that movie and along comes a big blot. Can you imagine the speculation on the blots? People would say, "Ooh, did you see that? I wonder what happened there?" or "Just as I suspected!!"<br><h2><b>Good Works and Honesty</b></h2><br>It just might be that the Lord will have the blots spliced out and put all the good things together. Some people may have a short tape, which is the deathbed repentance tape. I am not saying that deathbed repentance isn't good. I am just saying that it is not enough to be good--you have to be good for something. You see, we are going to be judged according to our works, so our life's tape should be filled with good works. I don't think it is going to do us any good to deny our acts. Brother J. Golden Kimball said that the hardest thing he ever did was to convince the Brethren he didn't say it.<br><br>It is important that we be honest. If we are not honest, we are really no good. We are no good to ourselves if we lie to ourselves (that is called rationalization). You are the worst person in the world for you to lie to. You will get to believing yourself if you're not careful. We are no good to our friends if we are not honest, as they can't trust us; no good to the Lord<br><br>because he can't use us unless, of course, it would be as a bad example. I presume we can always be used as a bad example.<br><br>At any rate, it is important that we be honest in what we do and accept the responsibility for our acts, because that is the reason we are here--to raise this family in the Lord--and it is a lot of fun. It couldn't be more fun, but it is important that you get about it as soon as you find the right mate. Some of our mission presidents have made statements to returning elders saying they had to be married within six months after they get home. Well, in my opinion they shouldn't have made such statements. Time really isn't a factor. Whether it is two days, two weeks, two years, or ten years, it doesn't really make any difference. You get married when you find the right girl or the right boy and you have a testimony about that person that he/she is the right one. As long as you keep the Lord involved you will be all right, but if the Lord isn't involved with you in your marriage, the marriage will fail. You can't succeed. And so you know what you are supposed to do, and it is important that you get about it.<br><br>As the poet Shakespeare said,<br><br><i>There is a tide in the affairs of men</i><br><i>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</i><br><i>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</i><br><i>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</i><br><i>On such a full sea are we now afloat,</i><br><i>And we must take the current when it serves,</i><br><i>Or lose our ventures.</i>[<i>Julius Caesar,</i>IV.iii. 216–22]<br><br>You see, you won't always have this opportunity. Opportunity, generally speaking, comes but once, and you'd better be ready to take advantage of it at that time.<br><h2><b>Fulfilling our Missions</b></h2><br>It is important that we understand what our responsibilities are. I will close with a verse from a play that I saw here at BYU some time ago, called<i>Joan of Lorraine.</i>Some of you may have seen it. It was well done. It depicts the story of Joan of Arc and how she heard voices from the Lord. She followed those voices and led the armies of France and was tremendously successful, but at the height of her success the tide of public opinion turned against her and she was tried by the Catholic Church, which did not believe in revelation from the Lord. The Inquisition gave her an option: she could either deny she heard those voices and they would let her live, in prison; or, if she insisted she heard those voices, they would burn her at the stake as a witch. Joan didn't want to die. She had everything to live for. She was just nineteen years old (about the age of a lot of you), but she knew she had heard those voices and she knew the Lord knew. She couldn't deny it (she was honest), and so she said these words:<br><br><i>Every man gives his life for what he believes. Every woman gives her life for what she believes. Sometimes people believe in little or nothing. Nevertheless, they give up their lives to that little or nothing. One life is all that we have and we live it as we believe in living it and then it's gone, but to surrender what you are and live without belief, that is more terrible than dying. More terrible than dying young.</i>[Maxwell Anderson,<i>Joan of Lorraine,</i>Act III]<br><br>There are a lot of things more terrible than dying, my young brothers and sisters. Not to live up to the high commission which you received from your Heavenly Father when you were set apart to come to this earth and fulfill this mission--that is much more terrible than dying. And so it is important that we recognize that this<i>is</i>the most important mission that we could ever have: to raise a family in the Lord.<br><br>Raise up choice children. Teach them to love the Lord and then keep his commandments and walk uprightly before him, because when you do you will give them the surest foundation for real joy and happiness and if they are happy you will be too. Oh, it is great to be the parents of righteous children. On the other hand, in Shakespeare's words, "How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child" (<i>King Lear,</i>l.iv 288–89). When you teach your children to love the Lord--which means they keep his commandments--they will be thankful, happy, and successful, and so will you, for this is your mission.<br><br>The kingdom is rolling forth as never before. What a great time to live in the Church and kingdom of God. There has been a 94-percent increase in membership in the last twelve years, led by South America with an 1,100-percent increase and followed by Central America with a 956-percent increase in membership in the last twelve years. This increase is followed by the Orient (Japan, Korea, Philippine area), with a 750-percent increase. In the United States alone we had a 50-percent increase in the last twelve years. This is happening at a time when many of the Christian churches are reducing in membership, but not so the Church and kingdom of God because, you see, it is that stone which the Lord revealed to Daniel, which would be cut out of the mountain without hands. No, it is not man-made. It was done by the Lord and it is rolling forth down the mountainside. It will break down all other kingdoms; it will fill the whole earth and stand forever.<br><br>The kingdom is a winner. Isn't it great to be part of a winner? Oh, I love a winner. I hate to lose. I think I am the worst loser in all the world. I don't believe this business that "it matters not whether you win or lose but how you play the game." I think it makes a lot of difference whether you win or not. I believe we came here to win, and we will win if we stick with the Lord, because the Lord is not a loser. He is a winner, and so is the Church and kingdom, and so will we be when we do it the Lord's way.<br><br>My young brothers and sisters, I am a witness before God that he lives. I know he lives and that he hears and answers prayers, for he has heard and answered mine. I bear testimony to you that Jesus is the Christ and that he lives. I know he lives and that he has reestablished his Church upon the earth in our own day and time through the great Prophet Joseph Smith, wonderful man that he was, and that we have a prophet of God on earth today. President Harold B. Lee is a prophet of the living God, and he makes the decisions in the Church and kingdom of God today under the direction of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, whose Church it really is.<br><br>I bear this witness unto you in all soberness and leave you my love and my blessing and my most fond affection, to you, the youth of Zion, upon whom so much depends. You are the best generation that has ever been born and much depends on you. We are looking to you to bear off the kingdom triumphantly, which I am persuaded you will do. I hope you know that I love you because I do. In Jesus' name. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Hartman Rector, Jr., was a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this fireside address was given at Brigham Young University on 7 January 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>&#039;s Resolutions: A Time to Choose - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters, I am pleased to have this opportunity to be with you on this occasion here in the Marriott Center.<br><br>As I look at you my thoughts turn to your parents. Each week it is my opportunity to be in the home of a stake president, or a counselor to a stake president; and it's interesting, as we visit with them, when they have a son or a daughter at Brigham Young, that invariably the conversation will turn to the most important thing in their lives, namely you. It is a marvelous opportunity for me to let them know of the activities which you pursue here at Brigham Young University, the fellowship which is yours, and the opportunities which come your way. Sometimes rather interesting things occur when we stay in the homes of your parents far from here. We've had situations where a tiny brother or sister, not knowing that mother and dad have given their bedroom and their bed to the General Authority, will creep into the bedroom early in the morning and think that he or she is crawling into the bed with mother and father, only to find that such is not the case, but that next to the little one is a General Authority of the Church. But we don't mind; it's just as if we were home.<br><br>On one occasion while visiting the Indianapolis Stake, I remember President Low, who is with Purdue University there, saying to me, "Brother Monson, would you like to come out to my home and stay with us, or would you prefer to forgo that forty-mile drive and stay here with my counselor in Indianapolis?"<br><br>I responded, "Well, President Low, it's late at night, and if it's all the same to you I'll stay with your counselor here in Indianapolis."<br><br>The next morning President Low greeted me at eight o'clock and said, "Elder Monson, you made an inspired decision."<br><br>I said, "How's that?"<br><br>He replied, "Well, we have a son away at Brigham Young University, and our anticipation was that we, of course, would have you occupy our bedroom on Saturday evening. But unknown to us, and totally unexpectedly, our son returned from Brigham Young University at two in the morning, came in the front door, walked up the stairs to our bedroom, turned on the light, and yelled, 'Surprise!'" I don't know who would have been more surprised on that occasion, the Brigham Young University student or Elder Monson. We love you, and that's why I am here today.<br><h2><b>New Year's Resolutions</b></h2><br>As I left our driveway early this morning, I noticed a remnant of Christmas: the old Christmas tree, on its side, awaiting its final journey to the incinerator. Gone was the tinsel; carefully tucked away in boxes awaiting next year were the trimmings; and Christmas and 1972 had departed. I looked at the tree and thought to myself, "We are in a new year: 1973. We are in a new semester here at Brigham Young University. Isn't this a most appropriate time to refer to Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, and read what he had to say about the times in our lives and the events that take place?"<br><br>In the third chapter of Ecclesiastes we read:<br><br><i>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</i><br><br><i>A time to be born, and a time to die;...</i><br><br><i>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</i>[Eccles. 3:1–2, 4]<br><br>And I would add: a time to choose. There is no better time in all the world to make important choices than at the beginning of a new semester, and particularly at the beginning of a new year, for we literally become the product of our choices. Our choices determine our destiny.<br><br>I thought today of the words of William C. Clegg, the poet, writer of a song which we so frequently sing:<br><br><i>Know this, that every soul is free</i><br><i>To choose his life and what he'll be,</i><br><i>For this eternal truth is given</i><br><i>That God will force no man to heaven.</i><br><br><i>He'll call, persuade, direct aright,</i><br><i>And bless with wisdom, love, and light,</i><br><i>In nameless ways be good and kind,</i><br><i>But never force the human mind.</i><br><br>We have the opportunity to choose. I think an awareness of this truth prompted Ella Wheeler Wilcox to pen the lines:<br><br><i>One ship drives east, and another west,</i><br><i>With the self-same winds that blow.</i><br><i>'Tis the set of the sail, and not the gale,</i><br><i>Which tells us the way to go.</i><br><br><i>Like the winds of the sea are the ways of fate,</i><br><i>As we journey along through life;</i><br><i>'Tis the set of the soul that decides the goal,</i><br><i>And not the calm or the strife.</i><br><br>We can choose our future.<br><br>I made a few resolutions at the commencement of this new year. I'd like to share them with you, hoping that you, too, will join in making the same choices, the same resolutions.<br><br>First in 1973,<i>I will listen.</i>Second,<i>I will learn.</i>Third,<i>I will labor.</i>And fourth,<i>I will love.</i>Four words beginning with the letter<i>l,</i>but four words which can well determine our destiny.<br><h2><b>Listen</b></h2><br>When it comes to listening, and my promise to be a listener, and your promise to be a listener, I would hope that you would listen to your mother and listen to your father, each of whom is upon his or her knees each morning and each evening, praying for you, asking our Heavenly Father to watch over you and to guide you in your selections, to be cautious, as it were, in your conduct, and to generally be, as it were, a parent in their absence. I believe that when we recognize our parents and the fact that they are concerned for you and for me, then we honor them, and the words echoing from Mount Sinai have a personal meaning: "Honor thy father and thy mother."<br><br>I trust that we will listen to the words of the prophets, and particularly the counsel and the advice of our prophet, seer, and revelator, President Harold B. Lee. I hope also that we will listen to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit. I promise you that if we have an ear attuned to the Holy Spirit, if there is a desire for righteousness within our heart, and our conduct reflects that desire, we shall be guided by that Holy Spirit.<br><br>Just at Christmastime, for example, I was returning home from an activity. I drove on a street that I very seldom travel. As I proceeded eastward on California Avenue, I happened to think, "In one of these houses there resides a family that lived in our ward when I was bishop, long years ago. I wonder how Sister Thomas is getting along." I drove right on by, hurriedly anticipating my next appointment. But then the Spirit seemed to indicate to me, "Why don't you go back, Brother Monson, and find out how Sister Thomas is getting along?" I turned the car around, found the house, pulled into the driveway, and knocked at the door. No one answered. I knocked again. Still no answer. I returned to the automobile and began to back out onto the street, when someone appeared at the doorway. I walked over to the doorway, and there I beheld a lovely, silver-haired woman with whom I had served in the MIA years before, Sister Zella Thomas. I extended my hand and said, "Sister Thomas, it is good to see you. How are you?" her hand seemed to grope for mine.<br><br>She said, "I know the voice, but I can't see you. I'm blind."<br><br>Only then did I appreciate why the Lord had directed me to bring a Christmas greeting to this sweet friend of years ago and to her family. As I talked to her and to her family members, I found that on that particular day she happened to be remembering the anniversary of the death of her eldest daughter. She particularly needed comfort from a source known as the priesthood of God. I hope that I shall ever listen for the whisperings of that Holy Spirit, that not only at Christmastime but during each day of the year you and I may have the opportunity to respond to these promptings and the directional influence of our Heavenly Father. Therefore, I promise to<i>listen.</i><br><h2><b>Learn</b></h2><br>Number two,<i>I will learn.</i>It isn't enough simply to listen if we don't learn. I make a pledge that I will learn more from the scriptures and, hopefully, that you too will have that privilege. Wouldn't it be marvelous if we could take into our hearts that counsel from the Lord, "Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;amp;C 88:118). Let us learn from the standard works, but let us also learn from the lives of our Presidency of the Church and the lives of those who are closest to us. For example, I believe that I can learn patience by better studying the life of our Lord and Savior. Can you imagine the disappointment which he must have felt, knowing that he had the keys to eternal life, knowing that he had the way for you and for me to gain entrance into the celestial kingdom of God, as he took his gospel to those people in the meridian of time and saw them reject him and reject his message? Yet he demonstrated patience. He accepted his responsibility in life, even to the cross, the Garden of Gethsemane preceding it. I would hope to learn patience from the Lord.<br><br>Next I would hope to learn the principle of acceptance. And I would learn that from President Hugh B. Brown, a man who on many occasions has spoken to you here, a man who for seven years has said good-bye to his sweetheart each morning, as she has been confined to her bed, paralyzed from a stroke. And yet he is encouraged by her example. She'll whisper good-bye; she'll whisper hello; but that's about the extent of what Sister Brown can say. As I see that loyal husband and father say good-bye to his wife and speak of her, I think of the time when he and I came to Brigham Young University a few years ago, when I was to give a commencement message. As we left President Brown's home, and he entered the car, he said, "Before we leave, wait a moment." He took from his pocket a handkerchief, and he waved it out the window of the car. I looked toward the home and saw Sister Brown, sitting in a wheelchair in front of the window, waving her handkerchief back. He said, "Now we can go."<br><br>I said, "No, President Brown, I want to know what's all this about the waving of the handkerchief?"<br><br>He said, "From the first day we were married, when I heard a rap at the window as I walked down the pathway and turned and saw Sister Brown waving a handkerchief, I fumbled around and found one and waved back, and that has been a sign between the two of us that everything would be all right until we were together again that evening." What a beautiful lesson from which I might learn an important principle in life.<br><br>I believe that I could learn other lessons. From President N. Eldon Tanner I could learn loyalty. Here is a leader, a man who is integrity through and through, a man who has the capacity to be a true counselor as he was to President McKay, a true counselor to President Smith, and today a true counselor to President Harold B. Lee--unyielding, undeviating, seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. I would learn that lesson from President Tanner.<br><br>I would learn from President Marion G. Romney a lesson of tenacity. Here is one who clings to truth, who clings to duty, who clings to the word of the Lord. Nothing can shake him. We could well profit from his example.<br><br>From President Spencer W. Kimball I would learn cheerfulness. I would learn devotion to duty. A man who has undergone major surgery, who has undergone serious treatments relative to another illness, and yet a man with whom I have been in session already this morning, in the fulfillment of his responsibility as chairman of the Missionary Executive Committee. He does not let anything stand between him and the performance of his task.<br><br>These are lessons which I hope to learn by emulating my brethren. I offer the same to you and would urge that you join me, in 1973, with a pledge,<i>I will learn.</i><br><h2><b>Labor</b></h2><br>Then, number three,<i>I will labor.</i>It's not enough to wish, it's not enough to dream, it's not enough to promise, it's not enough to pledge. Literally, we must do. The Lord said: "He that thrusteth in his sickle<i>with his might</i>...layeth up in store that he perisheth not" (D&amp;amp;C 4:4; italics added). And Nephi declared, "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded" (1 Ne. 3:7). It was James who summed up this lesson: "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves" (James 1:22).<br><br>No better example of laboring in the vineyard of God can be found than Elder LeGrand Richards, a special person in the hearts of all of the Latter-day Saints everywhere. I know of no personality in the Twelve who is more genuinely loved, no spirit more sweet, no service more sacred than that offered and rendered by LeGrand Richards. Did you know, for example, that there is never a day when Elder Richards is free from pain, that his hip bothers him constantly? Did you know that he's excused from kneeling in our prayers but never accepts the excuse, that he kneels right with everyone else, although one can tell from his face that it brings him physical pain? And then, at the conclusion of the prayer, one will be on one side and one of us on the other, and we'll lift him to his feet, and he'll thank us. Each week he's out to a conference in the far reaches of the Church, building and lifting, obedient to the counsel of the apostle Peter. "Be ready always," said he, "to give...every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you" (1 Pet. 3:15).<br><br>How many people can trace their membership in the Church to an introduction from Elder LeGrand Richards, particularly through that classic of his,<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder.</i>Earlier this summer, for example, I had a weekend free. Yet the Spirit prompted me to fulfill a responsibility. I boarded the plane for San Francisco, and there met with our branch of single people in San Francisco, and then boarded the plane to go to Los Angeles, where I might have the opportunity to meet with our young adult leadership in the southern California area. As I sat down, the seat next to me was empty. However, there occupied that seat eventually a most beautiful young lady. I noted that she was reading a book. As one is wont to do, I glanced at the title:<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder.</i>I said to her, "Oh, you must be a Mormon."<br><br>She responded, "Oh, no. Why would you ask?"<br><br>I replied: "Well, you're reading a book written by a very prominent member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."<br><br>She said, "Is that right? A friend gave this to me, but I don't know much about it. However, it has aroused my curiosity."<br><br>Then I wondered. Should I be forward and say more about the Church? And the words of Peter came again, to be ready at all times. And I decided that this was the time when I should bear my testimony. I told her that it was my privilege years ago to have assisted Elder Richards in printing<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder.</i>I told her of this great man. I told her of the many thousands of people who had embraced the truth after reading that which he had prepared. Then it was my privilege, all the way to Los Angeles, to answer her questions relative to the Church--intelligent questions, that came from a heart which was seeking the truth. I asked if I might have the opportunity to have missionaries call upon her. I asked if she would like to attend our branch in San Francisco. Her answers were affirmative. Upon returning home I wrote to President Irven G. Derrick of the San Francisco Stake and passed along to him this information. Can you imagine my delight when, about a month ago, I received a call from President Derrick, in which he said, "Elder Monson, I thought you would like to know that today Yvonne Ramirez, a stewardess with United Airlines, a young lady who sat next to you from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a young lady to whom you said that it was not coincidence that you sat next to her and that she was reading<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>on that trip, has become the newest member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." I was overjoyed.<br><br>I realize that I have a responsibility to<i>labor.</i><br><h2><b>Love</b></h2><br>And then that final pledge:<i>I will love.</i>Do you remember the answer which the Savior gave to the inquiring lawyer who asked, "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"<br><br>And he replied, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Matt. 22:36–39).<br><br>It was Shakespeare who wrote, "They do not love who do not show their love." How might you and I demonstrate our love for God and love for our fellowmen? Through obedience to God's commands and the counsel of his servants. We have the privilege to obey the law of tithing, to obey the code of morality, to obey in each facet of our lives the word of our Heavenly Father.<br><br>There is a poem, a very beautiful classic--it's almost a song--"How do I love thee?" I won't attempt to provide that illustration today, but choose instead to recall the Primary lesson of long ago, even a verse which is more my style and closer to my heart:<br><br><i>"I love you, Mother," said little John;</i><br><i>Then forgetting his work, his cap went on,</i><br><i>And he was off to the garden swing,</i><br><i>Leaving Mother the wood and the water to bring.</i><br><br><i>I love you, Mother," said rosy Nell,</i><br><i>"I love you more than words can tell."</i><br><i>So she teased and she pouted half the day,</i><br><i>Till Mother rejoiced when she went to play.</i><br><br><i>"I love you, Mother," said little Fan,</i><br><i>"Today I'll help you all I can.</i><br><i>How glad I am that school doesn't keep."</i><br><i>So she rocked the baby till he fell asleep.</i><br><br><i>Then stepping softly, she fetched the broom,</i><br><i>Swept the floor, tidied the room.</i><br><i>Busy and happy all day was she,</i><br><i>Busy and happy as a child could be.</i><br><br><i>"I love you, Mother," again they said,</i><br><i>Three little children going to bed.</i><br><i>Now how do you think that mother guessed</i><br><i>Which of them really loved her best?</i><br><br>Our Heavenly Father can appreciate our love for him by how well we serve him and how well we serve our fellowmen.<br><h2><b>By Love Serve One Another</b></h2><br>Four pledges for the new year:<i>I will listen, I will learn, I will labor, I will love.</i>As we fulfill these pledges, we can have the guidance of our Heavenly Father and in our own lives experience true joy. Now, I don't simply mean that we should make a wish, or that we should dream a dream, but rather determine to do that which we pledge to accomplish. We can, if we will. It was Henry Ford, the industrialist, who declared, "Whether you think you can, or whether you think you can't, you're right." Now, shall we go forward with such resolutions? Can we change our practices if such need changing? I declare that we can.<br><br>For an example, may I refer to an experience which I heard a friend relate to me and to a public audience some years ago. He was talking about his boyhood. "My," he said, "my twin brother and I had a boyhood filled with difficulty. We had a lovely mother and we had a fine father, but he had become addicted to drink. It was frequently our task to go to the saloon on Saturday night, at mother's bidding, and bring father home. It was sad." My friend continued: "On one occasion, my twin brother and I were celebrating our thirteenth birthday. We had invited our playmates to our home for a party and were playing games and enjoying the day when in stumbled father, dead drunk. He looked at us. Our embarrassed friends fled from the room. Mother had a pained expression upon her face. We said some unkind things to our father. 'Can't you stay sober, Dad? Even on our birthday?'" That young man stated, "My father turned to me and to my twin brother and said, 'Boys, I'm sorry. I promise you I shall never touch another drop of liquor.'"<br><br>The same old story, the same old tune, and into the bedroom he went. The boys complained to their mother. They were harsh in their attitude toward Dad. But that wonderful mother said to them, "Boys, your father holds the priesthood, and one day he will honor it. So I ask that you honor him."<br><br>The young man declared, "My father was true to his word. Never again did he touch liquor. He became the kindest and most considerate father twin boys could ever have. And oh the joy this change in Dad brought to our mother!" That father passed away some time ago, but that mother, who had the ability to inspire within her twin sons that a man's word can be his bond when he really means it, had the privilege to see each of those twin sons called to serve as a mission president in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br><br>I testify today that when the Savior spoke those words recorded in Revelation he was giving you and me counsel to help us be true to our pledge this new year. Remember his words? "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him" (Rev. 3:20). My prayer today is that we will have listening ears, that we might in turn hear his knock, appreciate the invitation of our Lord, and have the wisdom to open wide the doorway to our heart and the portals to our mind, that Jesus Christ might come in unto us. Shall we make room for him in our hearts? Shall we provide time for him in our lives? Once again the choice is yours, and the choice is mine, remembering that our choices, our decisions, determine our destiny.<br><br>God bless you in your new semester, bless you in every part of your lives. I leave with you my testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that our Heavenly Father hears your prayers, that he will guide you in your determination to serve him and keep his commandments<i>as you listen, as you learn, as you labor,</i>and<i>as you love.</i><br><br>I declare that we are led by a prophet of God, even President Harold B. Lee, a man from whom we can learn important lessons, a man who teaches all of us the beautiful lesson of humility. When we see President Lee stand and hear him say to the membership of the Church and to people everywhere, "I am not the head of the Church. I am sustained as President, but the head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Jesus Christ the Lord; and I shall attempt to so live that he can direct the Church through his prophet," I am grateful for the humility and for the leadership of God's prophet, seer, and revelator, President Harold B. Lee.<br><br>I thank my Heavenly Father too for the privilege which has been mine today to have by my side here on the stand my sweetheart, even my wife, who brings me joy, to have by her my mother, who gave me birth and taught me in those tender years, and our daughter, who is representative of each of you here today, a student at Brigham Young University. I express my gratitude to the Lord and to our Heavenly Father and ask our Father's blessing to be with each of you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Thomas S.

<h1>t in All Behavior - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
One of the principles of the BYU Code of Honor is:<br><br><i>Be honest in all behavior.</i><br><br><i>This includes not cheating, plagiarizing, or knowingly giving false information.</i><br><br>I propose to speak to you today about honesty and truthfulness.<br><br>There are few words in the English language with any more beautiful connotations than the word<i>truth.</i>In one of its meanings, the word<i>truth</i>is synonymous with the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scripture teaching us that the glory of God is intelligence adds "or in other words, light and truth" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36). The Psalmist referred to God as the "Lord, God of truth" (Ps. 31:5). John described Jesus as "full of grace and truth" (John 1:14).<br><br>The children of God have always been commanded to seek the truth and to say what is true. We are all familiar with the Ten Commandments the Lord gave the children of Israel through Moses. They include: "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" (Exod. 20:16). Proverbs contains this teaching: "A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape" (Prov. 19:5).<br><br>There is no more authoritative or clear condemnation of the dishonest and lying person than the Savior's description of the devil as a liar and as the father of lies (John 8:44). In the apostolic letters we read these commandments: "Lie not one to another" (Col. 3:9), and "Wherefore, . . . speak every man truth with his neighbor" (Eph. 4:25). In his condemnation of the lawless and disobedient, the apostle Paul listed murderers, whoremongers, those that defiled themselves with mankind (an obvious reference to homosexuality), and "liars and perjured persons" (1 Tim. 1:9–10).<br><br>Jacob, the Book of Mormon prophet, declared that the liar "shall be thrust down to hell" (2 Ne. 9:34). Similarly, in the great vision on the three degrees of glory, the Prophet Joseph Smith included "liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie" as among those who were to "suffer the wrath of God on earth," and to be cast down to hell to "suffer the vengeance of eternal fire" (D&amp;amp;C 76:103–6; also D&amp;amp;C 63:17). Elsewhere in the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "Woe be unto him that lieth to deceive . . . for such are not exempt from the judgment of God" (D&amp;amp;C 10:28); and "Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent shall be cast out" (the law of the Church--D&amp;amp;C 42:20).<br><br>Revealed scripture teaches us that truth is a "knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come; And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning" (D&amp;amp;C 93:24–25). To speak the truth is therefore to speak things as they were and as they are. In other words, to give an accurate account of the facts.<br><br>The thirteenth Article of Faith declares that "we believe in being honest, [and] true. . . ." To be "true" includes appearing to be what we really are. In this usage, truth is the opposite of the hypocrisy that our Savior condemned so vigorously. His stern rebuke of hypocrisy rings down through the centuries in all the sharpness with which it was originally issued:<br><br><i>Ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</i>[Luke 11:39]<br><br><i>For ye are like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.</i><br><br><i>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity</i>. [Matt. 23:27–28]<br><h2><b>Some Examples of Dishonesty</b></h2><br>In speaking upon the subject of honesty and truthfulness I am keenly aware that most of our BYU students are honest and truthful, fulfilling the commandments to the best of their ability. But there are many who need reminding. We are told that one purpose of the gospel is to "make bad men good and good men better." The commandments of the Lord pose a standard so high that we are all challenged when commanded to live them to perfection.<br><br>I once attended a revival sermon preached by a minister of another church. His subject was sin. I soon learned that he was against it. Calling sin by name, he condemned it, castigated it, cussed it, discussed it, consigned it to outer darkness, and called his listeners to repent from it. After his vigorous half-hour sermon, I had no doubts whatever that he was against sin, but I was no wiser about what it was.<br><br>By now you know that I am in favor of honesty and truthfulness and against lying. To avoid any possible doubt about the kind of dishonesty and lying I condemn, I propose to give specific examples.<br><br>It is dishonest to write a check with insufficient funds in the bank to cover the check. The check, being a false representation of fact, is a lie. It is also a crime and deserves to be treated that way.<br><br>It is also dishonest to obtain merchandise on credit, such as by using a credit card, without knowing how you will pay the debt. At an aggravated level, when the individual, upon contracting a debt, has no intention of paying it, his obtaining merchandise by this means is the crime of obtaining property under false pretenses.<br><br>Similarly, it is dishonest for a student to run up a bill for rent, telephone services, or other obligations, and then skip out, leaving roommates to carry the burden. It is dishonest to make a long-distance call and charge it to a nonexistent number. It is also dishonest and fraudulent to use the telephone to send messages that do not result in fair charges on the telephone bill. This includes the use of an uncompleted collect or person-to-person call placed in such a way that it carries a coded message, such as "I have arrived safely at my destination." Telephone executives advise that this is a major problem, and I regret that it involves our community as well as others. The telephone company sells the service of its long-distance lines. When a person uses those lines to convey messages but evades payment, that person has stolen something from the company just as surely as he would steal from a movie theater by sneaking past the ticket window, or from a merchant by slipping merchandise past the cash register without paying. In each of these instances the crime of theft is aggravated by the lie the thief tells about his intent.<br><br>Also to be classified as a lie and a dishonest act, since it involves a falsification of identity or intent, is the practice of using another student's activity card or lending an activity card to give an unqualified person admission to facilities and activities. Another instance of falsification of identity has been used to obtain access to the Varsity Theater. When an attendant at the Varsity Theater observes a patron who is clearly in violation of our Dress and Grooming Standards, he is instructed to ask whether the person is a BYU student. We do this to permit us to take the person is a BYU student. We do this to permit us to take appropriate action for the student but to avoid giving offense to campus visitors, who are not subject to our Dress and Grooming Standards. I am sorry to report that some liars have denied their student status in order to avoid their responsibilities to our standards. That kind of reprehensible conduct not only corrupts the liar, it also inhibits our efforts to treat our guests with dignity and fairness.<br><br>A dishonest act is also committed by the person who, without authorization, pulls class cards for other persons at registration time. A student who solicits another to do this for him asks him to lie and commit a dishonest act. A handful of long-haired male students have engaged in another dishonest practice at registration. Unwilling to conform to our grooming standard on the length of hair and also unwilling to face up honestly to the consequences of that refusal, a few young men have come through the registration line wearing short-haired wigs. That kind of conduct would be ridiculous and laughable if it were not such a classic example of lying deception to gain advantage. Persons guilty of this kind of dishonesty should remember President Tanner's statement in his message to the ten-stake fireside last November: "If a young man is dishonest in any way, he is on the way to destruction."<br><br>Karl G. Maeser taught that sooner or later everyone of us "must stand at the forks of the road, and choose between personal interests and some principle of right" (Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser, Mormon Educator,</i>p. 74).<br><br>A person who faces up to the truth and speaks it honestly, without reservation and without attempted concealment, is on the path of growth and success. An individual who conceals and misrepresents, however small the matter, sows the seeds of his own corruption. As Thomas Jefferson observed:<br><br><i>He who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, 'til at length it becomes habitual; he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world's believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all its good dispositions.</i>[Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Peter Carr, 19 August 1785, quoted in<i>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,</i>13th ed., p. 373]<br><h2><b>Knowingly Giving False Information</b></h2><br>Whenever I hear persons argue that it is only a "little lie," I think of the criminal who approached an employee and asked, "Would you help me steal your employer's property if I paid you one million dollars?" After a moment's thought, the surprised employee said that he supposed he would, for one million dollars. The criminal replied: "Well, I will give you twenty dollars, so lets get started."<br><br>The employee angrily replied, "What do you take me for, a thief?"<br><br>"We have already established that," the criminal responded; "now we are just haggling over the price."<br><br>Whether the amount is large or small, the crime is stealing. Whether the lie is large or small, the sin is lying.<br><br>At Brigham Young University we believe that we do not serve our students well if we teach them all the wisdom in the world but fail to give them the basic principles of righteous living that will give them direction in this life and eternal happiness in the world to come.<br><br>Since its earliest days, Brigham Young University has been concerned with the self-discipline, training, and conduct of the individual. Character training was an important part of the philosophy of Dr. Karl G. Maeser, the founding genius of Brigham Young University. No one was truly educated, in his eyes, unless his character, honor, and truthfulness were above criticism. He asked all who entered Brigham Young Academy to give him their word of honor that they would live in accordance with the high ideals and standards of the Church and the regulations of the school. We still ask students to make that promise, a commitment to live by the principles of the Code of Honor.<br><br>When I was a student at BYU twenty years ago, I often heard President Wilkinson refer to one of Karl G. Maeser's teachings about honor. The example was so vivid and applicable that I often recalled it after I left BYU. I will share it with you:<br><br><i>My young friends, I have been asked what I mean by word of honor. I will tell you. Place me behind prison walls--walls of stone ever so high, ever so thick, reaching ever so far into the ground--there is a possibility that in some way or another I may be able to escape. But stand me on that floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of that circle? No, never! I'd die first!</i>[Alma P. Burton,<i>Karl G. Maeser, Mormon Educator,</i>p. 71]<br><br>President McKay was fond of quoting a well-known Scottish writer who declared that "it is a greater compliment to be trusted than to be loved" (George Macdonald, quoted in<i>Richard Evans' Quote Book,</i>p. 179).<br><br>One of the most grievous forms of lying is a lie told to a bishop or branch president or stake president or other Church officer. Serious also are lies told to university personnel, to public officials, or to others with important responsibilities that can be frustrated by the lie and the liar. President Spencer W. Kimball has written:<br><br><i>Those who lie to Church leaders forget or ignore an important rule and truth the Lord has set down: that when he has called men to high places in his Kingdom and has placed on them the mantle of authority, a lie to them is tantamount to a lie to the Lord; a half truth to his officials is like a half truth to the Lord.</i>[<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness,</i>p. 183]<br><br>A lie is not always told in so many words. It may be a creature of concealment or a misrepresentation by action or a half-truth. According to Elder Richard L Evans,<br><br><i>Truth or untruth is not always altogether a matter of literal language, but often of implication, of inflection, of innuendo, of subtle suggestion. A clever person intent on being untruthful can give a false impression, even when his literal words can little be called into question.</i>["The Spoken Word,"<i>Improvement Era</i>(November 1961), p. 854]<br><br>What would you say about the conduct of a Church member of my acquaintance who once bragged to me about the following incident? His Church responsibilities required him to attend a stake auxiliary meeting that was held during a time when he was required to be present for shift work at his place of employment. He asked his employer for permission to attend the meeting, but permission was denied. "But I fooled him," this brother told me; "I had my wife call me in sick so I could attend my meeting."<br><br>The same kind of lying is done by our own students who refrain from registering their automobiles as required by our university regulations and then gain access to the campus, even with preferred parking, by approaching one of our traffic control booths, denying their status as students, and representing themselves as visitors to the campus.<br><br>To cite another example, I have recently received a disturbing report about the conduct of a few of our students receiving veterans' benefits. The full monthly payment is dependent upon the student's maintaining a full load in school. Occasionally a student registers for a full load and then drops a class. When this happens, the University is required to report the reduction in load to the Veterans Administration so it can reduce the monthly payment to the veteran. We have had instances where students have become furious at University officials who reported this change in registered hours. Some students have urged our staff to falsify the record so they will not receive a reduction in their monthly payment. I hasten to add that this reprehensible conduct is limited to a tiny minority of the eligible persons. The overwhelming majority of our veterans on campus, just like our student body at large, are honest and would not stoop to this kind of fraud and deceit.<br><br>Our Code of Honor includes three examples of our standard of "honesty in all behavior." I have already given illustrations of what we condemn as knowingly giving false information. The second example is plagiarism, which is a variety of lying consisting of representing the work of another person as one's own thoughts or writings.<br><h2><b>Cheating</b></h2><br>The third example of dishonest behavior treated specifically in our Code of Honor is cheating. It should be obvious to everyone that the person who cheats on an examination lies to his or her teacher and commits a dishonest act of serious dimension. Misrepresentations of fact within trusted relationships--such as husband and wife, parent and child, or teacher and pupil--are particularly vicious since they cause serious deterioration in these crucial relationships.<br><br>The aftereffects of cheating are vividly described in a letter I received last week from a former BYU student who wrote to apologize for cheating on several examinations at BYU ten years ago. I quote from her letter:<br><br><i>How paltry the false reward of a slightly higher grade compared to the pangs of conscience I have felt as a result of my dishonesty. Let no one scoff at "a little" cheating as being a minor offense of no account, for the conscience of anyone who knows the commandments of God and the truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ will prove him gravely mistaken, as I have learned most painfully.</i><br><br>The writer of this letter was seeking to confess her wrong and complete the repentance she needs to clear her mind of this matter. As I read her letter, I thought of the teaching in the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins--behold he will confess them and forsake them.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:43]<br><br>I also thought of the cleansing miracle of forgiveness, which promises that when we have truly repented of our sins we will be forgiven and the Lord will "remember them no more" (D&amp;amp;C 58:42). In contrast, if we are unrepentant and rebellious, the Lord has decreed that in time to come our "iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and [our] secret acts shall be revealed" (D&amp;amp;C 1:3).<br><h2><b>Standards of Dress and Grooming</b></h2><br>Another aspect of honesty and truthfulness for students and employees of Brigham Young University is the matter of adherence to our Dress and Grooming Standards. This becomes a matter of honesty and truthfulness because each student admitted to Brigham Young University promises in his or her admissions application to abide by the principles of the Code of Honor and the Dress and Grooming Standards, and that commitment is renewed each registration. Students who are in deliberate violation of the Dress and Grooming Standards are therefore promise breakers, and when that violation is continued through the promises of another registration period, the violators are<i>liars</i>in addition. If that word seems harsh to you, how would you fairly characterize such behavior?<br><br>The importance of our standards of dress and grooming and other principles of our Code of Honor was recently reemphasized by the First Presidency. In a letter of January 2, 1973, to all stake and mission presidents, bishops, and branch presidents of the Church the First Presidency directed that the interview of prospective students for BYU and other parts of the Church Educational System "should be conducted very carefully and should make specific reference to the Code of Honor and to the Dress and Grooming Standards that are a part of the specific requirements to which bishops must refer in attesting that a prospective student is worthy and will abide by these special standards."<br><br>The First Presidency further instructed that "in view of the special expectations we have concerning students in the Church Educational System, it is a serious mistake to recommend an individual for admission--even for rehabilitative reasons--who would detract from, rather than support, the special environment that thousands of others create and rely upon." The Presidency's letter concluded with this unambiguous declaration: "Bishops and prospective students should know that the Code of Honor and the Dress and Grooming Standards have the full support and approval of the First Presidency and the Twelve."<br><br>This is not the time to speak at length on the reasons underlying our Code of Honor and our Dress and Grooming Standards. The reason for the principles of the Code of Honor, such as the requirements to respect personal rights and property rights, to obey the law, to avoid drug abuse, to live the law of chastity, and to observe the Word of Wisdom, should be self-evident. These are all principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Our standards of dress and grooming have several purposes. Our requirement that women's skirts must be of "modest length" embodies an eternal principle--the modesty our leaders have always asked us to cultivate as a principle of decency and propriety, as a principle of "respect for one's self, one's fellowmen, and the Creator of us all" (<i>Priesthood Bulletin</i>[September 1970], p. 1).<br><br>Our rules against bare feet in the public campus areas and against shorts and cut-offs and grubby attire of all types, including the wearing of Levi's or blue jeans by young women, are responsive to our desire to promote the beauty and harmony of the campus. They are also responsive to our conviction that people's attitudes and thoughts and behavior are related to the way they present themselves to those around them. This concern with grubby apparel applies to men and women alike. In a letter to "Dear Abby" a young woman recently complained about high school dress and grooming standards quite similar to those at BYU. "Do you honestly believe that a person's dress affects his behavior?" the writer asked. Abby's response asserted that studies had shown that people's dress did affect their behavior. She concluded with this thought: "Kids who dress like they're going to a hayride are more inclined to horse around" (<i>Deseret News,</i>23 January 1973, p. 14-A).<br><br>Our rules against beards and long hair have the same purpose as the requirements our Church makes of its missionaries. In this university, which is largely supported by the tithes of faithful members and which stands as a beacon of Latter-day Saint values, we wish to avoid an appearance that has become associated with rebellion and rejection of values we hold dear. A recent book by Jerry Rubin, the clown prince of the hippy movement, gives this vivid characterization of the meaning of long hair:<br><br><i>Long hair is communication. Young kids identify short hair with authority, discipline , , ,--and long hair with letting go, letting your hair down, being free, being open. Wherever we go, our hair tells people where we stand on Vietnam, Wallace, campus disruption, dope. We're living TV commercials for the revolution.</i><br><br><i>Long hair is the beginning of our liberation from the sexual oppression that underlies this whole military society.</i>[Jerry Rubin,<i>Do It,</i>pp. 93, 95–96]<br><br>While I am on the subject of dress and grooming, I will add a word about the rules we apply. I still receive quite a number of communications from students and faculty asking for clarifications of the standards. Currently most questions relate to the length of men's hair and sideburns. This matter of definition is in the hands of the Campus Life Committee. I invite those who have questions on this subject to visit their office in Room 329 of the Wilkinson Center and obtain a copy of the guidelines. These guidelines consist of the dress and grooming standards and a few administrative clarifications. For instance, the dress and grooming standard that hair "must be styled so that it does not cover the ears and must be above the collar in the back," has been interpreted to mean "it must be cut above the ears so that it cannot cover<i>any part of the ear.</i>Long hair in front swept back over the ears is not appropriate. The cut line in back must be above a regular dress shirt collar."<br><br>In this connection I repeat my urging that individuals not skate on the thin ice at the edge of the standards, but place themselves clearly within the limits defined by these important standards. During the last registration almost one hundred faculty members assisted the Campus Life Committee in checking the dress and grooming of students who were registering. Now we should have a thousand faculty doing the same thing as they meet their classes and counsel with their students. I have heard a good many complaints about a lack of consistency. I think we must concede that when a standard is being applied by so many individuals it is inevitable that there will be some lack of consistency. But it is also true that this lack of consistency will work to the detriment of those only who persist in being close to the line, whether it is in the matter of sideburns, hair length, or grubby apparel. I urge that those students who would avoid the unfavorable consequences attaching to the inevitable lack of consistency should not persist in skating along the thin ice at the edge of the standard. Stay well within the limits, and live at peace with yourself and the standards.<br><h2><b>Absolute Honesty: the Easiest Way</b></h2><br>Every person in a position of responsibility, including teachers, employers, church leaders, and others, is asked to write evaluations and recommendations for students or fellow-workers. Prospective employers and educational institutions invariably request these recommendations because they need something more than the objective measures of a person's competence, such as grades. They need evaluations of such intangibles as dependability, honesty, and truthfulness. How satisfying it is when a teacher or employer can record that an individual has those hallmarks of character. How distressing it is when one must refrain, however tactfully, from an unqualified recommendation of character. How doubly tragic it is when the individual who is being evaluated has been false to a trust, a purveyor of deceit, or an unreliable steward, and that fact must be reported to those who are responsible for his future opportunities. A person who possesses all of the attributes for success, including talent, brilliance, and skills, cannot attain the heights of his potential without the quality of absolute honesty.<br><br>The qualities of honesty and truthfulness are the foundation of all organizations and all personal relationships. If a husband or an employee or a student or a teacher cannot be relied upon to tell the truth--not just usually but invariably--a relationship with that individual can never be a satisfactory one. Like their companion virtue of loyalty, honesty and truthfulness are not valuable unless they are absolute. How much trust would you place in a person who told you the truth ninety-five percent of the time? How much value is an employee who does not steal from his employer--ninety-five percent of the time? The ninety-five-percenter is like a leaky bucket: the hole may be small, but it renders the entire vessel unworthy of its purpose. Unless the hole can be mended, the bucket is bound for the trash heap.<br><br>In the long run, the course of absolute honesty and total truthfulness is not only the<i>best</i>course but also the<i>easiest.</i>The person who lies and then must tell another lie to cover the first, and then another and another until he has built a whole overlapping shingled roof of lies is a person to be pitied. At some point one of those covering lies will be exposed, and the whole overlapping structure will come down with a clap of thunder like the doomsday bell. The liar's iniquity will truly be "spoken upon the housetop."<br><br>A person who is only partially honest and only partially truthful is always having to make hard decisions about whether each new circumstance of life calls for honesty or deceit. How much better to commit oneself to the way of absolute honesty and truthfulness. A person with that commitment will waste no time or energy on deciding whether or when or the extent to which he will compromise with principle.<br><br>Happy is the individual whose personal code of honor dictates behavior consistent with the eternal principles of growth. Free from internal conflict and external deception, that individual can enjoy the blessings of peace in the present and growth in the eternities to come. That person will know the meaning of our Savior's declaration that "my yoke is easy and my burden is light" (Matt. 11:30).<br><br><i><i>Dallin H.

<h1> Is a Great Power - Marvin J. Ashton - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, President Oaks, for the gracious introduction. I'm sure you won't take exception if I tell you I appreciate your introduction almost as much as one I had a few weeks ago when visiting a Junior Sunday School in connection with a stake quarterly conference. When called upon to say a few words to these young students, I said to them, "Who can tell me who Harold B. Lee is?"<br><br>Hands went up rapidly. One six-year-old boy said, "He is our prophet."<br><br>Another young girl left her hand up. I asked her, "Do you have something else you would like to say?"<br><br>She responded with, "And I know who you are too."<br><br>"Who am I?"<br><br>"You're the prophet's helper."<br><br>This is one of my very favorite introductions. I hope I may always be.<br><br>I bear witness to you this morning I too know who President Harold B. Lee is. He is a prophet of God. I wish I knew all things as well.<br><br>My Brigham Young University friends, I want to share with you today some thoughts on the subject and principle of patience. Incidentally, while I am speaking today, you may all practice patience. I'd like Coach Potter, the basketball team, and the student body to know Sister Ashton and I are coming down Thursday evening to watch the game with UTEP, and we're not coming down to learn patience--we're coming down to see an appropriate victory.<br><br>Referring back to the six-year-old girl's introduction, may I remind you we can learn much from young people, particularly children, if we will have the patience to listen and observe. One other experience I hope will emphasize this. I was speaking to another Junior Sunday School group en route to a general session of quarterly conference. After a few thoughts I was making my way down the aisle to join their parents in the general assembly. In the process of leaving I tapped a couple of young boys on the top of their heads and said, "Good-bye, boys," and made my way out of the room. As I left the room the door was opened in back of me. I turned and saw another six-year-old running after me. I stopped, bent down, and listened while he said, "Brother Ashton, you didn't touch me on my head." I tapped him on both shoulders and we both went away feeling happier. I hope when he went back to his Junior Sunday School class there was a teacher with enough patience to not say, "Son, you can't do that."<br><br>Let me share with you one more child story and then I'll be back to my outlined patience theme. This story has to do with patience, I believe, and whether it does or not in your minds, I like it and hope you'll enjoy it. A city family recently moved to the country. Shortly after arrival and settling down, the father borrowed a horse from one of the new neighbors and placed himself upon the horse with his young nine-year-old securely in back of him. After they were mounted upon the horse, a big truck came by and caused a loud noise. The horse shied and off went the father and the son. This father showed great patience in making a comment to his son. Incidentally, I've been around horses enough to know that when they misbehave people don't talk to their sons; they talk to the horses. But he had the patience to turn to his son and say, "If that horse were mine, I'd teach him a thing or two." The next night at dinner time, when it was quiet, young Billy had his moment and said, "Dad, I talked to Brother Brown and he told me for $125 you can have the horse and teach him anything you want."<br><br>In the Doctrine and Covenants, section 6, verses 18 and 19, important instructions were given to Oliver Cowdery:<br><br><i>Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word's sake.</i><br><br><i>Admonish him in his faults, and also receive admonition of him. Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity.</i><br><br>Please note the double emphasis on patience. Oliver, as we, needed double reminding. Oliver Cowdery later fell because he lacked patience. He failed in the test of patience. He handled the sacred plates. He saw John the Baptist. He received the higher priesthood from Peter, James, and John. He participated in many unusual blessings, but he knew not patience.<br><br>Someone has said, "Patience is the support of weakness; impatience is the ruin of strength."<br><br>Now let me share with you some thoughts about patience in four different areas.<br><h2><b>Patience with God</b></h2><br>First, patience with God. How often have we heard people say, "I cannot believe or put my trust in an unknown being who permits my mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my child to die or suffer when I know I am entitled to have my prayers answered, as are they. If there is a God, he surely would have answered my prayers and heard my pleas." Aren't we lacking in patience, to say the least, when we are inclined to tell God how to answer our prayers and desires? Our relationship to God will improve as we learn to ask rather than to tell. Surely it is wisdom that we seek not to counsel the Lord. Aren't we out of our realm when we judge or are inclined to second-guess God in our human frailties?<br><br>Doctrine and Covenants, section 54, verse 10: "And again, be patient in tribulation." Proper prayer teaches us patience. I declare to you, my friends, this morning, very often our prayers are best answered in silence. Sometimes the answers to our prayers are delayed so we may learn patience. I bear witness to you today our Heavenly Father is an almighty God because he has eternal patience with us. God lives; he loves us; he hears our prayers; he answers our prayers; he answers the prayers of the faithful; he hears the prayers of the repentant. God can be found if we have the patience to seek, knock, ask, and listen.<br><h2><b>Patience with Family</b></h2><br>Second, a thought or two about patience with parents and family members. "Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath" (James 1:19). Oh, to God that we had the patience to withstand such family statements as these:<br><br>"I am ashamed of you."<br><br>"I never want to see you again."<br><br>"You're a disgrace to the family."<br><br>Yes, even "Get out and never come back."<br><br>"You've ruined our lives."<br><br>"What have we done to deserve such a son, or such a daughter?"<br><br>"This is a fine way to treat us after all we have done for you."<br><br>And "You watch. You'll never amount to anything."<br><br>May I pause long enough to say I, along with you, wish that such statements were never made. But if they are, students, do you have the patience to withstand, forgive, and bear without malice?<br><br>I'm thinking of a young lady who had decided upon marriage. When she consulted her father, he said, "Marriage will be a tremendous adjustment. Don't have any children until you have become adjusted to each other and know each other well." Her marriage was in difficulty after six months. As we visited with her, I thought to myself, speaking of patience with parents, maybe it would have been well for her at the time to have said to her father, who undoubtedly in all sincerity had given this advice, "Father, if you don't mind, these are things my husband and I will work out, decide, and plan." Patience with family members is most important.<br><br>I'm thinking of a young man I met over at the Utah State Prison. Let me just tell you some circumstances, with the thought in mind of patience on the part of this young man. We went there for a religious service. Members of the gathering were inmates of the prison along with friends and family members. The inmates sat on one side of the hall and their relatives, families, and friends sat on the other side of the small chapel. As we came into this setting through the rear door each individual was in place ready for the service. I noticed a young man near the front nudge his buddy. As they looked back at us, he said to his buddy, "Which one of those guys is Ashton?" I took a look at the size of the fellow who had asked the question and hoped his buddy didn't know which one I was.<br><br>"Ashton's the one in the middle," his buddy said.<br><br>We walked up toward the front. As we reached the place where these young men were seated, this young questioning prisoner came over to me and said, "Could I talk to you for a moment?"<br><br>As he made that advance, one of the deputy wardens walked over and said, "Sit down." (He said that to the prisoner, not to me. I'd have been happy if he had said it to me at that moment.)<br><br>"I want to talk to Ashton."<br><br>I saw he was determined. The deputy said to me, "Do you want to speak to him?"<br><br>I replied, "Yes, I do." (I may be a coward, but I'm not stupid.) I'll never forget what this prisoner told me privately just before the service started. He took hold of my arm as we stood alone and pointed over to the other side of the room.<br><br>"Do you see the guy on the end of the third row?" I looked over. He said, as I recognized the spot, "He's my dad. You know what?"<br><br>I asked, "What?"<br><br>He then continued, "Next week my dad's going to be ordained an elder, and I'm the guy what's done it. Ever since I've been in this prison, my dad's been coming down once a week to see me. I've been teaching him out of the Book of Mormon and the Bible. Now he's shaped up and is ready to be ordained an elder." If you English teachers will plug your ears again, I'll repeat what he said: "And I am the guy what's done it."<br><br>I found out later that that young man had every right to say, "You see that man over on the end of the third row? He's my dad. I'd like to break his back. He's no good. He's the reason I am here. The only time he ever spent any time with me in my life was after I came here." But he didn't say those things. In the true spirit of patience, he accepted his father when he visited him. Now his father was qualified to be ordained an elder because this son had patiently worked with him.<br><br>After the meeting I asked him, "What are you going to do now that you have your father ordained an elder?"<br><br>With genuine seriousness in his eyes, he answered, "Now I'm going to start on my mom."<br><br>I was interviewing a missionary not long ago in the privacy of a small church room. He asked me, "Brother Ashton, do you think I can make it as a missionary? I've been out fourteen months. My father is an alcoholic. My mother's been divorced twice. Can I make it as a missionary?"<br><br>I asked him, "How do you feel about your dad? How do you feel about your mother?"<br><br>His chin quivered as he replied, "I love them."<br><br>I felt impressed to say, "You'll make it. With patience and love like that you can't fail."<br><h2><b>Patience with Friends, Associates, and Neighbors</b></h2><br>Third, patience with friends, associates, and neighbors is the next classification I'd like to speak about. Have the patience not to resist reminders. Be patient in counsel. Be patient in the repentance processes of your friends. Be patient in living within policy. I bear witness to you, if you'll be patient you'll know the policies and procedures on this campus are for your benefit, your development, and your joy. May I share this quotation from John 21:14–17. Though it is very seldom used in the framework of patience, will you look upon it this way as I quote it.<br><br><i>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</i><br><br><i>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</i><br><br><i>He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest though me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</i><br><br><i>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?</i><br><br>And the scriptures say that Peter was<i>grieved,</i>but I would like to say for this occasion Peter was<i>impatient.</i><br><br><i>. . . because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</i><br><br>Oh that we could take counsel and direction repeatedly without resentment and without impatience.<br><br>Let us forgo giving people last chances: "Either . . . or else you've had it. I've put up with this as long as I can." Let's forgo giving last chances to family members or friends. This is not the spirit of Christ.<br><h2><b>Patience with Self</b></h2><br>Fourth, may I ask you to think with me for a few moments about patience with self. Have more patience with yourself--more self-understanding. I would plead that we understand it is not our role to be self-condemning. I like to think when we are taught "Judge not, that ye be not judged," that it has direct reference to us and our relationship with ourselves. We should not judge ourselves. We should teach ourselves patience--patience to believe in ourselves, patience to motivate ourselves, patience to believe that God and I can do it. When necessary, lean on the truth "I am a child of God." God and I, with patience on my part, can do it. I remind you we do not have to worry about the patience of God, because he is the personification of patience, no matter where we have been, what we have done, or what we, to this moment, have allowed ourselves to think of ourselves. Two of Satan's greatest tools today are spreading impatience and discouragement. Drugs, moral misconduct, violent protest are merely evidences of internal impatience on our part.<br><br><i>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</i><br><br><i>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</i><br><br><i>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</i>[James 1:12–14]<br><br>I share with you this morning, my young friends, this fact. When you have hours and days of a feeling of inadequacy, when you are inclined to say, "I don't have much going for me; no one cares about me," I bear witness to you that an eternal truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the value of the individual. God will not forsake you.<br><h2><b>Be Patient in all Things</b></h2><br>Patience is personal. Patience is a great teacher. Patience is a great achievement. Patience is a great power. I hope and pray our Heavenly Father will help us to be patient with God, to be patient with our families, to be patient with our friends and neighbors, and most of all, today, to be patient with ourselves. You are someone special. Our Heavenly Father is aware of you. All he asks in return is for you to be patient with him. I bear witness he knows the beginning. He knows the end. He knows you. Joseph Smith, in contrast to what I said in the beginning about Oliver Cowdery, remained true and faithful and was a vital instrument in the hands of the Lord because his patience was unceasing and undying. Some of you may wonder, "What can I do to make my testimony stronger?" One of the greatest ingredients for a strong, enduring, vigorous testimony is patience.<br><br>I humbly pray we will realize the great opportunity we have to practice patience with God, with neighbors, with family, and with friends, and with self. Never forget, man is that he might have joy. I bear witness to you, we can have joy only as we practice patience. One of the primary reasons we have been placed here upon the earth is to know God through diligence and patience.<br><br>I thought to myself last night as I watched television and saw our first prisoners of war making initial contact with their families, "How great, how wonderful, are the fruits of patience."<br><br>I humbly leave you my testimony to the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thank you for this opportunity of being with you and briefly turning your thoughts, in this day when it is so important, to patience. May God help us to be patient in all things, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marvin J.

<h1>r Inspiration—Which? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I've been many places with my wife when, as we have met members of the Church, stake presidencies, high councils, and the like, they've said to me: "We're surely glad to meet you, Brother McConkie, and we're most pleased to have Sister Smith with us." I've assured her that that was all right with me, as long as they didn't call me Brother Smith. And now that's happened.*<br><br>I've sought the Lord diligently, as is my custom, to be guided and directed this morning in what ought to be said--sought him both for myself and for you, so that I might speak and you might hear by the power of the Holy Spirit. Two subjects have occurred to me. I thought that on the one hand I might talk about "Agency or Inspiration--Which?" Or, on the other hand, I might talk about how to choose a wife. It occurred to me I might consult the student body, but then I said to myself, "No, it doesn't make a particle of difference which subject it is; I'm going to say exactly the same things anyway."<br><br>My wife and I were having a serious discussion recently, in which we were counting our many blessings. We named a host of things that have come to us, because of the Church, because of our family, because of the glorious restoration of eternal truth that has taken place in this day; and then she climaxed the discussion by asking this question: "What's the greatest blessing that has ever come into your life?"<br><br>Without a moment's hesitation I said, "The greatest blessing that has ever come to me was on the thirteenth day of October in 1937, at 11:20 a.m., when I was privileged to kneel in the Salt Lake Temple at the Lord's altar and receive you as an eternal companion."<br><br>She said, "Well, you passed that test."<br><br>I believe that the most important single thing that any Latter-day Saint ever does in this world is to marry the right person, in the right place, by the right authority; and that then--when they have been so sealed by the power and authority which Elijah the prophet restored--the most important remaining thing that any Latter-day Saint can ever do is so to live that the terms and conditions of the covenant thus made will be binding and efficacious now and forever. And so I'd like, if properly guided, to make some suggestions that apply in all fields of choice--in all fields, at least all major fields, of activity--but which apply particularly to the matter of eternal marriage, singling that out as the one thing paramount above all other.<br><br>When we dwelt in the presence of God our Heavenly Father, we were endowed with agency. This gave us the opportunity, the privilege, to choose what we would do--to make a free, untrammeled choice. When Father Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, he was given this same power, and we now possess it. We're expected to use the gifts and talents and abilities, the sense and judgment and agency with which we are endowed.<br><br>But on the other hand, we're commanded to seek the Lord, to desire his Spirit, to get the spirit of revelation and inspiration in our lives. We come unto the Church and a legal administrator places his hands upon our head and says, "Receive the Holy Ghost." This gives us the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is the right to the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead, based on faithfulness.<br><br>And so we're faced with two propositions. One is that we ought to be guided by the spirit of inspiration, the spirit of revelation. The other is that we're here under a direction to use our agency, to determine what we ought to do on our own; and we need to strike a fine balance between these two, if we're going to pursue a course that will give us joy and satisfaction and peace in this life and lead to eternal reward in our Father's kingdom.<br><br>When we were with our Father in the preexistent sphere, he observed and studied us; he knew how we would respond to his laws when we were in his presence, when we had the knowledge that he was our Father and that the teachings presented to us came from him. We walked by sight. Now he's finding out how we'll respond when we walk by faith, when we're outside his presence and we have to rely on other things than the personal counsel that we once received from him.<br><br>Well, I'd like, if I may, to present three case studies, out of which, perhaps, we can draw some very realistic and sound conclusions as to what ought to be in our lives. I'll take these illustrations out of the revelations that the Lord has given us.<br><h2><b>"You Have Not Understood"</b></h2><br>Case study number one: There was a man named Oliver Cowdery. In the early days, he operated as an amanuensis to the Prophet. He was the scribe. He wrote down the words that the Prophet dictated while the Spirit rested upon him in the translation processes (the Book of Mormon was then being translated). Brother Cowdery was relatively spiritually immature at that time, and he sought and desired to do something beyond his then present spiritual capacity. He himself wanted to translate. And so he importuned the Prophet, the Prophet took the matter up with the Lord, and they got a revelation. The Lord said, "Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you shall receive." And then one thing he might receive is defined as "a knowledge concerning the engravings of old records, which are ancient, which contain those parts of my scripture of which as been spoken by the manifestation of my Spirit."<br><br>Having thus dealt with the specific problem, then the Lord revealed a principle that applies to it and all other like situations: "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation" (D&amp;amp;C 8:1–3).<br><br>Well now, Oliver did what a good many of us would have done. He had the instructions I have read, and he assumed that they meant what they seemed on the surface to say, which was that if in faith he asked God he'd have power to translate. But in his condition of relative spiritual immaturity, he hadn't yet learned what was involved in asking of God, or how to generate the kind of faith or do the specific thing that has to be done in order to get an answer to a prayer. And so he asked. And as you know, he failed; he was totally unable to translate. This caused some concern, I suppose, to him and the Prophet. The matter was referred back to the Lord, whose promise they had been attempting to conform to; and the answer came, the reason came, why he couldn't translate: "You have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7).<br><br>Now, seemingly, that's all he'd been instructed to do, to ask in faith; but implicit in asking in faith is the precedent requirement that we do everything in our power to accomplish the goal that we seek. We use the agency with which we have been endowed. We use every faculty and capacity and ability that we possess to bring about the eventuality that may be involved. Now this is translating the Book of Mormon, it's choosing a wife, it's choosing employment, it's doing any one of ten thousand important things that arise in our lives.<br><br>The Lord continued:<br><br><i>I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</i><br><br><i>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 9:8–9]<br><br>How do you choose a wife? I've heard a lot of young people from Brigham Young University and elsewhere say, "I've got to get a feeling of inspiration. I've got to get some revelation. I've got to fast and pray and get the Lord to manifest to me whom I should marry." Well, maybe it will be a little shock to you, but never in my life did I ever ask the Lord whom I ought to marry. It never occurred to me to ask him. I went out and found the girl I wanted; she suited me; I evaluated and weighed the proposition, and it just seemed a hundred percent to me as though this ought to be. Now, if I'd done things perfectly, I'd have done some counseling with the Lord, which I didn't do; but all I did was pray to the Lord and ask for some guidance and direction in connection with the decision that I'd reached. A more perfect thing to have done would have been to counsel with him relative to the decision and get a spiritual confirmation that the conclusion, which I by my agency and faculties had arrived at, was the right one.<br><h2><b>"Why Are You Asking Me?"</b></h2><br>Now, case study number two: There was a man whose name is not so much as preserved to us in the ancient record. He's known as the brother of Jared. From other sources we know his name was Moriancumer. He was the spiritual leader, initially, of the Jaredite people. As they started their progress from the Tower of Babel to their American promised land, he was the one that got in communion with the Lord to get the direction, the spiritual guidance, that they, as a people, needed.<br><br>And some very interesting things occurred. They got to the waters that they were going to cross, and the Lord said to him, "Build some barges." But interestingly, the Lord didn't tell him how to build the barges. He'd done it on a previous occasion; he didn't need instruction; there wasn't any revelation that was necessary to guide him. So he built the barges.<br><br>But this time they were going to be used under some peculiar and difficult circumstances, and he needed something more than was now present in them: he needed some air. And this was a problem that was beyond him. So he took that matter up with the Lord, and because it was totally beyond his capacity to solve, the Lord solved it for him and said, "Do thus and so and you'll have air."<br><br>But then the brother of Jared--having confidence because he was talking to the Lord, because he was communing and getting answers--asked another question: he asked for a solution to a problem that he should have figured out by himself and not taken up with the Lord. He said, "What will we do for light in the vessels?"<br><br>And the Lord talked to him about it a little and then he said this: "What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?" (Eth. 2:23). In effect, "What are you asking me for? This is something you should have solved." And he talked a little more, and he repeated in essence the question: "What will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?" (Eth. 2:25). In other words, "Moriancumer, this is your problem. Why are you troubling me? I've given you your agency; you are endowed with capacity and ability. Get out and solve the problem."<br><br>Well, the brother of Jared got the message. He went up into a mount called Shelem, and the record says he "did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass" (Eth. 3:1).<br><br>I hold here a little piece of amorphous quartz that's clear as transparent glass. I picked this up in a wilderness area outside of a little community called Crystalina, in a nation called Brazil, in South America. The Brethren thought I was off touring missions, but actually I was doing a little rock hunting. And in that connection, I hope you got the message that the brother of Jared was a rock hound also.<br><br>Well, the brother of Jared took sixteen little crystals of some sort (he could hold all of them in his hands); he took them up on the mount. The record says, "He did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount" (Eth. 3:1), and then he said in effect to the Lord, "Now this is what I hope you will do." You really don't tell the Lord what to do, but you get some inspiration and you use your judgment, and then you talk the matter over with him. And so Moriancumer said to the Lord: "Touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea" (Eth. 3:4).<br><br>And the Lord did what the brother of Jared asked, and this is the occasion when he then saw the finger of the Lord; and, while he was in tune, he received revelation that exceeded anything that any prophet had ever gained up to that moment. The Lord revealed more to him about his nature and personality than ever theretofore had come forth, and it all came about because he'd done everything that he could do and because he counseled with the Lord.<br><br>There's a fine balance between agency and inspiration. We're expected to do everything in our power that we can, and then to seek an answer from the Lord, a confirming seal that we've reached the right conclusion; and sometimes, happily, in addition, we get added truths and knowledge that we hadn't even supposed.<br><h2><b>"They Shall Counsel Between Themselves and Me"</b></h2><br>Now case study number 3: In the early history of the Church, the Lord commanded the Saints to assemble in a certain place in Missouri. The decree went forth: "Assemble." Specifically, the decree went forth, "Let the Presiding Bishop come here and do such and such." Now notice what happened. The Lord is talking:<br><br><i>As I spake concerning my servant Edward Partridge, this land is the land of his residence, and those whom he has appointed for his counselors; and also the land of the residence of him whom I have appointed to keep my storehouse;</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, let them bring their families to this land,</i>[and here's the point]<i>as they shall counsel between themselves and me.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:24–25]<br><br>You see, the Lord said "assemble" to Zion. The details and the arrangements, however, the<i>how</i>and the<i>when</i>and the<i>circumstances</i>are to be determined by the agency of those who are called to assemble, but they are to counsel with the Lord. Now, when you counsel with the Lord, you talk something over. I bring my children in and we counsel on a problem. I don't tell them what ought to be; I say, "What do you think? What's your evaluation? What do you want to do in this situation? What's the best thing to do?" And they tell me what they think, and if I happen to have any wisdom or judgment on the matter, I express my views. Well now, the Lord has all wisdom, all knowledge, and all power; he knows how to govern and control and direct us in a perfect manner. He lets us determine what we should do, but he expects us to counsel with him.<br><br>Now, after the Lord had said this to the Presiding Bishopric of the Church, he gave the principle that governed in that situation, and it governs in all situations. And this is one of our glorious revealed truths. He said:<br><br><i>For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward.</i><br><br><i>Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness;</i><br><br><i>For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward.</i><br><br><i>But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:26–29]<br><br>You know, they said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, "How do you govern so great and diverse a people as the Latter-day Saints?"<br><br>He said, "I teach them correct principles and they govern themselves."<br><br>Now, that's the order of heaven. That's how the Almighty operates. That's how the Church is supposed to operate. We're supposed to learn correct principles and then govern ourselves. We make our own choices, and then we present the matter to the Lord and get his approving, ratifying seal.<br><h2><b>"Counsel with the Lord in All Thy Doings"</b></h2><br>Now, those are the three case studies; let us come to the revealed conclusion. There was a man named Alma, a mighty and a great prophet. He had a son named Helaman, who was a holy and righteous man, following the pattern that his father had set. And to Helaman, Alma said this: "O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God. Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support" (Al. 37:35–36). Do you think that if you're counseled to pray to the Lord for support, both temporal and spiritual, that that's all you have to do? The Lord's prayer says, "Give us this day our daily bread." Do you go out and sit down in the desert or on the mountain and pray with all the fervor you can possess, "Give us this day our daily bread," or do you go out and plant crops and raise herds and do everything that you can in your situation to accomplish the end result?<br><br>Well, continuing: "Yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever" (Al. 37:36). Now note: "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good" (Al. 37:37).<br><br>What was Oliver Cowdery's problem? "You took no thought save it was to ask. . . .You must study it out in your mind" (D&amp;amp;C 9:7–8).<br><br>Well, do you want a wife? Do you want anything that's right and proper? You go to work and you use the agency and power and ability that God has given you. You use every faculty, you get all the judgment that you can centered on the problem, you make up your own mind, and then, to be sure that you don't err, you counsel with the Lord. You talk it over. You say, "This is what I think; what do you think?" And if you get the calm, sweet surety that comes only from the Holy Spirit, you know you've reached the right conclusion; but if there's anxiety and uncertainty in your heart, then you'd better start over, because the Lord's hand is not in it, and you're not getting the ratifying seal that, as a member of the Church who has the gift of the Holy Ghost, you are entitled to receive.<br><br>"Yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day" (Al. 37:37). If you learn how to use the agency that God has given you, and if you try to make your own decisions, and if you reach conclusions that are sound and right, and you counsel with the Lord and get his ratifying seal of approval upon the conclusions you've reached, then you've received revelation, for one thing; and for another thing, you're going to have the great reward of eternal life, be lifted up at the last day. Now, we're not all equal by any means; some have one talent and capacity and some another. But if we use the talents we have, somehow we'll come out all right.<br><br>On the recent Monday when we were celebrating Washington's birthday, I was down at my mother's sawing a log in the backyard. She came out to give me some direction and see how I was doing it, and she wasn't very pleased. She thought I ought to do it differently. She went back into the house and in a few minutes my younger brother arrived. She said to him, "I think you'd better go out in the backyard and give Bruce some help and see that he does this thing right." And then she said to him, "Bruce isn't very bright." Well, so I'm not. So I start where I am, and I go forward from there. I start using such talent as I have, and I begin to apply principles of eternal truth to my life. And I consult and counsel with the Lord in the process. And no matter where I am, the gospel takes me forward and onward and upward, and blessings flow to me that will ennoble and sanctify and improve me in this life and eventually give me glory and honor and dignity in the life to come.<br><h2><b>We Have the Spirit of Revelation</b></h2><br>Now, I think we've said enough; the principles are before us. Let me just do one thing more. Let me do, in effect, what my friend Alma would do. After he'd preached a sermon, he said, "And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these things myself?" (Al. 5:45). That is, he'd given them the case studies, he'd quoted the revelations, he'd told them what was involved, and then he bore personal testimony. This is what we ought to do in the Church. We ought to learn how to teach by the power of the Spirit, so that when we get through talking about the gospel subjects we'll know whether what we've said is right, and we'll be in a position to bear testimony, not alone of the truth and the divinity of the work, but also that the doctrine we proclaim and the everlasting truths which we expound are right, that they are the mind and voice and will of the Lord. Now, the glorious, wondrous thing about this work and about these doctrines is that they are true. There isn't anything in this world, no truth that we can conceive of, to compare with the truth that the work we're engaged in is true, that the Lord's hand is here. It's a literal fact that we have the gift and power of the Holy Ghost. We have the spirit of revelation, the spirit of testimony, the spirit of prophecy. These things must be, or else we're not the church and kingdom of God; we're not the Lord's people.<br><br>Now, the fact is that we do have them; revelation works. Don't shy away from getting revelation. Joseph Smith said, "God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 149). We're entitled to the spirit of revelation. But what I'm attempting to teach this morning is that there's a how and a procedure, and there are conditions precedent, and it is our obligation to go to work on our problems and then counsel with the Lord and get the ratifying seal of the Holy Spirit on the conclusions that we've reached; and that ratifying seal is the spirit of revelation.<br><br>God grant us wisdom in these things. God grant us the courage and the ability to stand on our own feet and use our agency and the abilities and capacities we possess; then let's be sufficiently humble and amenable to the Spirit to bow our will to his will, to get his ratifying, confirming seal of approval, to get in our lives, in that way, the spirit of revelation. And if we so do, there's no question about the result: it's peace in this life; it's glory and honor and dignity in the life to come. Which may God grant for all of us. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br>*In the introduction, Elder McConkie was inadvertently referred to as "Elder Smith."<br><br><i><i>Bruce R.

<h1>sm Is of God - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I am grateful to be here tonight, brothers and sisters. There is always a great deal of anticipation when someone calls and says, "Will you come down and speak to the students here on the campus?" Someone has said that anticipation is greater than realization. But I must confess tonight that realization of where I am and who I am with is far greater than any anticipation I have had. I need help tonight: I have this modern convenience to help amplify my voice, and I've called on the Lord to help me to amplify my thoughts that this evening might not be wasted, that thoughts of this great country and thoughts of this great Church that was reestablished in this country may penetrate our hearts.<br><h2><b>Importance of Individuals in the Nation and the Church</b></h2><br>Preservation of this country takes people, and there are no greater people than are here tonight--the cream of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I know sometimes we feel modest about what we think we can do. And I know that the modest person likes to think that he, as an individual, amounts to little, that the world cares not what he does, nor pays any attention. We call this attitude modesty, but it fails to measure up to the true situation. The truth is that every individual counts for something. And some part of the world notes what he does and does care. What I am trying to say is that everyone of us has the power to influence other people. We influence people every day, every hour of the day, either directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously. For this reason we must be careful of the influence we exert.<br><br>I came from an immigrant family. My parents had the courage to listen to the truth of the gospel in the little country of the Netherlands. Since I was reared in this kind of family, my mother sometimes had difficulty expressing what she wanted to in English, so she reverted to Dutch. Because I understood a little Dutch at that time, since we spoke some of it in the home, she taught me this little maxim. I'll say it in Dutch and then give you the meaning in English: "Waar U mede omgat wordt U mede besmet," which means simply this: "That which you go around with you become tainted with." I always try to impress upon young people the importance of good associates and good companions. This is because we must recognize the fact that every person influences, to some degree, the person he may be with. If a person is good, wholesome, and clean in his thoughts and actions, his influence will be upright and beneficial. Because of this power, which each of us has, to influence other people, we should not be modest about our importance. We can help to shape the lives of others. Our influence is the words and actions that we give out. Now as you go through life you hear little stories that have an influence on your life--to give you strength, to give you stability, to give you maturity.<br><br>The other day I was reading the story of a baseball player. His name was Charles Gerringer. I guess he was quite a star on the Detroit Tigers team. The story indicated that it was the last half of the ninth and two men were down. Charlie Gerringer came to bat. He stood there with confidence and the first pitch came. He didn't swing. The umpire called, "Strike!" He frowned, looked at the umpire. The second ball came by. "Ball!" cried the umpire. Charlie smiled. The next ball came. "Strike!" Charlie looked at the umpire and glared at him with that kind of glare that implied he'd like to throw down his bat, take off his cap, and engage the umpire in fisticuffs. But he knew better. He was there to hit that ball. So he pulled down on his cap, took a determined look, and here came the next pitch and Charlie smote. I don't suppose he ever hit a ball harder. Somehow it didn't rise in the air more than twelve feet, but it went for the left field fence. And by the time it got there it was low enough that the outfielder could grab the ball with a running jump, a one-handed spear catch. The ball game was over. Charlie didn't say a word, but walked toward the dugout. One of his friends came up, patted him on the back, and said, "Tough luck. I have never seen you hit a ball so hard."<br><br>Charlie's answer, gravely, was this: "I have hit 'em higher."<br><h2><b>Personal Freedom</b></h2><br>There's a lesson in that we should never fail to try to do the best we know how. We're going to make mistakes, but there is a power within the individual to really achieve what he wants to achieve. This country did not come about easily. Yes, the Lord told those of us who knew and were willing to listen to him that it was a land above all other lands, a choice land. But they didn't know that fact when this country was organized. Immigrants came to this country seeking a new life, but as they came they were still under bondage. Someone threw out an idea that we ought to be free. I don't know who it was, but it was an idea of truth and it grew. And of course, the only value of any idea is that it grows, if it's a good idea. It's no good lying dormant. And it grew, and it grew to the point that there was one who, I think, was raised by God--a man called George Washington, a man to help create a union, to give the freedom to worship God as men pleased. It really makes me sick, brothers and sisters, when we have President's Day, and about the only thing you hear is who's having a "sale." To think that the father of our country and all the presidents of these great United States are belittled to a "sale" day. Hopefully, the time on the radio and the television would be given to extolling this great nation and the men who made it great. We can change that, you and I, if we'll use the power that we have in unison and in demanding that we honor the great people who caused this nation to be and to survive.<br><br>I really haven't had much to do with the military. I seemed to live in the in-between times when there wasn't war. I was thirty-five years of age when the Second World War broke out. Back in Boston, while I was attending a wool auction, they called for all people who were under thirty-six years of age to register. I was thirty-five. I went into an old building, a historical building, called Faniel Hall, in Boston. It's called the cradle of liberty because it is said that that's where the meeting was held that resulted in the Boston Tea Party. I remember going to that building, and when I heard and found out what its reputation was, a thrill went down my spine as I thought back on the tremendous sacrifices that our forebears gave in connection with the establishment of this country.<br><h2><b>The Greatness of George Washington</b></h2><br>Recently, in a scouting magazine, Margaret L. Coit wrote a few words, and I've taken a few excerpts from what she said regarding George Washington: "He carved victory out of defeat, because he could never give in, never admit he was beaten. At the darkest moment of the Revolution he would only say that this was just the end of the beginning and that the way ahead would be even harder. He had been prepared for the leadership. As we read his history it seems that adversity was constantly his companion, but it was also his teacher."<br><br>I think God guarded him as he went through all this adversity. It is said that an Indian bullet missed him just by inches as he was fighting the Indians. And that bullet, had it struck its mark, would have changed, no doubt, the course of history. But he lived. He was the most unlikely of rebels. He had everything to lose in the revolutionary cause: his great fortune, his fame, his honor, and--as a "damned rebel"--life itself if he was captured. Once it had been his pride to serve England, but now with that spirit of liberty he put himself on line, at last convinced that the very rights of Englishmen were at stake. The many retreats, the many losses came. But they only urged him on and on, and finally the tide turned for him. He knew the last battle was what counted. He could be forgiven all lost battles if only he won the last one, and that win came at Yorktown on October 19, 1781. His courage, his purpose, his holding power, could never be conquered. That's the spirit that has been in America ever since that day.<br><h2><b>Patriotism Supported by the Church</b></h2><br>I hope all of you someday have the chance to go to Yorktown that you might again be reminded and feel your bosom and your heart swelling with pride for the great sacrifices that our forebears gave. Let's not be passive about what we're going to talk about this week. The benefits of our forefathers are evident right here in this great university. We have an obligation. I'd like you to listen to what President Joseph Fielding Smith said:<br><br><i>No man can be a good Latter-day Saint and not be true to the best interests and general welfare of his country. After all these years it is foolish to say that the Church is antagonistic to the national government. The allegiance claimed from its members by the Church does not prevent a member from being a loyal citizen to the nation. It rather aids him. Fidelity to the Church enables a man better to entertain patriotic allegiance to his nation and country. There is nothing required of a Latter-day Saint that can, in any way, be construed to militate against loyalty to the nation.</i><br><br>Of course this stems from our twelfth Article of Faith:<br><br><i>We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.</i><br><br>The Lord has been mindful of this, and he has been wise in giving us, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, some very basic instructions:<br><br><i>Let no man break the laws of the land, for he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break the laws of the land.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be, until he reigns whose right it is to reign, and subdues all enemies under his feet.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:21–22]<br><br>And again, in section 98 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<br><br><i>Now, verily, I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command them.</i><br><br><i>And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.</i><br><br><i>Therefore I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 98:4–6]<br><br>And then again, in section 134:<br><br><i>We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker.</i><br><br><i>We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.</i><br><br><i>We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and a breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 134: 6–8]<br><br>Yes, let's listen to the prophets. Let's take to our hearts that which we believe. I think of a statement that I read some time ago concerning all the programs and all the benefits that we have:<br><br><i>To look at a thing is one thing. To see what you look at is a second thing. To understand what you see is a third. To learn from what you understand is still something else. But to act on what you learn is all that really matters, isn't it?</i><br><br>So let's take to heart and let's listen to the prophets. "Come listen to a prophet's voice." This next statement that I want to read to you from President Joseph Fielding Smith gives me vision, gives me an understanding of what this nation is to be. Listen to it carefully:<br><br><i>This great American nation the Almighty raised up by the power of an omnipotent hand, that it might be possible in the latter days for the kingdom of God to be established in the earth. If the Lord had not prepared the way by laying the foundations of this glorious nation it would have been impossible under the stringent laws and bigotry of the monarchial governments of the world to have laid the foundation for the coming of this great nation. The Lord has done this. His hand has been over this nation. And it is his purpose and design to enlarge it, make it glorious above all others, and to give it dominion and power over the earth to the end that those who are kept in bondage and serfdom may be brought to the enjoyment of the fullest freedom and liberty of conscience possible for intelligent men to exercise in the earth. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will be a strong supporter of the nation of which we are a part. I n the accomplishment of this grand purpose there are no more loyal people to their country on God's earth today than are the Latter-day Saints to this country. There are no better, purer, or more honorable citizens of the United States to be found than are found within the pale of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I testify to this and I know whereof I speak. We have never been enemies to our nation. We have always been true to it. Though we have been persecuted we have said, "We will put our trust in thee."</i><br><br>Why is our country important to us? My heart thrills as I read that statement from our prophet, from God's prophet, our President. It gives me new vision, new vistas to what this great America is. And it will reach its destiny. That I know. President Smith wrote those words or spoke them under the direction and influence of God, the Eternal Father. What a joy it can be to us, and it ought to stir our hearts, that we live in such a nation so organized with all the freedom and liberty to achieve God's purpose here upon the earth.<br><h2><b>Military Preparedness</b></h2><br>Sometimes we wonder about military. The Lord says to renounce war and proclaim peace. But I also read in the Doctrine and Covenants: "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (D&amp;amp;C 38:30). And I think we have an obligation to be strong in morality, in courage, in faith. This nation has an obligation to raise up the strength of military might, not to invade other countries, not to seek the enlargement of our boundaries, but I know, as you know, that the strong preparation we have will curtail in a great measure the movement of the enemy. I congratulate this school that it has a training program here to augment that great military might of this great nation. For our nation is taking its leadership. It is moving forward. And while we have problems, if we united will stand behind those whom we have chosen to lead us and give them our faith and our prayers, this nation will never lose its destiny.<br><br>That preparation comes in sustaining. It comes in the sustaining of local governments, the sustaining of law enforcement. You need government. You need government right here at this university. If you didn't have it there'd be chaos. We need to understand that. And we need to honor those who take the position and even seek employment in that unthankful job of policing. We can let our government know what we want. And I know that they will respond. I can bear personal testimony to that. We need, to obey the laws of the land. We need to obey our national leaders. As I said, I haven't had much experience with the military, but what I have had has convinced me that they are noble men.<br><br>A few years ago I had the privilege of going up to Fort Lewis as an honored guest. Some boys from Utah and Idaho were up there, and they asked me if I would go up and play soldier with them. I am sure I got treatment that very few people get. I had a private home with a houseboy. They saw that I was fed well and dressed properly. And yet I joined in with the boys and went through the gas chamber. I laid on my stomach and fired a machine gun. I had pistol practice. I pulled the lanyard on a cannon and watched the missile go to its destruction. I saw the airplanes drop napalm bombs to cause fires and destruction. My most thrilling experience was on the day of the dress parade. The boys came by saluting me as the honored guest. My, what handsome, what noble young men. They pulled at my heartstrings as I saw them--immaculate in their dress, perfect in their deportment--honor their uniform and this great country. It's a thrilling thing, my brothers and sisters, the strength that lies in the youth of this nation. That's why I say tonight I am honored to be in your presence. Someone has said that the greatest thing in the world is to be in the presence of good company and to have good conversation. Many people have died for this nation.<br><h2><b>Loyalty Expressed by Great Americans</b></h2><br>As I went through some material for thoughts relating to this subject that might penetrate your souls as they did mine, I found one that comes from Phillip A. Silk, a Unitarian universal register leader. He says:<br><br><i>I think the relationship between a person and his country is something like that between a person and his parents. There is kinship, but the amount of love and affection and concern varies according to your experiences with them and how you react to those experiences. The command that all children love their parents or their country, no matter what, is unwise, and it won't work anyway. Love, affection, loyalty, are given. They cannot be commanded by law or oath. We cannot expect everyone to show the same amount of patriotism nor to show it in uniform ways.</i><br><br>Another thought from Eugene P. Burton from the<i>Pennsylvania School Journal:</i><br><br><i>Our country is as great as our wills, as strong as our desires, and will rise as high as our aspirations. Patriotism is the emblem of our unity, our power, and our purpose. It is a lively sense of collective responsibility, the expansion of filial love, a kind of religion with freedom its creed, national freedom its heritage, and world freedom its goal.</i><br><br>One from Adlai Stevenson:<br><br><i>Patriotism is not the fear of something. It is the love of something. Patriotism with us is not the hatred of Russia. It is the love of this republic. It is the love of the ideal of liberty of man and of mind in which this republic was born and to which it is dedicated.</i><br><br>"I am an American by choice, not by birth," says Paul Malloy, who spoke to Oath of Citizenship a few years ago. (How many people have thanked God that they were able to come to this country?)<br><br><i>You see things differently</i>[Malloy continues]<i>when you get yourself adopted, and you have perhaps a deeper appreciation of what others take for granted. So I had become depressed, the word is nauseated, by the wail of sophisticates that this country was going to hell in a golf cart. I guess I am old-fashioned. But I can't share the sheeplike applause for saloon comics who made patriotism a derisive word. I am more concerned with what God thinks of this country, than what the stone-throwing delinquents abroad and our campus progressives here think of it. Perhaps it's corny. But lately I had been longing for some lusty flag-waving</i>.<br><br>And from Arthur J. Goldberg:<br><br><i>Our fundamental liberties were guaranteed in the Constitution, not for enjoyment by a majority but for the protection of a minority--whether it be one or many, in war or peace, equally for the weak as for the powerful. True patriotism, it seems to me, requires us to guard jealously those liberties for others as well as for ourselves.</i><br><br>My dear brothers and sisters, how grateful I am to be an American. "Yes," as one person said, "I was born a baby, but I was raised as an American." The glorious opportunities that we have in this nation shall never be defeated--think about that--so long as we give honor to God, the Eternal Father, and obey his laws.<br><br>I am so grateful that I had the privilege of being born in this country from goodly parents who sought the will of God, came here, and obeyed the laws of the land. May God implant in our hearts a patriotism that will make us so grateful that, every night when we get upon our knees to thank God for our blessings, we shall not fail to thank God for this great country and the power that he has given it to achieve its purposes.<br><br>I bear you my witness that I know that God lives, that he did protect and preserve this land for his choice people, so that his kingdom might be established in the earth. I know these things to be true, and I so bear that testimony in the name of Jesus Christ<i>.</i>Amen.<br><br><i><i>John H.

<h1>f God by Prophecy - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
We're very happy this morning, Sister Packer and I, to be here at Brigham Young University, where we have only three children now attending, down from four. That's a deficiency, I think, that as the years unfold we can correct, Brother Lewis; there'll be others coming along, and we're happy to have them here.<br><br>I'm conscious that this is a devotional assembly, and I would ask for an interest in your faith and prayers this morning as I discuss with you a very sacred subject, one that fills me with gratitude each time I contemplate it. I'd like to share with you some thoughts and some experiences relating to a question that was asked by Moroni, the ancient prophet, when he said,<br><br><i>Has the day of miracles ceased?</i><br><br><i>Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?</i>[Moro. 7:35–36]<br><br>This ancient prophet answered his own question with these words:<br><br><i>Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased, wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.</i><br><br><i>For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then faith has ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.</i>[Moro. 7:37–38]<br><br>The Lord, during his ministry, promised that these signs shall follow them that believe:<br><br><i>In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</i><br><br><i>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</i>[Mark 16:17–18]<br><br>Now, such miracles have always been a witness of his Church on the earth, and they're known among us--I could say even common among us--but they're not often talked about. We regard them with humility and with unmeasured reverence. It isn't about those miracles that I would speak to you this morning. It's about another miracle, a very quiet one, one that's constantly with us, and always apparent, and yet ofttimes ignored.<br><br>In a recent testimony meeting, a friend of mine told of a conversation he'd had that week with a fellow employee in a business establishment. My friend had regarded him as an active member, a faithful member of the Church always, and yet in this conversation he made the comment that he didn't believe that there was much inspiration in the way people were called to office in the Church. He said they're called from desperation or something else, but he said there couldn't be much inspiration in it. I don't know whether that referred to a call he'd received himself for which he felt unworthy; or perhaps he was offended by someone who was called and who was, he thought, ineligible; or maybe he referred to one of the few--and there are a few--who receive a call in the Church unwillingly and then respond and really fail to perform. To him, and to you, I want to quote a verse from the Doctrine and Covenants, and I suppose this is the theme of what I have on my mind this morning. The Lord is speaking:<br><br><i>I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.</i><br><br><i>Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh beneath, and not from above.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 58:32–33]<br><h2><b>"Now We'll See"</b></h2><br>Now, it's about the quiet miracle relating to the calling of members of the Church to office and their response to that call that I would like to talk today. That's a miracle I never fail to be humbled by: that process by which one is designated in the Church to receive a call, and the witness that he receives as he answers it. The suggestion that there's no inspiration in it is something that we have to contemplate.<br><br>I learned years ago a very important lesson. I think it was the second time I'd ever met President Lee; I had been introduced to him once before. I was serving as a member of a stake high council, and on one occasion the stake president presented in our meeting the name of a man to be called to a position of leadership in the stake. I was teaching seminary at the time, and Brother Leon Strong, also a seminary teacher, had talked to me a time or two about this man. We'd commented on what an able man he was, and how sad it was that he couldn't do more than he did because of a handicap relating to his wife. She had one personality trait that I think could be characterized by the term<i>malicious;</i>I think that identifies what it was.<br><br>When the stake president presented the name of this man for a presiding office in the stake and called for a vote, the two of us cast negative votes. That's rather unusual. The president talked it over for a few minutes and then said that he felt he'd like to proceed anyway, and he asked if we would sustain him in issuing this call. Immediately the issue changed. In my mind, then, it was a vote to sustain the stake president, not necessarily a vote for this man to office; and when he called for a vote, Brother Strong and I joined the other ten members of the stake high council affirmatively, approving the call of this man to office.<br><br>When our stake conference was held, a month or two later, when the ordinations were to take place, Elder Harold B. Lee, of the Council of the Twelve, was the visitor. After the conference, we'd assembled in the stake center for the ordinations. Elder Lee had ordained a bishop and his counselors and some others, and then this man was called forth to be ordained by the member of the Council of the Twelve. Brother Strong nudged me--we were sitting together--and with a smile on his face he leaned over and said, "Well, Brother Packer, now we'll see whether this church is run by revelation."<br><br>Elder Lee put his hands on the head of this man and began the usual introductory words to an ordination, then hesitated. Then he said words to this effect: "The other blessings relating to your activities and life and occupation that you've heard pronounced upon the others here apply to you as well, but there is a special blessing." And then that man received the longest blessing, the most pointed of them all; and, in reality, it was not a blessing for him but a blessing for his wife. It was a very interesting thing to see.<br><br>Immediately, when the meeting was over, I went to Brother Lee and said, "Did you know this brother before you ordained him?"<br><br>"No," he said. "I didn't know him. I think I hadn't seen him till I came into this room."<br><br>I said, "He received a very unusual blessing."<br><br>And Elder Lee said, "Yes, I felt that."<br><br>Later, the president of the stake explained: "I meant to talk to Elder Lee about that and tell him that here was a man that had need of a special blessing, but in the press of business we just didn't have time." And so Brother Strong was right. That day we did see whether this church was run by revelation or not.<br><h2><b>The Miracle of a Mission Call</b></h2><br>Recently I had the privilege of organizing the six hundredth stake in the Church, in Southampton, England. Four hundred of the six hundred have been organized in the last twenty years, and nearly half of them have been organized since I was called an Assistant to the Twelve in 1961. Now, with the Church growing that way, those of us who are members of the Council of the Twelve are employed almost constantly on our stake conference assignments in the organization and reorganization of the stakes somewhere in the world. It never fails to be a very interesting and a very inspiring experience. An assignment I would not cherish, I would not seek, save it were that the principle of revelation is a practical, operative principle and can be and is constantly employed.<br><br>Think of going somewhere in the world and arriving on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes when planes are delayed we come late and the meetings have to be rearranged. And yet, the following morning there must be new leadership called, people that we've never seen, sometimes a language barrier. If we were doing it man's way, there would be brochures of experience, there would be interviews and reinterviews, there would be times of study, interviewing many who knew the individual, and so on. But it doesn't work that way; it can't, for there isn't time. The world is too large, and there are too many stakes and too many places to be. It's a marvelous thing to be able to go before the Lord, to present a simple question, and to get a direct, positive, unmistakable answer. I'm ever humbled by that. This is a miracle, this process of the call and release of members in the Church.<br><br>What kind of miraculous persuasion is it that would have a young man, vigorous, active, interested in life itself--at the one time when he, by virtue of normal appraisal, ought to be more interested in material things--be willing to respond to a call to serve on a mission, pay his own way, give a tithing of his life, two years, preaching the gospel? Miracle? Oh, yes; but we have seventeen thousand of them.<br><br>You know, as I was presiding over the New England Mission, we had two missionaries that were two thousand miles away from mission headquarters. And I thought one day, "That's an interesting process. You take a common, garden-variety, teen-age young man; you call him on a mission; you set him apart; you give him another teen-ager as a companion; and you send him out someplace with a hundred dollars a month provided by himself. You then give him a simple list of instructions: no dating, rigid mission rules--spend all your time preaching and proselyting, and so on." Well, it's insane when you think about it. Ofttimes too, he's provided with an automobile. It couldn't possibly work. The only justification is that it does.<br><br>The two missionaries, two thousand miles away, could be depended upon because somehow they'd come to know that it's their church too, and he's their Lord, and this process of sustaining--the process, the simple process, of revelation relating to the call--is an operative principle of life in this church.<br><br>What is it that would cause a man to set aside his personal pursuits, to interrupt his business or professional activities, to yield in political preference, often to give up seniority, often retirement benefits, to go anywhere on earth, without question and without any unusual compensation or persuasion--no compensation materially--simply to preside over a mission?<br><br>I recall a few years ago I was supervising the missions in Western Europe. We needed a mission president with a certain language proficiency. Several names were brought forward, but none of them seemed to be right. Then one of the Brethren remembered that he had met a man--I think it was in Korea--several years before. He was a member of the Church, who was in the customs service. Somehow just the mention of that name and the Spirit confirmed. He was called, by virtue of the time pressures, by telephone to preside over the mission. I visited him a few weeks later. He was living in Washington, D.C. He was within reach of the number one office in his category. His lifetime had been spent progressing through the ranks, thinking that perhaps one day he would stand at the head of that division. His senior officer had indicated that because of a health problem he would retire early and that this man was being recommended for that position. It was just at that time that the telephone call came.<br><br>I wanted to get acquainted with him and was invited to stay overnight. He brought me a message from his superior. The message was this: "Tell that Brother Packer of yours that you're no missionary; I've worked with you for thirty years and you haven't converted me. Tell them they're making a mistake. And you're making a mistake. You're a fool." (I'm leaving out one word.) "If you will give up your retirement and all that you've reached for--why? Why would you do it?"<br><br>Simple answer: he'd been called. We live to know, in this church, that the response to a call does not depend on the testimony and witness of the one who delivers the call. It depends, rather, on the testimony and witness of the one who receives it.<br><br>It was very interesting. We were looking for a man who spoke French. It was not until after he was in the mission field, and we had some opportunities and responsibilities relating to some of the problems of some members we had in Spain, that we discovered that he wrote and spoke Spanish fluently. I suppose if we'd searched through the Church for a man who spoke French, spoke Spanish, and had had some diplomatic experience, particularly as it related to customs work, we would have gone afar in the world; and yet all it was was the chance memory of one of the Brethren that he'd met a man a few years before in Korea.<br><br>There are literally innumerable examples of this in the process of calling people to office. Now we're in the process of calling mission presidents, and I suppose in many homes there's a sweet wife who will give her husband a hug when he says: "I had a call from the Brethren. They want me to go to Argentina." (Japan, Germany, Denver, Texas, Finland, wherever.) And her answer, "We'll go with you, my dear, and we'll sustain you." When the protest comes, "What about this, or what about that?" "No worry about that; they're just material things. We'll come home in the years ahead, as we're released, and pick up the pieces as we can."<br><h2><b>A Spiritual Prompting</b></h2><br>Now with each call in the Church there comes, it seems to me, three things: First, something by way of preparation, not infrequently a spiritual prompting. On these weekends when we call a new stake president, it's an interesting thing to say, "President, when did you first learn of this call?" knowing full well that the enunciation of that to him didn't come from me. He then will tell those sacred experiences, that we'll not repeat here, about how he knew, so that he could prepare for this call.<br><h2><b>A Test</b></h2><br>The next thing usually related to a call is a trial. It's like a test, perhaps like a test you receive at school--and incidentally, like the tests you receive at school, you can fail them if you will.<br><br>I might mention here an experience of a young couple, graduates of this university. This young lady and her husband (they had two children, a tiny girl and a baby two weeks old) graduated, as many of you will, and he had a business opportunity in Salt Lake City. So they moved to Salt Lake City.<br><br>They, of course, were active in the Church, and Bishop Bowles--it was in the Belvedere Ward--called them in the first week they were there. The bishop said, "We're building a new building and we need all the help we can get. Are you willing to serve?" They both said they would. And he said, "Would you like to suggest where you'd like to serve?"<br><br>That's a little unusual in the Church, but she was happy for that. She was a teacher. In fact, she taught here for a quarter or two. She said she'd like to teach. She'd like to teach in the Sunday School or in the MIA. So the following Sunday she was sustained as a second counselor in the presidency of the Relief Society! Now, she protested and used the word<i>shocked,</i>and this is a quote: "That organization is for my mother, not for me." She said she had no experience, and I quote again, "And I have no desire to learn."<br><br>Well, the bishop prevailed, as bishops will, and she answered the call. They held Relief Society in a dismal room in the basement of the chapel, because of the remodeling and construction. It was in the furnace room. While the furnace was on it was terrible, and when the furnace was off it was intolerable. Her children caught cold. On at least two occasions she went to the bishop and asked to be released. On both occasions the bishop said he'd think about it.<br><br>Finally, she was in a very serious automobile accident. After some period of treatment, she was recovering at home. Part of the injury was a terrible laceration of her face. This became infected and they called a doctor one Sunday night. He made some preparation for some further attention, but he said, "I think we can't touch this surgically; it's too close to the nerve in your face." He gave her what attention he could and explained how grave the situation was.<br><br>It was as the doctor was leaving that late Sunday night when the bishop appeared at the door, after a long busy day, as Sundays will be for a bishop. He said, "I was just on my way home from some interviews and saw the light on and wondered if there was trouble here." This woman, in her agony, when the bishop said, "Is there anything we can do for you?" answered from her pain and with tears, "Yes, Bishop.<i>Now</i>, will you release me from the Relief Society?" He said he would pray about it. And the answer came back: "Sister Spafford, I still don't get the feeling that you should be released from the Relief Society."<br><br>This great and lovely woman, who for many years has presided over our Relief Society in the Church, was tested in those early days of her life. I think that something like that can come to many of us, most of us, when we're being tested, as it were.<br><br>I recall an experience I had on one occasion as a young man in the military service. I thought about it recently when we've had the repatriation of some of our military men from overseas. I'd been away from home about four years. We were given points. You got a point for every month you'd been overseas, ad a point for the number of battles you had been in, and so on, and high-point man went back to the States first.<br><br>Of course there were millions of men to be brought back, and shipping was taxed, so there was nothing more important than to look at the bulletin board and see the points come down. At once you were earning more, and someday you got to the point where you knew the next ship in would be the one that would take you home. I saw that on the bulletin board and thanked the Lord that I could go home finally.<br><br>It was that day that my commanding officer called me in and told me we were opening a new flight at Osaka and that I was to be the operations officer. Well, I expressed myself to him. I might have been court-martialed for what I said. I think I'll even admit I used a few scriptural terms out of context. In fact, perhaps upside down and backwards. He listened very patiently, and when it was all over with he said, "Well, that's all right, Packer, you're still going." And so it was.<br><br>That afternoon, on a C-47, with all my gear and the others who'd been assigned, I sat bitterly grumbling over the fact that it would take months again, that it wouldn't be just an assignment of a week or two. Then I challenged, I think, the Lord, saying, "Why is it?" I had never wanted anything so much as I wanted to be home. I'd prayed for it, I'd tried to earn it, I'd tried to deserve it, I'd tried to behave myself, and then, within grasp, the very thing I wanted most was denied me.<br><br>Somehow, I don't remember how, I took hold of myself; but looking back now, I can say the Lord was answering my prayers then. There came from that experience, from things that happened in those few months, lessons essential to the preparation for the calling that is now mine. I couldn't see that far ahead, but by those tests or trials that we receive, ofttimes the Lord will prepare for us what he has in mind.<br><h2><b>A Sustaining Power</b></h2><br>Now, the third thing, with reference to this quiet miracle, is that with the setting apart comes an endowment of power and inspiration, a sustaining power that will secure the success of anyone called to office in this church. Now, the Lord knows what the Lord knows, and he said, "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways" (Isa. 55:8). Sometimes we challenge, in our own hearts, when the Lord gives us an experience. We wonder, and yet there's that quiet miracle.<br><br>"In this Church," as President Clark said, "one takes the place to which one has been duly called, which place one neither seeks, nor does one decline" (<i>Conference Report,</i>October 1950).<br><br>Then there's the Article of Faith: "We believe that a man must,"--not<i>could be</i>, or<i>might</i>, or<i>sometimes is</i>--"We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof."<br><br>Now, the world doesn't see that. Some members of the Church don't see that. This man who said that we're called by desperation or something else is a man who is not possessed of the Spirit. For "natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Cor. 2:14). And I have come to know that whenever you find criticism, and cynicism, and ridicule, over something as sacred as this, invariably also you find disobedience. Keep in mind that word. "I command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing. Then they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled" (D&amp;amp;C 58:32–33).<br><br>I affirm to you, my young brethren and sisters, that that principle of revelation is a constantly operative principle, and I close with one other experience.<br><h2><b>Each of Us Can Have that Spirit</b></h2><br>I was organizing a stake in Samoa. There appeared before us in the interviews these wonderful Samoan brethren. One of them, a branch president, stood there--white shirt and tie, lava-lava tied around his waist, barefooted. I told him we were organizing a stake and seeking a stake president and asking his suggestions on men. He said, "Yes, I know. I've prayed about this." And he said, "I've come to know, by the voice of the Spirit, that Bishop Iona will be our new stake president."<br><br>He was right. But I wasn't anxious to have him make the announcement and so pressed him for another name.<br><br>He said, "No, just one name."<br><br>And I said, "Suppose he were not available, or not eligible. Won't you suggest another name?" He stood there for a few minutes, and then, looking at me, he said, "Elder Packer, are you asking me to go against the witness of the Spirit?" This wonderful man was possessed of that Spirit, as all of us can be, each of us answering the calls that come.<br><br>Now I plead with you, my brethren and sisters. This church is directed by a prophet of God; the principle of revelation is operative. Every week as we go out across the world, we have those experiences. We don't talk about them much. They're like the other miracles: they are the signs that follow those who believe. I pray that we will be reverently grateful for the sustaining power of the Spirit.<br><br>Jesus lives; he is the Christ. Of him I bear witness. It is taught by many that he's some influence in the far recesses of the heavens. He is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father. He is no stranger to his servants on this earth. This is his church. Of him I bear witness. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Boyd K.

<h1>orld Celebration in Iran - Ezra Taft Benson - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, my beloved brethren and sisters, humbly and gratefully I approach this assignment this morning. I'm very, very happy to be back on this great campus. I cherish very much the days that I spent here as a student. I'm proud to be an alumnus of this great institution; and of all these degrees--honorary, eleven of them--I think that there's none that I cherish more than the one from Brigham Young University.<br><br>I had a glorious weekend. I've had the privilege of being at another of the Lord's institutions: I was up at Ricks College, where we reorganized the two student stakes on the campus and partook of that wonderful spirit they have there. And now to come here, to this, the Lord's great university, and partake further of that same spirit--it's a real joy and a pleasure and an honor. I think this spirit cannot be duplicated anywhere, on any campus anywhere in the world, and I've visited many campuses in many countries. I remember some years ago, while living back in the nation's capital the first time, I had a very good friend, one of the great agriculture leaders of the country, Dr. H. E. Babcock of Cornell University. I'd invited him to attend one of our sacrament meetings--which is not uncommon; I'm always inviting my friends to attend our meetings--and he finally did attend. I met him on the street, and he said, "Well, last Sunday I attended your sacrament meeting, as you call it, but you weren't there."<br><br>I said, "No, I was visiting another ward. But how did you like the meeting?"<br><br>"Oh," he said, "it was wonderful, especially the spirit. But," he said, "I wish you'd tell me one thing. Why is it, when you Mormons come to the end of a meeting, you don't seem to have any place to go?" He said, "That meeting ended, the benediction was said, and then the people stood there and they visited and visited and visited. I thought I'd never get out of that chapel. And when I got out in the foyer it was more congested than ever."<br><br>Then I had to explain to him that this is characteristic of the Church; it's this great spirit of fellowship and brotherhood and love that we have. And I said, "Not only that, Doctor; it's one of the marks of the divinity of this work."<br><br>Well, I felt that spirit very keenly Saturday and Sunday up at Rexburg; I always feel it when I come here. I said to one of the professors up there after we'd been together most of two days, "This spirit is wonderful here on the campus. A person ought to be willing to work for almost nothing up here."<br><br>He said, "Brother Benson, we almost do."<br><br>But now, Sister Benson and I, a few days ago, attended our annual movie. We try to go once a year. Sometimes it's not easy to find a good show every year, but this one was a good one. It was entitled<i>Young Winston</i>. I thought of it as President Oaks announced the groundbreaking for the law school. It's a good movie. I hope you see it. And I was just thinking, of all the men I've met I think the three greatest statesmen I would choose are J. Reuben Clark, Senator Robert Taft, and Winston Churchill. I was at the White House, at the dinner honoring Winston Churchill, when President Eisenhower presided at the meeting at the dinner. After the meal was over and Winston Churchill was being introduced, President Eisenhower said, "Now, Mr. Prime Minister, we'd be happy to hear from you, and we'll be glad to have you talk as long as you want to talk." And he talked for forty-five minutes and gave the most masterful review of world conditions, country by country, that I have ever heard or ever expect to hear.<br><br>Following this movie, I was told an incident in the life of Churchill which I'll relate to you. He was very ambitious as a young man. He was what you might call a political climber. He had a very good opinion of himself. He was very ambitious and very effective. He was often very critical--almost wickedly critical, some of his opponents thought--of the opposition. He'd made a speech in London and had torn into his opposition rather vigorously. One of his acquaintances on the other side of the aisle politically, a woman, was so disturbed and so angry at the end of his speech that she looked him squarely in the face and she said, "Winston, if I was your wife I'd poison your coffee."<br><br>He said, "Madam, if I was your husband I'd drink it."<br><h2><b>A Great Conference</b></h2><br>Now I was just calculating, for thirty years I've had the privilege of coming here and talking about the glorious principles we prize as Latter-day Saints, giving counsel, admonition, warning of some of the dangers, talking about standards. This morning, if the Lord will bless me, I'd like to do something just a little different. Sunday afternoon, October 1971, a few minutes after the close of the semiannual conference of the Church, I boarded a fully loaded plane at the Salt Lake airport. Most of the passengers were rejoicing, happy, chatting Latter-day Saints, returning home from an inspiring general conference of the Church. There were stake presidents, bishops, high councilors, Relief Society workers, and many other cheerful, grateful members of the Church.<br><br>At Chicago I had the pleasure of greeting them one by one as they came out of the jetway into the terminal building, going to Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, St. Paul, and many other points in all directions from Chicago, and some of them to Europe. One of the first comments from a bishop: "Brother Benson, it was a great conference." Which brought forth a response from a stake president, "That's the only kind of conference we ever have in the Church," to which all agreed, including several western LDS businessmen who had stopped off for conference in route to business appointments in the eastern half of the United States.<br><br>Then, after getting a bit of a picture of membership distribution in this world Church, I was asked why I was leaving Salt Lake so soon after conference. Where was I going, and why? Then, what about the work in Europe, Asia, South America, and so forth? Several of them had missionary sons, brothers, or nephews in countries mentioned. All seemed to have the enthusiastic missionary spirit. Some few had recently attended regional meetings in Indianapolis and Lansing. It pleased a grateful father to have someone say, "We met your son and heard him speak. What a great mission president."<br><br>Then followed the brief forecast of the dual mission on which I was embarking. First to countries of continental Europe, then on to the world celebration in Iran, commemorating possibly the oldest secular event celebrated in history, the twenty-five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Persian nation--2,500 years ago, 529 years before the birth of Christ--by King Cyrus the Great.<br><h2><b>The European Trip</b></h2><br>The European trip was unique. It involved an American free enterprise firm, CPC International, operating 129 factories and plants in 41 nations, employing 44,400 people on all continents with annual sales of its 500 products totaling more than $1.5 billion, with headquarters in the New York City area at Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The three days would include inspection trips, field tours, luncheons, dinners, and receptions. The seventeen-man board, broken up into small groups for the tour, concluded its program with an all-day board meeting, panels, lectures, and reception for the European business, governmental, and industrial fraternity at company European headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. At every turn during the three days, people, people, everywhere people. Good people, gracious people, kind people, industrious people, enterprising people who believed in friendly competition and association, free markets, private property, and freedom of choice through free enterprise, which system has given us more of the good things of life--a higher standard of living--than any other system in operation in this world.<br><br>These leaders from all parts of free Europe--fifteen nations--believe in and promote this free enterprise system. They're men of good will, men of high ethical standards, our brothers, men who need the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to enrich their lives and increase their effectiveness. With deep appreciation I accepted their hospitality and prize their solid friendship.<br><h2><b>An Invitation</b></h2><br>Then, after four interesting, eventful days, my thoughts and my attention turned from my associates and the interests of this American-based organization to the world celebration--the twenty-five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great--in Iran, the world's oldest existing constitutional monarchy.<br><br>Something of the world character and interest in this great historic event had been forecast through national magazines and metropolitan newspapers throughout the world. Such headlines as "Iran Plans Spectacular Party," "50 Monarchs Gather in Iran," "To Celebrate 2500th Birthday," and so forth. These are typical of hundreds. The concentration of interests was brought to my attention when I placed a telephone call from Brussels, Belgium, October 7, and was told that because of the backlog of calls it would take four days--till October 11--before the call could be completed. The celebration was to start October 10.<br><br>One of the least publicized and possibly most important aspects of the recent twenty-fifth centenary celebrations in Persepolis, Iran, was the presence there of representatives of twenty-eight world religions. It was the first time in modern history that religious leaders were treated on the same level of importance as politicians. The guiding spirit behind this phenomenon was a white-haired Boston Irishman named Baron von Blomberg, President of the United Religions Organization.<br><br>The invitation to attend came about through a communication, the letterhead bearing the imprint of the royal crown and the heading "Honor Semper--SOVEREIGN ORDER OF CYPRUS." With the approval of the author I quote the letter:<br><br><i>(Received September 1, 1971)</i><br><br><i>My dear Mr. Benson:</i><br><br><i>Given the task [by the king] of inviting world religious leaders to the 2500th anniversary of Cyrus the Great, in Iran--I should like to have a Mormon leader included.</i><br><br><i>Having been with you in Innsbruck, Austria, and of course knowing your distinction, I write to ask if you would be with us or, if not, could you help us to get proper Mormon representation.</i><br><br><i>The time is short, as the dates are Oct. 10 to 17. Transportation and hospitality is paid. This is the greatest celebration in the history of Iran--royalty, heads of State, diplomats will be present.</i><br><br><i>Kindly give thought to the above and let me know soon. Thank you for your courtesy and with continued high regards,</i><br><br><i>Baron Frary von Blomberg</i><br><br><i>President</i><br><br><i>World Fellowship of Religions</i><br><br>The Innsbruck, Austria, meeting referred to in the Baron's letter occurred in this manner. In 1964, just before the opening of the Winter Olympics, we were touring the Austrian Mission of the Church. On the tour were President Peter Locher, his wife, and Sister Benson. And on that tour we were to dedicate a lovely chapel, just finished, in Innsbruck. Some six hundred people crowded the building designed to serve a growing branch of two hundred. Invited and present were the mayor of Innsbruck, the national senator of the area, and, with the mayor, Baron von Blomberg. The new chapel was located on a new street, unpaved except in front of our property. In his most fitting talk the mayor explained that while they "didn't quite have enough time to get the entire street paved, we were able to complete the street and sidewalk paving in front of your property in time for this dedication."<br><br>It was a lovely, spirited service of gratitude and rejoicing for the restored gospel. As the baron said, when he confirmed the letter of invitation by long-distance telephone, "I remember well the spirit of that occasion and how deeply I was impressed by the messages given." Yes, my brothers and sisters, the Spirit is very real. You cannot fool the Spirit. Some people try, only to learn of their own folly.<br><br>And so that is the genesis of the invitation. The office of the First Presidency, after seeing the letter of invitation and knowing that I would be in Europe at the time--and with all expenses paid--advised me to attend this unusual celebration.<br><h2><b>Cyrus, the Deliverer of the Hebrews</b></h2><br>Iran has been able to maintain its separate identity as a nation despite three major invasions. The Persian language is reported to be "still as liquid as it was during the pre-Islamic era."<br><br>Cyrus the Great (date of birth unknown) was a descendant of a line of kings ruling in Anzan (Babylonian Ansan), a country known to the nations west of it as Edom (highland). Although much is missing of the details of the life and activities of Cyrus the Great, there is enough to establish him as a great leader, a useful son in the Lord's plan for his children, especially for ancient Israel. Living something more than 500 years B.C., he figured in the prophecies of the Old Testament--mentioned in 2 Chronicles 36:22–23 and Ezra 1:1–2 and by the prophets Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Daniel. Greek writers give more of the details of his life. I quote briefly from 2 Chronicles 36 and the prophet Ezra, chapter 1:<br><br><i>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</i><br><br><i>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.</i>[2 Chronicles 36:22–23]<br><br><i>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</i><br><br><i>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.</i><br><br><i>And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</i><br><br><i>Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</i><br><br><i>And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,</i><br><br><i>Thirty basins of gold, silver basins of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.</i><br><br><i>All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</i>[Ezra 1:4–11]<br><br>Cyrus repaired the shrines and pacified tributary peoples by restoring to them the images of their gods. Among those whose religious feelings he thus regarded were the captive Hebrews, to whom he at the same time restored certain political and social rights. The coming of this deliverer had been foretold to them by the prophets, and no doubt the faithful welcomed him with hope and joy. He gave them permission to return to Jerusalem and directed that Jehovah's temple should be there rebuilt at the expense of his own treasury. The Lord of us all used this powerful leader as an instrument to accomplish his purposes, as he had done before and will do many times again in the days ahead. Cyrus the Great is reported to have spent the last years of his life reducing to order the affairs of his vast empire to the blessing of the people. He apparently was politic and considerate, knowing how to use the sentiments of others for large, beneficial, and political ends. And even if his friendly treatment of the Hebrews sprang mainly from a desire to have attached subjects on a threatened frontier, he was nonetheless their deliverer from bondage.<br><br>Cyrus has been referred to as a nonreligious leader with religious, Christian ideals.<br><br><i>Cyrus is said to be the first king to promulgate the "Declaration of Human Rights." He granted equal status to all his subjects and freedom of religious worship. He rebuilt the temple of Solomon which had been destroyed by the Babylonian kings and freed some 40,000 Jews who had been jailed by the Babylonians, allowing them to return to their homes.</i>[<i>Quincy Herald-Whig</i>(Quincy, Ill.) September 5, 1971]<br><br>Yes, God, our Father, uses the men of the earth, especially good men, to accomplish his purposes.<br><h2><b>Modern Prophets Speak of Cyrus</b></h2><br>In 1842, two years before his martyrdom for the testimony he bore to the world, the Prophet Joseph Smith said this:<br><br><i>If there was anything great or good in the world it came from God. The construction of the first vessel was given to Noah, by revelation. The design of the ark was given by God, "a pattern of heavenly things." The learning of the Egyptians, and their knowledge of astronomy was no doubt taught them by Abraham and Joseph, as their records testify, who received it from the Lord. The art of working in brass, silver, gold, and precious stones was taught by revelation, in the wilderness. The architectural design of the Temple at Jerusalem, together with its ornament and beauty, was given of God. Wisdom to govern the house of Israel was given to Solomon, and to the judges of Israel; and if he had always been their king, and they subject to his mandate, and obedient to his laws, they would still have been a great and mighty people; the rulers of the universe--and the wonder of the world. If Nebuchadnezzar, or Darius, or Cyrus, or any other king possessed knowledge or power, it was from the same source, as the scriptures abundantly testify. If then, God puts up one, and sets down another, at his pleasure--and made instruments of kings, unknown to themselves, to fulfill his prophecies, how much more was he able, if man would have been subject to his mandate, to regulate the affairs of this world, and promote peace and happiness among the human family.</i>[<i>Times and Seasons,</i>3:856–57 (July 15, 1842)]<br><br>Another modern prophet recognized the source of greatness in man. On January 9, 1881, President Wilford Woodruff said this of Cyrus the Great:<br><br><i>Now I have thought many times that some of those ancient kings that were raised up, had in some respects more regard for the carrying out of some of these principles and laws, than even the Latter-day Saints have in our day. I will take as an ensample Cyrus, on account of his temperance. He was one of the kings of the Medes and Persians. I believe his father was a Persian and his mother a Mede. To trace the life of Cyrus from his birth to his death, whether he knew it or not, it looked as though he lived by inspiration in all his movements. He began with that temperance and virtue which would sustain any Christian country or any Christian king. And even when he was sent in his youth to his grandfather Astyages, the king of the Medes, he showed that he had been carefully brought up, and he followed his early training in a great measure throughout his life; while as king or leader of the Median armies, he conquered nearly the whole world--in fact, I do not know that he ever lost a battle. His grandfather was living in luxury, and when young Cyrus was sent to him he offered to serve him as butler--only he didn't do as butlers sometimes do--that is, taste the wine before putting it on the table. Cyrus, when offered wine, said, "I am afraid it is poison." "You are afraid it is poison? What makes you think it poison?" "Why, because I have seen it make you and some of the princes act very strange, you would stagger and act very curious." He followed this principle of temperance during his whole life. Before a battle he offered sacrifices to the Gods; when he finished a battle and had a victory he did the same thing. I have been struck</i>[continues President Woodruff]<i>in reading his history with the course he took in this matter. He would never enter into revelry or debauchery over the nations he had conquered. He taught such principles until the day of his death. Before he died he told those by whom he was surrounded, that he did not want his body put into a gold coffin or a silver coffin; he simply desired his body to be laid in the dust and covered with earth. Many of these principles followed him, and I have thought many of them were worthy, in many respects, the attention of men who have the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</i>[Wilford Woodruff in<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>22:207]<br><h2><b>A Royal Tribute</b></h2><br>Little wonder, then, that on Tuesday, October 12, 1971--under a blue sky and gentle breeze, which unfurled hundreds of green, white, and blue flags in a most impressive ceremony--a royal tribute opened a big week of tribute to Cyrus: A 101-gun salute, "heard round the world" (as the 800 visiting press put it), and a solemn eulogy of Cyrus the Great by his successor, His Imperial Majesty, the Shahanshah.<br><br>Before the plain, stone tomb in the middle of a vast plain, surrounded by towering mountains, the head of a nation spoke in an emotion-choked, yet firm and clear, voice these words:<br><br><i>At this glorious moment, in the history of Iran, I and all Iranians, the offspring of the empire which thou founded 2,500 years ago, bow our heads in reverence before thy tomb. . . .</i><br><br><i>Cyrus! We have today gathered at thy eternal resting place to say to thee: "Rest in peace, for we are awake, and will forever stay awake to guard thy proud heritage." . . .</i><br><br><i>We vow that we will safeguard, with an iron will, the greatness and glory of this land bequeathed to us as a sacred trust by our forebears, and to leave to those who will come after us a country yet more proud and more great than ever.</i><br><br><i>We vow to ever safeguard the traditions of humanism and benevolence on which thou founded the Persian Empire, and to remain for the people of the world the bearers of the message of world brotherhood and truth. . . Today as in thy age, Iran bears the message of liberty and the love of mankind in a troubled world and is the guardian of the most sublime human aspirations. The torch thou lit, has never died in stormy times. Today it casts its light upon this land more brightly than ever and, as in thy time, its brilliance spreads far beyond the boundaries of Iran.</i><br><br><i>Cyrus! Rest in peace, for we are awake, and we will always stay awake.</i>[Encomium upon Cyrus the Great by His Imperial Majesty Mohammed-Reza Pahlavi Aryamehr Shahansha of Iran, Pasargadee, October 12, 1971]<br><h2><b>What God Has Wrought Among His Children</b></h2><br>The scene at the tomb of Cyrus the Great will remain: flags waving, bands playing, youth choir singing the national hymn, the king paying tribute to eternal principles and greatness in man, applauded by worldwide representatives of nations, religions, and people, people, people. Yes, the good that men do lives after them and is always recognized by inspired men who also recognize the source of greatness in men.<br><br>This was it--the spirit and greatness of the occasion--an oath of allegiance to the past, the present, and the future. Yes, there was much, much more. How can a weak man describe the twenty-five hundredth anniversary celebration of the founding of the Persian monarchy by Cyrus the Great? A nationwide celebration, thirteen years in preparation, centering in historic Persepolis, ancient religious capital of Cyrus and Darius. Yes, the celebration participated in by heads of state of the entire world in an overwhelming response. The decorations, the receptions, the concerts, the theater, the dancing, the magnificent parade, all in a setting of unequaled beauty. And all this climaxed by the living panorama of the long history of Iran, as it passed before us on the desert in a fabulous tent city, at historic Persepolis.<br><br>Yes, I know you have seen glimpses of it, via satellite, on color TV, and in large color sections in U.S. and international publications. The historic site, the preparations, the spirit of the people, even to one who had been in Iran before, are almost unbelievable. The talent of the free world was drawn upon for this most memorable event. As I viewed the cuisine, the crystal and china, the linens, the colorful, rich fabrics, the special effects, the transportation, the program of events, the construction, the organization, and so forth and so on, I could only exclaim, "What God has wrought among his children! How he has blessed us!" Oh, that these good people, our Father's children, our brothers and sisters, could all hear and receive the message of the restored gospel. How it would enrich their lives and add feelings of security, peace, and joy to their souls.<br><br>It was pleasing to note the progress being made under His Imperial Majesty, the Shah of Iran, a dynamic leader. Basic freedoms are being extended to the people. Educationally, industrially, and agriculturally, progress is being made to bless the people and their families.<br><br>May God bless the good people of Iran and our Heavenly Father's children everywhere. May we be grateful for the leadership of good men, the glorious blessings of freedom, and the rich blessings of a material nature which freedom makes possible. And most important of all, may God speed the day when the message of the restored gospel, with its priceless, eternal, spiritual blessings, will reach the hearts of all our Father's children everywhere, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 December 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<br>
We have an interesting custom among us of setting aside special days on which we think about special things. We set aside the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, and on that day we let our minds reach up and try to understand the purposes for which this day was set apart. We set apart the third Sunday in June as Father's Day for the same reason.<br><br>Someone has said that the human mind has some of the qualities of the tendrils of a climbing vine. It tends to attach itself and draw itself upward by what it is put in contact with. We have some other wonderful days in which we put our minds in contact with other great ideas. We set apart the fourth Thursday in November as Thanksgiving, and on this day we try to build gratitude and appreciation into our lives. And as we recount our blessings we increase them. On the fourth of July we commemorate the birthday of this great nation and we remember that God raised up wise men to write our constitution and establish this land upon righteous principles. Governments were instituted by God for the benefit of man, and he will hold us responsible for our acts in relationship thereto.<br><br>December 25 is the day set aside when we commemorate the birth of the Son of God, who came into this world to organize his church, to teach us those great lifesaving principles of the gospel, to atone for our sins, and to administer to us all of the ordinances of exaltation. The Church is a divine institution, but so is the government.<br><br>We set aside another important day called Easter, when we commemorate the initiation upon this earth of the universal resurrection. The resurrection is commemorated in the spring of the year, when the earth itself seems to be coming back to life after the cold and snow of the long dead winter.<br><br>We have other, smaller commemorations of Easter. When someone dies we sometimes talk about the resurrection. But ordinarily we don't like to talk about the resurrection because it is so closely associated with death, which seems to us to be unpleasant; and because we don't like to talk about unpleasant things, we close our minds and turn away our faces. But death does not cease to exist just because it is ignored.<br><br>The ancient Egyptians had a much more logical way of handling this situation when on their great festive occasions they kept constantly on display before the revelers the skeleton of a dead man. They wanted everybody to continually remember that someday he was going to die. Now I don't want to frighten anyone unduly in this audience today; however, I would like to point out as gently and as kindly as I can that someday each one of you is going to die.<br><br>Someone has said that, judging from the past, very few of us are going to get out of this world alive. One man had an inscription prepared for his tombstone which said, "I knew it would happen." One of the ways to get the better resurrection pointed out by Paul is to think effectively about it in advance. It has been said that the most important event in life is death. Death is the gateway to immortality. We live to die and then we die to live.<br><br>The other night I reread the old Grecian tragedy about the fall of Athens. You may remember that a Roman general had captured an Athenian philosopher, and he told the Athenian that he meant to put him to death. But because the Athenian didn't seem very disturbed, the Roman thought that probably he didn't understand. So the Roman said to the Athenian that maybe he didn't know what it meant to die. But the Athenian thought that he understood it better than the Roman did, and then he said to the Roman: "Thou dost not know what it means to die, for thou dost not know what it means to live. To die is to begin to live. It is to end all stale and weary work, to begin a nobler and a better. It is to leave deceitful knaves for the society of gods and goodness." The purpose of our mortal lives is to teach us how to live eternally.<br><br>That is also the primary concern of God himself and the purpose of the resurrection. If the death of the body forever ended all there is of human life and personality, then the universe would be throwing away with utter heedlessness its most precious possession. A reasonable person does not build a violin with infinite care, gathering the materials and shaping the body of it so that it can play the compositions of the masters and then by some capricious whim smash it to bits. Neither does God create this great masterpiece of human life and then, when it has just begun to live, throw it utterly away.<br><br>It would be very helpful to us if we clearly understood the central event in all human history which took place some 1,900 years ago in a garden tomb on the outskirts of Jerusalem. I would also like to discuss with you some of those things that preceded this event and some of the things that followed after it.<br><h2><b>Events Preceding the Savior's Crucifixion</b></h2><br>During the last days of the ministry of Jesus, the antagonism of his enemies had become so great that he took his most intimate associates, upon whom the burden of carrying on his ministry would rest after his death, and sought retirement in the little town of Ephraim some twenty miles north of Jerusalem, where for a short period he could teach them in comparative peace and quiet. But as the feast of the Passover approached, he startled his followers by saying, "Let us go into Judaea again." They reminded him that the Jews had there recently sought his life, and they asked, "Goest thou hither again?" (John 11:7–8). But Jesus prevailed, and early Friday morning of the last week of his life he began that solemn march toward Jerusalem and the cross.<br><br>He arrived back in Bethany late Friday afternoon, just before the beginning of the Sabbath, and went to the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, where he would lodge during these last few nights. Over the last Sabbath of the Lord's life, the gospel writers have drawn a reverent veil of silence. We know a few things that happened during this last Sabbath but not very many. Then early Sunday morning, the first day of the week, he went into Jerusalem to resume his teaching in the temple. He was joined along the way by Passover crowds going to Jerusalem, and they formed a triumphal procession where the people threw flowers and palm branches in his path and shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord" (Matthew 21:9).<br><br>Jesus wept over Jerusalem, knowing the calamities that would befall this sacred city because of its sins. All day long during this last Sunday, he taught in the temple, and then in the evening he walked some mile and a half back to Bethany to lodge. On Monday morning he came again to the temple. This is the day he overthrew the tables of the money changers and drove out those who used the temple to sell their goods, saying, "It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves" (Luke 19:46).<br><br>Again that night he returned to Bethany to lodge. On the next day, which was Tuesday, the Lord came for the last time to the temple and taught all day long without substantial success, and as the day closed, he began his journey back to Bethany to be with this little family that he loved. He had foretold his own death, the destruction of Jerusalem, and many other important things. As he, crossed the Mount of Olives he stopped near the summit to rest, and his disciples came unto him and said, "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" (Matthew 24:3).<br><br>And then for a few moments he laid aside the cares of his own death and talked to them about our day. He told them of the wars and rumors of wars that should be among the signs of his second coming. He made a comparison rather uncomplimentary to us when he said, "As the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be" (Matthew 24:37). And then, in what must have been the one bright spot in a rather gloomy picture, he said, "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come" (Matthew 24:14, 37).<br><br>Later, John the Revelator was to look forward to our time and announce the restoration of the gospel when he said,<br><br><i>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</i><br><br><i>Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come.</i>[Revelation 14:6–7]<br><br>And then, before going on to Bethany, Jesus made his famous farewell speech to Jerusalem. It was near the close of the day, and we might imagine that as he sat there on the side of the hill the last rays of the declining sun had lighted the temple with their golden light. This was a spot that was endeared to every Jewish heart by the sacred memories that it contained. Upon this spot, now occupied by the temple, had once been the wheat field of Ornan, where an angel of God had commanded David to build an altar on which to offer sacrifices to Jehovah. Here the magnificent temple of Solomon had later been erected. And after its destruction it had been rebuilt by King Zerubbabel. And now, after its second destruction, it was in the process of being rebuilt by King Herod. It was here that Jesus had come and from this spot had operated for the period of his mortal ministry. It was here that he was now saying farewell. In that famous last speech he said,<br><br><i>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</i><br><br><i>Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</i>[Matthew 23:37–38]<br><br>Only yesterday he had referred to it as his father's house. Now their chance had gone; he was leaving those sacred precincts forever. Their time had run out, and he said,<i>"Your</i>house is left unto you desolate." Then he went back to Bethany to lodge. Wednesday and Thursday he spent with the twelve. Thursday evening he invited them to the last supper. He gave them many teachings and instituted the sacrament. Then, after he gave the sop to Judas, Judas went out in his act of betrayal and brought the mob to take him in the Garden of Gethsemane, where he had gone after the supper.<br><h2><b>His Crucifixion</b></h2><br>All during that long night he was dragged from one political jurisdiction to another. During the mock trial he was sentenced to be crucified, and at nine o'clock the following morning he was nailed to the cross. He stayed upon the cross from nine until three. From twelve until three a darkness covered the land. It was against the law to leave anyone upon the cross during the Sabbath, and so, as the end of the day approached, the executioners went around among those on crosses and, if the victims were not already dead, hastened their death by the extra pain inflicted by breaking their legs. Jesus was already dead, but a Roman soldier thrust a sword into his side.<br><br>Joseph of Arimathea, an uncle of Jesus, had gone to Pilate to obtain permission to take down the body and lay it in his own sepulcher. A group of Jesus' enemies had also gone to Pilate and said,<br><br><i>Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</i><br><br><i>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure unto the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</i><br><br><i>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</i>[Matthew 27:63–65]<br><h2><b>He Is Not Here: For He Is Risen</b></h2><br>So they placed the Roman seal upon the rock and set a guard of Roman soldiers around the tomb to make sure that nothing was disturbed. And thus the tomb remained during the balance of that Friday night, all day Saturday, and until Sunday morning. What happened on that first day of the week is partially recounted by Matthew:<br><br><i>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</i><br><br><i>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</i><br><br><i>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</i><br><br><i>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</i><br><br><i>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</i><br><br><i>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</i><br><br><i>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</i><br><br><i>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</i>[Matt. 28:1–8]<br><br>The scripture continues this important account of the inauguration of the resurrection by saying, "And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many" (Matthew 27:52–53).<br><br>These were real people, and the resurrected bodies were real bodies, just as our own resurrection will be a very real, tangible one. During the next forty days the resurrected Jesus ministered among the people. He talked with them, ate with them, and manifested his person unto them. On one occasion he appeared to ten of the twelve in a room in Jerusalem. When he appeared in their midst they were terrified and affrighted, as they supposed that they had seen a spirit. But Jesus said unto them,<br><br><i>Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</i><br><br><i>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. . . .</i><br><br><i>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</i><br><br><i>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</i><br><br><i>And he took it, and did eat before them.</i>[Luke 24:38–39, 41–43]<br><br>On this occasion Thomas was absent, and when they told him that they had seen the Lord, that he was alive and had been resurrected, Thomas said that he would not believe unless he could see for himself. Eight days later, the Lord appeared to them again when Thomas was present and invited Thomas to come and make an intimate inspection of his person and feel the nail holes and put his hands in his side and be no more faithless but believing. And after a great exclamation of belief, the Lord said to Thomas, "Because thou has seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29).<br><br>After an eventful forty-day postmortal ministry, Jesus stood on the top of Mount Olivet with his most intimate followers and from their presence ascended up to heaven. The record says:<br><br><i>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</i><br><br><i>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</i><br><br><i>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</i>[Acts 1:9–11]<br><h2><b>A Literal Bodily Resurrection</b></h2><br>It is of the greatest importance to us personally that we understand this important event and that God has decreed that all men, good and bad, who have ever lived upon this earth shall be resurrected--some in the resurrection of the just and others in the resurrection of the unjust.<br><br>There are some people who claim that it is very difficult for them to believe in a literal bodily resurrection and the eternal existence of the human soul. It has never seemed to me that this should be very difficult for one who can believe in h is own birth--that is, if you can believe in this, if you can believe that two microscopic bits of protoplasm can come together to create a life cell and then by a process of self-division create other cells completely unlike the original to make this great masterpiece of flesh and bones, mind and personality, vision and understanding that we call a human being--for if you can believe in that, it ought not to be difficult to believe that that creation, once it had been established, could live on throughout eternity.<br><br>Edwin Markham once put this idea down in verse under the title "The Unbelievable." He said:<br><br><i>Impossible, you say, that man survives</i><br><i>The grave--that there are other lives?</i><br><i>More strange, O friend, that we should ever rise</i><br><i>From out the dark to walk beneath the skies,</i><br><i>But having risen to life and light,</i><br><i>We need not wonder at our deathless flight.</i><br><br><i>Life is the unbelieveable; but now</i><br><i>That this incredible has taught us how,</i><br><i>We can believe that all-imagining power</i><br><i>That breathed the cosmos forth as golden flower,</i><br><i>Had potence in his breath</i><br><i>And plans us new surprises beyond death--</i><br><i>New spaces and new goals</i><br><i>For the adventure of ascending souls.</i><br><br><i>Be brave, O heart, be brave:</i><br><i>It is not strange that man survives the grave:</i><br><i>'Twould be a stranger thing were he destroyed</i><br><i>Than that he ever vaulted from the void.</i><br><br>Some important events are recorded very briefly in the Bible. On one page the Bible contains all that is written of the history of the entire world for 500 years. Even the life of Christ himself is very briefly told. We know about his birth, but there is very little told of what he himself did until age thirty. We have only two short glimpses of him in that earlier period. One is when he visited with the wise men in the temple at age twelve, and Luke makes the only other comment: "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and man" (Luke 2:52).<br><br>He had an active ministry of some three and a half years. And John says that if all the things had been recorded which Jesus said and did, the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. But if you should put together all of the direct statements made by Jesus recorded in the Bible, they could be read in approximately thirty minutes. Likewise we wish we had more of the facts of some of his important teachings and more details about such momentous events as the resurrection.<br><br>Some time ago I read an interesting account of the resurrection of Jesus as it might have been told by the Roman officer who guarded the tomb of the crucified Christ. This story is based on scriptural fact and supplemented by the author's imagination. The officer's name is Maximus, and he later recounts to his sweetheart what he saw during this official three-day assignment.<br><br>He says to her:<br><br><i>My Sylvia, 'tis long since we have met, so kissed, so held each other to heart!</i><br><br><i>I thought to greet thee as the conqueror comes, bearing the trophies of his prowess home, but Jove has willed it should be otherwise.</i><br><br><i>Jove say I? Nay, some mightier, stronger God, who thus hath laid his heavy hand upon me; no victor, Sylvia, but a conquered man--who seeks to hide his weakness in thy love.</i><br><br><i>How beautiful thou art! The years have brought an added splendor to thy loveliness.</i><br><br><i>Come, girdle me about with thy true arms, and pillow on thy breast this aching and bewildered head of mine;</i><br><br><i>Here, where the fountain glitters in the sun among the saffron lilies--and I will tell, if so that words will answer my desire, the shameful fate that has befallen me.</i><br><br><i>Down in Jerusalem they slew a man, or God--it may be that he was a God--those mad, wild Jews; whom Pontius rules; thou knowest Pilate, Sylvia, a vain man, too weak to govern such a howling horde as those same Jews.</i><br><br><i>This man they crucified. I knew naught of him, never heard his name until the day they dragged him to his death;</i><br><br><i>Then all tongues wagged about him and his deeds; some said he claimed to be their king, some that he had blasphemed their deity. 'Twas certain that he was poor and meanly born.</i><br><br><i>No warrior he, nor hero; and he taught doctrines that surely would upset the world; so they killed him to be rid of him.</i><br><br><i>Wise, very wise, if he were only man, not quite so wise, if he were half a God!</i><br><br><i>I know that strange things happened when he died. There was a darkness, and an agony, and some were vastly frightened--not so I.</i><br><br><i>What cared I if that mob of reeking Jews had brought a nameless curse upon their heads! I had no part in that blood guiltiness.</i><br><br><i>At last, he died, and some few friends of his took him and laid him in a garden tomb. A watch was set about the sepulchre, lest these, his friends, should hide him and proclaim that he had risen as he had foretold.</i><br><br><i>Laugh not, my Sylvia, I laughed when I heard the prophecy; I would I had not laughed.</i><br><br><i>I, Maximus, was chosen for the guard with all my trusty fellows. Pilate knew I was a man who had no foolish heart of softness--all unworthy of a man.</i><br><br><i>I was a soldier who had slain my foes; my eyes had looked upon a tortured slave as on a beetle crushed beneath my tread;</i><br><br><i>I gloried in the splendid strife of war, lusting for conquest; I had won the praise of our stern general on the scarlet field; red in my veins the warrior passion ran--for I had sprung from heroes, Roman born!</i><br><br><i>That second night we watched before the tomb, my men were merry on the velvet turf, bestarred with early blossoms of the spring; they diced with jest and laughter.</i><br><br><i>All around, the moon light washed us like a silver lake, save where that silent sealed sepulchre was hung with shadow as a purple pall.</i><br><br><i>A faint wind stirred among the olive boughs; me thinks I hear the sighing of that wind in all sounds since; it was so dumbly sad; but as the night wore on it died away, and all was deadly stillness; Oh, Sylvia, that stillness was most awful, as if some great heart had broken and so ceased to beat.</i><br><br><i>I thought of many things, but found no joy in any thought, even the thought of thee. The moon waned in the west and sickly grew her light sucked from her in the breaking dawn.</i><br><br><i>Never was dawn so welcome as that pale, faint glimmering in the cloudless brooding sky.</i><br><br><i>My Sylvia, how may I tell thee what net came to pass? I have been mocked at, when I told the tale, for a crazed dreamer, punished by the gods, because he slept on guard; but mock not thou, Sylvia!</i><br><br><i>I could not bear it, if thy lips should mock the vision dread, of that Judean morn.</i><br><br><i>Suddenly the pallid east was all aflame with radiance, that burst upon our eyes as from the noon day sun, and then we saw two shapes, that were as the immortal gods, standing before the tomb;</i><br><br><i>Around me fell my men as dead; but I, though through my veins ran a cold tremor never known before, withstood the shock, and saw one shining shape roll back the stone.</i><br><br><i>The whole world seemed ablaze, and through the garden came a rushing wind, thundering a paean, as of victory.</i><br><br><i>Then that dead man came forth! O Sylvia if thou could'st but the face of Him have seen.</i><br><br><i>Never was such a conqueror. Yet no pride was in it--naught but love and tenderness, such as we Romans scoff at, and his eyes bespake him royal. O my Sylvia, surely he was no Jew but very God!</i><br><br><i>Then he looked full upon me. I had borne much staunchly but that look I could not bear! For what man may front a God and live?</i><br><br><i>I fell prone as if stricken by a thunderbolt; and though I died not; somewhat of me died that made me man.</i><br><br><i>When my long stupor passed, I was no longer Maximus, I was a weakling with a piteous woman soul; all strength and pride, joy and ambition gone.</i><br><br><i>My Sylvia, dare I tell thee what foul curse is mine because I looked upon a God?</i><br><br><i>I care no more for glory, all desire for honor and for strife is gone from me, all eagerness for war. I only care to help and save bruised beings and to give some comfort to the weak and suffering.</i><br><br><i>I cannot even hate those Jews; my lips speak harshly of them, but within my heart, I feel only compassion; and I love all creatures, to the vilest of slaves, who seem to me as brothers.</i><br><br><i>Sylvia, scorn me not for this weakness; it will pass, surely 'twill pass in time and I shall be Maximus, strong and valiant once again, forgetting that slain God. And yet, and yet, He seemed like one who could not be forgot.</i><br><br>At Christmas when we commemorate the birth of Jesus, we retell the story of the wise men, the shepherds, the angels, and fact that there was not room for Christ to be born in the inn. We follow about the same procedure at Easter when speaking about the resurrection. Jesus was resurrected and there we usually let the matter rest until the next Easter Sunday. But most events get their greatest importance from what comes after them.<br><br>The birth of Jesus is even more important to us because of his teachings, his atonement, and the other important things which came after his birth. This is also true of the resurrection.<br><br>The resurrection of Christ is important to us for many reasons. One is that he broke the bonds of death for all mankind and initiated the universal resurrection upon this earth under the divine decree that "as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). Our resurrection will be important to us throughout eternity.<br><br>There are some religious leaders who teach that a mortal body is but an encumbrance given us during our mortality and that we will be well rid of it when we die. This is not true. Without this mortal body we could never receive a fullness of joy, nor achieve our greatest accomplishments. If a body were not necessary for this life, then it never would have been created in the first place. If it had not been necessary for eternity, then the resurrection never would have been instituted. If a body of flesh and bones were not necessary for God the Father, then why was God the Son resurrected? At the resurrection the spirit and the body are inseparably connected and only then is it possible for us to receive a fullness of joy. This is one of the very important events in the wonderful program of God which we refer to as eternal progression.<br><br>A number of years ago Brigham H. Roberts recorded some ideas about God's great program for our eternal growth and happiness. He said:<br><br><i>Think for a moment what progress a man makes within the narrow limits of this life. Regard him as he lies in the lap of his mother--a new born babe! There are eyes that may see, but cannot distinguish objects; ears that may hear, but cannot discern sound; hands as perfectly fashioned as yours and mine, but helpless; feet and limbs, but they are unable to bear the weight of his body much less walk. There lies a man in embryo, but helpless, and yet within the span of three score years and ten by the marvelous working of that wondrous power within, what a change may be wrought! From that helpless babe may arise one like unto Demosthenes, or Cicero, or Pitt, or Burke, or Fox, or Webster, who shall compel listening senates to hear him and by his master mind dominate their intelligence and their will and compel them to think in channels that he shall mark out for them. Or from such a babe may come a Nebuchadnezzar or an Alexander, or a Napoleon, who shall found empires or give direction to the course of history.</i><br><br><i>From such a beginning may come a Lycurgus, a Solon, a Moses, or a Justinian, who shall give constitutions and laws to kingdoms, empires, and republics, blessing happy millions unborn in their day, and direct the course of nations along the paths of orderly peace and virtuous liberty.</i><br><br><i>From this helpless babe may come a Michelangelo who from some crude mass of stone from the mountain side shall work out a heaven-born vision that shall hold the attention of men for generations, and make them wonder at the God-like powers of man that has created an all but living and breathing statue.</i><br><br><i>Or a Mozart, or Beethoven, or Handel may come from that babe and call forth from the silence those melodies and richer harmonies that lift the soul out of its present narrow prisonhouse and give it fellowship for a season with the gods.</i><br><br><i>Out of the babe may arise a master mind who shall seize the helm of the ship of state and give to a nation course and direction through troublesome times and anchor it at last in a haven of peace, prosperity and liberty, crown it with honor too, and give it a proud standing among the nations of the earth while he the Saviour of his country is followed by the benedictions of his countrymen.</i><br><br><i>All of this may be done by a man in this life! Nay, it has been done between the cradle and the grave--within the span of one short life. Then what may not be done in eternity by one of these God men? Remove from his path the incident of death, or better yet, contemplate him as raised from the dead: and give to him in the full splendor of manhood's estate immortality, endless existence, what may we not hope that he will accomplish. What limits can you venture to fix as marking the boundary of his development or his progress? Are there any limits that can be conceived? Why should there be any limits thought of?</i><br><br><i>Grant immortality to man and God for his guide, what is there in the way of intellectual, moral or spiritual development that he may not aspire to?</i><br><br><i>If within the short space of mortal life, there are men who rise up out of infancy and become masters of the elements of fire and water, and earth and air, so that they well-nigh rule them as gods, what may it not be possible for them to do in a few hundreds or thousands or millions of years? What may they not do in eternity? To what heights of power and glory may they not ascend?</i><br><br>The Savior of the world said that the purpose of his mission was that we might have life and have it more abundantly. The greatest creation in the world is life, and the greatest form of life is the kind that God himself has; birth, education, death, and the resurrection are all a part of that program of God for our eternal welfare and happiness.<br><br>May God bless us with life in the greatest possible abundance. For this I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i> Sterling W.

<h1>ot, Save the Lord Commanded Me - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2></h2><br>I pray that whatever I may say here this morning may be what my Father in heaven would have me say, and that you also will pray in your heart that I may do this.<br><br>Years ago, when my father was in the evening of his days on this earth, I encountered him reading his patriarchal blessing. He marveled that the old patriarch, John Smith, in the Sugarhouse Ward eighty years before, could have told him in outline what had come to pass in his life. "Everything has been fulfilled in my blessing," he said, "except one thing."<br><br>"What is that?" I asked.<br><br>He replied, "My blessing said that if I sought the will of the Lord I should preside over a stake in Zion."<br><br>I said, "Did the patriarch make a mistake, Dad?"<br><br>"No," he said abruptly. "The General Authorities called me to serve, but I'd just returned from a three-year mission to England. I was an older man. I had a large family that had worked to keep me there. My business partner, O. S. Stapley, had carried the burdens of our business, so I told the Authorities to let me get on my feet financially, and then I would be glad to serve, but I was never called again."<br><br>There was no further comment, but I sensed without any moralizing on my father's part that he wanted me to hear this story and draw my own conclusions.<br><br>What is the will of the Lord in our lives? How can one do many things of his own free will (D&amp;amp;C 58:27) and yet not let one's independence and thinking lead him away from an experience which the Lord would have him enjoy? This question is as old as the council in heaven, that day when Jesus Christ chose to do the will of his Father, and his brother Lucifer chose to go his own way. It is as new as yesterday, when a Mormon boy had to choose between a football contract with the Dallas Cowboys and a mission call to Tonga. To do or not to do something because the Lord or his servants ask you to do it is the question. When the angel asked Adam why he had just killed a firstling of the flock as a sacrifice to the Lord and Adam answered, "I know not, save the Lord commanded me" (Moses 5:6), didn't the Lord know that giving people a reason is a great motivator? Was this a blind faith that leads to nowhere or was it the smart thing for Adam to do?<br><h2><b>Covenants in the Temple</b></h2><br>One of the purposes of a temple of God is to help us answer these questions. The word<i>temple</i>is related to the noun<i>template,</i>which is defined as a "pattern" or "guide." All temples, heathen, Greek, or Oriental, house the values men live by. Your temple houses the story of how life was started on this earth by Elohim, the living God--your God and mine. This university, our wards and our stakes, our homes and our teachings prepare us for the time when we can be found worthy to go to the temple and willingly make covenants with our Father in heaven. These covenants, in brief, bind us to say, "I will put him first in my life. I will find out what his will is concerning me and follow it."<br><br>Jeremiah, standing at the gate of the Lord's house, cried in vain for Israel not to walk after the imaginations of their own hearts but to counsel with the Lord. Otherwise they would face lamentation and desolation.<br><br>Harry Glick, a Mormon Jew, tells how his grandfather, Rabbi Louis Hersch, had one ambition more than anything else, and that was to go to Jerusalem and weep bitterly over the small, battered remains of an inaccurate replica of a wall--a part of the once glorious temple of Jerusalem. "Why," he asked, "should this rabbi--a Ph.D. as far as worldly designations are concerned--why should he, a Levite, who could only sweep the floors and wash the sacrificial altars of the temple, want to go there? It was because he longed to see the return of the glory of those days when God's chosen people talked with God and he led them by the hand. Grandpa Hersch died at seventy without ever making the trip," Brother Glick went on to say, "but he would gladly have traded those seventy years for one moment that we spend in one session in our temple, had he known that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had set those temples up."<br><br>We learn in the modern temples of Israel that the main reason any of us is on this earth is to see if we will do "all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God [will] command [us]" (Abraham 3:25). Now note, the scripture doesn't say "Do only the things that God first explains to you." Thousands of Latter-day Saints are living their lives on the principle that doing God's will first is the thing to do. All the understanding, believing heart wants to know is, What does God want? Then finding it, he goes and does it. This is not authoritarian. It is not a military order or blind faith. It's the highest form of intelligence, for the temple story tells us that God created us. He is our Father. Literally, he conceived our spirit bodies in love and with great expectations. He brought us to this earth and gave us the opportunity to choose him or some other way. We see that he made the heavens, and that he made the earth on which we stand. It was he who said of us:<br><br><i>They are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency;</i><br><br><i>... and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father.</i>[Moses 7:32–33]<br><br>Who has greater love, or who has a greater interest, or who has a greater right in commanding us, guiding us, and reigning over us? Why should he mince words or be permissive or sound anything but a certain note about going the way he has outlined? He set up<i>the</i>stairway, not<i>a</i>stairway; he gave us<i>the</i>iron rod on that stairway to take us to the precious fruit of this life. Who else, as Peter said, has words of eternal life? Where else should we go to find them (John 6:68)?<br><h2><b>Obeying of Our Own Free Will</b></h2><br>Jesus was far ahead of us in exercising deference, respect, and love where it is deserved, and by doing this he became our Creator and our God. He set the example. He saw, very clearly, what a great privilege it was to glorify his Father. Without our Father we wouldn't get very far, for Jesus said:<br><br><i>The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: ...</i><br><br><i>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: And he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</i>[John 5:19–20]<br><br>The truth is, God gives us plenty of room to do many things of our own free will, if we will just listen to and follow him in the first place. Call this blind obedience if you wish, but it is truly the key that opens the door to all blessings. Our Father is the source of all power. Jesus said, "For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given the Son to have life in himself" (John 5:26). Because of his obedience, Christ was given power over all life or death. Yet he said, "I can of mine own self do nothing: ... and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30). Now, if we want to be like the Son of God, the best start is to seek to do the will of our Father, and then in due time we too will be given a measure of "life in ourselves" in our kingdom. The temple story tells us that we may be heirs with our Father.<br><br>Apparently giving a by-line when and where due, showing respect and love, and acknowledging what someone has done for us are the greatest virtues we can have. Not doing so is not just a fault; it is a base crime that we must pay for. As far as God our Father is concerned, it is really the only offense that we can give to him. In a small, vestibular example, I find myself going the extra mile in love to any of my eight children when one of them slips his hand into mine and says, "I'll always be indebted to you, Dad, for what you did for me," or to the independent thinker in the family who says, "I don't understand what you want me to do, but I'll do it because you're my father and I love you." Even though I may not deserve these words, in that moment, somehow, they really become my children. Before that, they were my respected offspring. But in those things in which they show love and faith in me, their father, they truly become my sons and my daughters. I would go to the ends of the earth for that child. I would be inclined to trust him with all I had. I would call him my beloved son.<br><br>This is why, when God gives us the priesthood, the power to do things in his name, we should honor it. This is why, when he gives us temples and great promises to make and keep with him, we should make and keep them. Everything in the endowment in the temple, according to President Brigham Young, is a gift from a loving father and is necessary to bring us back one day into his presence, to rule and reign with him. Everyone who comes out of the temple does so with a bona fide working agreement with his Father in heaven. This agreement, in essence, is based on the premise that we will do his will. Now, it is wonderful for all of us to sing "I Am a Child of God," but we are not really such until we do his will. Just being conceived by him is not enough. Just being sent to the earth by him is not enough. Just thinking beautiful thoughts is not enough. Just being an honorable man is not enough. The terrestrial kingdom of God is filled with the honorable men of the earth who are blinded by the philosophies of men--philosophies described by Kenneth Rexroth as "complicated methods of avoiding all the important problems of life." The temple shows Adam and Eve facing up to conditions, not theories. If we do not face the problem of knowing God and his wishes and knowing why we should keep his commandments, and then if we do not keep them, we stand in our own light and choke the channels of communication with him. He can well say when we meet him, "Depart from me, for I never knew you" (<i>cf</i>. Matthew 7:23). We<i>know</i>God by knowing what he asks us to do and then by doing it. And if we know him and his Son, Jesus Christ, in this manner, we may have life eternal, which is to live with him forever, because we will feel comfortable in his company and he in ours.<br><h2><b>The Word of Wisdom</b></h2><br>It is so easy to drift inadvertently into something less than this kind of attitude. I recall a manuscript on<i>Reasons for Observing the Word of Wisdom,</i>produced by one of our BYU professors. He wanted us to print it. So we took the manuscript to one of the Brethren, President Spencer Kimball, who pronounced it one of the finest treatments of the subject that he had ever read. Convincing economic, health, and other reasons for following the Word of Wisdom were clearly set forth. "But," he said, "you left out the most important reason."<br><br>"What is that?" the author asked.<br><br>"Because God asked us to," he replied.<br><br>Now, I wondered why I hadn't thought of this reason. I had to confess that, as a professor, I just wasn't in the habit of using this approach. It seemed like a reason you talked about only in church. Was it because the approach was too sacred or was I afraid the learned would not understand? I began to feel like the salt that had lost its savor. I read the eighty-ninth section of the Doctrine and Covenants over again. Sure enough, it said, "the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God." And here and there God said, "I warn you," or "it is pleasing unto me if you don't do this," or "I ordain this grain for you," and finally, "I give unto you the promise that the destroying angel shall pass by you." Then I began to see it as wise counsel from the heart of a loving God, the God of all health and happiness.<br><br>His words are full of love and concern. He knew more about health than all the learned doctors. He made the human body in his image. Hundreds of years before, he knew more than any of us what tobacco and liquor and intemperance would do in our day. He wanted to warn us. The first reason for observing the Word of Wisdom is that God our Father told us to leave tobacco and liquor alone, eat right, and be temperate. I remember Nephi's words:<br><br><i>O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they thing they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom ... profiteth them not. ...</i><br><br><i>But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God.</i>[2 Nephi 9:28–29]<br><br><i>And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned ... who are puffed up because of their learning ... are they whom he despiseth.</i>[2 Nephi 9:42]<br><br>We can partially conceive of how upset God would be with those of us who "walk in darkness at noonday." When we have so great a light, how stupid not to walk by it, and still more stupid to never even give him honorable mention for providing the light.<br><h2><b>Follow the Spirit</b></h2><br>I wonder if any of us are worthy of working for BYU if we are not governed by the desire to always acknowledge God in our work. I wonder if we as students don't need a jolt right at the very first of our four years here, such as losing our 116 pages or having some other similar experience, so that we could really listen to the Lord, as he teaches us what he taught Joseph Smith on that occasion:<br><br><i>Although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he ... sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will, ... he must fall ...</i><br><br><i>How often you have ... gone on in the persuasions of men. For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 3:4, 6–7]<br><br>And then after we have learned our lesson as Joseph Smith did, and we love our Father for his will concerning us, then we are ready to graduate, produce that book, build a successful business, marry a wonderful companion in the temple, keep great promises, and fill our life's mission and glorify our Father.<br><br>The founder of this university, President Young, pointed the way when he said not to teach anything here without the Spirit of God. He meant, too, that the learners here are not to learn anything without the Spirit of God. We're not to take on any learning that won't lead us back into the presence of God. One of the great architects of this school, Karl G. Maeser, said, "let your first good morning be to your Father in heaven." He reminds me of Alma, who said:<br><br><i>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let they heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</i>[Alma 37:37]<br><br>Dr. Maeser said over and over again, in the writings given us by his son Reinhard, that this university would be what the Lord designed it to be, avoiding the pitfalls and old grooves into which so many universities fall as they acquire the notion that they can go it alone without God. I believe we are avoiding this pitfall in this university.<br><br>When a new dean was chosen to fill the post I had occupied here at BYU, I was anxious for the future of that division. For a quarter of a century I had prayed and worked with this stepchild of the University--the Extension Division of Continuing Education. The Lord poured out his blessings upon it over the years to make it one of the most respected extension programs among the institutions of higher learning in this country. There were several promising young men as candidates for the deanship. We could have honestly recommended several. In the office of the new and young president of Brigham Young University we discussed the choice. Then I heard President Oaks say, "This is a most important decision. I think we should kneel in prayer and ask the Lord for guidance." I knelt down with him and another Ph.D., Vice-President Thomas. The prayer was simple and direct. He asked for light and discernment in whatever course of action we were about to take. And when we arose, I knew by the manifestations of the Spirit that the Lord would not fail us. I didn't see the name of the next dean written on the wall, but I felt good about whatever might be done. I knew that we would not make a bad choice. And isn't this feeling the most important blessing that God could give anyone? When President Oaks mentioned a name, we all agreed. And there was a good spirit present.<br><br>Now I'm just simple enough to believe that the Lord will stand by that feeling which he gives us. The new dean may stay a short or a long time. The blessings we ask for come in unexpected ways, but if the will of the Lord is done what is there to fear? I'm simple enough to believe that any decision made in this university by any teacher, administrator, or student will be a good decision if he does his homework first and then asks the Lord to accept or modify what he may present and thus not let him do anything contrary to the Lord's will. Just wanting to be on God's side is a great start. Notice I did not say wanting God to be on our side; I said wanting to be on his side. Peace of mind, serenity, and the feeling that God's hand is over you is his greatest gift to us, for it releases all of the best that is within us.<br><h2><b>Inquire of the Lord</b></h2><br>Just one word to the hundreds who, in their secret hearts, have come here to find someone with whom they can share companionship and a love which will last forever. Let me tell you that you too<i>must</i>do your homework. So many storm the Lord to get him on their side, with all his blueprints. This is a poor start, especially when we've never "studied it out first in our own minds," to quote the Lord's word to Oliver Cowdery. Let not that person think that he should receive anything from the Lord, for the Lord will leave him alone with his problems. He is not teachable by the Lord or anyone else, and he will be driven by the wind and tossed while waiting in vain for the Lord to give him a picture of the girl he's to marry. One of our great prophets, Jacob, said:<br><br><i>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.</i>[Jacob 4:10]<br><br>When we have lived the commandments, when we have learned to know and follow his will, and the person we want to marry does the same thing, we will both be drawn together in the Lord because we have much to share with our Father and with each other. We put ourselves beyond serious doubts and fears and foolish errors. Our whole bodies will be filled with light when our eyes are single to the mind and will of our Father in heaven, and we will comprehend all we need to know to make a good choice, and our companion will also (D&amp;amp;C 88:67). Why is this so? It is because our affections are based on eternal principles. When are two Latter-day Saint people in love worthy of each other? When can a couple be truly sealed for time and all eternity in the temple? It is when they love their Father in heaven enough to say, "Father, we have thought through our marriage, we have our own ideas, but we know that you ordained marriage, you made us male and female, you told us to leave father and mother and twain be one, and we want to be guided by you. We want to know, for we love you. We want to keep and make, make and keep sacred promises with you in your house, and in your own way."<br><br>Is it possible to love any woman, or any man, any more than we, or they, can love God, covenant with him, and follow his will? The answer is no. That's why marriage in the temple has so much potential for those who come here with an eye single to his glory. The successful temple marriage begins when two people want God's blessings in the way he has ordained. Then our Father in heaven can promise these two everything that he has and deliver it. He knows that with this spirit the couple will say more than just "Lord, Lord." They will wait to back it up by being worthy of all the requirements found on the temple recommend. Eternal love, as Erich Fromm says, is more than a feeling, for feelings come and go. How can we be sure on this basis alone that love will last forever? You can be sure only when feelings are supported by a judgment, a decision, a meaningful promise before God. Everything in our lives falls into place when we continually ask and answer the questions "What does my Father in heaven want me to do?" And "What did I do today to fulfill his will?"<br><br>In the scriptures, in the quiet of our study, in a clean body and mind, and in the busy and anxious bustle of good causes in our priesthood and Church and civic and home duties, God answers our inquiry. But until we find him and his will, and until he finds us and our will, we begin, as H.G. Wells says, "at no beginning and work to no end," and nothing in the universe or in our lives will fall into place.<br><br>How easy it would make President Oaks's administration if, when problems are placed on his doorstep, and teachers and students want to know why the General Authorities said this or that, he could say, as Nephi said to his brothers, "Have ye inquired of the Lord?" (1 Nephi 15:8). Why should our leaders have to tell us whether the course of our bishop or stake president is the right one? We must get our own testimonies and then live by them. And we have no right to push off this responsibility of knowing onto our parents, or President Lee, or our teachers, or anyone else.<br><br>Once when I was secretary to a congressman, I felt that President J. Reuben Clark, a Republican, was injecting politics into the Church because of his prejudice against the Democrats. I was a bishop, and I felt guilty because I wanted to think well of my Church leaders. I prayed earnestly to know from the Lord whether my observations were justified, and if not, what attitude the Lord would have me take. I went to general conference at Salt Lake in this spirit of inquiry. President Clark rose to speak. He gave some of the soundest advice I ever heard, and a witness came into my heart that said, "This man is a servant of God; you won't get off the track if you follow him." Now it didn't say that he wasn't an ardent Republican, but all I wanted to know was whether I should not in my heart accept him as my leader. Later I worked intimately with him on a Church manual, and my love and respect for him is one of my choicest possessions. But my choicest possession was the knowledge that this member of the First Presidency, in whom I could have great trust, put the Lord first in his life and was accepted by my Father in heaven.<br><br>What if we didn't try to argue loud and long as parents to convince our children, but had trained them and ourselves to inquire of the Lord on matters of importance that we hope they and we would understand together in the home? How it would help us to refine our thoughts as parents, and what a choice gift we would give each of our children. It would be an iron rod in his hand, which we could both use in our hands also to carry us through, to eventually eat together the precious fruits of life eternal.<br><br>It might sound ridiculous to you, but if President Oaks, before he handed your sheepskin to you, would ask the question, "Have you learned to inquire of the Lord while in this university, and did you inquire of him?" and if you could sincerely answer, "Yes, it is one of my most valued possessions. I not only made the resolution, but I took the action required to bring it into being," he would say with pride, "Take this diploma. We won't ever worry about your honoring this university with success, for this will be a lantern in your hand, and a song in your heart, and, incidentally, money to the alumni. It is better than any other skill or knowledge we could have given you at BYU, for God will exalt you, or in other words, there will be no bounds or limits to the privileges that he will give you."<br><h2><b>A Personal Witness</b></h2><br>To those who are strong and independent thinkers and yet able to say, "I will follow him," then that portion is given them at the right hour of their need. I know this, because he has gone before my face so many times when I have trusted in him implicitly. He has been on my right hand and on my left and borne me up and raised up friends to help me. I keep thinking at this moment of Minnie Louise Haskins' words:<br><br><i>I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year: "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out into the darkness and put thine hand into the hand of God. That shall be to thee better than a light, and safer than a known way."</i>[John Bartlett, comp.,<i>Familiar Quotations</i>(Toronto, 1955), p. 881]<br><br>Early in my life, from somewhere, perhaps from my conversation with my father about his patriarchal blessing, I had a desire to find out and then to do what the Lord wanted me to do. This was only a seed, planted in weakness, but somehow watched over by some guardian angel, for my mind was never so clear as when I was up and doing something about this seed. I tried to follow Elder Hugh B. Brown's admonition by starting the day right by reading some appropriate scripture or making some covenant and then asking God to help me remember it, and then, during the day, remembering that I was going to talk with him again that night and report what I had done and how well I'd kept the covenant. This helped me to try to do his will (<i>Conference Report,</i>October 3, 1964, p. 100).<br><br>I ended up as a student at BYU because I'd heard that teachers here taught with the Spirit. The day after I graduated one of my physical education teachers, Miss Jeppson, got me a job sailing between New York and London on great ocean liners as a recreation director. Later I fell in love and married a returned lady missionary. We prayed and laughed and worked our way into having six children, education degrees, and finally into Washington, D.C., where I worked with a congressman and in other government agencies. I served as a bishop of the Washington, D.C., Ward and then came to BYU to teach. Each day I found more and more rich dividends when I sought to put my hand in the hand of my Father in heaven. This belief was tested severely when the lovely companion of my youth died of cancer, leaving me with five children. Oh, how I prayed that I might be spared such a bitter cup! The Lord never promised me that he would spare me; he only said, "Don't worry, things will turn out all right." And I found again and again that the most precious of all gifts is the gift of faith, serenity, peace, and the untroubled mind.<br><br>When I looked for someone who would be a mother to my five children and be my companion, I said to myself, "I want someone who loves and trusts the Lord." So when I saw a smiling young widow, I fell in love again. But presumptuously I asked her bishop if she had a temple recommend. I knew this was only one straw in the wind, but it was one on which I felt I could depend. Not many people would go to the temple unless they want to do what the Lord wants them to do, I reasoned. She qualified for the recommend, so we were married. And it turned out that she did deeply love the Lord. How much we had to share together! How much to have faith about! How much to repent about! Our marriage has been "one long conversation which seems all too short." I looked at the family picture we took a few months ago of our eight children. I counted the twenty-six grandchildren, and more and more on the way. Some of them write and say, "Dad, we want a home like the one we had with you."<br><br>Now in conclusion, I just want to bear witness that in spite of all the risks of people trusting God in the wrong way--in spite of the Hitlers who think they do the will of God (I remember Finley Peter Dunne said, "A fanatic is a man that does what he thinks the Lord would do if He knew the facts of the case" [Bergen Evans,<i>Dictionary of Quotations</i>(New York, 1968), p. 224])--in spirit of all the young people who have plain heartburn instead of a true burning in their bosom to tell them the right way, I testify that if we just plug ahead, living a clean life and doing God's will as he gives us the light to do it, he will bless us. I testify to you that placing your hand in the hand of the living God is better than a known way. So, of your own free will, go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God. It is better than anything<i>you</i>can think of, and far more exciting. I tell you, you won't ever be sorry. It will be the most intelligent thing you ever did. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Harold Glen Clark was serving as the first president of the Provo Temple when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 15 May 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ay Prophet-Presidents I Have Known - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks and students, I always appreciate an invitation to meet with the students of Brigham Young University. I have many happy memories of the years when I was here at the University. I know the heartbeat of this great school, and I have seen its progress through the years. And I am deeply grateful to have an opportunity to be with you this morning. I hope that I may be able to say something that will be of interest to you and perhaps give you a little broader insight into the natures of the great leaders who have presided over us as presidents of the Church. Today I wish to speak to you of prophets, with special reference to those under whose immediate direction I have served as president of Relief Society.<br><h2><b>A Prophet Speaks in God's Name</b></h2><br>In the Articles of Faith, penned by the Prophet Joseph Smith, in which are set forth the basic tenets of our faith, one--<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.6?lang=eng#5">Article 6</a>--declares our belief in prophets as a part of the organization of the Church, both in the primitive church and in the Church today. It reads:<br><br><i>We believe in the same organizations that existed in the Primitive Church, viz., apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.</i><br><br>Scriptures also attest the reality of prophets in Old Testament days: Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Micah, Malachi, and others too numerous to mention.<br><br>A prophet in no wise must be regarded as a soothsayer, one who, relying upon his own reasoning, foretells future events. Nor should he be compared to a so-called fortuneteller, one who professes to predict the future. A prophet, as I understand it, is one chosen and inspired of God to speak in God's name regarding the future happenings pertaining to the Church on earth and also to the well-being of God's children. We in this dispensation know that by the will of God our prophet is also the seer and the revelator. As the revelator, he is the one to whom the Lord reveals whatever is necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the Church and the good of the people. He is the living oracle of God, God's mouthpiece on earth. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read: "For his word [the prophet's] ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.5?lang=eng#p4">D&amp;amp;C 21:5</a>).<br><br>In the Church, the prophet is also God's chosen servant to preside over the Church as its president, accepted and upheld as such by a vote of the priesthood and the laity of the Church assembled in an officially called general Church conference. To him are given all the keys of authority of the priesthood of the Church upon earth, and by the word of the Lord he is president of the high priesthood of the Church. As such, he presides over the priesthood, and every office in the Church is under his direction, while he himself is directed of God.<br><br>These are marvelous things to contemplate, and if we truly believe in prophets and their divinely ordained calling, as we claim to do in the Articles of Faith, we impose upon ourselves a responsibility of strict obedience to their teachings. Since the founding of the Relief Society, the presidency of the society has been favored in having frequent opportunities to meet with the presiding prophet-president of the Church and to receive his inspired counsel and direction. This was true in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who, according to the Relief Society records, met often with the Relief Society sisters in Nauvoo, giving them instruction and encouragement, confiding in them, and blessing them. The minutes of the first meeting record the Prophet as saying, "I gave much instruction, read in the New Testament and Book of Doctrine and Covenants" (<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>4:552).<br><br>This same attention to Relief Society has been given by the prophet-presidents during the days I have served as Relief Society president. It has been my unusual and blessed privilege to serve as president of Relief Society under five prophet-presidents. I was called to office by President Heber J. Grant. I later served under President George Albert Smith, then President David O. McKay, then President Joseph Fielding Smith, and presently under President Harold B. Lee. I bear witness to you that I know each was divinely ordained for his great and responsible calling. Each one, I am confident, was among the noble and great spirits which the Lord showed unto Abraham, who were chosen before the world was, and was chosen for his great and responsible earthly mission. As I have met with each in council regarding the affairs of Relief Society and matters pertaining to women generally, I have been awed by the depth of insight and understanding, I have marveled at the foresight and the wisdom of counsel, and I have been blessed by the patience and the tenderness of each, as he has directed the course to be pursued by Relief Society. I have heard each speak of the future with prophetic vision, and I have seen the fulfillment of his words.<br><br>This does not mean that these five prophets with whom I have had close association were alike as men. On the contrary, they differed in personality, in their native endowments, in their approach to building the kingdom, and in their methods of dealing with the work and dealing with those over whom they presided.<br><br>As I consider the men and the needs of the Church and of the world during the time of the presidency of each, I feel confident that each was prepared and peculiarly suited to preside over the Church at the exact period of his calling.<br><br>Although I could relate many great and divinely inspired prophecies, as well as highly significant counsel pertaining to the work of the women of the Church given by each of these prophets-presidents, time does not allow for this. I will pass on to you, however, bits of wisdom--given informally, in most instances--that have served me well and which may also serve you and give to you some insight into the natures of these God-ordained Church leaders.<br><h2><b>Heber J. Grant</b></h2><br>Prior to being made Relief Society president, I was for eight years editor of the<i>Relief Society Magazine.</i>During this period I became quite well acquainted with President Heber J. Grant, who exercised close, watchful care over the contents of all of the Church publications. If an issue appeared containing something displeasing to him, particularly as it related to Church doctrine, you may be sure the editors would hear from him. He was quick in his judgments, forthright, but always right in counseling us. He admonished us always to make certain that articles dealing with Church doctrine were in harmony with interpretations given by the presidents of the Church. He advised us to be precise in quoting the scriptures or the words of the Brethren, and always to give source references. He warned us repeatedly against publishing accounts of dreams of individuals which they regarded as spiritual manifestations, almost personal revelations. Said President Grant to me at one time with regard to these, "It is all right to encourage the people to read the revelations, but let them be the revelations recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants."<br><br>An oft-repeated bit of wisdom from President Grant which has served me very well is this: "Discouragement is one of the sharpest tools in the hands of Satan to weaken a person and open the way for the devil to gain power over him. Avoid discouragement as you would avoid a plague."<br><h2><b>George Albert Smith</b></h2><br>President George Albert Smith, the next president, was a man who taught and practiced brotherhood. He was very approachable. Many times he would drop into my office and say he had just come to visit, and we would visit together for several moments. There was an occasion, during the last illness of President Smith, when I was deeply impressed with his words. I was driving home after a busy day at the office and passed his place of residence. I knew he was seriously ill. Nonetheless, I felt prompted to stop and, without going into the house, to ask his nurse to express to him the love and concern of the women of the Church for his well-being and to assure him that we were praying for him. The nurse kindly asked me to wait a moment while she conveyed the message. Returning to the door, she said the President wished me to come in, as he wanted to talk with me.<br><br>After a short period of time, the nurse assisted the President in to the living room and seated him, well wrapped, in an easy chair. He thanked me for the support the women of the Church had always given him as president. He said he knew that his earth life was nearing its end, that he was unafraid of death because he knew he understood it. One thing he sorrowed over, however, he said, was the fact that he might not be spared long enough to dedicate the Los Angeles Temple . This had been a long-time dream. He said he knew it was just a human and selfish desire. And then he spoke of selfishness and said how important it was that we learn to overcome it. Then, with conviction, he said that he knew that in the Lord's own due time the Los Angeles Temple would be dedicated, and it would be dedicated by a prophet of God, one of the Lord's choosing, even though it appeared that he would not be that one. He said the work of the Church goes on as the Lord desires and will do so until all is accomplished. He affirmed, as the Lord's plan for his children, the law that each must go on to another sphere of service as his individual earthly mission is completed, that everyone should accept release from earth life with joy if he has been obedient to God's commandments. He reiterated that the Church would endure and would always have a prophet at its head.<br><br>Thus testified a dying prophet, whose earthly mission closed in a few short days. This was a deeply moving experience for me.<br><h2><b>David O. McKay</b></h2><br>Now of President McKay. An unusual experience with President McKay comes to mind in which you may be interested. One day I received a wire from President John F. Kennedy, inviting me to attend a meeting at the White House the following week, to which the presidents of women's organizations of the United States, having membership of 100,000 or more, were invited. I didn't wish to attend. I was of the opinion the matter to be discussed was controversial legislation. I felt I might be called upon to speak, and I preferred not to be involved. I knew, however, that I should refer the matter to President McKay before sending my regrets. I took the wire to the President, who read it, and then, to my surprise, he repeated the twelfth Article of Faith: "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law." Concluding this, he said, "In view of this belief, I don't see how you can refuse to honor the request of the president of the United States, if it is at all possible for you to go." Of course I agreed to attend the meeting. I then explained my reason for hesitating, saying what I thought would be the nature of the meeting, and inquired if the President had counsel for me. To this he replied, "Indeed I have. Remember, you do not speak for the Church. This is my role. You speak only for Relief Society." Then, with a twinkle in his eye, he said, "We would expect, of course, that what you say would be in harmony with Church views, insofar as you know them."<br><br>With the interview closed, I rose to leave the room. The President, as was his custom, walked with me toward the door. In leaving, I once again said, "President McKay, are you sure you have no further counsel for me?"<br><br>With great understanding for my feelings he replied, "Yes, I do have further counsel. Go in peace and learn to trust in the Lord."<br><br>I went in peace, and I trusted in the Lord, and I was called on to speak, as I expected. And I attest that I was guided in my actions and directed in my speech during that meeting.<br><h2><b>Joseph Fielding Smith</b></h2><br>Our next president, President Joseph Fielding Smith, a man of tenderness and great love for the people, evidenced at all times a depth of understanding of the work of the women of the Church, and he passed this on to the Relief Society presidency countless times and in many ways, opening our vision and directing our ways. An oft-repeated statement, relative to this, which is recorded in one of President Smith's Relief Society conference addresses is as follows: "Relief Society was revealed to the Church as a fundamental part of the Gospel."<br><h2><b>Harold B. Lee</b></h2><br>It is my firm conviction that our present president-prophet, President Harold B. Lee, is endowed with all of the graces, gifts, and powers needed to conduct the affairs of a fast-growing and expanding church in a perilous period of time. He continually evidences great concern for the home and family life of the people. He also evidences warm friendship and concern for the youth of the Church. He never spares himself when the well being of a Church member seems to require his service. His life is the embodiment of his belief that "the Church hath need of every one." Some thirty-five years ago, the Relief Society presidency met weekly with the brethren of the Church Welfare Committee, as this program was in the course of development. President Lee, at the time, was a member of the Council of the Twelve and one of the leading men in the development of the program. With foresight and inspired wisdom beyond our comprehension, he would voice viewpoints and influence decisions related to the future of the welfare program that seemed so remote, indeed so far outside the realm of fulfillment, as to be beyond our understanding. Yet today we see these views firmly incorporated in the Church Welfare Services program, as among its cardinal principles, and his prophetic judgments are an essential part of the Church Welfare Services programs and procedures today.<br><br>Sister Florence Jacobsen, former president of the YWMIA, and I visited with President and Sister Lee one day, three or four years ago, in their hotel room in New York City. President Lee spoke of his concern for the youth of the Church and his feeling that the Church needed to do more for them, and in a better way. As he talked, we became aware that he envisioned efforts that could affect long-established patterns, some of them related to the auxiliaries over which we were presiding. Leaving him, we both affirmed our conviction that we had listened to prophetic utterances. Today we see the fulfillment of his inspired prophecy in the new programs and patterns for youth that are being set into action.<br><br>One of the treasured blessings of my life is the personal friendship President Lee has extended to me.<br><h2><b>The Prophets Need Our Obedience</b></h2><br>Thus I speak of prophets I have known personally. We may speak with equal conviction of the greatness of all of the prophet-presidents who preceded them in this dispensation. Church history is replete with convincing evidence of this truth. I cite one example which relates closely to President Lee's prophetic wisdom as it relates to the youth of the Church. From Gospel Doctrine, I quote the words of President Joseph F. Smith, spoken during April Conference of the Church, sixty-six or sixty-seven years ago:<br><br><i>I expect to see the day when this organization</i>[the Relief Society]<i>will be one of the most perfect, the most efficient and effective organizations for good in the Church. But that day will be when we shall have women who are not only imbued with the spirit of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and with the testimony of Christ in their hearts, but also with youth, vigor, and intelligence, to enable them to discharge the great duties and responsibilities that rest upon them. We want the young women, the intelligent women, women of faith, of courage and of purity, to be associated with the Relief Societies of the various stakes and wards of Zion. We want them to take hold of this work with vigor, with intelligence, and unitedly, for the building up of Zion and the instruction of women and their duties--domestic duties, public duties, and every duty that may devolve upon them.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, 3rd ed., p. 484]<br><br><i>This</i>[the Relief Society]<i>is an organization that was established by the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is, therefore, the oldest auxiliary of the Church, and it is of the first importance. It has not only to deal with the necessities of the poor, the sick, and the needy, but a part of its duty--and the larger part to--is to look after the spiritual welfare and salvation of the mothers and the daughters of Zion; to see that none is neglected, but that all are guarded against misfortune, calamity, the powers of darkness, and the evils that threaten them in the world. It is the duty of the Relief Societies to look after the spiritual welfare of themselves and all female members of the Church.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, 3rd ed., p. 482]<br><br>Are we not justified in feeling that these are prophetic words, along with those of President Lee, that are being fulfilled today in the announcement made at the recent general Church conference, in relation to the Melchizedek Priesthood MIA and the assignment of all single females eighteen years of age and over to Relief Society?<br><br>Again, I attest that the great prophets under whose direction I have worked as president of Relief Society have counseled me with prophetic vision relative to the work of Relief Society. In addition, I am convincingly impressed that the prophet-presidents who preceded them were chosen of the Lord. The world has always needed prophets--never more, I believe, than today. Blessed are we indeed to have the restored gospel with a prophet to lead us in these troublesome times.<br><br>We must remember, however, that just as we need prophets, so the prophets need us. They need our faith, our prayers, our labors, our sensitivity to the demands made upon them. They need our obedience to their teachings. The Prophet Joseph Smith appealed to the sisters in Nauvoo: "Your prayers in my behalf shall avail much: let them not cease to ascent to God continually in my behalf" (<i>Documentary History of the Church,</i>5:141). Even as that first prophet-president of this dispensation needed this support from his people, so does he who presides over the Church today as our prophet and president. And may we give to him this support, I sincerely pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Belle S.

<h1>phasis on Priesthood - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My faith in youth is always renewed when I have the privilege of meeting with the youth of Zion.<br><br>I would like to talk to you today about a subject that makes no headlines in the media or gets much attention elsewhere. It is not a popular subject for speakers. In the gospel menu it would probably be the meat and potatoes instead of the exotic salads and other types of foods. I suppose for that reason it has normally been avoided as a subject for speakers. Yet this movement is the single most important event that has occurred in recent Church history. I speak of the present emphasis on the basic priesthood principles--the assignment of more specific priesthood duties to brethren, the reactivation of men who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, the motivation of men to worthily receive it, and the placing on women of more responsibility than ever before to assist the priesthood. Both the method and the objective of this great movement are to strengthen the home. Few things can strengthen the home as much as the achievement of this objective. This emphasis is a direct frontal attack on the influences that would destroy the home.<br><br>On all sides we hear concern expressed regarding problems that start in the home. The corollary to that, obviously, is to resolve them in the home. In the world we are seldom told to do that; even less frequently are we told<i>how</i>to solve these problems. When we shall achieve the purposes of the present priesthood emphasis we shall have found the way to resolve the majority of these problems. The Lord, I believe, has comprehended this from the beginning, and I think we are just gradually beginning to learn it.<br><h2><b>The Priesthood and Its Purpose</b></h2><br>This priesthood emphasis, identified with the priesthood correlation program, is not entirely new to the Church, but seldom has it had the long-range planning and consideration it has had in recent times. The careful planning culminated in the announcement last year of greater emphasis on the priesthood. (I wish I could think of a better word to use, but it is not a program--it is not a system, and it is not a procedure. It is an<i>emphasis</i>on the priesthood.) Specifically, it is to reactivate elders and motivate prospective elders to become elders (these are the former Aaronic Priesthood adult brethren over the age of nineteen). It places greater emphasis upon the priesthood responsibility of all who bear the priesthood. Perhaps some background may help you to understand the priesthood and its purpose.<br><br>Attempting to define the priesthood, John Taylor said:<br><br><i>It is the</i>government of God,<i>whether on the earth or in the heavens, for it is by that</i>power,<i>agency, or principle that all things are governed on the earth and in the heavens, and by that power that all things are upheld and sustained. It governs</i>all<i>things--it directs all things--it sustains all things--and has to do with all things that God and truth are associated with. It is the</i>power<i>of God delegated to intelligences in the heavens and to man on the earth.</i>[John Taylor in<i>Millennial Star</i>, 9:321, quoted in John A. Widtsoe,<i>Priesthood and Church Government</i>, p. 32; emphasis added]<br><br>To clarify the difference between priesthood and offices in the priesthood, President Joseph F. Smith said:<br><br><i>There is no</i>office<i>growing out of this Priesthood that is or can be grater than the Priesthood itself. It is from the Priesthood that the office derives its authority and power. No office gives auhority to the Priesthood. No office adds to the power of the Priesthood. But all offices in the Church derive their power, their virtue, their authority, from the Priesthood. If our brethren would get this principle thoroughly established in their minds, there would be less misunderstanding in relation to the functions of government in the Church than there is.</i>[<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, p. 14; emphasis added]<br><br>Five years after the Church was organized with the first and second elders, the Lord gave a significant revelation on priesthood. He said, speaking of the presiding quorums of his Church and setting forth the order of the priesthood in the government of the kingdom of God:<br><br><i>Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:22]<br><br>Next is set forth the special calling of the Twelve:<br><br><i>The twelve traveling counselors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world--thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</i><br><br><i>And they form a quorum, equal in authority and power to the three presidents previously mentioned</i>[equal, that is, when there exists no First Presidency]. [D&amp;amp;C 107:23–24]<br><br>Next is set forth the unique calling of the Seventy, meaning the First Council of the Seventy:<br><br><i>The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world--thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:25]<br><br>Others have been called as General Authorities and assist the presiding brethren:<br><br><i>Whereas other officers of the church, who belong not unto the Twelve, neither to the Seventy, are not under the responsibility to travel among all nations, but are to travel as their circumstances shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high and responsible offices in the church.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:98]<br><br>In other important priesthood revelations--sections 20, 42, 84, and 121--and in instructions from the Brethren today, the Lord has further explained the duties of the various offices of the priesthood. The presiding function of high priests is set forth thus:<br><br><i>High priests after the order of the Melchizedek Priesthood have a right to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the presidency, in administering spiritual things, and also in the office of an elder, priest . . . , teacher, deacon, and member.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:10]<br><br>In addition, today, high priests are to sponsor genealogical research and temple attendance. There are just three great things that this church and the people are to do. One is to save the dead; the other is to perfect the Saints; and the other is to do missionary work--to declare the message of the restoration to all the world. These three major things have been assigned to the three major offices in the Melchizedek Priesthood. High priests have genealogical research and temple attendance. The elders' responsibility is set forth:<br><br><i>An elder has a right to officiate in his stead when the high priest is not present.</i><br><br><i>The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things, agreeable to the covenants and commandments of the church; and they have a right to officiate in all these offices of the church when there are no higher authorities present.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:11–12]<br><br>Today elders have the major assignment to care for the temporal and spiritual welfare of each elder and prospective elder and their families. You may get some idea of the magnitude of their responsibility when you understand that the number of high priests and seventies is less than half the number of elders in a normal stake of Zion. Then when you add the prospective elders to their responsibility, their responsibility doubles again. This is the magnitude of their service.<br><br>The seventies have a special assignment to motivate missionary work through the priesthood correlation program of the Church: "And these seventy are to be traveling ministers, unto the Gentiles first and also unto the Jews" (D&amp;amp;C 107:97).<br><br>The Aaronic Priesthood is to administer in temporal things and is a "preparatory priesthood."<br><h2><b>"Let Every Man Learn His Duty"</b></h2><br>After delineating the duties of each office, the Lord declared: "Therefore, let every man stand in his own office, and labor in his own calling . . . that the system may be kept perfect" (D&amp;amp;C 84:109–10). And he said, to conclude the 107th section:<br><br><i>Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.</i><br><br><i>He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 107:99–100]<br><br>When we thoroughly understand our priesthood duties and act in them "in all diligence," we shall then perform a mighty work. We are now involved in a way, the like of which I think this church has never seen before, with this particular emphasis. And we are meeting with success. Each week we go out to a conference and find stakes that are accomplishing only a little and stakes that, when they catch the vision and understanding, are accomplishing a tremendous amount. We shall likewise fulfill the prediction of President Joseph F. Smith, when we act in all diligence. He said:<br><br><i>We expect to see the day, if we live long enough, . . . when every council of the Priesthood in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will understand its duty, will assume its own responsibility, . . . to the uttermost, according to the intelligence and ability possessed by it. When that day shall come, there will not be so much necessity for work that is now being done by the auxiliary organizations, because it will be done by the regular quorums of the Priesthood. The Lord designed and comprehended it from the beginning, and He has made provision in the Church whereby every need may be met and satisfied through the regular organizations of the Priesthood.</i>[<i>Conference Report</i>, April 1906, p. 3]<br><br>This prophecy had a major fulfillment last November, when the MIA was made an arm of the priesthood.<br><h2><b>The Man Must Lead His Family</b></h2><br>The most important outcome of "acting in our calling in all diligence" is that we shall strengthen the home. May I suggest two of the significant implications as a man begins to magnify his priesthood. First, he will assume his rightful role as the head and spiritual leader in his home. Second, he will willingly perform outside his home that service required to magnify his office in the priesthood, that is, home teaching or service in some priesthood or auxiliary capacity. The Church has provided the means whereby the father may become the spiritual leader of the home by regularly holding a family home evening. The fulfillment of this calling tremendously magnifies a father and puts things in proper perspective--something every home needs, and something every father needs. His service outside the home affords him invaluable experience and properly magnifies him in the eyes of his fellowmen; such esteem from others every man also needs.<br><br>The man ought to be the spiritual leader of the home. When a man does not exercise the priesthood to the extent he is authorized to do so, and when he fails to act as the spiritual leader in his home, someone else does. While this condition may exist until he becomes the spiritual leader, "from the beginning it was not so."<br><br>Orson Hyde expresses a thought-provoking assertion:<br><br><i>I will here venture the assertion, that no man can be exalted to a celestial glory in the kingdom of God whose wife rules over him; and as the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord, it follows as a matter of course, that the woman who rules over her husband, thereby deprives herself of a celestial glory.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 4:258]<br><br>Anyone who has been through the temple should understand the proper role of the husband and the wife and consent to its being that way. The way to solve juvenile delinquency as well as a host of other social problems is to put father at the head of the family. The mother cannot put the father in his proper place; if she could, then she could remove him if occasion required. The man must step forward and assume his rightful role. He is to be the breadwinner. He is to take the lead. His role should be well understood by his children as well. In Ephesians we read some wise counsel:<br><br><i>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</i><br><br><i>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</i><br><br><i>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</i><br><br><i>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.</i>[Ephesians 5:22–25]<br><br>Our understanding of the role of husband and wife in an ideal home may not be sustained by some modern sociological concepts. Our understanding comes from revelations in both ancient and modern days.<br><br>There is widespread misunderstanding today concerning the role of father and mother and children. The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that the destiny of the family is to live together as a family unit in the celestial glory. To understand their proper roles, one must understand the eternal nature of man's life, his premortal existence, life's purpose now, and his future destiny.<br><br>The man is the head of the home. He is to preside and administer its affairs, not in a dictatorial or authoritarian manner, but "by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekeness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge" (D&amp;amp;C 121:41–42). When he magnifies his office in the priesthood, he will begin to do this better.<br><h2><b>The Woman's Exalted Role</b></h2><br>President Reuben Clark, Jr., one of the Lord's noble servants, defined woman's role in eternal perspective. Speaking of Eve, he spoke of all women:<br><br><i>So came Eve, an helpmeet to the priesthood mission of Adam--Eve, the last created being in the . . . world. . . . Adam took her in her purity, . . . radiant and divinely fair, into the Garden he had dressed and kept for her, into the bridal home he had built, into the Garden that from then till now has been the symbol of heaven on earth, there to begin together their earthly life, that was finally to bring opportunity . . . to the untold myriads of spirits then waiting for the mortal tabernacles these two were to make it possible for them to possess.</i><br><br><i>. . . So Eve came . . . to be a creator of bodies . . . that God's design and the great plan might meet fruition.</i><br><br><i>This was her calling. . . .</i><br><br><i>From that day, . . . the greatest glory of true womanhood has been motherhood.</i><br><br><i>What a miracle is motherhood; how nearly infinite is mother. She fashions in her womb the most complex structure known to man. . . .</i><br><br><i>This is wife's and mother's task and opportunity; and did she fail . . . then the great plan would fail and God's purposes would come to naught. . . . This must never change. . . .</i><br><br><i>But the full glory of motherhood is not yet reached when her child comes forth into this world of trial. . . . She feeds not only, but clothes it. She cares for it by day and watches over it by night. . . . She gently leads its faltering steps, till it walks alone. . . .</i><br><br><i>Thus to the full stature of manhood and womanhood, mother guides, instructs, directs . . . the soul for which she built the earthly home, in its march onward to exaltation. God gives the soul its destiny, but mother leads it along the way.</i><br><br><i>When the souls shall return to the presence of the Father of all, the worthy mothers will be there to welcome their worthy children.</i>[<i>Immortality and Eternal Life</i>, 2:24–28]<br><br>Wives and mothers do what men cannot do. Men will bow in reverence and in love before mothers who perform this great, this marvelous service.<br><br>Contrast this view of woman with the current prattle that demeans motherhood and her exalted role, that even condones abortion and its attendant evils, that sets aside the role God gave to her. It would be hard to imagine a more exalted role of woman and her place in the eternal plan than is held and taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And yet there are some within and without the Church who would change it. I admonish you today, both young and old, to read and listen and pray, to know the will of the Lord in this important matter, for it holds the key to your eternal happiness and destiny. The family is a divine institution. The first family unit was organized by our Heavenly Father:<br><br><i>And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</i><br><br><i>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</i>[Genesis 2:18, 24]<br><br>The Lord has instructed his children in the basic family relationships:<br><br><i>Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:22]<br><br><i>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</i>[Colossians 3:19]<br><br><i>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</i>[Colossians 3:18]<br><br><i>Thou shalt live together in love.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 42:45]<br><br><i>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</i>[Colossians 3:21]<br><br><i>Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</i>[Colossians 3:20]<br><h2><b>The Home Must Be Filled with Love</b></h2><br>The home is the source of happiness, serenity, and peace. Only in a home filled with unity and love can man or woman find the pure, undiluted heavenly joys. There is no substitute. An expression from one of the early apostles, Orson Pratt, gives us food for thought in his logical reasoning:<br><br><i>Could wicked and malicious beings, who have eradicated every feeling of love from their bosoms, be permitted to propagate their species, the offspring would partake of all the evil, wicked, and malicious nature of their parents. . . . It is for this reason that God will not permit the fallen angels to multiply: It is for this reason that God has ordained marriages for the righteous only: it is for this reason that God will put a final stop to the multiplication of the wicked after this life: it is for this reason that none but those who have kept the celestial law will be permitted to multiply after the resurrection: . . . for they alone are prepared to begat and bring forth offspring whose bodies and spirits, partaking of the nature of the parents, are pure and lovely, and will manifest, as they increase in years, those heaven-born excellencies so necessary to lead them to happiness and eternal life.</i>[Orson Pratt,<i>The Seer</i>, pp. 156–57, quoted in Rodney Turner,<i>Woman and the Priesthood</i>, p. 147;<i>cf. Journal of Discourses</i>, 13:186]<br><br>In view of the wise counsel through revelation that we have received, why live the wrong way now? Why be guided by the philosophies of men in eternal living? Why confuse the roles of husband and wife and put in jeopardy the lives of your children?<br><br>Why should I talk about this matter to you young people this morning? You are not yet married. If this university fulfills its purpose, however, you soon will be. Now is the time to understand your place in life. Now is the time to prepare for your proper role in the Lord's plan. Now is the time to plan an enduring family unit, before you make any mistakes. If you are not yet married, these relationships still are important and one day will ultimately apply to every worthy soul.<br><br>Do you young ladies see and understand what this means in eternal perspective? When you marry, and if you marry, do you see why it ought to be to an active Latter-day Saint man who honors the priesthood? Do you young men see the importance of your present companionships being conducted purely and properly to prepare you to worthily enter the temple of the Lord to eternalize the family unit? Brigham Young said:<br><br><i>There is not a young man in our community who would not be willing to travel from here to England to be married right, if he understood things as they are; there is not a young woman in our community, who loves the gospel and wishes its blessings, that would be married in any other way; they would live unmarried until they could be married as they should be, if they lived until they were as old as Sarah before she had Isaac born to her.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 11:118]<br><br>Do you see, in eternal perspective, the answer to such questions as personal purity, parenthood, temple marriage, the priesthood? We have limited this consideration of the far-reaching effects of the present emphasis on priesthood to only two implications: the effect it can have on a father and mother, and on the home. That effect is tremendous.<br><br>President Harold B. Lee has said:<br><br><i>Now, you husbands, remember that the most important of the Lord's work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home. Home teaching, bishopric's work, and other Church duties are all important, but the most important work is within the walls of your home.</i>[From the published text of a 1973 motion picture,<i>Strengthening the Home</i>, p. 7]<br><br>Thank the Lord for revelation to his servants today. Living prophets give counsel to a living church. If you will listen and heed the counsel, you will live and live eternally. This counsel establishes your priorities. It puts things in proper perspective.<br><br>I bear you my humble witness that we do have the priesthood in this church. It has been given to us by angelic messengers who came from the presence of the Lord with it. We have a great emphasis being given to it in the Church today. May you understand it, be a part of it, and see its far-reaching implications for your well-being and eternal happiness, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>A.

<h1>ls for Success - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, President Wilkinson, members of the faculty, brothers and sisters:<br><br>I appreciate the invitation to come and speak to you this morning. The last time I spoke to a devotional assembly at BYU was over fifty years ago, when I was a student. I remember T. Earl Pardoe was my public speaking instructor, and he called us all together and gave us thirty minutes to prepare our talks. I froze; I couldn't say a word when I got up to speak. That was my last experience here.<br><br>I won't freeze this morning, but I do feel extremely humble in this new calling that I have. I'm not quite used to it; I have many things to learn; I'm running hard to try to get on top of my job. I feel somewhat like the farmer who moved to the city and was put on the school board. At the first meeting, someone got up and made a motion that they buy a new chandelier, and he immediately got up and opposed it. He said, "First of all, I can't spell it. Next, I don't know what it is. What we really should spend our money for around here is something that would give us more light."<br><br>This morning I'd like to talk about some of the things that I think are essential for success. Many different terms are used to define success. Some feel it means acquiring money, while others feel the gaining of knowledge is most important of all. The dictionary defines success as the favorable termination of a venture. Another definition is the obtaining of wealth, favor, or eminence. Some say success is to be happy in your work and in your family homelife. Perhaps this is the best definition of all. But when you analyze what is necessary to achieve such a lofty goal, you must agree that some degree of financial success is necessary if we're to have a happy homelife. We must provide shelter, food, and clothing for ourselves and members of the family, as well as providing for education, missions, and care in time of illness. Yes, regardless of the field we choose, our first and most important duty is to provide for our family. These things all take money, and more now than ever before. Therefore, I maintain that regardless of the field we choose, we must also give a great deal of thought and effort into the making of money and in acquiring the skills of good money management. The things necessary for success in money matters are about the same as for success in any other field. Whether we want to be a doctor, lawyer, banker, educator, or scientist, it takes about the same attributes to gain success. Here are a few of them which I think are essential.<br><h2><b>Determination</b></h2><br>Determination is the first on the list. Not many have it; yet it can be acquired by anyone who is willing to pay the price of hard work.<br><h2><b>Action</b></h2><br>Charles F. Kettering, the great inventor, laid great stress on action. He once made this statement: "You will never stub your toe standing still. The faster you move the more chance there is of stubbing your toe, but the more chance you have of getting somewhere." A father once wrote to his son who was about to finish college and made this worthwhile statement: "With all thy getting, get going." Be on the march.<br><br>Kettering also told a group of his subordinates, "Think about big things and don't sweat the small stuff." Many times we get so cluttered with small things that we don't have the time or energy for the bigger or more important things. Another way of saying "Don't sweat the small stuff" is "Don't get thickly involved in thin things." Evaluate your time--establish priorities--and use it wisely. It's the most important thing you possess. Things that matter most should not be left to the mercy of things that matter the least.<br><h2><b>Good Money Management</b></h2><br>Good money management is essential to success. There are many things pertaining to it, and I'll mention only a few of them. First, always pay your tithing. The Lord made a great promise as recorded in Malachi 3:10:<br><br><i>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i><br><br>Some say they can't afford to pay tithing. I say you can't afford not to pay tithing so as to keep yourself eligible for these great blessings. "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise" (D&amp;amp;C 82:10).<br><br>After paying the Lord his share, pay yourself something off the top. Save something out of every dollar you earn. It may be small in the beginning; add to it as you can. This forms a good foundation on which to build.<br><br>Then be wise how you spend the rest of your money. We're all being encouraged in this economy we live in today to buy now and pay later. It sounds easy and glamorous to surround yourself with all the things you'd like to have before they're earned, but it can get you into trouble. Overnight you can find yourself in debt in excess of your ability to meet your obligations, and this is where trouble starts. I officiated at hundreds of marriages in the Salt Lake Temple, and to every couple that I married I gave advice on money management. I always told them, "In addition to the things that I've already mentioned, instead of buy now and pay later, save now and buy later. You save a tremendous charge for interest; in addition you keep yourself out of trouble."<br><h2><b>Adherence to Principles</b></h2><br>Sticking to your principles will help you to succeed. I've been asked on numerous occasions during my fifty years in business whether I found it necessary to violate my principles in order to gain success. And the answer is no. Men will respect you for adhering to that which you believe. On the other hand, we shouldn't try to force our beliefs on others. The Lord intended that each of us should have his free agency, and it is not our prerogative to be critical of or to judge others who do not believe as we believe.<br><h2><b>Endurance</b></h2><br>Endurance is important. Stay with it, no matter how hard it may be. Stick-to-it-iveness is another way of expressing endurance. Don't give up when the going gets tough. Often we're tempted to quit when success may be just around the corner. The world is not looking for quitters but for men who will stick to the job, no matter how tough it may be. A person who gives up easily will never gain success.<br><br>There are bound to be times when we're disappointed, but we should never be discouraged. Discouragement is a tool of the devil. I give you the admonition of my wife, which she's given to me on many occasions throughout our fifty years of married life: "Do the very best you can. Angels can do no better." There are times, after having done everything we can, we have to leave it in the hands of the Lord. Heber J. Grant told us how to endure to the end when he made this statement: "Let us do the will of our Father in heaven today. We will then be prepared for the duties of tomorrow and for the eternities to come."<br><h2><b>Good Work Habits</b></h2><br>Good work habits are essential to success. This applies to everything we do--from earning a living to the work we do at home, at school, or in church. A boy or a girl who is lazy in school will be a lazy missionary and a lazy worker and has little chance of success. One can attain good work habits only by getting at the work to be done at the time it needs to be done, applying reasonable diligence, and taking pride in good performance. The habit of being prompt and accurate in all that we do is essential to good work habits. Forty hours a week won't bring success. I'd like to quote from President David O. McKay, as given in one of his conference talks not long before he died:<br><br><i>Within my experience there has never been a time when the doctrine of individual initiative and individual effort should be more generally taught and more earnestly put into effect than at the present day. Too many are claiming that the world owes them a living and are sitting effortlessly by, expecting the world to throw its luxuries into their passive laps. Too late they will learn that the earth rewards richly only the strenuous strugglers.</i><br><br>I love these words. They mean willingness to work and sacrifice and plan as may be necessary to achieve our goals.<br><h2><b>Personal Appearance</b></h2><br>Good grooming is important to all of us throughout our entire lives. This doesn't mean that we need to be dressed up in our Sunday best all the time. We can wear clothes that fit the occasion. Personal cleanliness is likewise essential to good grooming. It's been my experience, through long years in business, that the man who really wants to get ahead and be a leader is careful about and uses good taste in his personal appearance.<br><h2><b>Honesty</b></h2><br>Honesty is one of the most important attributes a person can have. Men and women who can be trusted are always in demand. Our Heavenly Father deemed this so important that he made it one of the Ten Commandments: "Thou shalt not steal." If we're t o be honest we must not only refrain from stealing money and goods from our employer or others, but we must do a good day's work for a day's pay. When one shirks on the job, he is stealing time from his employer. This is nearly as bad as stealing money or merchandise. If a person wastes thirty minutes a day, it's equal to three and a half workweeks each year. Coffee breaks and idleness on the job are some of the reasons we're finding it difficult in this country to compete in world markets. If our labor force would produce as it should and is capable of doing, we would compete with any and all nations and still maintain the highest standard of living in the world.<br><br>Honesty also includes keeping one's word or contract. It's important to pay your obligations on due dates, or make prior arrangements with your creditors if you are unable to do so. Live within your income. To consistently spend more than you earn only makes it that much more difficult to avoid temptation. If we're honest in our small dealings, we acquire the habit, and we'll then find it will be easier to be honest in handling large transactions. Be honest with yourself in all things, and you cannot help but be honest with others. Shakespeare wrote in<i>Hamlet</i>:<br><br><i>To thine own self be true,</i><br><i>And it must follow, as the night the day,</i><br><i>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</i><br><h2><b>Friends and Associates</b></h2><br>I admonish you to use care in selecting your friends and associates. The influence of our friends is great indeed. The actions and ideals of those with whom we associate cannot help but have a profound influence on our lives and actions for either good or evil. Learn to walk in the company of good people. Shun evil. Stay out of the devil's territory.<br><h2><b>Acquisition of Knowledge</b></h2><br>Gaining knowledge should, of course, be uppermost in our minds and must be part of any goals that we set. Joseph Smith has told us under inspiration that "the glory of God is intelligence" (D&amp;amp;C 93:36).<br><br><i>Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.</i><br><br><i>And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 130:18–19]<br><br>These words were given to us by our first Prophet through inspiration from the Lord.<br><br>Socrates said, "The learning and knowledge that we have is at the most but little compared with that of which we are ignorant." Aristotle said, "Learning is an ornament in prosperity, a refuge in adversity, and a provision in old age." You who are here today are to be congratulated on your desire and effort to gain knowledge. Guard this privilege and opportunity, and let nothing interfere with your goal to obtain learning about everything on the face of the earth and in the heavens.<br><h2><b>Setting Goals</b></h2><br>Setting goals is important for success in any field. In my father's day, business organizations used to take an inventory once a year to help them analyze their position and make plans for the future. In my day we used to do it every three months. Today, because of the electronic age, businesses keep a perpetual inventory. They must be kept right up to date on every thing pertaining to the business, so that management can tell where they've been and where they now are and can set their goals for the future. If it's important for business to have an up-to-date analysis, how much more important it is for us, as individuals, to constantly analyze our own situation. Where have we been? Where are we now? And where are we going? In this modern and rapid-moving age we now live in, it isn't good enough to do this just once a year or once a quarter. If we are to live righteous lives and accomplish the purposes of our creation, then we must constantly review our past actions and our present status and set goals for the future, without which we cannot hope to reach our objectives in this life.<br><br>Each of us has his own built-in electronic system. I think the best one that's ever been created is right here [in one's head]. It not only remembers things that have happened, but it records our thoughts. We have all the equipment necessary, if we just make good use of it. I firmly believe you can do what you want to do and become what you want to become in this life. All you need to do is set your goals and then work and sacrifice to the extent necessary to reach your objectives. It is worth the effort; it can be done. Men and women who enter into a partnership with God, who live his commandments, and who are "strenuous strugglers" will be successful.<br><br>Plato, in speaking to youth, said, "Take charge of your lives. You can do with them what you will." And these are the words of our late President Stephen L. Richards:<br><br><i>So I say to my young friends everywhere, enjoy the happy days of youth. Live life joyously, beautifully, unmarred by ugliness of sin. Show to the world what good, wholesome living will do for the oncoming generations. Demonstrate your gratitude for good homes, loving families, and great opportunities.</i><br><h2><b>Church Activity</b></h2><br>Staying close to the Church and taking advantage of our opportunities to learn, develop, and act are very important in this life--and necessary for one to gain salvation, exaltation, and eternal life. The Church provides us with unlimited opportunities for learning and developing ourselves, through priesthood, Sunday School, MIA, seminaries, institutes, sacrament meetings, and other Church meetings. It takes effort on our part to take advantage of these opportunities. No one can give us knowledge or testimony, nor can one buy these treasures. They can be secured only through individual effort. We need to take a few minutes' time each day to study, carefully analyze our position, and set our goals in the right direction so that we can reach our objectives.<br><h2><b>Repentance</b></h2><br>The late Richard L. Evans, member of the Council of the Twelve, made this statement on success and failure:<br><br><i>The moment we close the books on one period, we open them on another and compare our performance with the past. In business we look back and compare costs and production and prices and profits, and no matter how good last year was, there is another year now to consider. We have to keep at it, for life is a process and not a finished product, and there's no moment at which we can say the picture is completed. Likewise, failure never need be final so long as a person can improve his performance. Failure need never be final so long as a person has the spirit of repentance. Neither failure nor success is final so long as we are trying, so long as we have the spirit of improvement and repentance. And if we keep moving, keep working, keep improving, we can hardly help finding the happiness that we so much wish for one another, which is what the Lord God wants for his children, as we want it for our own.</i><br><br>Regardless of the field we choose, we should never forget the admonition of our late President David O. McKay when he cautioned us, "No amount of success can compensate for failure in the home." We would all do well to ask ourselves this question: Are we as individuals making proper plans to gain full potential, or are we drifting along with the tide? It takes no ability to be a drifter. One of the prime purposes of life on this earth is to provide us with opportunities to meet, combat, and overcome evil. Thus we develop character and gain strength, power, and skill as a means of further development throughout the endless ages of eternity.<br><br>All this can be accomplished only when we have problems and meet them head-on with zeal, courage, and determination. Don't ever feel sorry for yourself; few men's lives have not been hindered by obstacles. God intended it to be that way in order to give us opportunity for self-development. In seeking success in any field, always remember the promise the Lord made: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6:33). I'd like to quote the message to youth from President Harold B. Lee, our present prophet, seer, and revelator:<br><br><i>You, our youth today, are among the most illustrious spirits to be born into mortality in any age of the world. Yours is a noble heritage and a wonderful opportunity. Dedicate your lives to a new resolve. Gird yourselves with the armor of righteousness, having as your weapons the shield of faith and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Be guided to fulfill your highest destiny. Be prepared to become leaders in that glorious millennial day when Christ himself will reign as King of kings and Lord of lords.</i><br><h2><b>Leadership</b></h2><br>The Church is faced with a great growth explosion. Thousands of new leaders will be needed to keep up with this growth. There'll be great opportunities for all who are wiling to work and prepare themselves for the great opportunities that are ahead of us. Here are a few things I think you'd like to know about. It took seventy years to get the first 250,000 converts. It now takes approximately two years to get this many new members in the Church. We now have 610 stakes of Zion and approximately 6,000 wards. By 1985 it's estimated that we'll have 1,000 stakes in the Church with 10,000 wards. And with this many wards we'll need 2,500 new bishops every year, to say nothing about stake presidencies, high councils, and all the other workers that are necessary to lead this Church. One of the highest priorities that we have is to train leaders and potential leaders to accept these responsibilities. In the year 2000 it's estimated that we'll have ten million members.<br><h2><b>Acceptance of Church Calls</b></h2><br>Now I'd like to conclude my talk, as I have just a few minutes left. I don't want to go overtime. I'm reminded of one of my colleagues up in Salt Lake who timed himself when he went out to speak at conferences. He told me that he always put a lifesaver in his mouth when he started his talk, and by the time that lifesaver dissolved, he'd be all through and he knew it was time to sit down. He got along fine with that until one day he reached in his pocket and drew out a button. I'm a firm believer in always starting meetings on time and also letting them out on time. I'm sure you favor that too.<br><br>It's been a real pleasure to be with you. I'd like to bear my testimony to you that I know that the gospel is true. The Lord has blessed us abundantly in our lives. This is the little girl sitting on the stand whom I met a little over fifty years ago. I wasn't doing everything that I should be doing at that time, and she told me, "Listen, if you have any interest in marriage, it must be a temple marriage, and you'd better shape up." And I did. And fifty years ago next April 23 we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. She's been an inspiration to me all of my life. She's helped me wherever I needed help all along the way. In my early business career we moved quite often because I was putting in stores in different towns. I think we moved maybe twenty times before we finally got settled in Oakland, California, where we lived for thirty-six years. It's always been our policy in our home to accept calls whenever they come from those in authority. When we receive a call we accept it.<br><br>One Sunday morning our lives were changed. President Tanner called us on the phone. I was away at the time, and when I came in, Dorothy said, "President Tanner would like to speak to you."<br><br>I said to her, "Now, I've received hundreds of calls from Salt Lake City. This one is different. You go pack your bags."<br><br>I knew it was a call to go somewhere--I didn't know where until I got him on the phone. He said, "President Stone, are you willing and able to accept a call that would require your leaving the Bay Area?"<br><br>And in that minute while I said, "Yes, President Tanner, where would you like us to go?" My mind went all over the world except Salt Lake City. But the experience we had in presiding over the great Temple was one of the greatest blessings and joys of our whole lives. Sister Stone was matron in the Temple and we worked sided by side. With the patrons who came and the wonderful workers who were there, we accomplished eight million ordinances in four years' time.<br><br>The Lord has blessed us greatly. I'm very appreciative of the opportunity that I have of sitting at the feet of, and receiving counsel and direction from, President Harold B. Lee and his counselors, and President Kimball, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They give us our direction. We respond as best we can, going anywhere throughout the world that we're asked to go to help build the kingdom of God. I testify to you that I know that Jesus is the Christ, that he is the Son of our Heavenly Father, that he and his Father appeared to Joseph Smith and told him that he (Joseph) would be an instrument in the restoration of the gospel in this dispensation. I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that President Harold B. Lee is a prophet of God, and I so testify to you, leaving my blessings with you this morning, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>O.

<h1>Purpose Is This Waste? - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
I'm delighted to have this opportunity. Every time I come on this great campus a thrill runs through my soul as I mingle with you great young people. Seems like it's always a homecoming too. I see so many of you out there--good Bostonians, good New Yorkers. Isn't it great to have that representation here. I'm sure it influences and sweetens the campus here to have some of that good Eastern blood.<br><br>As I approach this subject today, you may find it to be a mixture of a businessman's approach and a churchman's musings. I think that wherever we find truth it's our responsibility to uphold it and defend it. I'd like to start by just reading a scripture to you that's found in the book of Matthew:<br><br><i>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</i><br><br><i>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</i>[Matthew 26:7–8]<br><br>Now I know in our lives there are times it's difficult to determine whether it's a benefit or a waste, but most times the distinction is clearly evident between the two. In the scripture just quoted, the Savior approved of that which was done and blessed the woman who anointed him. However, to his disciples, seeing that costly anointment, it appeared to be a waste. Today I'd like to talk to you about waste. With our ever increasing population and the depletion of our natural resources, our great hope is to become more efficient in utilizing that which the Lord has given to us and in eliminating the waste so prevalent in our society.<br><br>You see, I'm not very proud of my generation and some of the things that they have done. During the time that our nation has been under the leadership of this generation, I would guess that it's become the most wasteful in all of the world. I just can't believe my eyes sometimes as I read the paper and try to understand our approach to solving the problems that beset our nation today. I was very proud of the generation that I belong to until recent years. They appeared to have made some great contributions to mankind. Then, all of a sudden, they seemed to fall apart. After reaching a peak and becoming the richest and most powerful nation on earth, we appear, as they say in business, to have "topped off." We now find ourselves turning over to your leadership a nation a few ways better but for the most part in a poorer condition than the one which was given to us. I'd like to reminisce for just a few minutes, to see if we can determine what has caused our failures.<br><h2><b>The Depression and the War</b></h2><br>My generation had its beginnings during the great depression. We witnessed the concern of our parents as they worried about supplying us with the basic needs of life. We witnessed the waste of inactive people standing in bread lines or leaning on shovels in WPA projects. I remember marveling, as a young man, at my mother's ability to make things stretch. I guess I had the easiest job on the block when it came to carrying out the garbage cans. The neighbors would always carry out two or three big ones. Ours was a small size, usually only half-full. The great cities would not be having the problems they have today with their garbage if all the residents were as frugal as my mother. Almost everything she processed was either biodegradable or reuseable.<br><br>About the time the great depression showed signs of fading away, our great country was disgraced at Pearl Harbor. We were just the right age to take up arms and go to fight to preserve our freedoms.<br><br>For the next several years, we witnessed firsthand the waste of destruction. We sat on the fantails of troop ships and listened to chaplains prepare us to meet our Maker as they would tell us frankly what the odds were that we would be alive at noon the following day. We were very close to our God; we pleaded to him for strength. How those prayers were answered, to give us strength and a great inner source of faith as we would go over the side and down those long cargo nets into the landing craft which would carry us to a hostile island.<br><br>Then one night a guard came running up the rows of tents where we were sleeping, shouting that he had just heard over the radio the war was over. We literally jumped through our mosquito nets and ran to the one and only radio we had, located in the mess hall. By the time we arrived, the armed forces radio was broadcasting a New York Yankee baseball game. Can you imagine our disappointment to have to listen to a baseball game when such exciting news was about to come forth? We sat glued to the radio all night, but no news came. We even changed stations to see if Tokyo Rose would be good enough to give us the announcement, but she continued on her same theme. It was two days later when we noticed in the harbor shots of tracers being fired into the air, and the big guns trained out to sea set off a fireworks display to announce the end.<br><br>A few days later we were on our way to see the waste and destruction of our efforts. Our ship dropped anchor in Nagasaki harbor and we rushed topside to look at the results of an atomic bomb. Sickened by the sight, our souls were cleansed from the hate which had been built up in our hearts against our enemies during those years of battle. As we saw the destruction of this great city, smelled the stench of the dead, and heard the cries of the orphans, our hearts mellowed and we reached out to help them rebuild that which we had destroyed.<br><h2><b>Materialism</b></h2><br>I must say we were impressed with the initiative of the Japanese. The first day we were in the city, they had set up little stands to sell Japanese fans imprinted with the American flag. I guess they must have been manufacturing them for months, realizing that the end of the war was near, that there would be a new tourist trade coming in in the form of occupation troops.<br><br>I believe this was our finest hour. We worked hard to rebuild the world. We were the richest and most powerful nation on earth. Our currency was the standard of the world. We couldn't work long enough or hard enough to supply the needs of those who desired our services or the goods we could export. The more we helped others, the richer we became. This was our zenith. We were so accomplished that we found ourselves not needing our God quite as much as we did when we were sitting on the fantails of those ships. In fact, we found him getting in our way on occasion. Materialism started to give us more satisfaction than religion. Soon we found ourselves without that same patriotic spirit that had propelled us out of the world to help save it and to build a better place for all mankind. We divided ourselves into special interest groups and were selfish and self-centered. Our chief interest became centered on having a big home, two cars in the garage, campers, trailers, boats, foreign vacations, fancy bars, rich food, etc. We were convinced that there was no end to that which we could produce to supply our never-ending appetites. Waste became a way of life.<br><br>Now let us examine some of the ways that our thinking changed and we started on a new approach as we would attack our problems.<br><h2><b>Dishonesty</b></h2><br>I guess the first area would be that of dishonesty. We found ourselves unable to satisfy our needs fast enough. We looked at our employers and decided we were not getting enough for the efforts we were putting in. We didn't want to work as hard as we had been. We needed more time for TV, longer coffee breaks, extra time during lunch periods to go shopping, and so on. We wanted more for less. When it was not given to us, we decided to find alternative ways to take it. So we slowed down our production; we would take sick leave even though we were not ill. We'd find some excuse to take an extra day or two on vacations. If we felt that we were not being paid enough, we would steal from our employers to make up the difference.<br><br>And the reaction of our employers was most remarkable. They sat in their secluded offices asking the question: "To what purpose is this waste?" Their conclusions were astounding. Rather than seeking to eliminate, they condoned! It required less effort to add a few dollars to the cost of the goods to cover the waste of dishonesty rather than to instill integrity in their employees. After all, we were the biggest and the best in the world. Everyone wanted our goods. A dollar or two on the cost would not affect them that much.<br><br>Our cost of production started to spiral time and time again. One day we were shocked to find that the demand for our goods in foreign markets had slowed down. We were further shocked to find that those nations we had defeated in battle and helped rebuild now had the nerve and the gall to produce products better than ours at a lower cost. Soon our imports exceeded our exports, and rapidly we were no longer the richest nation on earth. West Germany, the nation we had defeated and leveled to the ground and had helped rebuild, now had that honor. The mark and the yen in world money markets were making our currency look rather ridiculous. The Japanese had copied our ways and our big cities and our industrial plants, looked over what we were doing, eliminated the waste that they found in our operations, and were offering our products manufactured in their country at less cost than we could produce them.<br><br>I remember a personal experience in dealing with a Japanese manufacturer. One of the divisions that reported to me when I worked in New York was a large shoe warehouse. We warehoused over a million pair of shoes. We had been purchasing most of them from New England sources until the waste of their operation priced them out of the market. We resolved to try the Japanese market and decided to try with a gym shoe that one of our U.S. manufacturers had been producing for us. We sent an order to Japan to compare the costs. We had a frugal shoe buyer who decided not to send a good pair, but he had a defective one that had a little marking on the heel of the left shoe. The Japanese firm agreed to produce the shoes at much less cost for us, and so the order was placed for 3,000 pairs of gym shoes. When the shoes, all 3,000 pairs, were delivered to us, they were exact copies of the American shoe in every detail, including the flaw on the left heel.<br><h2><b>Pollution</b></h2><br>I think the next area we've had difficulty in is that of the waste of pollution. My generation was productive and even inspired in the field of invention. We saw the immediate needs of the population and satisfied those needs in an impressive fashion. However, our genius may have been premature on many occasions. We forgot, in our excitement, the total effects of these inventions compiled after years of use. Merely from looking at our polluted air and rivers we come to realize that possibly we implemented in haste without looking to the future. My generation gratified those immediate needs through all sorts of mechanical innovations to produce comfort. But in so doing, we forgot and possibly indelibly marked the sweet, quiet, natural comforts of this world that God has placed for us. My son, after coming back to Utah--I'm sure he couldn't have done this in the East--thought it wise to write a little poem on air and pollution. [Lee, will you excuse me while I quote here for a minute? I don't think he knows I have this.]<br><br><i>Air</i><br><br><i>Air comes from a complicated</i><br><i>chemical occurrence</i><br><i>And continues to bless us</i><br><i>with ceaseless abundance.</i><br><i>But what if one day</i><br><i>The air left with rain,</i><br><i>How could we convince it</i><br><i>To come back again?</i><br><i>The air would complain,</i><br><i>"Why,</i><br><i>you creatures must hate me.</i><br><i>There's smoke and smog</i><br><i>As far as you can see,</i><br><i>And people don't care</i><br><i>Enough to stop smoking.</i><br><i>Just one cigarette</i><br><i>Depresses me choking."</i><br><br><i>And nobody stops a moment to ponder</i><br><i>If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.</i><br><i>Up buildings,</i><br><i>down trees,</i><br><i>Air comes with the breeze.</i><br><i>Life is forever</i><br><i>An end?</i><br><i>Oh, never.</i><br><i>Why look at me,</i><br><i>I'm breathing with ease.</i><br><br><i>"There ought to be laws,"</i><br><i>says a lawyer.</i><br><i>"There ought to be ways,"</i><br><i>says a chemist.</i><br><i>"Where are the clean rivers?"</i><br><i>asks Tom Sawyer.</i><br><i>"Why,</i><br><i>the plants are all dying,"</i><br><i>claims a botanist.</i><br><br><i>A clean river formed the Grand Canyon.</i><br><i>Tall trees were chopped by Paul Bunyan.</i><br><i>You and I ignited this war</i><br><i>The moment</i><br><i>we decided to pour</i><br><i>The wastes of the day</i><br><i>On the world</i><br><i>in a reckless way.</i><br><i>Why,</i><br><i>you can't see the sun anymore.</i><br><br><i>And nobody stops a moment to ponder</i><br><i>If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.</i><br><i>Up buildings,</i><br><i>down trees,</i><br><i>Air comes with the breeze.</i><br><i>Life is forever</i><br><i>An end?</i><br><i>Oh, never.</i><br><i>Why look at me,</i><br><i>I'm breathing with ease.</i><br><br><i>I think the whole problem</i><br><i>Stems from the fact</i><br><i>That air is abundant,</i><br><i>Too abundant to lack.</i><br><i>It's always been there</i><br><i>Since the world was created,</i><br><i>But a wholesome-type air</i><br><i>Will soon be outdated.</i><br><br><i>And nobody stops a moment to ponder</i><br><i>If enough air exists in expanses out yonder.</i><br><i>Up buildings,</i><br><i>down trees,</i><br><i>Air comes with the breeze.</i><br><i>Life is forever</i><br><i>An end?</i><br><i>Oh, never.</i><br><i>Why look at me,</i><br><i>I'm breathing with ease.</i><br><br>[Now, Lee, you'd think with all that literary genius that you have you'd get off that plateau you're on in your grade level. He consistently sends home report cards 3.9.]<br><br>When we consider pollution, again we must ask the question: For what purpose is this waste?<br><h2><b>Gifts of the Spirit</b></h2><br>Now I think we must consider the gifts of the Spirit. I'm certain that as serious as the problems of dishonesty, pollution, and waste are, my generation will be condemned more for turning their backs on the faith of their forefathers. How often history has repeated the story that replacing the gifts of the Spirit with the desires of materialism brings only heartache and disappointment. Do you remember in the Book of Mormon the account of the wicked King Noah--how Zeniff, his father, conferred the kingdom on Noah? Then the scripture records that he didn't walk in the ways of his father:<br><br><i>For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</i>[Mosiah 11:2]<br><br>Then he set about to tax the people, and he laid a tax of one-fifth on all that they possessed, their gold, their silver, copper, brass, iron, their fatlings of the flock, and a fifth of their grain. And he brought all this in for the support of himself and those who were living immoral lives with him. And those priests that would murmur against him he cast aside and consecrated new ones in their stead, and he went out and found those that had pride in their hearts to be his priests. And then the scripture records:<br><br><i>Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, by the taxes which king Noah had put on his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity.</i>[Mosiah 11:6]<br><br>Well, Noah's reign lasted about fifteen years before his people turned against him and burned him. Time has a way of catching up on those who refuse to keep the commandments of God and who walk after the desires of their own hearts.<br><br>As serious as pollution of our highways, rivers, lakes, and streams may be, pollution of the mind and spirit is far more detrimental. When this occurs, an individual loses his ability to devise clear ways of solving problems.<br><h2><b>Prepare for the Day of Your Generation</b></h2><br>I have given you the analysis of the rise and fall of the generation to which I belong. We are almost at the end of our leadership reign. Now you prepare for the day of your generation. Your beginnings are not going to be much different from ours. The cycle that we started at the bottom went to the top, appears to have reached its peak, and has started down at a rapid rate. In all probability, you will start close to the bottom again.<br><br>My challenge to you today is not only to develop understanding, knowledge, and expertise in your chosen field, but also to gain an understanding of certain eternal principles that are basic to all positions of good leadership. To follow them will bring about a righteous accomplishment. To violate them will bring only heartache and despair.<br><br>Answer in your own hearts, "For what purpose is this waste?" For what purpose is the waste of dishonesty--of cheating yourselves and those with whom you work with dishonest acts? Or the waste of pollution--of environment and mind? Or denying the gifts of the Spirit? Isn't there one generation or one group of leaders who will be intelligent enough to look at the signs of the past and establish righteous principles that will endure and guide them in the future? I pray to God that you may supply that leadership. I pray that you may have the same righteous desires in your hearts that Alma in the Book of Mormon had when he cried:<br><br><i>O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!</i><br><br><i>Yea, I would declare to every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto their God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.</i>[Alma 29:1–2]<br><br>The righteous desires of Alma should not be foreign to you. You have been blessed with a greater knowledge of the gospel than any generation before you has possessed. Now the question is, Do you have the courage to stand up and be counted for that which you know to be right? Do you have the courage to steer a straight course when worldly pressures surround you and offer you a seemingly easier and softer and more comfortable way of life? Can you be honest in your dealings with your fellowmen? Are you willing to go beyond that which is required of you and exercise your influence in bringing about honest practices? Have you the courage to set an example of right, of truth, and of justice? Are you strong enough to say no to a short-term gain when the long-range effects will damage future generations? Are you willing to enter into a partnership with the Lord and allow him to have controlling interest? Are you willing to follow his counsel and follow his direction?<br><br>Now, as I stand here today, I have no doubts concerning your potential. There has never been a better trained, a more enthusiastic generation and a more determined group than we now find in the young adult members of our Church. I challenge you today to use those tools with which you have been blessed and those you are now acquiring through your education, to be a builder in our Father in heaven's kingdom. How desperately the world needs a generation of righteous individuals who are willing to stand up on their feet and do that which our Father in heaven would require of them--not to be tempted, beguiled, in the ways of materialism, but to be willing to make sacrifices for that which they know to be right.<br><br>I bear solemn testimony to you that this is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We have a powerful and vigorous leader who is the mouthpiece of God on earth today. I know him to be an inspired leader who is receiving that direction and guidance from our Father in heaven. Let us be found on his side, supporting that which he knows to be right and you in your hearts know to be right. And let this influence, which is here present, spread throughout the world, inspiring many to live better lives, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>L.

<h1>izons - James E. Faust - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
President Oaks, members of the faculty, my beloved and choice young friends: I am grateful for the presence of the most important person in my life. I know that it's not appropriate to brag about your relatives, but I'm not related to her; I'm just married to her.<br><br>I have a desire this morning to be objective in what I say to you, and I think, in my desire to be objective, I also have a concern that I might not be invited back again to speak to you. I have not been privileged to attend this great institution, which memorializes the name of Brigham Young, but my interest in and concern for this university and its students are very great; and if BYU is going to be worthy of its name, it has the responsibility to expand the horizons of all who attend this institution, for Brigham Young himself was a man of endless vision. There is currently a rerun of the movie called<i>Lost Horizon.</i>If I can, I should like to challenge those who attend this institution to broaden their vision, rather than to limit it, so that there might be no lost horizons for any of the graduates of this great university.<br><br>Every time I go into the President's room at the Hotel Utah, which, as you know, contains the pictures of all of the presidents of the Church, there is a remarkable likeness of Brigham Young looking down from the wall. He always seems to be saying to me, "What are you doing here?"--a question which might appropriately be asked of those of you who are attending BYU. What are you doing here? This great school and its unique faculty are not really on trial, for they have stood the tests of time and excellence; but the students who attend here will be evaluated more and longer than any students who attend any other institution in this state or any other state. This is so because the Spirit of the Lord is here, and therefore it should reflect in the quality of the lives of those who attend here.<br><h2><b>Two Divergent Reactions to BYU</b></h2><br>I have wondered if the great honor of graduating from this institution, named after the great visionary colonizer, has had too much of a tendency to limit the horizons of a small number of those who attend, simply because they have felt that graduation was the crowning achievement of their lives. I'm sure that it is unfairly categorized, and I certainly do not wish to do so, but there are at least two divergent reactions which seem to obtain in some who attend this university. The first reaction can be seen in those few who, after graduation or leaving this institution, seem to feel that they cannot or do not wish to perpetuate in their lives the high ideals and standards of this university and of the Church which supports it. There are some of those in the law school which I attended, who have turned out to be good lawyers and otherwise good men but are spiritually inactive and have therefore limited their horizons.<br><br>The next category consists of those few at the opposite end of the spectrum who project the feeling, either consciously or unconsciously, that, simply because they have attended this university, somehow they have achieved, have arrived, and are fully satisfied with their achievements, as well as being a little self-righteous therefore, and whose vision has been limited and many horizons unseen. There must never be a lack of inner vision in the students or an inadequate challenge by the faculty at this university. Elder Hugh B. Brown reminds us, "If you have a desire to be mediocre, you will probably find that you have already achieved your ambition." Everyone would probably agree that most of the students at Brigham Young University are on the right track, but Arthur Godfrey has said, "Even if you're on the right track, you will get run over if you just stand there."<br><h2><b>An Understanding Heart</b></h2><br>Having recently come into the body of your leaders, I have a persuasion that the Brethren have been called, not because of their great intellects, although many have such, or their vast experience, although most have such, or their great learning, and all are learned according to the standards of the world. Based on their treatment of me, I am persuaded that in a large measure they have been called because of the understanding of their hearts. In this area they are not wanting. The Lord has made it clear that he requires an understanding heart and a willing mind. It is to be hoped that at this great University, while cultural and intellectual pursuits take their proper place, the feelings of the heart will be included in the curriculum and therefore not become one of the lost horizons.<br><h2><b>Overcome Adversity with Work</b></h2><br>Rossiter Raymond has said that "a horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight," and unfortunately the first range of hills which encircle the scanty vale is the horizon for the majority of its inhabitants. Heslop wisely counseled, "Don't always look at the objects which are near and never on the horizon." A thoughtful woman, Phoebe Cary, reminds us, "An inner vision, quick to find the beauties hidden from common sight," ought also to be part of the bill of fare of this university.<br><br>One of my friends, whom you would know if I should name him, recently had a son graduate from Harvard University. His other son has an advanced degree from Stanford. My friend began his illustrious career as a paperboy of one of the great newspapers, of which he is now the president, and subsequent to his having been a paperboy he worked for one of the big railroads. He has had all of the advantage of knowing the blessings of adversity. I queried him with a sincere pondering: "I wonder if your sons are as well educated as you were at their age?" I myself am very grateful to a father who did not overindulge his sons except with love and moral support. I think I have a special appreciation for many things, because of having worked at a canning factory in Murray and having caught hot cans as they came from the capper--for the munificent sum of twenty-five cents per hour. One of the fringe benefits of that job was to have the flesh of the hands peel off because of the wet and the heat of the cans. It also involved a ten-mile bike ride every day to get to and from work.<br><br>There is in the Church today a truly remarkable family. They are the children of Patriarch and Sister Alexander R. Curtis, who used to run a coal yard in Sugarhouse. To my knowledge, no family in the Church has produced so many bishops, stake presidents, mission presidents, and regional representatives of the Twelve. There are presently three sons serving as regional representatives of the Twelve. One of them, President A. Ray Curtis, when asked to what he attributed his success, answered that it was the coal shovel his father put in his hands when he was a boy.<br><br>There are some advantages if you have to work and struggle and deny yourselves here at Brigham Young University. It may very well be that the most beneficial part of your college education is to learn to work. You will find that in time you will outstrip those other students who will arrive on this campus next week or next month driving a Thunderbird their parents have bought for them. We are indebted to Henry Ward Beecher for the marvelous thought that "affliction comes to us all, not to make us sad, but sober; not to make us sorry, but wise. It is trial that proves one thing weak and another strong. A cobweb is as good as the mightiest cable when there is no strain upon it."<br><h2><b>Excellence</b></h2><br>One of the marvels of the surpassing craftsmanship so evident in so many places in the Salt Lake Temple makes one wonder if one of the lost horizons in your day is not a loss of excellence in personal performance. Paul counseled the Philippians well: "Approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ" (Philippians 1:10). The challenge to follow a more excellent way appears in two more significant scriptures. In Paul's writings to the Corinthians he says, "Covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way" (1 Corinthians 12:31). In Ether, the challenge is more spiritual: "In the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way" (Ether 12:11). One takes no offense in the pride of Michelangelo, who carved across the bodice of the<i>Pietà</i>this reminder to all who gaze upon this exquisite and sublime work of art: "Michelangelo Buonarroti of Florence made this."<br><br>Stradivarius too had a working knowledge of excellence. One of the horizons which profitably can be expanded in all of us is spiritual excellence. I would surmise that all who attend this great institution have a desire to see the face of the Savior. This is an available blessing, for he has said, "It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am" (D&amp;amp;C 93:1).<br><br>Another lost horizon of spiritual excellence is that of a want of personal integrity, or just plain honesty in one's dealings. A knowledge and practice of first-rate honesty is far more important than a knowledge of logarithms or the periodic tables of the elements of the earth. It would be hoped that first-rate honesty would be one of the principles taught constantly at this institution of higher learning. The element of honesty in fine test is that of being true to one's own being. Shakespeare, speaking through Polonius, said:<br><br><i>This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.</i>[Hamlet, I.iii].<br><h2><b>Confidence</b></h2><br>May I mention briefly three other horizons, which hopefully are never lost in the individual students at Brigham Young University. First is confidence in yourselves. Recently one of the Twelve with some others sat in a group of former recipients of a special scholarship of the universities of this state. Each recounted what the scholarship had meant in his or her life. Invariably appreciation was expressed for the money itself, because, I'm sure, of the great need. But quite often appreciation was also expressed for the self-confidence it gave to the recipient. Excellence comes into being, riding on the confidence one has in oneself.<br><h2><b>Physical Soundness</b></h2><br>Another lost horizon may be in physical soundness. More than a strengthening of muscles, there comes a strengthening of resolve, self-discipline, and carriage in participating in athletic endeavors. My brother Gus and I occasionally had to walk five miles from Granite High School to Cottonwood where we lived, after having participated in a scrimmage or training for a track meet. To many, including my own children, this seems not only foolish but downright stupid, and as I look back on it I have some misgivings myself. But there was a certain satisfaction in having persevered in an overwhelming physical challenge.<br><h2><b>Service</b></h2><br>The last horizon, which hopefully is never lost in our lives, is that of service. I speak of service to your family and to others, service to your calling, service to your profession, service to your community and your country. Most of the expanding horizons of all of us involve service and dedication. I humbly challenge all to remember that mere attendance at Brigham Young University, or for that matter Harvard University or the University of Utah, is not a substitute for excellence or endeavor. There is an unquestioned mark of distinction in being part of the student body of this great institution, but equating mere admission at Brigham Young University with achievement is an improper equation.<br><h2><b>A Journey, Not a Destination</b></h2><br>One of my beloved uncles went on a mission in 1912–14 to an enlightened nation in Europe. He found great satisfaction and fulfillment in being part of the great missionary activity and in his involvement with the Saints. After his mission he remained very loyal to the Church but became somewhat inactive because he had a Word of Wisdom problem. My brothers and I used to thrill in hearing him tell about his mission. He would tell us by the hour about his mission president, his companions, the Saints, the country, and its culture. His mission was, in many ways, the highwater mark of his life. He was thrilled when we went on our missions. He treasured missionary experience; it became the destination of his life rather than a journey.<br><br>An appropriate question to ask youth is whether your attendance at Brigham Young University is your destination or whether it is part of your eternal journey. In World War II we flew over the oases of the great Sahara Desert. Often we were low enough to the sand to see the drovers guiding their lumbering camels to and from these sanctuaries from thirst. In a measure, this great university and its environment is an oasis in the real world. As at an oasis in the desert, there should be those pilgrims who are coming from the real world to this campus and leaving this campus again to go back into the real world, even to distant lands. Members of this Church should be the leaven of the world, and if we are therefore not out in the world how can we provide the yeast? I am told that a few recruiters may be boycotting Brigham Young University because its graduates and/or their wives do not want to leave the oasis, or, having left it, always want to return. One of the mottoes of this university is "The world is our campus." If the world is our campus, then should not the world also be our area of influence? Alma reminds us that "the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, ... all that he seeth fit that they should have" (Alma 29:8). This must be constantly kept in mind by the students and the graduates of this university.<br><br>We are not saved by the role we play in life or by the geographic area where we live. The word of the Lord came unto Jonah saying, "Arise, go to Nineveh" (Jonah 1:2). There will be many of you who should go to Nineveh. You will recall that Jonah recoiled from that idea and went to Joppa, to go on to Tarshish, to get away from the presence of the Lord. And wherever your Nineveh may be, you will find that the presence of the Lord will be there. Jonah found that the Lord had other ideas for him, and three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish which swallowed him changed his mind about a number of things.<br><br>I bear my testimony to the divinity of the work which caused this great institution to be founded and to flourish, and to the reality of Jesus of Nazareth, our divine Redeemer, who should be our constant companion in the classrooms and assemblies, and even when we walk on the paths of Brigham Young University. And because of his influence on this campus, I pray that all who pause at this great oasis may have truly expanded horizons in their lives, and that he whose life we seek to emulate will be our continuing model. I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>James E.

<h1>ve in God, the Eternal Father - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It surely is thrilling to meet with so many of you here tonight. It's a great privilege to be a member of the Church. It's a great privilege to meet together in such large numbers to worship the Lord, which is, of course, what we hope to do tonight. Before I begin, I would like to introduce my wife to you. Would you please come to the pulpit, Emma Marr? I'd like you to meet her. She's a wonderful lady. Many of you were raised on her books. She's written about a dozen of them for young people and for children. Yesterday and the day before and the day before that, we had a great celebration in our family. We have just completed fifty years of happy married life. And so this is our golden wedding, and what a wonderful way it is to complete our celebration of that event by coming here and joining with you in expressing our joy for each other and for the great gospel that has brought us together. Emma Marr Petersen. Would you say hello to them, Emma Marr?<br><br>[<i>Mrs. Petersen:</i>Do I have to? We're really delighted to meet with you here tonight, even if we are practically terrified. But then, we talk ourselves into it, knowing that whenever we're among Latter-day Saints we're among friends; and that thought sustains us a great deal, together with, of course, our trust in our Heavenly Father, when we try to do what we're supposed to do. We're delighted to be here, and I ask the blessings of our Heavenly Father upon us during the remainder of this meeting, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.]<br><br>Isn't she a delightful lady? You can imagine the joy I had fifty-one years ago, when she promised to join me for the rest of my life, and then fifty years ago when, in the Salt Lake Temple, we were privileged to be sealed together for time and for all eternity. So this is a happy day for us, and we're glad that we can spend it with you here this evening.<br><br>I was here just a year ago. I don't remember what I said on that day, and I hope I won't tell you the same thing over again. But I believe I remember that I asked you to recite some of the Articles of Faith. Some of you may possibly remember, although I don't expect anybody to remember much what I say. But I'd like to talk about the Articles of Faith a little bit tonight, particularly the first article. And I wonder if you'd be willing to join with me in reciting the first Article of Faith:<br><br><i>We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.</i><br><br>I would like particularly to talk about the first few words of that article. To begin with, "We believe in God."<br><br>That's the reason we're here tonight, isn't it? We believe in God. Regardless of what all the rest of the people of the world may say or do, we Latter-day Saints have a testimony that God lives, and therefore we believe in him. We have various reasons for believing in him. One of the reasons is, of course, that our prophets have actually seen him. Our prophets have seen Almighty God, and they bear testimony that he lives. We have the scriptures which bear testimony that he lives, and if we have been worthy, everyone of us as a member of the Church has received the testimony from the Holy Ghost. Every member of the Church has been given the gift of the Holy Ghost, and if we are worthy and if we seek it, that Spirit will bear testimony to our spirits that God does live. And so this is my testimony tonight; it is your testimony tonight; and that is why all together we can say, "We believe in God."<br><br>And then the next few words: "We believe in God, the Eternal Father." That's what I'd like to talk about with you tonight: the fatherhood of God. God is literally our Eternal Father. You remember that when Paul was on Mars' Hill he came to the altar marked "To the Unknown God," and he took advantage of that great opportunity (Acts 17:19–34). He was a great salesman as well as a great preacher, and when he saw this altar marked to the unknown god, immediately he proceeded to explain to them the true God, who was unknown to them because they were worshiping idols. The true God, not being known to them, required definition, and therefore he gave it to them. You recall that when he spoke to them he said, among other things, that "we are the offspring of God." That is the very basis of our whole religion. We are the offspring of Almighty God.<br><br>How are we the offspring of God? We are dual beings. Actually everyone of us is a spirit, and our spirit occupies a body of flesh and bone. The body is not the person at all. The spirit is the real person. I am a spirit; you are a spirit--everyone of you. Our spirit resembles our body, or rather our body was tailored to fit our spirit. The spirit bears the image and likeness of God, and the body, if it's normal, is in the image and likeness of the spirit. And the spirit is the offspring of Almighty God. You remember that Paul said also, "We have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?" (Hebrews 12:9).<br><br>So we, as spirits, were begotten of Almighty God. We are his children. We are not products of creation in the usually understood sense. We obtained our being by birth and not by manufacture, if I may use that word without being misunderstood. We were born of Almighty God in the spirit, in the same sense in which our bodies were born of our parents here on the earth. As we have the blood of our earthly parents flowing through our veins, so we have divinity within us, because our eternal spirits have a divine parentage.<br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith became the President of the Church in January of 1970. He did not actually make a public address as President until the April conference of that same year, when he made his acceptance address as President of the Church, when he was voted in as President by the members of the Church.<br><br>At that time President Smith said something very significant, and I would like to read it to you:<br><br><i>We believe in the divine origin of man.</i>[He was talking about the fact that we are the offspring of God, just as Paul said. And then he continues:]<i>Our faith is founded on the fact that God is our Father and that we are his children. As members of his family, we dwelt with him before the foundations of this earth were laid</i>[I hope you notice that he says that we are the "family" of God, because we are the offspring of God, born to him],<i>and he ordained and established the plan of salvation, whereby we gained the privilege of advancing and progressing as we are endeavoring to do. The God we worship is a glorified being in whom all power and perfection dwell, and he has created man in his own image and likeness with those characteristics and attributes which he himself possesses.</i><br><br>And so our belief in the dignity and destiny of man is an essential part of our theology and of our way of life. Because God is our Father, we have a natural desire to love and serve him and to be worthy members of his family. President Smith's father was President Joseph F. Smith, who preceded him as President of the Church by several generations of presidents. President Joseph F. Smith, on that same subject, said this:<br><br><i>Where did we come from? We came from God. Our spirits existed before they came to this world. They were in the councils of the heavens before the foundations of the earth were laid. We were there. We sang together with the heavenly hosts for joy when the foundations of the earth were laid, and when the plan of our existence upon this earth and redemption were mapped out. We were there. We were interested, and we took a part in this great preparation.</i>[And then he continues:]<i>These spirits--that is, you and I, our brothers and sisters</i>[and don't worry about the fact that we have so many brothers and sisters, because God had all eternity before this earth was made in which to have us, so don't worry about that]<i>--have been coming to this earth to take upon them tabernacles from the morn of creation until now, and will continue until the winding-up scene, until the spirits who were destined to come to this world shall have come and accomplished their mission in the flesh.</i><br><br>President Brigham Young talked about the same thing, and he said this:<br><br><i>Our Father in heaven begat all the spirits that ever were or ever will be upon this earth</i>. [You see, we are begotten children of God.]<i>Then the Lord, by his power and wisdom, organized the mortal tabernacle of man. We were made first spiritual, and afterward temporal.</i><br><br>President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote a book--he wrote many books, of course, but one of them was entitled<i>The Restoration of All Things.</i>On pages 250–51 he says this:<br><br><i>How uplifting and comforting is the thought that the Father of Jesus Christ is in very deed our Father, that we are in very deed his offspring. It is the teaching of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that we all lived in the world of spirits and in the presence of our Father before we came to this earth to be clothed in bodies of flesh and bones. He is our Father.</i><br><br>And then President Smith quotes Paul again, this time from Romans, as follows:<br><br><i>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</i><br><br><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.</i>[Romans 8:16–17]<br><br>That's a very significant expression: heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ. You remember in the oath and covenant of the priesthood the same thing is expressed, that if the holders of the priesthood will honor their priesthood, "all that my Father hath shall be given unto [them]" (D&amp;amp;C 84:38). We inherit these things from God, providing we're worthy, and the reason we can inherit them is that we're his children. We have his divinity within us. That gives us the right of inheritance, and therefore we are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ.<br><br>And then President Smith discusses another thing. We have a Father in Heaven. Can fathers reproduce themselves all by themselves? And then we have this glorious song, "O My Father." Do you remember those words?<br><br><i>In the heavens are parents single?</i><br><i>No; the thought makes reason stare!</i><br><i>Truth is reason, truth eternal</i><br><i>Tells me I've a mother there.</i><br><br>And then President Smith goes on in his book:<br><br><i>Latter-day Saints believe not only that we have a Father in heaven but also a Mother there. Why not have a mother as well as a father? Is there any blasphemy in this teaching?</i><br><br>And there isn't. It's merely a statement of fact, because in the heavens parents are not single. "Truth is reason, truth eternal tells me I've a mother there."<br><br>And so everyone of us is a child of God. That's why we teach this doctrine, even to our little children. That's why our Primary children sing "I Am a Child of God." Do you know that song? How many of you know "I Am a Child of God"? Will you sing it with me, the one verse? Will you? Let's go; I'll pitch it for you. [<i>Song; audience participating:</i>]<br><br><i>I am a child of God,</i><br><i>And he has sent me here,</i><br><i>Has given me an earthly home</i><br><i>With parents kind and dear.</i><br><i>Lead me, guide me, walk beside me,</i><br><i>Help me find the way.</i><br><i>Teach me all that I must do</i><br><i>To live with him someday.</i><br><br>What a wonderful chorus. I enjoyed hearing you sing that. Being a child of God gives us a great opportunity, doesn't it? It means that we can become like him and then live with him eternally if we will but follow his rules. This is what Jesus taught, isn't it? Wasn't this the meaning that Jesus had in mind when he said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48)? And that's our goal and our objective, and that's what we all hope to do.<br><h2><b>Distractions</b></h2><br>But there are many distractions, aren't there? Always there have been distractions, all down through the years. Do you remember the biblical account of the time of Samuel the prophet? Samuel was doing his best to preserve the kind of government among ancient Israel that God had given them, but these Israelites were looking around at the various other nations. They became jealous of these other nations, and a very foolish thought came into their minds: they wanted to become like all the other nations. So they came to Samuel and said, "Give us a king, that we may be like all the other nations" (see 1 Samuel 8:5–20). And when finally Samuel gave in and they did become like all the other nations, they became like all the other nations also in that they turned their backs on God, and they descended into slavery.<br><br>Whenever we reject the commandments we reject God to that extent, and that is a lesson that everyone of us must learn and understand. When we turn our backs upon the commandments, we turn our backs upon God. Can we afford it?<br><br>We can reject him by wanting to do as all the nations, or by being so stubborn in our own conceits that we will not listen to the still, small voice. No wonder Isaiah said, "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way" (Isaiah 53:6). Or we may be ashamed of our standards, since popularity means to be like all the nations.<br><br>Do you remember the story of Lehi's dream? Do you remember the iron rod? And do you remember that the people were holding to the iron rod because it led them up to salvation? But across the river were the people of the world, and they were laughing at these faithful souls holding to the iron rod, and pointed the finger of scorn at them. And many of these faithful became ashamed, because the worldly people were making fun of them and pointing their finger at them; so they let go of the iron rod and were lost.<br><br>Being ashamed of our religion puts us on the road to ruin and destruction. If we are ashamed of righteousness and godliness, then we turn to evil and all that it brings with it. Oh, if everyone of us could but remember the lesson of Lehi's dream of the iron rod. That "Iron Rod" used to be in our hymnbooks. I believe it's in the junior hymnbook now. Do you know this song, "The Iron Rod "? The chorus goes,<br><br><i>Hold to the rod, the iron rod;</i><br><i>'Tis strong, and bright, and true;</i><br><i>The iron rod is the word of God,</i><br><i>'Twill safely guide us through.</i><br><br>Do you know that? Do you know the chorus? How many of you know that? Do you? Well, then we can sing that one too, can't we? Just the chorus only. "Hold to the rod," it starts. [<i>Song; audience participating.</i>]<br><br>Great, you're wonderful singers.<br><h2><b>The Tyranny of an Unproven Theory</b></h2><br>There has developed in recent years what almost amounts to a cult in certain fields. This is a cult which also points the finger of scorn at believers and would seek to make us ashamed of our faith. It is one which would have us reject the doctrine of a special creation and accept the unproven but time-worn theory that all life evolved from lower forms, that worms and microbes were our ancestors, and not God. It teaches that God is not our father, but that our first progenitors were microscopic forms which came into existence spontaneously, without cause, without reason, and without purpose. According to this theory of primordial life, man at one time developed from an ancestor which, as one writer described him, was "a hairy, four-legged beast which had a tail and pointed ears and lived in trees." I ask you, which requires more faith, to believe that God is our father, or that some monkey-like ape gave us birth? And which would you rather have as your father, a creeping ape or Almighty God?<br><br>Our religion tells us that God is our Father. Some so-called intellectuals who point the finger at religion have become so domineering in their attitude toward those who do not believe their ghastly theories that they assume an attitude almost approaching tyranny. In some circles it has become persecution. So severe it is among some that one researcher, Dr. Thomas Dwight, was led to say,<br><br><i>The tyranny in the matter of evolution is overwhelming to a degree of which no outsider has any idea. How very few leaders in the field of science dare to tell the truth as to the state of their own minds. How many of them feel themselves forced in public to do lip service to a cult that they do not believe in.</i><br><br>But how glad we are for such men as Dr. Joseph W. Barker, former dean at Columbia University. In an address some time ago that he gave at Ripon University, he said that "some scientists have been misled by certain of their observations, and, as a result, came to conclusions which were atheistic." But now he says, and I quote him:<br><br><i>Even the most pragmatic materialist in the face of present-day scientific knowledge is led to the inevitable conclusion that the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows of his handiwork. As the children of Israel foreswore the worship of the golden calf and returned to that faith of Jehovah, so we have foresworn the crass mechanistic materialism and returned to that faith in God of which the psalmist of old sang, "The earth is the Lord's. . . and they that dwell therein."</i><br><br>So spoke Dr. Barker.<br><br>Yes, our religion tells us that God is our Father, and that we lived with him before we were born on this earth. It tells us further that every creature, microscopic and otherwise, was made by him before it lived here on the earth, and also that each one was made as a spirit before it was made in the flesh here in mortality. There were two creations, one in which God made all things in the spirit. That is, he made the real life, the real being, as a spirit, in the first creation. And then, in the second creation, he provided these mortal tabernacles in which he placed these spirits that he had created in the preexistence.<br><br>I hope you read the scriptures on this. Moses, in the book of Moses, was very specific on this subject, and I'd like to read to you what Moses had to say.<br><br><i>And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that I, the Lord God, made the heaven and the earth;</i><br><br><i>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. . . . in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air.</i>[Moses 3:4–5]<br><br>They're significant words, aren't they? He made all life in heaven, making them spirits, which were the real persons--or the real creatures, or whatever they were. He made them all as individual persons--or creatures, as the case may be--and they were in the spiritual creation. Then he created the mortal part of life, this earth and all mortality. But at the time he made the spirits there was no flesh, Moses says, "upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air" (Moses 3:5). He hadn't even sent them here.<br><br>And then another very interesting thing in the second chapter of Moses: he says that when he did place them here on the earth, he placed within each one the seed, of reproduction with the power to reproduce after its own kind. Well, he gave human beings the power to reproduce, didn't he? We have within ourselves the seed to reproduce, but what do we reproduce? We reproduce after our own kind, don't we? The only reproduction among human beings is more human beings, isn't that right? Whoever heard of a human being bringing forth a horse or a cow or--well, excuse me for being ridiculous, but it's to the point, isn't it? Human beings can reproduce only human beings. And he put this seed in animals, likewise, so that animals can reproduce only after their own kind. So dogs will only reproduce dogs, and never cats or polliwogs. They will only reproduce after themselves. The same is true in vegetable life. An apple will only bring forth an apple, and it will not bring forth a cucumber. Now, I'm being a little extreme, but I think you get the point. God placed in everyone of his creations, as it says here in Moses 2, the seed within itself to reproduce after its own kind.<br><br>Of course it was a great discovery when the scientists discovered genes, the genes which keep the species true. And who made the genes? It was this same God, our Eternal Father, who decreed in the first place that everything would reproduce only after its own kind. Genesis sustains the Book of Moses in this, and it also says that every plant was made "before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew," and so on (Genesis 2:5). And Genesis is very specific in declaring that all life was to reproduce after its own kind. The sectarian people have a hard time understanding the idea that man is made in the image of God and that God looks like a human being. But I ask you, he having made all these rules, he having created all things and now reproducing us after his own kind, how could we be other than the exact image and likeness of God? It had to be that way, because we're the offspring of God. And since we are the offspring of God, and since the law is that everything should reproduce after its own kind, and inasmuch as God would not break his own laws, he reproduced after his own kind and thus man looks like God and man is in the image and likeness of God.<br><br>It's a very interesting thing to read in section 77 of the Doctrine and Covenants some further information on this same subject. The Prophet Joseph Smith had great difficulty understanding the book of Revelation. The Prophet asked the Lord for some explanations, and in this section 77, certain explanations are made that have to do with this very subject. We learn from this section that in heaven beasts and fowls and creeping things exist as spirits. Then the scripture goes on: "That which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual" (D&amp;amp;C 77:2). So you see, the body matches the spirit, and the spirit was made in the preexistence, so that the body that's made here fits the spirit that was made in the preexistence. Then notice this next part of this little section: "The spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast and every other creature which God has created" (D&amp;amp;C 77:2). Isn't that a marvelous and an interesting scripture? Lots of people don't read that, but this is one of the most significant things in the Doctrine and Covenants, in my humble opinion. So in heaven God created the spirits of all forms of life as they appear in mortality, the mortal form being in the likeness of the spirit, with mankind being God's own offspring, his literal children, having the full capability of becoming like him.<br><br>And this brings us back to Paul's expression that we are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. We have inherited, by reason of our divine birth, the capability of sometime becoming like God. And that's why there's good sense in the Savior's commandment, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Man, then, was always man, because he was made that way in the preexistence. Cows were always cows and horses were always horses, because they were made that way in the preexistence, when first they were made as spirits before they were tabernacled in flesh, since all things were made spiritually before they were temporally in the earth. Then trees were always trees, corn was always corn, cats were always cats, because they were made that way in the preexistence. Now I ask you, if God were not our father, literally, why would the Savior teach us to pray as he did in the Lord's prayer, "Our Father which art in heaven?" Would he deceive us? And why, after the resurrection, would he say to Mary, "I ascend unto my Father, and to your Father; and to my God, and your God" (John 20:17)? If it were not so, why would he have said a thing like that? Our whole religion, you see, is based upon the concept that God is our Father.<br><br>You believe in our Articles of Faith. One of them says, "We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression." Do you believe there was an Adam, described in the scripture as the first man? Do you believe there was such a thing as Adam's transgression, sometimes called the Fall? Now I ask you, can you believe in Adam and in Darwinian evolution at the same time? Our religion teaches that there was no death in the world before the Fall. Do you believe that? And if you do, how can you accept Darwinism, which says there was death before Adam--or before the first human being, as some will accept it? This then becomes one of the great hurdles for LDS anthropologists, doesn't it?<br><br>According to our doctrine, the fall of Adam and the process of death are inseparable. Death and Adam are inseparable; death and the resurrection are inseparable; the fall of Adam and the atonement of Christ are inseparable; Adam and Christ are inseparable. If there was no Adam, there was no fall. If there was no fall of Adam there was no atonement by Christ. If there was no atonement by Christ our religion is in vain, for if there was no Adam, there was no Christ either. If there is no Christ, where are we? Are you ready to reject your inspired religion, your faith in God and Christ, to accept the questionable philosophy that may be thrust upon you by some unbelieving, even atheistic, professor of an unproved hypothesis? This is certainly a case in point where we must do as Joshua of old said, "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15).<br><br>One of our local newspapers ran this editorial that I'd like to read to you:<br><br><i>A midwestern newspaper, in its editorial columns, defined the origin of language and said that primitive man was able to communicate only through facial expressions and bodily movements. It claimed that the spoken language came much later and was part of man's evolution to his present state. This, of course, is in line with other false hypotheses being foisted upon an unwary public, many of whom are willing to believe that if we developed from lower forms of life, we also had to develop language from lower forms. They say we learned to speak as we also learned to stand erect or to think, hunt, and eventually cultivate the ground. But how foolish is this notion in the light of revelation. The first man, Adam, could speak eloquently. He could write. He could talk, not only with other men but with God, who was his teacher, who likewise gave him his language and his intelligence. The earliest men, according to the scriptures, kept books of remembrance, and they wrote the scriptures themselves, under inspiration from the Almighty. Has there ever been more beautiful language than is found in the scriptures? Has any writing been as uplifting and enduring? Language did not evolve from lowly origins. It was beautiful to begin with. It suffered from the same retrogression that centuries ago made cavemen out of intelligent beings and turned pure religion into superstition, as early men apostatized from God.</i><br><h2><b>Witnesses for Christ</b></h2><br>The apostle Paul dealt with this subject to some extent, as you know, and he had to fight for the principle that there was a resurrection, that there was an Adam, and that there was a Christ who came forth from the grave and atoned for Adam's sin. Paul was one of the great witnesses of Christ anciently. We have many witnesses for Christ today. I am one of them, and I humbly stand before you as one of his witnesses. Today I join with the apostle Paul and give you my testimony in Paul's words, so that Paul and I bear you the same testimony as it is recorded in 1 Corinthians 15:<br><br><i>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</i><br><br><i>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</i><br><br><i>And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</i><br><br><i>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</i><br><br><i>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</i><br><br><i>And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</i>[Vv. 12–17]<br><br><i>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</i>[V. 29]<br><br><i>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.</i><br><br><i>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</i><br><br><i>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</i>[Vv. 20–22]<br><br>And then Paul continues, speaking first of the first man, Adam, who he says was a living soul. Then he testifies again of the fact of the resurrection and says that<br><br><i>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. . . .</i><br><br><i>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</i><br><br><i>. . . Death is swallowed up in victory.</i><br><br><i>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? . . .</i><br><br><i>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, my beloved brethren</i>[and tonight, since it's also my testimony, I add sisters as well],<i>be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</i>[1 Corinthians 15:50, 53–55, 57–58]<br><br>Let us realize this great fact, that God reproduced himself and gave us birth to give us the opportunity of sometime becoming like him, and he provides the means, which is the gospel of Christ, to help us to become like him. It was not an idle statement, quoted by President Lorenzo Snow, that "as man is, God once was, and as God is, man may become." That is why Jesus commanded us to become perfect as our Father which is in heaven is perfect. For this reason we must follow his way of life, his plan of development, the only plan which will permit us to reach this goal. This is why we must not allow ourselves to become like all the nations, as the ancient Israelites desired. That is why we must not be like the world, even though we live in the world. That is why the apostle Peter declared that we are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood and holy nation, a peculiar people, that we might indeed become like God our Father.<br><br>President Tanner of the First Presidency is one of our great teachers of latter days. One of the principles that he keeps fresh in our minds he attributes to President David O. McKay: "Remember who you are, and act accordingly." Then who are we? We are the children of God. Do you believe it? Will you say it with me? [<i>Audience:</i>We are the children of God.] That was kind of half-hearted, wasn't it? Can't you do better? [<i>Audience:</i>We are the children of God.] Then shall we be ashamed of this fact? [<i>Audience:</i>No.] Then shall we serve him? [<i>Audience:</i>Yes.] Shall the youth of Zion falter in defending truth and right? [<i>Audience:</i>No.]<br><br>When I was here last time, I gave you a little bit of verse that I'd like you to say again with me. You remembered it very well before. It was a little verse that I learned when I was a young missionary. It goes like this:<br><br><i>Dare to be a Mormon;</i><br><i>Dare to stand alone;</i><br><i>Dare to have a purpose firm;</i><br><i>Dare to make it known.</i><br><br>Let me say the first two lines, and then will you say them with me? [<i>Audience participation.</i>] Let's say the whole thing now, shall we, the four lines? Ready. [<i>Audience participation.</i>] Thank you.<br><br>I bear you solemn testimony tonight, my brothers and sisters, that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is true. By all that I hold sacred, I testify to you that God indeed is our Father, that we are the offspring of God, that he's the father of our spirits, and that we can become like him. By all that I hold sacred I testify to you that Jesus Christ lives, that he is the Savior of the world, and that he will save everyone of us if we will but allow him to. He has given us the gospel. If we will live it, if we will be clean and pure in our private lives, if we will have faith, if we will have believing hearts, if we will follow the prophet of God who stands at the head of this church, Jesus will bring us back into his presence and make it fully possible that we can become perfect, even as our Father which is in heaven is perfect. And to this I humbly and solemnly testify, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Mark E.

<h1>es for the Year Ahead - Dallin H. Oaks - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My dear brothers and sisters, I stand before you in great humility for the responsibility of addressing you on this occasion. I see your faces--thousands of them. I also see other faces: parents, alumni, tithe payers, Church leaders, the great and the humble friends of this university, and teachers and leaders of times past--all who have contributed to the great traditions of this university. These faces look to me to be their spokesman on this occasion. No one could face that challenge without humility.<br><br>The last time I stood up in assembly to deliver a comprehensive challenge to this student body was two years ago, just a few weeks after I had taken office. It is time that I do so again. Your faces are new. Only 4,000 of you were students at BYU when I gave that first talk; 21,000 of you were not here on that occasion. That fact impresses me to repeat a few things that have been said before. Other topics are dictated by the experiences of the last two years and our aspirations for the future.<br><h2><b>Personal Safety</b></h2><br>A few months ago Dean J. Elliot Cameron and I met with the grieving parents and brother of a BYU coed who had drowned in the Provo River. Many times over the past two years I have had to pick up the phone to call the parents of BYU students killed in automobile or motorcycle accidents. Whenever I have one of these conversations I am left wondering if I could have said or done anything in advance to help avoid these tragedies. Some of these deaths seem so avoidable, so unnecessary. Each of you is aware of the need for extra care on the highways, especially in winter driving. But I wonder if each of you has been warned about the Provo River.<br><br>A week ago today I drove up the canyon and sat beside the Provo River near Canyon Glen to meditate and seek inspiration about the subject of these remarks. As I sat there lost in thought, I heard a whoop, and down the river came five fellows of college age on inner tubes, whirling and bobbing in the swift, cold water. They had no life jackets or other observable safety protection. As the current carried them beyond my view, I could still hear their happy voices. I wondered if they knew that this river had taken the lives of three boys and girls their age in the last six months. One of these bodies had been pulled from the river within a few blocks of the place where I sat. A deputy sheriff searching for one of these bodies narrowly missed drowning also.<br><br>Those of you who have any possible desire to go swimming or tubing in the Provo River, please understand that for a multitude of reasons associated with the chilling water temperature, swift current, and hidden obstacles this is highly dangerous. You enter the Provo River at the peril of your life.<br><h2><b>Drugs</b></h2><br>Last year, in the middle of a semester, we dismissed a group of young men who were involved in the use of drugs. Some parents and fellow students were surprised at the swiftness and harshness of this action. Some accused us of not giving sufficient advance warning about our policy. I include this subject not only to make you aware of our policy but to add my voice to those who have warned you about drugs. My personal observations and experience with drug users have given me some indelible convictions about the destructive physical effects and the disabling spiritual effects of drugs. I know the reason for the provision in our Code of Honor that commits us to refrain "from the possession, use, or distribution of any narcotic or dangerous drug . . . , except as prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner."<br><br>As a young law professor I spent several weeks in the criminal courts in Chicago<i>prosecuting</i>men accused of selling and possessing drugs. Later I spent many more weeks<i>defending</i>men accused of narcotics offenses. I have counseled young people who have been deceived and disabled by drugs, including marijuana, LSD, and pills, as well as the harder opium derivatives like heroin. I am more determined than anyone that we will not permit this tool of the devil to gain a foothold at BYU, as it has on so many high school and college campuses. Consequently we have a policy that any student found to be distributing, using, or possessing any drugs other than those used under a doctor's care, on or off campus, will be dismissed immediately and without any allowance for probation. Persons guilty of drug offenses can, of course, repent and change their ways--and we hope that they will--but they will have to complete their repentance away from this campus and demonstrate their total rehabilitation before they will be allowed to return.<br><br>This policy is stern, but necessary. National studies, confirmed by our own experience, show that the drug traffic spreads rapidly from friend to friend, infecting the innocent and unwary as well as the eager participant. Every day we permit a drug user to remain at BYU we take chances with the welfare of thousands of other students. We will not take those chances.<br><br>Our swift action may also save the participants from more serious involvement. At the time we apprehended one of these young men last fall he had ordered a large shipment of marijuana sent to his address in the dorm, intending to sell it to some of his fellow students who were already using the drug and to others who would become involved. When our officers advised him that we were aware of his activities, he confessed and surrendered the drugs without committing the serious crime of sale of narcotics. If we had waited just a few days to apprehend that young man, our officers would have been obliged to prosecute him for the serious felony of sale of marijuana, a penitentiary offense.<br><br>If any of you have any association or contacts with anyone possessing or using drugs, I urge you, in your own interest, to break off your associations entirely and immediately. If any of you have had any experience with drugs and have not completely repented, I urge you to confess to your branch president immediately to establish your total break with this vicious affliction of our times.<br><h2><b>Chastity</b></h2><br>Another provision of our Code of Honor is: "Live the law of chastity. This includes abstinence from all sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage." I could appropriately give an entire talk on that subject, whose importance transcends almost anything else I will say this morning. And it is needed. Too many of our young people have heard too little plain talk on this subject. Too few understand that young men and women who violate the law of chastity surrender their self-respect, forfeit their right to the companionship and guidance of the Spirit of the Lord, and sow a harvest of bitter regrets and blighted expectations. Persons who commit the sin of adultery or fornication separate themselves from God as surely as if they had locked themselves in a spirit prison from which they can obtain release only after the most painful and prolonged period of repentance. What I have said applies to sex relations between man and woman and also to homosexual relations between man and man and between woman and woman. All are deadly sins in the eyes of God.<br><br>Our campus stake presidents and branch presidents are best aware of the tragic consequences of sexual sins. They hear the confessions, give the counsel, guide the repentance, and, where necessary, hold the courts that take away the Church membership of persons involved in these sins. Further counsel and teachings on this subject will come from your Church officers. I will not say more than to urge you with every power of persuasion I possess to follow the commandment of God to live the law of chastity and also to avoid the physical intimacies and other conditions of temptation that lead young men and women to the brink of this desecrating sin.<br><h2><b>Pornography</b></h2><br>Our Savior emphasized the importance of sexual purity when he taught that it was sinful even for a man to look upon a woman to lust after her. That teaching leads me to say a few words about the kind of material we read and the kinds of movies and television we view. On the printed page and on the screen we are surrounded by the promotional literature of illicit sexual relations. For your own good, avoid it. Pornographic or erotic stories and pictures are worse than filthy or polluted food. The body has defenses to rid itself of unwholesome food. With a few fatal exceptions, bad food will only make you sick but do no permanent harm. In contrast, a person who feasts upon filthy stories or pornographic or erotic pictures and literature records them in this marvelous retrieval system we call a brain. The brain won't vomit back filth. Once recorded, it will always remain subject to recall, flashing its perverted images across your mind and drawing you away from the wholesome things in life.<br><br>Please remember also that in a free enterprise economy we vote by each purchase we make. If we buy erotic literature or patronize X-rated movies we record a vote, we send a message, that this is what we desire: "Give us more." The market will respond to that message. Conversely, the most effective way to control unwholesome movies, literature, and every other form of evil that we would like to eliminate from the marketplace is to avoid patronizing it. By the same token, if we would only refrain from shopping on the Sabbath, the merchants who keep their businesses open and require their employees to work on the Sabbath would soon find it unprofitable and would arrange to do their business as each of us should, on the six days of labor. The free enterprise method of controlling evil, by not patronizing it, is more effective in most instances and has less bad side effects than the more popular method of passing a law to make certain behavior a crime or to control it in other ways. Cast your vote for wholesome literature and movies; avoid patronizing the other kind.<br><h2><b>Religious Life</b></h2><br>I am always distressed when I hear that a young man or woman at BYU is inactive or unreliable in his or her Church responsibilities. Religious activity is a vital part of life at this university. Our entire approach to learning is a spiritual one, born of our conviction that intelligence is the glory of God and that a balanced education should provide food for the spirit as well as the mind. This explains why we are concerned about creating and preserving an environment of personal purity and public beauty in which the Holy Ghost--that teaching and communicating member of the Godhead--can be the companion of every student and the catalyst in every lesson.<br><br>Church attendance is not required at BYU. Neither is attendance at the library. But students who fail to maintain an active religious life, just like students who fail to participate in the intellectual life of the university, are missing such a vital part of the educational experience that they raise serious questions about the appropriateness of their continued enrollment. All over the world there are young Latter-day Saints who would like to attend Brigham Young University, to participate in the entire educational program. Those who occupy places here have a responsibility to use these resources to the fullest or to step aside for those who will.<br><br>This year, as always, our student body includes hundreds of students who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We welcome you and anticipate that your presence here will enrich our education as well as yours. We invite you to take part in the active religious life of our campus branches and stakes. If you choose not to, we urge you to affiliate with the church of your choice in this community. We urge upon you our conviction that each of us should have an active religious life along with our university studies.<br><h2><b>Those Who Support You</b></h2><br>Occasionally we hear that a young man or woman has chosen to go to another private school because of the receipt of a large scholarship. In one such case the tuition scholarship was $1,500, but because the tuition at the other university was $2,500, the young man still had to pay $1,000 per year for his education. When I hear of such cases I wonder if we have done all we should to make our students aware of the fact that each of them has, in effect, a scholarship of more than $1,200. That is the approximate average amount of Church appropriation per student in addition to tuition to cover the costs of education at BYU. Without that additional Church appropriation our tuition would have to be almost $2,000 per year of two semesters instead of $600, assuming we could maintain our present level of enrollment.<br><br>Other Church appropriations account for the capital investment in this campus, its buildings, equipment, grounds, streets, and other facilities. The investment in the last twenty years alone is more than $100 million. To put that another way, that is the tithing on earned income of more than $1 billion. All of the Church-appropriated funds that build and run this university come from the faithful tithe-paying members of this Church: the farmer in Ephraim and Juarez, the workman in London, the stockman in Star Valley, the businessman in Long Beach, the widow in Layton.<br><br>Among the important lessons to be drawn from these figures is that each person who benefits from this university community has a great stewardship to use these resources wisely and in the way the Lord and his servants intended. We who benefit from the expenditure of these tithing funds are representatives of the Church just as surely as are missionaries or Church officials. The sacred tithing resources are spent in our behalf, and the Church and its ideals will be judged by our words, our deeds, and our appearance.<br><br>For the next few minutes I will touch briefly on a variety of subjects that will be familiar to many of you but should be mentioned here for the benefit of the thousands of new students in our midst.<br><h2><b>Dress and Grooming</b></h2><br>I will say very little about our Dress and Grooming Standards. They are well known, and every student has agreed in writing on his or her admission application and in each succeeding registration to abide by them. BYU students overwhelmingly support these standards and remain in compliance with them. Most who violate the Dress and Grooming Standards do so thoughtlessly. Thus, I believe that most of the young women who wear blue jeans or other grubby clothes on campus do so without conscious intent to flout the standards. You help them and the university when you give them a gentle reminder that this is not consistent with our standards.<br><br>There are a few students who violate our standards purposely. I include here the deceitful fellow who gains entrance to the university by wearing a short-haired wig or slicking his long hair back over his ears to get through the registration line and then removing the wig or shaking his hair down for everyday wear. That kind of deceitfulness is a contemptible continuing insult to the university and its rule-abiding students and faculty. In my view the only proper course of action for this kind of fellow is to withdraw from the company of the honest men and women at Brigham Young University and pursue his studies at some location where he will not be in continual violation of the rules and his own personal word of honor.<br><br>I hope that our faculty and students will unite in clear and gentle reminders to those who violate our standards, to make them aware that others note and disapprove their violations and to encourage them to fulfill their commitments. Those of you who would object to such reminders should take care to remain well within the standards. Persons who persist in running close to the line in any area are apt to have some embarrassing conversations with teachers and fellow students.<br><h2><b>Assembly Attendance</b></h2><br>Every Tuesday morning students and faculty walking to assembly see other students and faculty who are not. Though attendance is voluntary and no academic credit is given, our devotional and forum assemblies are among the most important events at the university. You neglect your education and fail to use a unique resource of this university if you miss a single one. Wise students will attend faithfully. The foolish will find other diversions, ranging from the indolent or frivolous to the real pressure of studies too long delayed. Last year some superb forum assemblies were very poorly attended, and the average devotional attendance of about 8,000 fell far below the level of which we are capable. Our devotional speakers are drawn predominantly from the board of trustees of this university: the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and a few other General Authorities who have been given special responsibilities to supervise the Church Educational System. Our forum assemblies will feature messages of extraordinary importance and variety from carefully chosen BYU faculty members and speakers from outside the university. For your own sake, don't miss any assemblies this year.<br><h2><b>New Calendar</b></h2><br>Under the heading of wise use of time I encourage each of you, and especially entering freshmen, to examine carefully the advantages of our new three-semester calendar, including the independent eight-week half semesters we call the spring term and summer term. By attending two and one-half semesters per year--such as the fall semester, winter semester, and spring term, going to school from September 1 until about June 20--a student can complete a full four-year college program and graduate in just three years.<br><h2><b>Other Concerns</b></h2><br>My list of periodic reminders concludes with the lawn. Don't cut across. Use the sidewalk. Our lawns are for lounging and looking, but not for walking. Help keep the campus beautiful and free from ugly muddy and dusty paths.<br><h2><b>Helping Others with Their Responsibilities</b></h2><br>From time to time students write me or speak to me about what they can do to help the university and their fellow students. That attitude of Christian brotherhood is characteristic of this campus. It never fails to fill me with admiration for this great student body. There are so many things you are already doing to help that I could give an entire talk on this subject. I will single out only one more.<br><br>The final provision of our Code of Honor obligates each of us to "help others fulfill their responsibilities under this Code." This has so many implications. I have already suggested that each of us be supportive of our Dress and Grooming Standards, sharing gentle reminders with our fellow students who are thoughtless on this subject. But there are many more important aspects. Thus your efforts to encourage your fellow students to observe the principles of our Code of Honor may save them from more serious offenses. I have already referred to the young men who were dismissed for using drugs, an action that saved at least one of them from deeper involvement as a seller. To cite a different kind of case, in the last month many of us have grieved over the press accounts of several instances in which the vicious crime of rape has been committed on young women, including BYU students, in off-campus housing in Provo. I am sure that every citizen in this community would rush to the aid of a girl threatened with this crime. Few of us are likely to be called upon in that rare circumstance, but we can all be alert to notice persons who are present at times and in places where they obviously do not belong, reporting them to appropriate authorities where wisdom dictates. And we can all urge our sisters to use appropriate precautions in locking their doors, in not appearing scantily clad in places visible to the outside, and in not letting themselves get into remote places with strange men.<br><br>A student who is aware of serious behavioral irregularities on the part of a roommate or another fellow student--such as drinking, drug abuse, or sexual misconduct--cannot conscientiously ignore that behavior. The love and concern we owe our fellowmen should not permit us to withdraw into the cowardice of "It doesn't concern me; it's his life--not mine." That position is contrary to the whole spirit of love and Christian brotherhood embodied in the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is also contrary to the responsibility that has been laid upon every member of the Church to preach the gospel of repentance. In a talk given in a ten-stake fireside a year ago, President Marion G. Romney of the First Presidency told thousands of students assembled in this hall that if they knew of any fornicators or drug users it was their duty to do what they could to bring them to repentance, failing which, he said, "they must be removed from the campus."<br><br>A person with observable tendencies to violence, sexual misconduct, drug abuse, or thievery should be put in the hands of persons who can help him. If we refrain from reporting a person of this character, we share the blame for the harm that person may later do to others. The<i>law</i>does not require such affirmative action to help a weak person who may do wrong to himself or another, but the<i>gospel</i>does. The Lord has declared that if LDS parents fail to teach their children correct principles, the sin is upon their heads (see D&amp;amp;C 68:25). We are told that we should not have to be commanded in all things, that we are responsible to bring to pass much righteousness and to do many things of our own free will (see D&amp;amp;C 58:26–28). The Lord has also told us that we are responsible to "succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees" (D&amp;amp;C 81:5). All of that is involved in the loving encouragement each of us should exert upon one another to fulfill all of our responsibilities under the Code of Honor.<br><h2><b>Thoughts on an Education at Brigham Young University</b></h2><br>In the time that remains I will speak about the unique opportunities of a university education. My purpose is to stir up your minds to a bright consciousness of why you are here at Brigham Young University and to suggest some ways to make the most of your opportunities.<br><br>I begin with a conversation I had with one of our young men students last spring. I was walking by the tennis courts. He was waiting for a game. Finding out that he had just come to BYU as a transfer student from a junior college on the West Coast, I asked him to tell me about his experience at BYU.<br><br>"Well, I don't know much about the studies yet," he responded, "but the social life is sure great, and that's what it's all about here at the Y, isn't it?"<br><br>I ground my teeth at that answer. What I wanted to reply was: "No, you featherheaded, indolent child, social life<i>isn't</i>what it's all about. This is a university.<i>Learning</i>is what it's all about. You are here to get an education."<br><br>Instead I managed a gentler suggestion that he ought to discover some other purpose for his enrollment or his stay would be frustrating and short. Now this young man meant no harm. He was suffering from a misapprehension whose victims are all too common among our students, alumni, and supporters. It concerns the purposes and functions of this university.<br><br>Let us banish forever the illusion that Brigham Young University exists for any purpose other than to provide a university education. Social life, physical exercise, Church activity, cultural development, good times--all these are here. We deem all of them essential ingredients of a university education. As for the opportunity for our choice young men and women to meet and marry someone of their own faith, we consider that a welcome<i>by-product</i>of the coeducational enterprise. But none of these ingredients is sufficient in itself or in combination to justify the enormous capital investment and annual financial support appropriated to Brigham Young University. Each of these other activities could be conducted separately and economically in your own home areas.<br><br>Our reason for being is to be a university. Your reason for enrolling is to pursue a university education. Persons who are here for any other reason or who fail to measure up to this challenge with all their hearts and abilities have come to the wrong place.<br><br>I rejoice in our freedom--indeed our duty--to pursue knowledge in its broadest sphere. In an important address given on this campus by assignment of the First Presidency, President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., made this significant statement:<br><br><i>In all his promises and commandments about gaining knowledge, the Lord has never withheld from our quest any field of truth. Our knowledge is to be coterminous with the universe and is to reach out and to comprehend the laws and the workings of the vast deeps of the eternities. All domains of all knowledge belong to us. In no other way could the great law of eternal progression be satisfied.</i>["Charge to President Howard S. McDonald at His Inauguration as President of the Brigham Young University on November 14, 1945,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 49, no. 1 (January 1946): 15]<br><br>This thought was further emphasized and elaborated by President Harold B. Lee in his great charge to the president at my own inauguration:<br><br><i>Brigham Young University, indeed the whole educational system of this Church, has been established to the end that all pure knowledge must be gained by our people, handed down to our posterity, and given to all men.</i><br><br><i>We charge you to give constant stimulation to these budding scientists and scholars in all fields and to the urge to push back further and further into the realms of the unknown.</i>["Installation of and Charge to the President," delivered at the inauguration of Dallin Harris Oaks, 12 November 1971, p. 14]<br><br>Properly understood, these challenges run to every student, teacher, and other worker at this university.<br><br>Keep uppermost in your mind at all times the fact that you are here to gain an education. Lift your eyes to the total horizon of knowledge we promote in this university. Remember Brigham Young's great insight that education is power: "Education is the power to think clearly, the power to act well in the world's work, and the power to appreciate life" (quoted by George H. Brimhall in "The Brigham Young University,"<i>Improvement Era,</i>vol. 23, no. 9 [July 1920]: 831). Strive for harmonious growth of body, mind, and spirit. Participate in the activities and put forth the effort to make your stay at Brigham Young University a time of intellectual growth, artistic sensitivity, physical vigor, exemplary personal behavior, and spiritual progress.<br><br>I have already urged you to maintain an active religious life during your studies, referring particularly to Church activity. But our concerns with spirituality go farther than that and permeate all of our other activities in the university. Brigham Young University provides a unique educational experience.<br><br><i>What makes us unique is the spiritual dimension we provide. By spiritual dimension, I mean our faith in God the Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, our devotion to the principles of the restored gospel, our concern with personal behavior, and our commitment to the essential harmony of secular learning and the spiritual values that embody all truth.</i>[Dallin H. Oaks, "Response," delivered at his inauguration as president of Brigham Young University, 12 November 1971, p. 18]<br><br>Our spiritual concerns come into focus in the religion classes required of all who attend this university. If you pursue these studies with diligence, you will increase your knowledge of the spiritual powers that are within you, illuminating all of your other studies and guiding you throughout your life.<br><br>Your university experience should also be a time to cultivate a heightened appreciation for the creative arts. Learn to recognize what is "virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy" (Articles of Faith 1:13). Cultivate your inborn sensitivity to what is beautiful and seek after those things.<br><br>Don't neglect physical fitness. Proper food, rest, and exercise are essential to the vigor of the body and also to the sharpness of the mind.<br><br>Though most of our students have no need of this advice, a few need to be reminded that their university experience should also include opportunity for growth in social skills, improving their ability to associate gracefully with a variety of men and women in different circumstances.<br><br>Last, but most important, because of the unique mission of the university, every student at BYU should make his or her stay here a time of great advance in intellect. Take up the challenge of learning. Raise your sights and aspirations. Reach out for knowledge. Expand your vision. Stretch your mind with new ideas. Learn precision in thought and expression. Develop your awareness and deepen your understanding of the world in which we live. Strive for excellence in all your studies. Budget your time. Do not use other activities, valuable or otherwise, as an excuse to neglect your studies. In this connection I urge you to remember that Monday evenings and Tuesday evenings should be planned to permit you to take part in a home evening activity of not more than an hour and a half and MIA activities of appropriate duration, with ample time remaining for study activities on both evenings. Remember that this is a university and you are here to gain an education.<br><br>Cultivate balance and be thoughtful in the choice of your courses and the allocation of your time so that you can benefit from all that is available at this university. A university is like a great smorgasbord of opportunities for learning and experience. The wise student will sample widely and gather a variety of knowledge and experience that will prepare him or her to serve well in a multitude of life's activities. Don't make the error of the inexperienced person who circles the smorgasbord until he sees one or two foods that are familiar and desirable and then fills his plate with those to the exclusion of the wondrous variety that remains. Like the person who makes out a meal on black olives and jello salad, the university student who concentrates on skiing and student government or who specializes in performing groups and a handful of major courses or who fills his plate with competitive athletics and social activities never learns what a university is all about and never partakes of the wondrous variety and harmony of a university education.<br><br>The initiative and responsibility are yours. You make the choices and arrange the time to reap the benefits. In this connection I urge you to support one another by mutual cooperation and encouragement in all study activities. I have been deeply concerned at reports of student interference with other students' study activities: loud noises, harassment, horseplay, and other nonsense activities, which have sometimes prevented serious students from studying in our on-campus and off-campus housing. Such interference frustrates or prevents a brother or sister from achieving his or her goals at the university. It is inexcusable and should be the subject of prompt and appropriate corrective action. But to those who are the victims of this kind of interference, I say: Don't blame poor academic performance on a roommate. If your surroundings are intolerable for study, you are responsible to change them, either permanently by moving or temporarily by studying in the library or elsewhere. We provide the library, which we are seeking to enlarge with the cooperation and efforts of our Student Development Association, but it is up to you to take the initiative to use this and every other learning opportunity.<br><br>Honor the teachers who challenge you to choose excellence. Both you and your teachers should be dissatisfied until your performance has risen to the best that is in you.<br><br>In a society grounded on the brotherhood of the gospel it is difficult for teachers to give and for students to receive low grades, even for inferior performance. Yet teachers do you no favor when they reward substandard performance or fail to challenge you to do your best.<br><br>Despite the obvious importance of high academic standards, the standards set for you by your teachers and by the university are far less important than the standards you set for yourself. Your own pride and desire for improvement should not allow you to be comfortable with a level of performance in any area that is less than your best. Be your own severest taskmaster. The self-discipline and skills you acquire by this means will be far more important in the long run than the grades you receive, whether they are high or low.<br><br>The highest councils in the world--in government, professions, business, arts, letters, science, or any other area--are composed of men and women of no greater natural ability than the young men and women in this student body. There is no town so small and there are no origins so humble that they have not produced the greatest men and women in the world. The list of such people who have graduated from Brigham Young University is long and proud. In almost every case, what brings men and women out of the crowd and up to the pinnacle of achievement is the high standards they have set for themselves, their iron will, and their extraordinary efforts. Anyone can drift with the crowd, but notable accomplishments invariably require overtime. I love the lines in Longfellow's poem:<br><br><i>The heights by great men reached and kept</i><br><i>Were not attained by sudden flight,</i><br><i>But they, while their companions slept,</i><br><i>Were toiling upward in the night.</i><br><br>["The Ladder of St. Augustine" (1858), stanza 10]<br><br>The gospel teaches us that we are the sons and daughters of God. That fact identifies our destiny and the ultimate goal for which we strive. Your education, all that you learn and do, should contribute to that destiny. The road toward perfection is long and arduous. There are many mileposts along the way. Your formal education is only one of them. The road leads on to others. We prepare now for them. Make yourself ready while you are here. The challenges will come, sooner and more magnificent than you dream. Will you be ready? The breadth of your education and the purity of your life should prepare you for challenges in parenthood, church service, community leadership, and employment. Use your opportunities to prepare yourself for the responsibilities the world will place upon you. May our Father in heaven help us that we may help you, and help you that you may help yourself, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Dallin H. Oaks was president of Brigham Young University when this address was given at an assembly on 6 September 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.</i>

<h1> to the Royal Within You - Harold B. Lee - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters, I am overwhelmed at this magnificent audience of over 23,000, according to President Oaks's estimate. The background screen has been raised so that those sitting behind the screen could have a place in sight of all of us. Thank you, you wonderful brothers and sisters--my friends, in the same sense that the Master called his disciples friends; not servants, but friends.<br><br>I am delighted to be with you. While my schedule does not permit me to have this wonderful experience very often, I said to the brethren, "I think it has been so long since I was here last that you probably have recovered from my last visit." I would like you to know, however, that my thoughts have often been with you, when I have not been on the campus. You have never been absent from my mind, as one of the greatest student bodies of the world, and, I think, with no exception.<br><br>I am more grateful than I have words to express for this award that I have received. No one who seeks to serve our exemplary Master, as I desire to do, can take lightly the honor that you have accorded me, for I realize that He alone is the perfect model. The Master said, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Some people scoff at that, saying, "How can we be made perfect, even as He is perfect?" But the Prophet-Leader of this Church declared "that it is like a ladder in this Church: you climb step by step, until you arrive at the top. But it will be a long while after we go through the veil until we have reached the fullness of the glories of the Celestial Kingdom."<br><br>In a revelation, the Lord has declared that those who live the laws of the celestial kingdom here, when they pass through the veil and are resurrected, will be quickened by a portion of celestial glory and then will continue onward until they receive the perfectness (D&amp;amp;C 88:28–29). Only then can I be satisfied that I could be the model, when I shall have arrived at that place where the Lord wants us all to arrive. Nevertheless, I want to express appreciation to those who have made this presentation to me and for this opportunity to speak to so many of you in this special setting--so many of you that I am overwhelmed, that I confess that I am very nervous as I stand before you, wondering if I have enough of what it takes to address such an audience.<br><h2><b>Humility</b></h2><br>When I was a stake president, I called to serve as the junior member of the high council a man who had at one time been in the stake presidency. I asked him if he had any diffidence in accepting this junior position, and he replied, "The only honor there is in any position in this church is the honor that we, ourselves, bring to it. It doesn't make any difference where I serve, or when."<br><br>I echo that same sentiment here today. The only honor there is in any position, in that one sense, means that no matter where we are or what we may be called, it is the honor that we, ourselves, bring to it that makes all the difference in the world.<br><br>Some who have had an illustrious heritage seem at times to be boastful. Someone has said, "Humility is a rare virtue. When most people become humble, they soon become proud they are humble." I was in the New England Mission when there were some high-named missionaries there. They had the names of Grant, and Madsen, and Kimball, and Smith, and so on; and some of them had only names like Lee and Jones. And those with high-sounding names, so the mission president said, felt themselves very superior. I shall never forget when our good friend, President S. Dilworth Young, stood before a group of those who were shrinking back, thinking that they were not so popular, and said, "Let me tell you folks something. You may not<i>have</i>illustrious ancestors, but each of you can<i>become</i>a great ancestor." And it is that which I say to you folks here today.<br><h2><b>Blessings Contingent upon Obedience</b></h2><br>I heard President Howard Bennion, who was a scribe for his father, a patriarch, tell about listening to many of the blessings of his father. He noticed in these patriarchal blessings that they were contingent upon "if you do this," or "if you do that." He said, "I began to call them 'iffy blessings.'" He said, "As I watched and had in mind those men to whom those 'iffy' blessings had been given, . . . I noticed that those who did not heed the warnings fell by the wayside."<br><br>As you know, that started me to thinking. I looked back through the revelations in the early rise of this church, and I found that the Lord had given 'iffy' revelations to many of the early leaders. If you want an interesting exercise, read what the Lord said about William E. McLellin, or what he said and what he warned about Thomas B. Marsh; and because they did not heed that warning, as others did, they failed. They lost their testimony and fell by the wayside.<br><br>I repeat to you here this morning something President Grant once said that rather startled me. He said he had heard of men who declared that they had had a personal visitation from the Lord. And then President Grant added, "Some of those who had that experience lost their testimonies. It seemed that they became puffed up in the pride of their hearts, perhaps thinking that they were more special to the Lord than others who had not received the same experience." And I say when one receives that kind of a visitation, it must be that he has had a vision; for, as Moses said, one couldn't stand in the presence of the Lord except he had been quickened by the Spirit of the Lord (Moses 1:13–15). As the Lord said in a revelation to the Prophet:<br><br><i>For no man has seen God at any time in the flesh except quickened by the Spirit of God.</i><br><br><i>Neither can any natural man abide the presence of God, neither after the carnal mind.</i><br><br><i>Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of angels; wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 67:11–13]<br><br>As I have thought of that, I am sobered by it. As I pray for the guidance of the Spirit, and seek to rise to the responsibility which has been given me, I don't ask for any special endowment. I ask only to go where the Lord would have me go, and only to receive what the Lord would have me receive, knowing that more important than sight is the witness that one may have by the witness of the Holy Ghost to his soul that things are so and that Jesus is the Christ, a living personage. It is that which guides me through many of the experiences of life.<br><h2><b>A Balanced Education</b></h2><br>Because I cannot come to this campus very often, there are several things I wish to say that may be preliminary, in a sense, to my basic remarks to you; there are many things I would like to say that I may not have the time to say.<br><br>The men and women who are admitted to Brigham Young University are encouraged to pursue an education that is concerned with the spiritual, the intellectual, the cultural, and the physical aspects of their nature. The Board of Trustees expects our students to be diligent in using the resources of this great institution in acquiring this kind of education. One of the most important skills that you can learn at this university is the ability to budget your time carefully. You should certainly provide sufficient time for Church service, time for attention to your family responsibilities, and time for adequate but not excessive social activity. All these things are important, but you should devote most of your time to the acquiring of an education. This is the central objective of your university years, and in many cases your parents' sacrifices make it possible for you to come here. Education is also the major reason for the Church's enormous commitment, financially speaking, to this and its other institutions of higher education.<br><br>"Why has the Church been concerned over the years about the maintaining of schools for learning in secular subjects?" we are often asked. And our answer is, "To develop the whole person and not just the intellectual--that we want those who graduate from this university to be not just intellectually but spiritually, and culturally, and physically developed." I am reminded of the story told of the boy who went to college and obtained a part-time job chopping wood, to work his way through school. Others, seeing his proficiency in chopping wood, asked for his services, and he accepted. He soon had so many of these offers that he began to neglect his studies and became a woodchopper and never completed his education. Now I have no quarrel with being a woodchopper, but that wasn't the purpose of his going to that institution. You can get that kind of an education elsewhere. So, keep in mind that the prime purpose of coming here is to get the kind of basic education that balances and prepares you for the battle of life.<br><br>I listened some years ago to a startling confession of a man who stood in a high place. I shall speak carefulIy of this, lest you try to identify him. He said he had gone to a midwest university, where he received his Ph.D. in education. His father, who was in the Presidency of the Church, went to his graduation exercises and, after the exercises were over, took him to lunch and said to him, "My boy, for eight years now you have done very little in the Church. You have gone through your college years, and now you have gone through your Ph.D. years, and you haven't been very active in the Church. I want you to promise me that when you get back home you will get active in the Church."<br><br>But the son said, "When I returned home, to my shocking surprise, the boys with whom I had graduated from high school had grown spiritually until they were Ph.D.'s in religion, but I was still in the high school age. I had laid aside my religion for eight years."<br><br>As I listened to that rather sad confession, and being closely associated with that man, I watched him go through the rest of his life. He never did have his spiritual self catch up with that intellectual side. The result was that he failed to take the counsel of his father. He went through life making decisions by his own measure of what was right and wrong, and finally he lost his place in the Church and was excommunicated because of his conduct. I say, as you think of that, it should be a warning to all of us that we must keep our spiritual selves as alive and growing as our intellectual selves.<br><br>I listened to an excerpt of a testimony of a man who was a member of the Twelve and of whom President Grant had said that he never knew a man who had a greater gift of prophecy than did this man. There was put in my hands a quotation from a sermon that he had delivered some fifty years before, which proved to be the last sermon he had ever delivered as a member of the Twelve. Before another conference, he was dropped from the Council of the Twelve and subsequently left the Church. This is what he said, in that last sermon: "That person is not truly converted unless he sees the power of God resting upon the leaders of this Church and it goes down into his heart like fire." And I repeat that to you here today. The measure of your true conversion and whether or not you hold fast to those ideals is whether or not you are so living that you see the power of God resting upon the leaders of this Church and that testimony goes down into your heart like fire.<br><br>With these illustrations, perhaps I can impress upon you again what I have said to you before, especially some things that I said at the inauguration of President Dallin Oaks in 1971. The First Presidency had previously declared that because of its unique combination of revealed and secular learning, Brigham Young University is destined to become a leader among the great universities of the world. If that lofty goal is to be obtained, it must be based upon the extraordinary efforts of the students of Brigham Young University, as well as the dedicated and skillful instruction and research of faculty and staff of the university. And I added at that inaugural exercise, "The acquiring of knowledge by faith is no easy road to learning. It will demand strenuous effort and continual striving by faith. In short, learning by faith is no task for a lazy man." Someone has said, in effect, that, "such a process requires the bending of the whole soul, the calling up from the depths of the human mind and linking the person with God. The right connection must be formed; then only comes knowledge by faith, a kind of knowledge that goes beyond secular learning, that reaches into the realms of the unknown and makes those who follow that course great in the sight of the Lord" (President Brigham H. Roberts).<br><br>In seeking this balance between things academic and spiritual, we, of course, hope that you will conduct your lives in a way that will reflect credit upon you, upon your parents, upon the Church, and upon this university. Now, one word of caution about overstressing your religious opportunities to the neglect of your college studies or your family responsibilities.<br><br>We have had shocking examples of Church leaders in some stakes and wards who have seemingly used their business and Church assignments as excuses for neglecting their families. In one case I heard a wife say, "Because he was so much away in his business and his Church responsibilities, I was just little more than a hired woman in his house." I have frequently counseled, and I repeat it to you again, to all of you here:<i>"The most important of the Lord's work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes."</i>We must never forget that.<br><h2><b>Standards of Conduct and Appearance</b></h2><br>Your code of honor, which has been spoken of, contains important principles of conduct that the First Presidency and the Board of Trustees expect all students and employees of this university to maintain. I was greatly pleased with the address of President Oaks on this subject at your opening assembly, as reported in the press. Now, I only had a brief report, and I'm anxious to get a copy of the complete text. May I merely say, however, that I heartily endorse all that I did read, and because of my confidence in President Oaks, I endorse all that he said that I didn't read.<br><br>Without belaboring this subject, may I merely say: do not underestimate the important symbolic and actual effect of appearance. Persons who are well groomed and modestly dressed invite the companionship of the Spirit of our Father in heaven and are able to exercise a wholesome influence upon those around them. Persons who are unkempt and careless about their appearance, or adopt the visual symbols of those who often oppose our ideals, expose themselves and persons around them to influences that are degrading and dissonant.<br><h2><b>The Home</b></h2><br>Outward appearance is often a reflection of inward tendencies. Someone has said that a shoddy housekeeper is more often than not the evidence of an unsuccessful manager of her household. And may I add, so often is it the reflection of the kind of treatment she gets from her husband. An author once said, "The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother." And I would add to that, "A woman happy with her husband is better for her children than a hundred books on child welfare."<br><br>It was Samuel Smiles, a philosopher, who once said, "It is a common saying that manners make the man. There is another saying that mind makes the man. But truer than either, the third, the home makes the man, for the home training includes not only manners and mind but character as well. It is mainly in the home that the heart is touched, habits are formed, the intellect is awakened, and character is molded."<br><br>Recently in one of our wards a young girl in her late teens said in her talk something that was very meaningful. She was out with her father in the country where they lived, helping him with the chores. They made their living milking cows. At four o'clock in the morning, as they began their work, the father said to her, "My girl, you are the product of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and you are also the product of a Latter-day Saint home. If you fail, your church and your home have failed also." And then this girl added, "That was impressed upon my mind, that I had a responsibility to the church to which I belonged and the home from which I had come."<br><br>President Oaks and I were talking at our last board meeting, and I commented upon the high standards of BYU conduct as I had observed it then and had learned of them from others. He remarked that most importantly the reason for that kind of conduct was that most of the students have come from true Latter-day Saint homes. That, you students must realize, is the fundamental basis of what we are trying to impress here, right conduct.<br><br>We had a visit here from Mr. Eugene R. Black, former president of the World Bank. I became associated with him when I was a fellow director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He had come here to participate in a businessmen's seminar at the Y. After he returned to New York, and at our next board meeting, I was anxious to get his appraisal of what he had seen and heard here. His comment was to this effect: "John W. Gardner [and many of you know who John W. Gardner is] must see this as a model for college campuses, because of its superb high standards. I have never seen the equal anywhere in all the world." Now here is a man of world learning and world experience.<br><h2><b>The Role of the Wife</b></h2><br>Now, just a word to women students, in this day, when so much is being said about the prime role of the woman. We say the prime role in life for a woman is to become a wife and a mother. It is wise for young women also to receive a proper education. You might think of your education as an insurance against the uncertainties of life. As Mark Twain said of his daughter, Susan, who died when she was twenty-five years of age--he was on a lecture tour in Europe and couldn't be home, but when he wrote about her he said, "Susie died at the best time of life. She had lived her golden years, for after this, there come the risks and the responsibilities and the inevitable tragedies of life." No one knows what those inevitable tragedies may be. And it is well that we educate our women as well as our brethren as an insurance against the inevitable tragedies that come--disabled husbands, widows. I would caution, however, that a husband, when his wife works, not thereafter expect perpetual care and aid from his wife, but rather he should assume his own responsibilities in his family. I think careless husbands may often expect more than a wife should be expected to give.<br><br>One of our daughters graduated from this school. She received a minor in childhood education, and afterwards she, with the wife of one of the students down at Stanford, in order to help their husbands, obtained a license to conduct a small nursery. They were getting along very well, until both of them began to prepare for new motherhood. So the public nursery had to give way to their own private nurseries. Our other daughter didn't quite graduate from the University of Utah--she's here on the stand--because she found a higher education for herself. She has been just as successful as a mother because she never lost her desire for education beyond the college education. Educational opportunities for learning shouldn't end with marriage; a mother should keep herself aware of what is going on in the world so that she can keep pace with the learning of her growing-up family. If her husband has been a college student, the more she can make herself come to understand the problems in his life, and he in her life, the more likelihood there is that there will be a successful marriage relationship.<br><h2><b>The Husband's Responsibility</b></h2><br>Now I'd like to say a word to the men and their responsibilities to women. I had a very revealing letter from a cultured, college-trained wife and mother of four children, from up near Ogden. She was writing in answer to the question why so many women are leaving their home and family responsibilities. I suppose thinking of the so-called women's liberation, she wrote, "It may not be her fault, nor her husband's alone, if there be a fault-finder for each situation in our lives, yet I feel strongly that the religionists of today must take partial credit for the loss of a woman from her home, because in the system of secular teaching, the marriage is only till death do them part. Well, in this sophisticated society," she argued, "with a husband engaged furiously in building his career without the need of his wife's educational help or confidence--and highway deaths occurring at a rapidly alarming rate during the last twenty years--if she doesn't 'fit' into one's world, she might say, 'Why wait for death? Why not leave now? Why not, while I still have youth and brains and can find companionship on my own level?'" Then she added, "When religion teaches only a temporary binding, why adhere to such a counterfeit binding? Especially where the husband takes his wife for granted." And then continuing her comments:<br><br>"And don't be startled, you husbands, when I say many, many men, I'm afraid, do just that. Men are sadly neglected in today's world in not being taught high appreciation for their wives, throughout life. There is always the courting-flavor of appreciation from the men until the marriage-bed has been accomplished, and also, until the first child appears on the scene. How many men are literally prepared for the advent of a son or daughter in the home immediately? Some men actually seem to resent the 'intrusion' of their own children into the world, because these seemingly take the affections of their wives away from them. In view of this attitude on the part of the males in marriage, where has the educational aspect of marriage gone astray for men in this last generation? If the religious world teaches that marriage is only till death do them part, that kind of temporary binding is not the kind that endures." But I say to you today, thank heaven that in this church, by the power of the priesthood, marriages are performed not only for time but for all eternity.<br><h2><b>On These Three Things . . .</b></h2><br>And then this cultured mother went on to give some "old-fashioned words that have meaning for successful living: There are a few words that have real meaning, so let's try a few of them. How about honesty? How about charity? How about faith, morality, character, intelligence? You might say we know that everyone has intelligence, especially if he's been to a university and been educated, but I beg to differ. Being given an education does not mean that a man is educated, any more than having knowledge makes a man have intelligence. Intelligence is using knowledge with wisdom. How many of our actions in the world require wisdom, real wisdom, that which is beneficial for other men, and not to build self, except in a worthwhile way? For that is the place of each of these old-fashioned qualities. Yes, to build other men and women and children, to teach them to rise up and sing in their glory at being alive, and to be able to help other men and women and children find the joy in this life." And then she concluded her letter with something rather significant: "I married my husband for better or worse. My marriage may not be perfect, but I will work as hard as I can to make it better. I love America. I love my husband. I love my children. I love my God. And why is this possible? Because I truly love myself also."<br><br>These are certainly some sobering thoughts for you men: I agree with the wife who said, "You men must put 'for adults only' movies out of your life. You men must put 'adults only' magazines out of your life. You must put 'adult humor only' out of your life. These three things alone will destroy you." Remember what the Lord said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself" (Luke 10:27). Brethren, if you truly believe what the Master said, to love your neighbor as yourself, then turn it about and get the inference of the Master's further injunction, to love yourself as well as to love your neighbor, as this wife has said.<br><br>On these three things hang all the burden of the law and the gospel: the love of God, the love of neighbor, and the love of yourself. In this day when so many seem to have lost the desire for decency, the desire for perfection, may we teach them to pray, as did the old English weaver, "O God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself."<br><h2><b>Follow Those Who Preside</b></h2><br>Now, you have given me a most prized award of exemplary manhood. By this token, you apparently have accepted me as someone who has all that exemplary manhood should have. I shall try to be worthy of the honor that you have conferred.<br><br>Now may I make a personal reference, which I'll try to treat in such a way as to preserve the confidentiality. It involved a beautiful, young wife and mother from a prominent family. She had gone away from her home and was now in the East. She had gone out into an area where she and her husband had taken up with those in the ghetto, and she wrote me a rather interesting letter, and I quote only a paragraph: "Tomorrow my husband will shave off his long, full beard. Because of the request of the stake president and your direction in the<i>Priesthood Bulletin,</i>he must not have the appearance of evil or rebellion if he is to get a recommend to go to the temple. I have wept anguished tears; the faces of Moses and Jacob were bearded, and to me the wisdom and spirituality of the old prophets reflected from the face of my own spiritual husband. It was like cutting out for me a symbol of the good things my generation has learned." Then the letter concluded with a challenge to me: "We are prepared for clear, specific, hard-line direction as youth. Wishy-washy implications are not heard very well here. We look to you to tell it straight."<br><br>I don't know whether she knew just what she was asking for when she asked me to tell it straight, but these are some things I wrote to her: "In your letter you address me as 'Dear President Lee,' and in your first sentence you refer to me as the Lord's prophet. Now, in your letter you tell me that you are saddened because with the shaving off of the beard and the cutting of the hair, which, to you, made your husband appear as the prophets Moses and Jacob, he would no longer bear that resemblance. I wonder if you might not be wiser to think of following the appearance of the prophets of today. President David O. McKay had no beard or long hair; neither did President Joseph Fielding Smith; and neither does your humble servant whom you have acknowledged as the Lord's prophet.<br><br>"The inconsistency in your letter has made me reflect upon an experience that I had in the mission field when, in company with some missionaries and the mission president, we were at Carthage Jail, where the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph and his brother, Hyrum, took place. In that meeting there were recounted the events that led up to their martyrdom. Then the mission president made some significant comments. He said, 'When the Prophet Joseph Smith died there were many who died spiritually with Joseph.' Likewise there were many who died spiritually with Brigham Young, and so with others of the presidents of the Church, because they chose to follow the man who had passed on, rather than giving allegiance to his successor upon whom the mantle of leadership had been given by the Lord's appointment." And then I asked her, "Are you following, in looks, prophets who lived hundreds of years ago? Are you really true to your faith as a member of the Church in failing to look to those who preside in the Church today? Why is it that you want your husband to look like Moses and Jacob, rather than to look like the modern prophets to whom you are expressing allegiance? If you will give this sober thought, your tears will dry, and you'll begin to have some new thoughts."<br><br>My final advice to you lovely girls who are present, perhaps likewise struggling for answers to difficult questions: Accept this word of counsel and apply it to yourselves, you girls, and you young men. Keep your eye upon those who preside in the Church today, or tomorrow, and pattern your life after them rather than to dwell upon how ancient prophets may have looked or thought or spoken, because if you really believe what you say, you will honor the one who presides today as a prophet, seer, and revelator. For the Lord gives to his leaders in their own dispensation and their own time the things that he would have given to his church for the guidance of his people in this present day. This is the thing that makes this church strong. God isn't an absentee father. Jesus is the head of this church. This church is founded upon apostles and prophets, but Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, is the chief cornerstone. He reveals his mind and will by the power of the Holy Ghost to those who preside, as each President of the Church can testify. Today we see the evidence of His direction as we are seeing His work going forward day by day in our time. Well, that letter seemed to bear fruit, because I had another letter from this sweet sister. She said something that pleased me: "I recall the trials of last week basically being a challenge to my sense of individuality. I have a finer understanding of others now. I also see that, like the Council of the Twelve, we may have individual viewpoints, but each is necessary in the deliberation. Yet by our decision through the mediating and truthful power of the Holy Ghost, we will become of one mind without force. Again I feel refreshed in the blessings which always follow difficulties. I've pondered on these experiences and wonder why I felt pressed to share them only with you. I trust you will know. We all long to counsel with a wise man and take comfort in the Lord. Perhaps I wrote my prayer."<br><br>And then she said something that thrilled me, "God bless you, President Lee, that your voice may be heard above the chaos of these days." That is my plea to you today. With chaos in the world, unless the voice of those who preside today can be heard above the voices of chaos in these days, where are you going to look? Where are you going to go?<br><h2><b>Remember Your Heritage</b></h2><br>Now, a final injunction to womanhood. I think President McKay has left us with one of the most beautiful messages to point out how valuable you are to a young man if you keep yourself a sweet, pure girl. And I wish that everyone of you could remember this and perhaps get a copy of it, to write it somewhere where you could read it every day of your life. And this is what he said:<br><br><i>But there is a beauty every girl has, a gift from God as pure as sunlight and sacred as life. It is a beauty that all men love, a virtue that wins all men's souls. That beauty is chastity. Chastity without skin beauty may enkindle the soul. Skin beauty without chastity may enkindle only the eyes. Chastity enshrined in the mold of true womanhood will hold true love eternally.</i><br><br>Now note this, as he closed his statement:<br><br><i>The flower by the roadside that catches the dust of every traveler is not the one to be admired and seldom is ever plucked. But the one blooming way up on the hillside, protected by the perpendicular cliff, is the flower with the virgin perfume, the one that the boy will almost risk his life to possess.</i><br><br>Do you girls get the meaning of that last statement? Don't be a flower by the roadside that catches the dust by becoming a plaything for a young man who doesn't appreciate your womanhood. But be like a flower blooming up on the hillside, protected by a high cliff, with your virgin perfume, so that you will be the one whom a fine handsome young man will almost risk his life to possess.<br><br>I say to you girls--and you men, I hope you listen to this--beware of the man who comes to you professing that he loves you and then seeks to destroy and rob you of the most precious thing you have in life. No man loves the girl that he wants to harm, and don't you forget it.<br><br>May I just offer one or two more thoughts. One of our Latter-day Saint men during World War II was over in England. He had gone to an officer's club where they were holding a riotous kind of celebration. He noticed off to the side a young British officer who didn't seem to be enjoying himself at all. So he walked over to him and said, "You don't seem to be enjoying this kind of a party." And this young British officer straightened himself a few inches taller than he was before and replied, "No, sir, I can't engage in this kind of a party, because, you see, I belong to the royal household of England."<br><br>As our Latter-day Saint boy walked away he said to himself, "Neither can I, because I belong to the royal household of the kingdom of God." Do you realize that, you young people? There are things that you cannot and must not do if you remember your heritage.<br><br>I am reminded of the old court jester who was supposed to entertain his king with interesting stories and antics. He looked at the king who was lolling on his throne, a drunken, filthy rascal, doffed his cap and bells, and said with a mock gesture of obeisance, "O king, be loyal to the royal within you." And so I say to you young people today, remember your heritage, and be loyal to that royal lineage that you have as members of the church and kingdom of God on the earth.<br><h2><b>The Lord's in His Heaven</b></h2><br>A young missionary spoke to me in the temple yesterday, after we had had an hour or so of questions, and said, "I represent these missionaries in telling you we have respect for you, but will you tell us something that will strengthen our testimonies and make us better prepared to go out as missionaries?"<br><br>I responded by saying, "Well, let me share with you an experience I had with one of our business executives. His wife and children are members, but he is not. His twin sons are attending Brigham Young University, and one of them is planning to be married in the temple next year. But he said to me, 'I can't join the Church until I get a testimony.' I said to him, 'The next time you are in Salt Lake, come in and visit with me.' As we talked following our business meeting a few weeks later I said to him, 'I don't know if you realize whether you have a testimony or not; or if you know what a testimony is.' And so he wanted to know what a testimony is. I answered him by saying, 'When the time comes that your heart tells you things your mind doesn't know, that is the Spirit of the Lord dictating to you.' And then I said, 'As I've come to know you, there are things that you know in your heart are true. No angel is going to tap you on the shoulder and tell you this is true.'" The Spirit of the Lord is as the Master said:<br><br><i>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.</i>[John 3:8]<br><br>So I said to my friend, the business executive: "Now, remember that your testimony won't come in a dramatic way, but when it comes, the tears of gladness will water your pillow by night. You'll know, my beloved friend, when that testimony comes."<br><br>This morning my lovely Joan handed me something that gave me strength--because I knew throughout the night she was troubled and worrying about me, I suppose more than I was worrying about myself in preparation for this morning. She handed me something that had been written by one of our great teachers, the late Elder Adam S. Bennion. It was this: "Whenever we live to the best that is in us, we live up to the ideals He gave us." Did you get that? "When we live to the best that is in us, we live up to the ideals that the Master gave us. To follow Him brings peace to the soul." Then he had a quote from a writer who said something significant:<br><br><i>It isn't the wreaths in the windows,</i><br><i>It isn't the shining tree,</i><br><i>Or the children, rapt and waiting,</i><br><i>Brings Christmas to you and me.</i><br><br><i>It's the marvelous self-forgetting,</i><br><i>It's the thoughts we are sending far,</i><br><i>It's our hearts aglow, uplifted,</i><br><i>It's a wonderful guiding star.</i><br>[By Alex Thorn]<br><br>Yes, you young people, He is there. The Lord is in his heaven, and all is right with your world if you keep his commandments. He spoke to the weeping Martha, who was mourning the death of her brother Lazarus. He looked at her as she wept, kneeling there at his feet, and declared, "I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." Then he asked the question, "Believest thou this?" Tears now were gone, and she replied, "Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world" (John 11:25–27).<br><br>You Latter-day Saints, the youth of the noble birthright, if you can say, as Martha said, "Yea, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world"--if you can say that and know that he is in his heaven, and you believe that with all your soul, you will not be trapped in the pitfalls of life. I can say to you young people that I know--as did Martha in that flash of testimony--I know that he is up there. He is there, and he is closer to this church than you have any idea that he is. He is the resurrection and the life. And though you were dead, yet shall you live. As he lives, you shall live. If you believe in him, you shall live in everlasting life, as one who has won the fight and has kinship to him who gave his life that men might be.<br><br>With all the conviction of my soul, I leave my blessing with you wonderful people. I am thrilled with the spirit that you bring here to such a vast audience. I want you to know that in my heart I have a love, a special love, for folks like you.<br><br>We witnessed something wonderful in the great Munich conference where we had those from at least eight different countries, including France, Holland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as those of us from America. Here they were members from countries whose political differences had caused war and bloodshed. And yet we brought them all together into one congregation with a peaceful, sweet spirit!<br><br>I was moved to repeat what the apostle Paul said to the Galatians: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither, bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus... and heirs according to the promise" (Galatians 3:28–29). And then I paraphrased to them, "You are neither German nor Austrian, nor French nor Italian, nor Dutch, nor Spanish, nor English, but you and I are all one in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and in the hearts of all of us here there must be no war." And so when we believe, and know that the Savior loves us all, regardless of nationality or color or creed, then we have gained something that the world does not know.<br><br>I bear you that sacred testimony, that I know with a witness that is more powerful than sight. Sometime, if the spirit prompts me, I may feel free to tell you more, but may I say to you that I know as though I had seen, that He lives, that He is real, that God the Father and his Son are living realities, personalities with bodies, parts, and passions--glorified beings. If you believe that, then you are safe. If you don't believe it, then struggle for that witness, and all will be well with you. And so I bless you, and commend you, and thank you again for the honor that you have conferred upon me this day. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Harold B.

<h1>od Shall Give unto You Knowledge by His Holy Spirit - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brethren and sisters, it's a pleasure to be with you. I am complimented by your presence this stormy morning. I am grateful for Brother Wheelwright's prayer. It's about 2:20 in the morning in Australia where I have just been, and if I fall asleep while I give this talk you will know the reason why, and you may have the same privilege.<br><br>I know that you have come to hear something that will help you, and to that end I seek the inspiration and direction of the Holy Spirit. I think I know something of the frustrations of college life. It is a long time since I was there, but I have never forgotten the anxieties of those days. And I think I know something of the frustrations of life in general. I have had my head bumped and my shins barked. On some of these occasions when I have needed a laugh I have turned to a letter which I think is something of a classic, which was first published in the Manchester, England,<i>Guardian</i>and later reprinted in the<i>Deseret News.</i><br><br>A hurricane had hit the West Indies, and a bricklayer was sent to repair the damage. He wrote to the home office as follows, and I hope you can get this delightful picture:<br><br><i>Respected Sirs:</i><br><br><i>When I got to the building I found that the hurricane had knocked some bricks off the top. So I rigged up a beam with a pulley at the top of the building and hoisted up a couple of barrels full of bricks. When I had fixed the building, there was a lot of bricks left over. I hoisted the barrel back up again and secured the line at the bottom, and then went up and filled the barrel with the extra bricks. Then I went to the bottom and cast off the line. Unfortunately the barrel of bricks was heavier than I was, and before I knew what was happening the barrel started down, jerking me off the ground. I decided to hang on, and halfway up I met the barrel coming down and received a severe blow on the shoulder. I then continued to the top, banging my head against the beam and getting my finger jammed in the pulley. When the barrel hit the ground it bursted its bottom, allowing all the bricks to spill out. I was now heavier than the barrel and so started down again at high speed. Halfway down, I met the barrel coming up and received severe injuries to my shins. When I hit the ground I landed on the bricks, getting several painful cuts from the sharp edges. At this point I must have lost my presence of mind because I let go of the line. The barrel then came down, giving me another heavy blow on the head and putting me in the hospital. I respectfully request sick leave.</i><br><br>Life is like that--ups and downs, a bump on the head, and a crack on the shins. It was ever thus. Hamlet went about crying, "To be or not to be," but that didn't solve any of his problems. There is something of a tendency among us to think that everything must be lovely and rosy and beautiful without realizing that even adversity has some sweet uses. One of my favorite newspaper columnists is Jenkin Lloyd Jones. In a recent article published in the<i>News,</i>he commented:<br><br><i>There seems to be a superstition among many thousands of our young who hold hands and smooch in the drive-ins that marriage is a cottage surrounded by perpetual hollyhocks, to which a perpetually young and handsome husband comes home to a perpetually young and ravishing wife. When the hollyhocks wither and boredom and bills appear, the divorce courts are jammed.</i><br><br><i>Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he's been robbed. The fact is that most putts don't drop. Most beef is tough. Most children grow up to be just ordinary people. Most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration. Most jobs are more often dull than otherwise....</i><br><br><i>Life is like an old-time rail journey--delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.</i><br><br>I'd like to leave that thought with you this morning.<br><h2><b>Miracles Wrought by Faith</b></h2><br>It was my great privilege to attend the Munich area general conference held last month in Germany. It was a tremendous experience to sit in that great Olympic sports hall and look into the faces of 14,000 Latter-day Saints who had gathered from across Europe. Two days before, I had met with the missionaries of the Germany South Mission and had felt something of their discouragement as they labored to find those they might teach. Out of all their efforts there have come only a convert here and another there, and these seem so few. But when I saw that great body of Saints in Munich I saw the fruits of their faith and of the faith of those who had preceded them. I saw a thousand doors knocked on for every man and woman and child present. I saw 999 doors rudely slammed for everyone opened. I heard the prayers, the pleadings of missionaries to be led to someone who would accept the truth. I saw those missionaries going up one street and down another in bitter winter weather and the scorching heat of summer. And I witnessed in my mind's eye the lonely struggles of those few who opened their doors--their fasting, their pleadings, their doubts, their faith, weak at first and then strengthening. When I looked over that vast congregation I knew that faith had been rewarded and that, while it had happened ever so slowly, a miracle had come to pass.<br><br>A week ago we stood at the foot of the steps leading to the door of a great Boeing 747 aircraft. Always in the past I had boarded these planes at level loading, and it had been like walking from one building to another. But a new loading area was under construction and we had to go down to the pavement and then up the steps. I stood beneath that plane in awe. How could that kind of a bird ever fly? I wondered. With its vast wings reaching 231 feet and its tail rising to the height of a six-story building, it weighed more than 320 tons loaded, and carried nearly 400 people. "It can never get off the ground," I said to myself. But we climbed aboard and seated ourselves comfortably, and soon it was bumping down the runway. The ride on the pavement was rough and noisy, and I said again, "I knew it. This thing can't get off the ground." But then it began to lift--smoothly, quietly, swiftly. We climbed to 38,000 feet, above the clouds and toward the stars. The giant bird had found its element, and through the night it cruised while we ate and slept for more than 7,000 miles.<br><br>We left San Francisco and arrived in Sydney. We left one hemisphere and landed in another. We left by direction of the North Star and came down by direction of the Southern Cross. It was a miracle, so commonplace that we scarcely think of it. But it was a miracle wrought in faith, and behind it lay a thousand feeble beginnings made in faith, shattered now and again by scores of tragedies as men walking in faith have learned to build and fly that giant.<br><h2><b>Have Faith in Yourself and Call upon the Lord</b></h2><br>While on that journey, I read for diversion two books--I should have been working on this speech--each of which lifted my sights and strengthened my own faith. The first was<i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull,</i>a delightful fantasy wherein I came to know that "that gull sees farthest who flies highest" and that only one in a million sees beyond its wingtips, that the remainder stand on the ground, "squawking and fighting among themselves for food, their eyes tightly shut to the joys of flight." Many of you, I am sure, have read that little book, and I hope you received a lift as did I.<br><br>The other was a volume first published in Liverpool in 1848 under the title<i>Spencer's Letters.</i>Orson Spencer was a highly educated Baptist clergyman, widely respected and greatly loved in Boston. There he heard the message of the restored gospel, as did many others. But with a courage not often seen, he faced up to his convictions, left his ministry, his friends, and the comforts of his high station, and moved to Nauvoo, only to be driven therefrom on the long and miserable journey that led to these mountain valleys, here to live the struggling life of a pioneer. As I read the words of that gifted, sensitive, courageous man, added resolution came into my own heart. And out of the feelings that came from those two books, I would like for a few minutes longer to speak with you about that simple but most marvelous principle spelled with two vowels and three consonants: F-A-I-T-H.<br><br>I hope you won't turn me off, because if there is any one thing you and I need in this world it is faith, that dynamic, powerful, marvelous element by which, as Paul declared, the very worlds were framed (Hebrews 11:3). We need it in our studies. We all know that university work, as it is structured, is a grind. Our academic pursuits are spoken of as disciplines, and so they are. But somewhere out there for you seniors and away out there for you freshmen is a field to be cultivated, and you are here today to learn to use the necessary tools. This is one university where students can be told that faith--the kind of faith that moves one to get on his knees and plead with the Lord and then get on his feet and go to work--is an asset beyond compare, even in the acquisition of secular knowledge. I do not minimize the need for study and labor. I would add to these faith and prayer, with the sacred promise that "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost." There are hundreds of you here this morning who can testify that you have witnessed this in your own experiences. It is so easy to get discouraged while you're here. It seems so natural a thing to drop out or to give in. The way seems so long, the road so steep, that we are prone to think it not worth the candle. The story is told of the Irish peddler who wished to go to Dublin, which was so far away and he had no money. But he got there by placing one foot in front of the other.<br><br>My dear young friends, never lose faith in yourselves or in your capacity to do worthwhile things. And call upon the Lord for help that your minds may be enlightened and your understanding quickened. Then go to work with that assurance inside of you that somehow you can do it.<br><br>I remember a missionary in Japan who bore his testimony in one of our meetings. It was before the days of the language training missions. Japanese had been extremely difficult for him, so much so that his mission president thought he should be transferred to an English-speaking mission. The elder said, as he stood on his feet, "The Lord had called me to Japan, and I knew I had to have the language to do the work. I fasted all of one day and prayed through the night. I fasted the second day and again pleaded with the Lord for help because I knew that somehow with his help I could do it. The next day, something seemed to break. The shadows of my mind lifted. I could understand as I had never understood before. And now it seems that Japanese is a language I learned a long time ago that is coming back to me."<br><h2><b>Faith Leads to Direction by the Spirit</b></h2><br>In Australia just this past Sunday we were told of a doctor, a member of the Church, who had taken seriously the counsel that every member should be a missionary. He didn't know how, but he was willing to try. He pleaded with the Lord for help. He told his patients, as opportunity presented itself, of the Church. Then he received a call one day from a patient who said that he and his family wished to know more of Mormonism. The doctor sent the missionaries. After being taught, the family asked for baptism and requested that the doctor perform the baptisms. The doctor asked them how their interest had been aroused. They said that they had gone camping. The first day they just enjoyed themselves. The second day they felt a little bored. They walked around the campgrounds and found a copy of a Church magazine. They read it. Their interest had been aroused. Tears came into the eyes of the doctor. He said, "My family and I had been at the same campground a few days before. I had taken that magazine with me to read. I felt impressed to leave it on the table. That was the magazine which led you in the direction of the Church."<br><br>My brethren and sisters, the faith to try leads to direction by the Spirit, and the fruits that flow therefrom are marvelous to behold and experience. A little over a year ago a young woman convert to the Church was called to serve a mission in her homeland, one of the countries of the Far East. Her folks, who were Buddhists, repeatedly insisted that she forsake her mission and her religion and return home. Their demands were so insistent that the mission president last month authorized her to go back and see her family. There she was met by her family, the entire clan, who used every possible means to persuade her to forsake her newly found religion and return to the religion of her forebears. She replied quietly but firmly that she could not deny her faith, that she must heed the call of the Lord rather than follow the counsel of men, even the counsel of her father.<br><br>The family, presided over by her uncle, denounced her and expelled her and told her that she could no longer associate with any of them. Then, after further deliberation, the family leaders determined that a mark should be put upon her to remind her of her infidelity to her traditional religion. While the men of the family held her, her father's older brother branded her with three burns in the arm. He told her that this would be a sign to the gods that she had forsaken Buddhism.<br><br>With ugly and painful wounds, with a broken heart but a resolute spirit, she returned to her mission. The scars in her flesh will remain to her a sign not of the forsaking of her father's religion but of her unconquerable faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Her faith so touched the heart of the father who had denounced her that he came to the mission home and put his arms around her and kissed her and told her that they would never desert her, and there was awakened in him also something of an understanding, faint but real, of the true meaning of the gospel of the Lord.<br><br>It is that kind of faith that sustained the Prophet Joseph when, as a boy, he was ridiculed and persecuted. It was that kind of faith that sustained him and his followers when they were driven from state to state, when they were tarred and feathered, when their homes were burned and they sickened unto death from exposure to the elements. It was that kind of faith which took him to Carthage, though he knew he was going as a lamb to the slaughter. It was that kind of faith that sustained our forebears in the long marches from the Mississippi to these mountain valleys when death walked beside them. It was that kind of faith that has sustained a hundred thousand missionaries and a million converts who have walked through the lonely valley of conversion, and it is that kind of faith that will sustain you and me in difficult and trying situations.<br><br>God help us to cultivate it, for "if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you" (Matthew 17:20). Such is the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ. This, my brethren and sisters, is what our presence on this campus is all about: that faith might increase and be manifest and reflected in our lives and through us in the lives of others. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Gordon B.

<h1> is Honorable - Spencer W. Kimball - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
My beloved brothers and sisters of the ten stakes on the Brigham Young University campus, the song that was just sung by the choir so beautifully is my favorite, and I feel tonight that "I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord." This is a most inspiring group of people, and I would say to you--as you know already--that the eyes of the world are upon you, the students of Brigham Young University. As I've come to talk to you tonight, I have come not to entertain you--there are others to do that--but to discuss with you some of the deeper things of the gospel program. Most of you are biologically and intellectually maturing and should be ready to think deeply and order your lives accordingly. I believe in the old adage that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," and since perhaps the majority of you have not yet entered into the marriage state, I wish to talk to you tonight about marriage.<br><br>While some of our young people marry early, yet there seems to be a tendency toward delaying marriage. A gradual move toward ignoring and even rejecting this vital and basic program is noticeable in our culture. The Lord said, "For behold, this is my work and my glory--to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39). And in Hebrews we read, "Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge" (Hebrews 13:4). We are finding that many young people are obsessed with the idea of more and more education, even to the postponing of their marriages. Only yesterday I met a returned missionary, thirty-five years old, who was little concerned about his bachelorhood and laughed it away.<br><br>When the Lord organized his world and established his policies, he could have filled the earth with physical bodies in some other way than that which he designed--perhaps some kind of an incubator process. But it seems that merely filling the earth with humans was not the great objective of our Lord. In order to properly people the world it was necessary that every child born into this world should have two parents, a father and a mother, to teach him, to train him, to love him, that that child should be made aware of what was expected of him.<br><br>As he has done throughout the ages, the Lord reiterated his requirement of those adults who would sire and bear children. The oft-quoted scripture given in 1831 has been basic instruction from the beginning of time and will continue to the end of time, for "God is the same yesterday, today, and forever." He commands, "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, . . . that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ, the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents" (D&amp;amp;C 68:25). This command was to be "a law unto the inhabitants of Zion" (D&amp;amp;C 68:26), not a mere hope or suggestion. The Lord continues, "And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord" (D&amp;amp;C 68:28). Remember that this does not cover prayer only, but all the doctrines of the Church and the way of life. And the Lord clinches his command by indicating his displeasure that many of the parents were not training their children, that the children were growing up in wickedness, that they were not seeking the riches of eternity. The command to teach the children seems to be of equal power with the command to sire and bear children. It is a sin to fail to teach the children.<br><h2><b>Make your Marriage Eternal</b></h2><br>Most of you are unmarried, but we hope that every normal one of you will be married, and we are reminding you now, with all the power and influence we have, so that none of you will fail a proper marriage and that you will so completely fortify that institution that it will be an eternal one. We are gravely concerned about the number of our people who are being married out of the temple and even out of the Church. Then we're gravely concerned again about that unbelievable number who permit their marriages to go stale and let them be destroyed. May I say that almost all marriages could be beautiful, harmonious, happy, and eternal ones, if the two people primarily involved would determine that it should be, that it must be, that it will be.<br><br>A recent spot-check of stakes reveals that fewer than forty percent of the marriages in those stakes were temple marriages. The figures increased in these stakes only 2.9 percent in four years, or less than one percent a year. How long will it take us at that rate to reach a reasonable record? Of course there are a substantial number of sealings after marriage, but we're mindful also that many of the original marriages fail and end in divorce. We wonder why--why nearly sixty percent of our people would be satisfied with less than an eternal marriage.<br><br>One of the more prominent reasons for nontemple marriages is marriage to nonmembers. This figure is frightening. In those same stakes, more than twenty-five percent of the marriages were those with nonmembers. Again, this worries us greatly. Certain studies in the past have indicated that in these marriages some wonderful people who were not members have later joined the Church and become faithful members. We are grateful for every convert who comes in through this door, but the chances are against conversion. The study shows that for every nonmember spouse who joins the Church there are approximately six who never join the Church, and this unequal yoking brings problems. The nonmember spouse could be even more righteous than the member, but what happens often is that neither is faithful to the Church, or both fall away, or there are frictions, ending frequently in divorce; and numerous children have grown up out of the Church because the parents were selfish and had not thought of them in the marriage.<br><br>If forty percent of the members married for eternity and twenty-five percent married nonmembers, this leaves another thirty-five percent who married in the Church but with seeming little interest in the eternal nature of their marriage. Whether or not these figures are accurate, it does reveal that someone does not understand. This is the reason that I chose the subject of marriage for this address.<br><br>May I inject here that selfishness is the element that breaks and corrodes and destroys marriages, as it destroys lives and all that is good. The time to make good marriages for the turn of this century is now, in the 1970s. Now is the time to organize your program, to set your standards, to solidify your determination, and to prepare for that married period of your life which will be hard, demanding, and difficult, but which will be rewarding and beautiful and eternal in its nature. The Lord has ordained that each of these mature spirits which he has created shall be permitted to come to this earth at a proper time, be provided with a small, pure body and a mind uncluttered, be given a loving home with two parents to teach and train him, and come to maturity through numerous, varied growth experiences, then in turn to marry, provide bodies for another generation, and go through the same process, working toward this eternal plan.<br><br>You have been a child; you are now an adult and about ready to enter this next phase, which is married life. Some of you are now married, some of you are anticipating, and still others of you are quietly hopeful. Next you will find your eternal companion and you will marry, and you will beget and bear children. And then begins the long, difficult, but loving process of training them toward godhood.<br><h2><b>First Things First</b></h2><br>As I visit with missionaries I remind them of their many specific goals: to get their marriage, their family, their education, their occupation, their training. They can, by careful planning, have all the blessings they want if they take first things first. For instance, if they marry first, their chance for a mission is greatly limited, if not locked out. If they get their schooling first, their chance for a mission is limited. Taken on a basis of priorities, practically every normal young man can have a wonderful mission, a good marriage, a satisfactory educational training, each in its turn, having all.<br><br>The training you get in the universities, while excellent, is limited. It is but a very tiny percentage of the total knowledge. We encourage knowledge and its proper use, but we know there will be a thousand years to study about<i>things,</i>and compared to the years spent in universities, that great learning period is relatively limitless. When we're ready to create our own worlds and give leadership thereto, we will have great knowledge. Since knowledge is power, we will have power. Since knowledge can make us creative, we can be creators. Since knowledge can lead to judgment and wisdom, we can be just and worthy and wise. But we cannot wait for marriage until we have accumulated the knowledge we finally will need and want to have in order to create. We need the power of the priesthood to effect the creation, and it will have to be there; you hold the priesthood and can use it as you accumulate the secular knowledge.<br><br>The book of John begins:<br><br><i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i><br><br><i>The same was in the beginning with God.</i><br><br><i>All things were made by him</i>[the Word, Jesus Christ];<i>and without him was not any thing made that was made.</i><br><br><i>In him was life; and the life was the light of men</i>. [John 1:1–4]<br><br>Again, in 1 John, he says:<br><br><i>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;</i><br><br><i>(. . . and</i>[we]<i>shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) . . .</i><br><br><i>And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</i>[1 John 1:1–2, 4]<br><br>For following this program that the Lord has set up for us is the only way to have full joy.<br><br>And again, we find that the early apostles knew more of the program than they have been given credit for. Paul told the Hebrews:<br><br><i>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</i><br><br><i>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, . . . by whom also he made the worlds;</i><br><br><i>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, . . . sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</i><br><br><i>Being made so much better than the angels.</i>[Hebrews 1:1–4]<br><br>I feel certain that all the knowledge that is available will not be enough to give the power to create worlds without the priesthood and the power thereof. When we shall have learned all about medicine, mineralogy, zoology, forestry, biology, and all the other "-ologies" and all about the heavens and the earth in all of its moods, then, if we also know theology and know it well and abide by its precepts, perhaps then we can exercise our accumulated power to create an earth for our exalted family.<br><h2><b>Do Not Postpone Marriage and Children</b></h2><br>But, of course, marriage cannot wait for that. We shall marry, have our families, teach and train them, while we are learning these other things and building toward our creatorship. Marriage should come when we are reasonably young, to procreate and bear children, to have the patience to teach and train them and to grow up with them. Hence, marriage is a must, an early must. Of course, we would decry child marriages, but when young people are in their upper years of collegiate work surely it is time to plan this important life's work. Missionaries should begin to think marriage--when they return from their missions, to begin to get acquainted with many young women so that they will have a better basis for selection of a life's companion. And when the time comes they should marry in the holy temple and have their families, and complete their education, and establish themselves in a profitable and rewarding occupation, and give themselves to their families, the gospel, and the Church.<br><br>Brothers and sisters, this is not a matter of jest. It isn't anything to laugh about. This is the most serious thing in all the world that lies ahead of you unmarried young people.<br><br>The<i>San Francisco Chronicle and Examiner</i>had an article in it last year entitled "The Anti-Marriage Revolution." The article came from a young woman, not a member, who wrote to me:<br><br><i>I wish it were possible for all these misguided, unfortunate young people to become receptive to your message. . . I am investigating the Mormon Church and one of the most favorable aspects of the wonderful teachings is the concern and rapport for and with the young people. That, as well as other reasons, keeps me diligently studying to become worthy for membership in the Mormon Church.</i>[Letter from Miss Nagene Ellis]<br><br>In magazines we frequently see articles on this antimarriage revolution, although we don't hear about it so much in our little communities here. Let me say again, marriage is honorable. It's a plan of God. It is not a whim, a choice, a preference only; it's a must.<br><br>We are talking to normal young people. Generally there are husbands for most young women. There might be an occasional young woman who does not find her companion, but there is little excuse for the normal young man. I tell young women who seem to have missed their chance for desirable marriage that they should do all in their power to make themselves attractive physically in dress and grooming, mentally in being knowledgeable on many subjects, spiritually in being responsive emotionally in being genuine and worthy. And if one fails to find a companion after having done everything possible, then there will be provision for her in eternity.<br><br>The first commandment recorded seems to have been "Multiply and replenish the earth." Let no one ever think that the command came to have children without marriage. No such suggestion could ever have foundation. When God had created the woman, he brought her unto the man and gave her to him as his wife, and commanded, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).<br><br>There is enough in that one line to make a hundred sermons. Think it through very carefully, every word. This was not the evolution of Adam to human status. Adam was already an intelligent, trained, and knowledgeable man. He was a prophet in his first recorded days on earth (see Moses 5), and this prophet blessed God and prophesied concerning his posterity. He saw the future and proclaimed:<br><br><i>In this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.</i><br><br><i>And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.</i><br><br><i>And Adam and Eve . . . made all things known unto their sons and their daughters. . . .</i><br><br><i>. . .</i>[They]<i>ceased not to call upon God.</i>[Moses 5: 10-12, 16]<br><br>In true order, Adam knew Eve, his wife, and she conceived and bore Adam's children--many children. And a book of remembrance was kept, and recordings were made in the language of Adam. And angels came from God to teach them by the spirit of revelation. Their children--thirty-three sons and twenty-three daughters, according to Josephus--were taught to read and write in the language which was pure and undefiled. Adam and his righteous sons were baptized, received the Holy Ghost, and received the priesthood. They kept the genealogical records of their fast-expanding families. This would indicate, then, that Adam was a great man when we first are introduced to him. He didn't come from the jungle.<br><br>I have told many groups of young people that they should not postpone their marriage until they have acquired all of their education ambitions. I have told tens of thousands of young folks that when they marry they should not wait for children until they have finished their schooling and financial desires. Marriage is basically for the family, and when people have found their proper companions there should be no long delay. They should live together normally and let the children come.<br><br>There seems to be a growing feeling that marriage is for legal sex, for sex's sake. Marriage is basically for the family; that is why we marry--not for the satisfaction of the sex, as the world around us would have us believe. When people have found their companions, there should be no long delay. Young wives should be occupied in bearing and rearing their children. I know of no scriptures where an authorization is given to young wives to withhold their families and to go to work to put their husbands through school. There are thousands of husbands who have worked their own way through school and have reared families at the same time. Though it is more difficult, young people can make their way through their educational programs. On most campuses there are married student buildings for their living. It's a good experience to learn to save and to scratch and to economize.<br><br>President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., gave us this:<br><br><i>There is some belief, too much I fear, that sex desire is planted in us solely for the pleasures of full gratification; that the begetting of children is only an unfortunate incident. The direct opposite is the fact. Sex desire was planted in us in order to be sure that bodies would be begotten to house the spirits; the pleasure of gratification of the desire is an incident, not the primary purpose of the desire.</i><br><br>He said further:<br><br><i>As to sex in marriage, the necessary treatise on that for Latter-day Saints can be written in two sentences: Remember the prime purpose of sex desires is to beget children. Sex gratifications must be had at that hazard. You husbands, be kind and considerate of your wives. They are not your property; they are not mere conveniences; they are your partners for time and eternity.</i>[General Priesthood Conference, October 1949, pp. 194–95]<br><br>Billy Graham gave us this statement:<br><br><i>One thing the Bible does not teach is that sex in itself is sin. Far from being prudish, the Bible celebrates sex and its proper use, presenting it as God-created, God-ordained, God-blessed. It makes plain that God himself implanted the physical magnetism between the sexes for two reasons: for the propagation of the human race, and for the expression of that kind of love between man and wife that makes for true oneness. His command to the first man and woman to be "one flesh" was as important as his command to be "fruitful and multiply".</i><br><br><i>The Bible makes plain that evil, when related to sex, means not the</i>use<i>of something inherently corrupt, but the</i>misuse<i>of something pure and good. It teaches that sex can be a wonderful servant, but a terrible master. It can be a creative force more powerful than any other in fostering of love, companionship, happiness, or can be the most destructive of all life's forces.</i>[<i>Reader's Digest,</i>May 1970, p. 118]<br><br>Another thing. It is my opinion that young women often frustrate their own best interests. Generally they are as well off financially on the campus as are their young men counterparts, especially those who have spent their accumulated funds on missions, so that young women should not be demanding of expensive dinners and corsages and cars and other things which often are the basis for dates and courtship. Perhaps the high cost of courting may be one reason for the delayed courtships and marriages. Young people, then, should date and court in a serious mood, and when the right time and the right person come there should be marriage and family and real life.<br><br>Last week I tore out of a magazine a full-page advertisement with a picture of Albert Einstein, with his drooping eyes, his sleepy looks, and his tousled hair. This was the great Einstein, highly publicized, greatly admired. It was stated that Albert Einstein admitted that he had had only two ideas in his life. These had brought him fame and universal honor.<br><br>This is about all that you young people need, two ideas: (1) Where am I going? (2) How do I get there? Again: First, what is my goal, and, second, how do I reach it? Of course, that includes numerous lesser secondary goals. If we turn our eyes from our basic goal and get diverted along the way, we shall, like Little Red Riding Hood, lose our way and run into trouble with the wolf. Basic then to this goal is proper and lasting and loving marriage.<br><br>Great promises are made to every couple, and this by the Lord and his prophets, that as parents plan their lives and carry forward their marriage in selflessness and rear their children with care and love, they have rejoicing in their posterity throughout their lives. Their joy is full; their cup runneth over.<br><br>As we approach this vital subject, we are reminded of the scripture where the Lord says:<br><br><i>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</i><br><br><i>When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know not whence ye are: . . .</i><br><br><i>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</i>[Luke 13:24–25, 28]<br><br>And again, we repeat for emphasis from Matthew: "Enter ye in at the strait gate." That's an<i>s-t-r-a-i-t</i>gate, not the shortest distance between two points.<i>Strait</i>means hard, difficult, exacting, that kind of a gate. And that's the kind of a gate that marriage is. An eternal marriage is also strait and difficult, but it's rewarding and beautiful. "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Matthew 7:13–14).<br><br>Now, all Latter-day Saints are not going to be exalted. All people who have been through the holy temple are not going to be exalted. The Lord says, "Few there be that find it." For there are the two elements: (1) the sealing of a marriage in the holy temple, and (2) righteous living through one's life thereafter to make that sealing permanent. Only through proper marriage--and I repeat that--only through proper marriage can one find that strait way, the narrow path. No one can ever have life, real life, in any other way under any other program. Sexual life outside of marriage, whether it be heterosexual or homosexual, is as a dream of the night that fades when the sun comes up. It is as the froth that accumulates on pounding waters.<br><br>Today, to offset and neutralize the evil teachings in the media and on the cameras and in the show and on the street, we must teach marriage, proper marriage, eternal marriage. When we realize the great number of young people who do not marry in the temple, we wonder if we have been failing our responsibility.<br><br>What we are saying about eternal marriage is not my opinion nor the opinion of the leaders of the Church. This is the word of God, which supersedes all opinions.<br><h2><b>Rejection of Marriage Is a Sin</b></h2><br>There seems to be a growing trend against marriage--in the movie colonies, in the social groups--toward having sex without family, sex without marriage even. Naturally the next question is, Why marriage? It's only a slip of paper, they say. And the antimarriage revolution comes into focus. Arguments are given that children are a burden, a tie, a responsibility. Men and women cohabit. They sin. They are guilty of deep transgression and seemingly without conscience. They have convinced themselves that education, freedom from restraint and responsibility--that's the life. And unfortunately this benighted and destructive idea is taking hold of even some of our own people.<br><br>Do you ever read a great writer or speaker who does not decry the loose permissiveness of the age and the abandonment of the family? The great thinkers all speak of the family as being the cement, the welding link, the foundation of civilization. That being true, then all the other vagaries and theories are but chaff that blows away and has no substance. Marriage is ordained of God. It is necessary and a delightful condition. It is the only true state, and the fact that many marriages fail does not change the rightness of marriage.<br><br>Some people say, "I am afraid of marriage. I fear temple marriage." To that person we can only say, "Then you are not prepared for marriage. You are still immature." A holy, happy, unending marriage may be enjoyed by every couple if they will it so. And if it be that kind of a union, surely every couple would want it to be eternal; and a happy marriage can. And a happy, selfless marriage will bring happy, normal children and a happy life. Surely selfish parents can bring a veritable hell to their children.<br><br>Remember, "for this is a day of warning," the scripture says, "and not a day of many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in the last days" (D&amp;amp;C 63:58). Can you think of any worse mockery than a civil marriage, than no marriage at all? "Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ" (D&amp;amp;C 63:60).<br><br>Marriage should be solemnized in the holy temple, by an appointed leader ordained by the prophet who holds the keys. Paul told the Corinthians, "The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord" (1 Corinthians 7:39).<i>Only in the Lord.</i><br><br>Significant is the brilliant answer of the Savior to the Sadducees who tried to trap him:<br><br><i>Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</i><br><br><i>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</i><br><br><i>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</i><br><br><i>And last of all the woman died also.</i><br><br><i>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</i>[Matthew 22:24–28]<br><br>They felt they had one question that he never could answer, that his face would turn red, that he would be embarrassed. Whose wife shall she be of the seven? Well, the answer was very simple, wasn't it? None of them would have her in eternity. She wouldn't be in exaltation because they were none of them married for eternity. They were all married "till death do you part," the most deceptive little phrase in our language. The answer of Jesus was perfect. That's the basis for my sermon tonight. They could have no further argument. Here was his answer:<br><br><i>Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</i><br><br><i>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</i><br><br>This answer yielded to no argument. None of the seven would husband her. She would have no husband; they would have no wife. None of the marriages were temple marriages; none were "in the Lord" or by the Lord or his authorized servants. Death ended each of the unions. There was no efficacy to any of them.<br><br><i>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</i><br><br><i>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</i>[Matthew 22:31–32]<br><br>Let's examine that a moment. The Lord says again through Mark, "Ye therefore do<i>greatly err"</i>(Mark 12:27). First it was a question, "Don't you err, not knowing the scriptures?" and then he said,<i>"You do err,</i>not knowing the scriptures." God's plan is for those who live, not for those who die; for those who receive the light, not for those who walk in darkness; for those who are prepared for eternal life, and not for those who are satisfied with casual and sinful living. These people did not know the God of the burning bush. They did not know the God of Abraham or Isaac or Jacob; yet they had the scriptures before them. They were travelers in the wilderness, who had no defined plans. They knew not our God nor his power.<br><h2><b>Do Your Own Temple Work</b></h2><br>No one who voluntarily rejects marriage here in mortality has any assurance of eternal life. Now, there is a great difference between one who doesn't hear it, doesn't know it, and one who rejects it, because that is inherent in the word; they couldn't reject it if they didn't know it. The day is coming soon when no one will need to die without a temple marriage. There are already fifteen temples, new ones being built. The day will come when there will be hundreds of temples all over this world, when there will not be a soul in the world, probably, who is more than a thousand miles away; and for a one-time experience in all one's life, a thousand miles is not far to go. It wouldn't be far to crawl if one knew what he was getting and what he was missing if he didn't go.<br><br>Remember, the temples of God are not for the vicarious temple ordinances for those who have known the gospel. I'm sure we misunderstand that. Those who live as you have lived for twenty years--as some of you will live for forty years and eighty years--this vicarious temple work isn't for you. You do your work yourselves. That's your job, to go up to the temple and get your endowments when you're properly matured--your job, not your parents' job or the responsibility of people after them, to give you blessings or even to open the door to blessings for you if you are not interested enough to get them for yourself. It's for your grandfather and your great-great-grandparents and my great-great-grandparents. Those are the ones we go to the temple for. Those are the ones we do the work for, those who were born when there was no gospel on the earth, when there was no temple or idea of a temple.<br><br>God is the God of the living, not the God of the dead. And people who close their eyes and their ears and fail to follow the commandments of God are dead. They're dead as to all the things that are worthy: dead as to the benefits, dead as to the blessings, dead as to this natural and eternal gift.<br><br>Temple sealings are for your ancestors, the people who could have traveled all over the world and never found a temple or a temple president or helpers to take them through and give them their endowments--people who were good, good as you and I are good, or better, and who may have neared perfection in their lives. But there were no temples; there were no temple workers. They had to wait. We must do their work for them. That's why we have our genealogical work. That's why we have the temple.<br><br>We go forward and we have the work done for those who die. But we have no guarantee that anyone will ever receive the gospel when we do it for him after his death. We hope he will; we go forward and we hope that he will accept the gospel. But we have no assurance whatever that he will ever accept it. For people are very much the same when they arise from the resurrection as they are on the day they were buried. It's for them to accept it; and it's for you to accept it, today, while you live, while you can, while you have your own free agency.<br><br>Our Lord is not the God of the dead. Those who marry civilly by secular means to avoid the restrictions in dress by reason of the garments, or by reason of restrictions as to divorce, fun, freedoms, so-called, are postponing to their own peril. Are not they the dead? Remember, our temple work is for those who have passed on without opportunity, not for those who have had opportunity and rejected it. There's a tremendous difference between him who misses the blessing and him who rejects the blessing. Men of our day calculate and evaluate and develop opinions and "kick against the pricks" and close the door to their own opportunities. You won't do that, will you? These people are like the Pharisees, the Sadducees. They are like the Pharisees and the hypocrites and the scribes who "shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in" (Matthew 23: 13).<br><br>But could there be any excuse for any of us? Few of us have joined the Church recently. Most of us have been in the Church all our lives. Most of us have seen the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price upon the mantel all of our twenty years. And we haven't stopped to find out exactly what it means, how deep it goes. "Everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, . . . that [is] not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead" (D&amp;amp;C 132: 13). Men may perform the marriages, certainly. We will continue to do so. Our hope is everlasting, and we will continue to do the work of those who didn't do it; but we have no assurance, as I've said. Mortal death terminates a mortal marriage. Now, don't kid yourself, using that slang phrase. Don't try to be opinionated about this thing. Don't try to argue yourself out of it. You're either married by the word of the Lord, by his servant, or you're not married after you're dead. And death comes, regardless of how we would push it off if we could.<br><br>A few months ago a call came from a sister whose husband had been dead for some years, whose son and his wife had recently been killed in an airplane accident, leaving several small children. Alone, in deep anguish, this sweet woman with many regrets told me that these young victims of the airplane crash had not been married in the temple. They were middle-aged, both coming from good families. They had either ignored it or postponed it. They had lived the majority of their lifetime on the earth and still had not had this ordinance performed. They became single, and their children orphans.<br><br>At death our sympathies, of course, are gravely stirred. And oftentimes at funerals speakers, in their kindness, make to the living mourners many promises that could not be substantiated by scripture. I have heard them many times promise that this good man will go direct to eternal life, and yet he has not been married in the temple, and his life didn't warrant it anyway. He had the gospel; he had the opportunities; he ignored his privileges. He will unfortunately drink the dregs of the bitter cup. And so will you if you fail this important thing.<br><br>I remember an article in a local newspaper, telling of a young couple married in Salt Lake by a man who had only civil authority--no power beyond the grave. They had a brilliant wedding breakfast. They got into the car to travel to another city for an evening wedding reception, where hundreds of friends and relatives would come to wish them well. They did not reach their destination. There was no reception. A car accident took their lives. Their mortality was ended. An eternal life had not been provided for. About three hours of marriage, and the end of it came like a flash of lightning. And the sad thing was that their three-hour marriage was performed within a mile of the holy Temple, where a man with the sealing power would gladly have saved them from the bitter cup.<br><br>They're in eternity now. I don't know what they're thinking or what they're doing, but they're not prepared for eternity. They had grown to twenty years or more of life and they didn't go to the temple, even though they were members of the Church. They ignored it. They left it. If they ever gave a serious thought, do you suppose they were saying, "Oh, we can have the sealing ordinance performed later"? Do you suppose the bereaved family was thinking, "Well, it's too bad; but then, we can go to the temple in a year and have the work done for them"?<br><br>Yes, the family can go to the temple a year later. Yes, they can do the ordinance work for them. And the records will show it. But the question is, Will the young deceased couple accept the ordinances when they were of such little consequence to them while they lived? And more important than all else, do you think that God is going to be mocked? He is the God of the living, not of the dead. And they were dead, both physically and also, it would seem, spiritually. He has identified this ordinance as one to be done in mortality while you have your body and your spirit together. Perhaps not any scripture emanating from the mouth of God has been so definite and positive and unchangeable as those we are quoting. It has been said that we rise from the grave much as we lie down in it. We change little in our attitudes and moods and desires in that period when our spirit is freed from our body that is in the grave. The process of change in the body does not necessarily change the inner man. If the gospel truths mean little to us as we die, they are not likely to mean very much to us when we rise.<br><br>Have you ever known couples who ignored the temple marriage and had tragedy take one of them in unexpected death? Have you seen the surviving spouse rush to the temple when the year is ended to endow by proxy the deceased spouse and have the sealing done? Have you ever realized that there is no magic in death, that ceasing to breathe does not make angels of careless people, does not make believers of disbelievers, does not bring faith where there was skepticism?<br><br>In such situations I always think of the ten virgins parable, where the five wise virgins took their lamps filled with oil to meet the bridegroom. Then the five foolish virgins, who had slumbered and slept, came at midnight when the bridegroom was announced. They begged oil of their neighbors, but without success; and with their unlighted vessels they came fumbling and shuffling along, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But the bridegroom said, "Verily, I say unto you, I know you not" (Matthew 25:11–12). Now, that isn't being mean; that isn't being unkind; it's just following a program. They knew it; they had their lamps; they knew they needed oil in their lamps. They didn't provide it.<br><br>It was Job who said,<br><br><i>What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</i><br><br><i>And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</i>[Job 7:17–18]<br><br>Man is the very son of God. This accounts for God's great concern for him. Job also said,<br><br><i>Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</i>[Job 7:1]<br><br><i>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</i><br><br><i>He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. . . .</i><br><br><i>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.</i>[Job 14:1–2,5]<br><br>Now let us look into latter-day scriptures. For long centuries the gospel was not upon the earth, not available to the best of saints. From the day of the martyrdom of the apostles following the crucifixion of the Christ till the third decade of the 1800s there was not one soul on the earth qualified to endow and marry and seal for eternity. There was not a holy temple on the entire earth. There was not a prophet holding sacred keys to open eternal doors. It is principally for the good people of those centuries that we do the work for the dead. They could not do it themselves. They had neither the knowledge, the temples, nor the keys on the earth. But in the twenties and the thirties in the nineteenth century began to come the revelations of the Lord. They came pouring out almost like a flood, seemingly to make up for the long lost time of the Dark Ages. This was as spoken by Joel the prophet, quoting the Lord:<br><br><i>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</i><br><br><i>And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth.</i>[Joel 2:28–30]<br><br>And so in 1820 the revelations began to pour out upon us. The prophets began again to prophesy and interpret and direct, the Church began to thrive and grow, the temples began to rise, the ordinances began to be performed, and men began to prepare in earnest for the great day of the Lord.<br><br>Now, there are many who still ignore the right ways of the Lord. I mentioned that more than half of our young people ignore the sacred ordinances, having their marriages performed merely by men of the world with the authority of principalities and powers of the world for a worldly marriage that cannot last.<br><br>The prophets of the Lord had already opened the vista 1,800 years ago. Paul had told us of the "seventh heaven"; and the celestial glory, compared to the sun in brilliance; and the terrestrial glory, likened to the moon; and the telestial glory, compared to the stars in glory. The Lord had already said much that should have been a warning to the readers of the scriptures; but since they did not understand, the voice of the Lord came again.<br><br>Time is passing. Time is fleeing. We have no guarantee for continued living. Procrastination is a veritable thief. We mortals have had twenty or forty or eighty years to come to a knowledge of the truth and to abide by the requirements. For us who neglect or procrastinate or deny or reject, the doors are closing. As with the ten virgins, the day is passing. Darkness approaches.<br><br>Now think about it. Many reject the priesthood today--thousands of them. Many reject eternal marriage--thousands of them. They are offered it. They will not accept it. Will it always, even in eternity, be handed out to them, forced upon them? Can a man change his mind and grasp it as time goes on? These are solemn questions. Those who have accepted and failed to live up to its requirements, will they have it or lose it in time and eternity?<br><br>I tell you, folks, God will not be mocked. He has given us a program. He has given us a chance for mature consideration. He is not playing games with us. It is the most vital of all decisions. First, we must develop that worthiness which makes one eligible for the blessing. Second, we must grasp the opportunity of the ordinance. And third, we must remain faithful and worthy to that marriage and to all righteousness. Then the promised blessings may not be withheld by anyone.<br><br>Again, the Lord reiterates the message:<br><br><i>If a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, . . . then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:18]<br><br>I tell you again, no statements have ever been made with greater force or power. There is no place for opinion or for argument. Such a temporal marriage is in the world and cannot be received other than in the world.<br><br>The Lord speaks. of the angels and says that their rewards do not compare with those of men and women "who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory" (D&amp;amp;C 132: 16). We've always grown up thinking of the angels as being the last word in righteousness, haven't we? The angels are greatly inferior to every person in this room who will live all these commandments the Lord requires at the hands of these persons. When the Lord speaks of "the angels and the gods [who] are appointed" at the gate (D&amp;amp;C 132:18), it reminds us of immigration laws as we go into the various countries of the world. Like the immigration officers, the angels will receive the visas, the passports. They will check the prerequisites; they will see if the documents are all in order. They have an appointment as gatekeepers. The Lord again is emphatic, saying that those who have not earned the reward of eternal life shall not pass--shall not pass. "They cannot, therefore, inherit my glory" (D&amp;amp;C 132:18).<br><h2><b>Kingdoms, Principalities, Power, and Dominions</b></h2><br>Now, on the positive side, these are blessings which will be available to those who meet the requirements. They are promised blessings of kingdoms, principalities, power, and dominions--all heights and depths. As I come into the United States Immigration offices frequently, each gatekeeper has a large book and he quickly looks at my name on the passport and then opens this huge book and looks under<i>K</i>to see if I am on the blacklist, to see if there's anything wrong, if I have been unworthy of entrance into this kingdom, this republic. And so shall it be when men go to their permanent homes. The angels and gods will be at the gate. They will know your records; they will have the records. Of those who are faithful and have the ordinance and live worthy of it, the promise is made, "And they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19). We are further promised a glory "which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them" (D&amp;amp;C 132:19–20).<br><br>Now this, again l say, is not a matter of opinion. This isn't something you can go out and argue about. The judges at the gate will know by it for sure--the formula, the records, the spirit, the true desserts. The book of life will show the earthly activities of the earthly servants, and the book of the angels will give the entire story of every man--of that which he did in the light and in the shadows, in the open and in the corners; all that was said in the secret places and from the housetops; all that was thought and expressed, whether good or bad. There will be no escape. The honest judge will give full value to all for their good work and will not overlook the other.<br><br>I have repeated the conditions and the restrictions and the glories and the benefits because we are all inclined to let them pass by. But the Lord has repeated over and over, as his message of the revelation came to Joseph over and over, and as we read the scriptures over and over, and again: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory" (D&amp;amp;C 132:21). No musts or ifs or questions there. There's no room for argument or quibbling. This is forthright and sure.<br><br>Now, let me say here lest someone misunderstand, we're not talking about plural marriage, as some might think. We're talking about the eternal law of marriage, or temple marriage, as referred to in the 131st section, wherein he, the Lord, says eight words that leave no question:<i>"</i>[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]" (D&amp;amp;C 131 :2). This is the covenant wherein a man and a woman are conditionally sealed for eternity. That's the new and everlasting covenant of marriage, which came in our day for us.<br><br>The Lord said in 1843 again, "Strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives [<i>plural,</i>of the lives, our great posterity in the eternities that follow], and few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me. But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation" (D&amp;amp;C 132:22–23), subject, of course, to your continued worthiness. If we receive him in this world, if we go to the temple worthily, receive our endowments, our sealing program, then the Lord guarantees us--providing, of course, our continued worthiness--guarantees us an exaltation, continuation of lives, creatorship, and all of the great blessings that any righteous man might want.<br><br>Significant also is the counter verse: "Broad is the gate, and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths; and many there are that go in thereat, because they receive me not, neither do they abide in my law" (D&amp;amp;C 132:25). The gate that is wide and easy of access is the gate wherein comes destruction.<br><br>In our own dispensation God has said those few will know him and will receive their exaltation and be with him. The mysteries are promised. The Lord on one occasion said:<br><br><i>And the mysteries of the kingdom ye shall keep within yourselves; for it is not meet to give that which is holy unto the dogs; neither cast ye your pearls unto swine, lest they trample them under their feet.</i><br><br><i>For the world cannot receive that which ye, yourselves, are not able to bear; wherefore ye shall not give your pearls unto them, lest they turn again and rend you.</i>[Matthew 7:10–12 (Inspired Version)]<br><br>Now, this is a good question the Lord asks. He asks it of everyone of you. "Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" (Luke 6:46). He made it very clear. "He that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great" (Luke 6:49). Now, young folks, as I near the conclusion, may I plead with you that you never consider for one moment forsaking this great principle.<br><br>Yesterday a young woman said to her fiance, "If you cannot get a temple recommend, then I am not about to spend my life with you." Now, there's a lot of strength in that. If his bishop and his stake president will not sign a recommend for him, "there is something wrong--something that's going to show up after they're married, after they have a family, something that's going to continue. A certain young missionary said to his girlfriend, "I am sorry. As much as I love you, I will not marry out of the temple."<br><h2><b>We Can All Have the Blessings</b></h2><br>On the brighter side, may I bring to your attention that some months ago I divided a stake, making two excellent ones in its place. In searching for a new president for a stake, we employ the process of elimination. We get records, and we go there and have an interview with each one, and I find out all I can about these men, because anyone of them might possibly qualify to be the stake president. Of the men we interviewed, we found that 29 men had 121 children. The average was 4.3 children per family, or 6.3 persons per family. Not a single divorce among them. This was only 29 out of a community; there may have been hundreds more. But of these 29 men that I interviewed, there was not a single divorce among them--no broken homes in these 29 families. Every child of the 121 had two parents, a father and a mother--which is often not the case these days, to have two parents, a mother and a father. No divorce had broken these homes. All of the men were fairly well employed and fairly well housed. Forty-three of the children were teenagers, but there were no serious problems. They probably had some questions, as many young people do, but there were no serious problems. Everyone of these 29 men was married in the holy temple. Everyone of these 121 children was born under the covenant. None of you have any right, any right whatever, to rob your children of that privilege. Not anyone of you has that right. When you marry you should marry for your family, not for your selfish desires and passions. Every one of the 29 men was married in the temple, and every one was faithful in carrying forward the work of the Lord.<br><br>I wondered why the Lord used Abraham especially for his pattern and example. Then I read, "Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment"<br><br>(D&amp;amp;C 132:29), face to face with his eternal God. Every person in this room can have that same experience if he will do the works of Abraham. And the Lord said, "I am . . . the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob" (D&amp;amp;C 136:21). Abraham was tested and was true and faithful. The Father had made him. And the Lord said again that Abraham "hath entered into his exaltation and now sitteth upon his throne" (D&amp;amp;C 132:29). Abraham followed the path I am telling you you should follow. And you can follow the same one and find your exaltation and find your throne and sit upon it. And so the great commandments and promises can be had by all of us.<br><br>And so we wonder why, with all these blessings and promises, men will fail to marry and fail to marry right, and thus waste their lives in a frozen wilderness. Why will any person ever give a single thought to a marriage out of the temple and jeopardize those glories that are available? Why would a person with a temple marriage ever think of divorce or breaking up a family or of any other immoralities or infidelities? Why? Oh, why?<br><br>Some years ago I spoke on this campus about a certain king who abdicated his throne for love of a woman and with that abdication lost his kingdom, acclaim, and riches. And while there are few kings today who abdicate their thrones, there are numerous princes in this church who abdicate their thrones before they come to them, for they were born to become priests and gods forever and ever.<br><br>As I conclude this address, may I bring you back to the 76th, 131st, and 132nd sections of the Doctrine and Covenants and many others, and may I repeat for emphasis some of the lines we have quoted:<br><br><i>In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees.</i><br><br><i>A man must enter into this order of the priesthood.</i><br><br><i>. . . the new and everlasting covenant.</i><br><br><i>And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.</i><br><br><i>That is the end of his kingdom: he cannot have an increase.</i><br><br><i>Prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you.</i><br><br><i>If ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.</i><br><br><i>All . . . shall abide the law. . . . it was instituted for the fulness of my glory.</i><br><br><i>All covenants [must be made] . . . for time and for all eternity . . . through the medium of mine anointed.</i><br><br><i>All contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.</i><br><br><i>And everything that is in the world . . . that [is] . . . not by me . . . shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead. . . . [It] shall be shaken and destroyed.</i><br><br><i>If a man marry him a wife in the world . . . not by me nor by my word . . . not of force when they are dead.</i><br><br><i>When they are out of the world . . . [the righteous may be] appointed angels in heaven . . . ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.</i><br><br><i>For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain . . . without exaltation . . . to all eternity.</i><br><br><i>And . . . henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.</i><br><br><i>. . . is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world.</i><br><br><i>They cannot pass . . . the angels and the gods [who] are appointed there.</i><br><br><i>Then shall they be gods, because they have no end . . . above all, because all things are subject unto them.</i><br><br><i>And the angels are subject unto them.</i><br><br><i>Except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory.</i><br><br><i>Few [find the strait and narrow way], because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me.</i><br><br><i>But . . . ye [who] receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.</i><br><br>Let me close with a little story that I told after returning from Europe in 1955. I had been to the temple dedication. One German woman whom I knew had lost her husband in the war. When I was in the temple at its dedication in Bern, this sweet German woman told me her story. Her husband had disappeared ten years before. That was in 1945, when the war ended. No word was ever had from him or news of his whereabouts. It was presumed that he was dead. After the dedication, having talked to President McKay about it and having the permission, this sweet woman went through the temple for her endowments. I saw her again as she went to the counter to get her clothing. I saw her in the session with contentment and peace upon her face. I saw her after the temple service, and she said to me with great satisfaction, "Brother Kimball, I have now been sealed to my husband. Let the war come. Let the persecutions pile up. Let the bombs burst. Let whatever need be come that war brings on. I'm all right now. I'm sealed to my husband and I am at peace and life is good."<br><br>As we close, we seem to hear a gracious and loving God reminding us, "I gave you your opportunity. I taught you the right principles. You knew better. When you refuse to hearken you will suffer the consequences." He is saying a man must enter into this new and everlasting covenant or he cannot be exalted. "You did not listen. If you abide not that covenant, then you are damned. All those who have this law revealed to them must obey the same. All marriage contracts not by me are of no efficacy in the life to come. Fail in this law and you can never be gods. Obey not my law and you cannot obtain my glory." "Receive ye, therefore, my law," the Lord said (D&amp;amp;C 132:24).<br><br>Now, my young brothers and sisters, if I meet any of you beyond the veil--I'll reach there before you do--don't anyone of you ever come to Brother Kimball and say, "You didn't tell me. I didn't understand. Nobody warned me of this. I came to my marriage without knowledge."<br><br>God bless you, my brothers and sisters. This is a vital message. I hope it has sunk into your hearts. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Spencer W.

<h1>y Years of Brigham Young - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Speaking of lineage, I should like to explain to you that whatever your great-grandparents or forebears did cannot be grafted into your own life. If you happen to be named Brown or Jones or Spendlove or Lewis or Young or any name, it doesn't matter who your ancestors are. If you live right you can become an ancestor yourself and have your own descendants look up to you as a person from whom they might be happy to have descended and whom they might be glad to emulate. I don't look upon President Brigham Young with any feeling that I am any better for it. I am happy, of course, to be a descendant, but I think I need to do some of the things he did before I can qualify.<br><h2><b>Childhood and Youth</b></h2><br>John Young, a revolutionary soldier, received a letter in 1800 from a cousin in Whitingham, Vermont. John lived in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and married the daughter of Phineas Howe, a girl by the name of Nabby, whose name we think was really Abigail.<br><br>I now present to you a map showing the location of the towns about which I shall speak. John's cousin sent the letter inviting John to come to Whitingham, Vermont, to live, telling him there was acreage and a lot of trees he could cut, and land he could get cheap, and perhaps offering him some of his own land at a discount. In the late fall or winter of 1800, John Young picked up his wife and eight children and drove across the country, landing at Whitingham; and there, on June 1, with the beautiful summer abloom, Brigham Young was born. The other eight children I shall mention only briefly as I go along; they're important to my life, of course, but not necessarily to this talk.<br><br>At Whitingham Brigham began to grow. The first thing that happened to him was that he apparently couldn't digest some of the food they gave him and he was not a very well child, with the result that he clung to his sister Fanny and wouldn't leave her. So when she went out to milk the family cow, Brigham went out and sat on her lap while she milked with one hand. That's the first knowledge we have of him and what he did. Now I thought that was pretty good, to take part in the family milking so early in life.<br><br>Two years later they were on their way across the country to New York State. They came by way of Albany and then down to a place known as Sherburne (Smyrna), and there they lived for three years. Two more children were born, making a total of eleven, and one of them, little Nabby, died.<br><br>Again they picked up their wagons and moved over to a township called Aurilius. Now, Aurilius is not a small town as you think of Utah towns. Anywhere in that particular country, a town is a section of land about ten, perhaps twelve, miles square--not quite square always, but a hundred square miles covered heavily with trees, except where they had managed to cut them out to make farms. So when you say he came to a town, you simply mean he moved into the forest, got a tract of land, and started to cut wood and to clear the land.<br><br>The history of this family during that period is one of constant moving, constant acquiring of a piece of land, constant cutting of trees and clearing the land, and then, for some reason, moving on to the next place. The remarkable thing about it is that when one of the children would move to a place the rest of the family seemed to gravitate to that place, and at Aurilius there were two of the children who had moved there. So the Young family was at Aurilius. There Nabby Howe Young, the mother of eleven children, died of tuberculosis, worn out from the pioneering days which she endured. Then John Young took his four boys down to Tyrone and again started to clear land.<br><br>That particular winter was bad, and they found themselves in early March--still hard winter in that country--without food. John sent his two older boys, Phineas and Joseph, to find work anywhere which they might exchange for food, corn, or whatever, and kept Brigham and Lorenzo Dow--Brigham fourteen, Lorenzo Dow about ten--there in the cabin with him. John Young had tapped the maple trees on his farm and boiled down the sap and made a quantity of maple sugar. As they finally came to the end of their food supply, he told Brigham he was going to take the sugar over to Painted Post, on the border of Pennsylvania, and sell the sugar in exchange for food. He said, "Now you stay here, Briggy, and tomorrow morning get out and work all day clearing the brush and chopping what you can. And Lorenzo, you pile the brush. It'll take me all night and tomorrow to get there and back, but I'll be back the next day."<br><br>So early that next morning, strapping on his snowshoes and leaving half a pound or so of sugar for the boys to eat as best they could, he left those two small boys and, donning his pack, snowshoed off through the timber to go to Painted Post.<br><br>They worked all that day, as they had promised they would, and about four o'clock they started for the house. As they were walking along they heard a robin sing, one of the early harbingers of spring. They stopped and finally located the robin on a bush some fifty or sixty yards away. Brigham said to Lorenzo, "Now you watch. I'll run around and get the gun and we'll have some supper." So he circled around and got to the cabin and got the gun out and ran back. (The gun, of course, was an old revolutionary muzzle-loading musket, which you fire by putting some powder in a little pan called the frizzen, cocking the gun, and then firing it. The hammer, which has a flint attached to it, strikes a piece of steel, causing a spark to drop into the powder. The powder ignites and runs down a hole in the gun where the main charge is, and the gun fires.) The gun barrel had a half-inch bore. Now you wonder what a half inch is--about the size of my finger. The bullet was about that size too. The gun must have weighed fifteen pounds, but Brigham managed to aim it. Whether he propped it up I don't know, but he aimed it and pulled the trigger and shot the bird's head off. They ran over and got the bird, skinned it and cleaned it, went to the cabin, and put the bird in a kettle on the fireplace with a little water and began to stew it. They upended the flour barrel and beat on the bottom, catching what they could in the pan, and managed to get half a cup of flour. They thickened the stew with that and had bird stew and sugar for supper. The next night, of course, John got home, bringing some corn meal and pork, and they were able to survive.<br><br>About a year later, Brigham asked his father if he might go out and earn his living and learn how to be a carpenter, and his father gave him permission. Whether or not he apprenticed himself or just hired out I don't know, but he went back up to Aurilius, where his sister was staying. There, in the same township, the town of Auburn, New York, was beginning to develop. There he stayed and learned the carpenter's trade, the painter's trade, and the glazier's trade. I suppose it took quite a bit of doing, and I can't explain to you what he went through as a boy, learning those trades, but he worked hard, became expert, and was a very meticulous, careful craftsman, as the chairs which he made in that day and still exist attest.<br><br>When he was about twenty-two or twenty-three he lived in Port Byron, on the Erie Canal, fifty or sixty miles east of Palmyra. During this period he met Miss Miriam Works, a beautiful girl, of course. (They always have to be beautiful. From the looks of my family I can believe it, although I don't measure up to the fact.) They were married and had two children and stayed at Port Byron.<br><br>Meanwhile the Young family, John Young and all of his children, began to gather at Mendon. There they kept importuning Brigham to come over, and finally, in 1828, he moved his wife and his two children over to Mendon. There they met Heber C. Kimball and his wife Vilate, and the family, and there was cemented a friendship which lasted as long as they lived.<br><h2><b>Introduction to the "Golden Bible"</b></h2><br>At Mendon, Brigham's brother Phineas Howe Young, an itinerant Methodist preacher who had a circuit (a distance of some miles around, where his congregation lived and where there were a certain number of small buildings in which he could preach), was coming home from his circuit riding and stopped at the house of a man named Tomlinson, one of his members, for lunch. You folks can understand that, because even here in our cow country if a cowpuncher, riding a horse, at noon time comes to a ranch house he goes into the corral, puts his horse in the barn, gives him a feed of hay and some grain, and walks up to the house and is given dinner. And so it was with Phineas Howe Young. He stopped for lunch at Tomlinson's and sat in the parlor. Sitting there also was a tall young man dressed in well-worn homespun.<br><br>The young man said to him, "Sir, I have a book I should like you to read."<br><br>"Oh," said Phineas, "what is it?"<br><br>"It's called the Book of Mormon, sir, and it's a revelation from God."<br><br>Phineas said, "Oh, the golden Bible?"<br><br>"They call it that," said the man, "and I'd like you to read the testimony of the witnesses."<br><br>The man turned to the back of the book, where in the first edition the testimonies were located, and handed it to Phineas. Phineas read the testimony of the three witnesses, how they had seen with the power of God these plates and heard the voice of God declare that the plates were translated correctly, and then they read about the eight men who had seen them with their eyes and had hefted them and touched them and described them to be of ancient and curious workmanship. The man said, "I would like you to buy one, and I testify to you it's true."<br><br>Phineas bought one, and on his way home he read a little of it. When he got home he said to his wife, "I have a week's work to do, and I don't want to be disturbed."<br><br>"Oh," said his wife, "what is it?"<br><br>He said, "I have a book here and I want to read it and point out its errors so that I can tell my congregations it's not true." Phineas read the book and, of course, found out it was true. He took it to his father and he read it, and to his brother Brigham and he read it, and to some of his other family members and they read it. They began to talk about it and decided there might be something to what they had read."<br><br>That summer there came into the community five young men from Columbia, Pennsylvania, 125 miles away. Walking through the country without purse or scrip, they stopped at Mendon and at Victor, where Phineas Young lived. Phineas welcomed them and opened his home to them, where they preached. The Kimballs and the Youngs all went to hear them speak.<br><h2><b>Conversion</b></h2><br>At the end of the conversation they were quite sure that the young men had something which was really true. But they waited, and they investigated. That winter, in late December or early January, Heber C. Kimball hitched up a team of horses onto a bobsled, and, accompanied by Brigham and his wife, Miriam (Vilate stayed home to take care of the children), and Phineas Young, drove the 125 miles from Mendon to Columbia. Where they stayed and how they fed their horses in that cold winter weather I do not know. They visited there for a week. There they heard the gift of tongues exercised. And when they went back home they were convinced.<br><br>As soon as they returned home, Brigham hitched a horse to a sleigh and, with Portonius Greene, drove the horse from Mendon up around the end of Lake Ontario, across the St. Lawrence River to Kingston, and twenty or thirty miles back in the country to "Loboro" (Loughborough). There Joseph Young had a congregation. Brigham convinced Joseph there was something to this new doctrine. Joseph accompanied him on the return to Mendon.<br><br>In April of 1832, Brigham went back into the woods to a creek with Eliad Miller, one of the five men who first came preaching, and, in a blinding snowstorm, found a hole deep enough and was baptized. He sat on a log, his clothing freezing on him as he sat there, and he was confirmed a member of the Church and ordained an elder. He later said, "As I sat there and that was done, I felt the sweet spirit of the Holy Ghost witnessing that my sins were forgiven." And so he became a member of the Church. Miriam, his wife, was baptized a week later. That summer Miriam died of tuberculosis, leaving two small girls, Elizabeth and Vilate. Heber C. and Vilate Kimball took them in.<br><br>That fall Heber C. Kimball and Joseph and Brigham Young hitched up Heber C. Kimball's team to a wagon and headed west to Kirtland, Ohio, to meet the Prophet Joseph. They rode along through the beautiful fall scenery, down across New York, around Lake Erie, across upper Pennsylvania--the 325 miles to Kirtland. That's about as far as from Salt Lake City to St. George. They arrived in Kirtland and found Portonius Greene and Rhoda Young Greene already living there, had a little lunch, I suppose, washed up, and then asked to be taken to where the Prophet was. Brother Greene took them to the Prophet's house, and there they were informed that the Prophet was in the back lot cutting timber. They walked back.<br><br>Can you see them, the fall air reflecting the gold and yellow of those beautiful trees in full fall color? As they walked along they saw a man over six feet tall, strong, vigorous, barefooted, cutting wood. As he turned, his blond hair seemed to reflect the golden color of the leaves; and his blue eyes seemed all the more blue. He in turn saw Brigham Young, five foot eight and a half, strong of body and firm of step, also with light hair, about the same color as his own, also with blue eyes. And as the two clasped hands, Brigham said to himself, "I know he is a prophet." From that day on he dedicated his life to Joseph Smith and never missed an opportunity to be in his presence, day or night, storm or calm, winter or summer.<br><h2><b>Taught by the Prophet</b></h2><br>They went back home to Mendon, and Brigham and Joseph started in late November or early December, through mud and snow and cold and wind--on foot this time. They started at Mendon, of course, and walked up around Lake Ontario on foot, crossing the St. Lawrence on the ice. As they started to cross the ice, the ice bent beneath their weight and water came up through cracks in it to the depth of their ankles. They immediately separated fifty yards apart and prayed that the ice would not break. It didn't and they managed to get across. They went to West "Loboro," converted that congregation, and then came back.<br><br>As soon as spring came, in April Brigham went immediately, on foot and alone, around the south shore of Lake Ontario and down the St. Lawrence to Ogdensburg, converting people all through that part of the country. He went over to West "Loboro," joined a group of people who wanted to go to Kirtland and had their wagons ready, and guided them all the way down some 600-odd miles to Kirtland, Ohio, and then back to Mendon. His travels totaled more than 1,000 miles that summer, much of it on foot.<br><br>That fall Heber C. Kimball and Brigham sold their property, packed up the wagon, and with their families drove through the fall beauty to Kirtland, Ohio--325 miles--to be with the Prophet. When they got to Kirtland, they found that the brethren there were all going over to Cleveland for the winter to earn money. Brigham said, "I'm not going. I came to be with the Prophet and I intend to stay." Even though there wasn't much work in Kirtland, he stayed and got jobs as a carpenter. He said that when spring came he had "means."<br><br>Every time the Prophet talked, wherever the Prophet held a meeting, wherever the Prophet was holding discussions, Brigham Young laid down his hammer, his saw, his plane, and his square and, without fail, went and listened. And he did it constantly.<br><br>In 1834 the Prophet recruited the brethren to go on the Zion's Camp March. Brigham, of course, with his brother Joseph, joined that march. They went from Kirtland down across Ohio, past Columbus, passing Dublin, across Indiana, across Illinois to the Mississippi, across Missouri to Fishing River. You know the story of Fishing River--how, when the mobbers came to wipe them out, a great storm closed in on them, the river rose, and a great hailstorm came and drove the mobbers to cover, and how the cholera outbreak came as punishment because of the disobedience of some of the Zion's Camp members. Fourteen of them died. Then the camp was disbanded and Brigham Young was discharged along with the others and walked all the way back to Kirtland--as far as from Winter Quarters to Salt Lake City. He and his brother Joseph did it in twenty-five days. You can figure out how far they walked each day.<br><br>Then, of course, there was the great time when they dedicated the Kirtland Temple. Brigham Young did the painting of the interior of that temple and Lorenzo Dow Young did the plastering of the outside of it, with the help, of course, of others. Twelve apostles were now chosen from those who had marched in Zion's Camp. On that march Joseph Smith taught Brigham Young how to lead men. And he learned from Joseph Smith how men should be led, as they made that thousand-mile-plus walk to the Liberty area.<br><br>Called on a mission, they started at Kirtland and came to Buffalo and then fanned out all across New York State, meeting every so often to hold conferences, then across Massachusetts and finally as far as Farmington, Maine, coming back that fall.<br><h2><b>Apostasy in the Church</b></h2><br>Then apostasy began. The hatred of the men who rose against the Prophet, including some of the apostles, was very great. Brigham and Heber C. Kimball, Joseph Smith, Sr., and Hyrum stood firm, and whenever the meetings were held in which the apostates tried to vote the Prophet out, they were so vehement in his defense that the apostates could do nothing.<br><br>In one such meeting in the Kirtland temple, where the apostate conspirators were going to vote the Prophet out of the Church, a man by the name of Jacob Bump, a pugilist, got so angry at the defense of the Prophet by Brigham Young that he jumped to his feet and shouted, "Let me get my hands on him!" Friends grabbed him and held him off, and Brigham said, "Oh, if he wants to lay his hands on me, let him try." Bump did not attempt to make good his threat. The apostates got so tough and so mean that Brigham finally had to flee to save his own life.<br><br>In this period of a year or so, Brigham had--six or seven different times, I would judge--taken steps to preserve the Prophet's life against that mob, as they conspired to waylay him in one place or to ambush him in another and kill him. I shall not take the time to describe some of those events.<br><br>In December Brigham rode away on a horse, leaving his wife, Mary Ann, whom he had married in 1834 at Kirtland, his two girls, and the twins that had since been born--four children--alone to fend for themselves as best they could. He rode the horse across Ohio, stopping at Dublin, Indiana.<br><br>Three weeks later the Prophet Joseph Smith was driven out. Starting at ten o'clock at night, he and his counselor, Sidney Rigdon--the two of them on horses--rode sixty miles on that cold, bitter night. I don't know how many of you young folks have ridden a horse very far, but I rode one forty miles one time, and that was as much as I wanted to ride. Joseph rode sixty miles in the bitter cold of a zero weather night. A few days later his wife met him there. She had been brought slowly along in a wagon. Then all the way across Ohio the spies of the mobbers and some of the mobbers tried to locate him to kill him, but the Lord blinded their eyes. Finally he arrived at Dublin too.<br><h2><b>More Trials</b></h2><br>At Dublin a strange thing happened. There Joseph met Brigham Young, Lorenzo Dow Young, the Decker family, and two or three other families who were waiting for spring to break, so that they could go west. When the Prophet got there he tried to find work. He couldn't find any. He could cut a cord of wood for fifty cents. That's a four-by-four-by-eight-foot stack of wood. He could earn fifty cents that way, and it would take all day to do it.<br><br>So he said to Brigham Young, "Brother Brigham, you're a member of the Twelve Apostles and have the authority. I want to place myself in your hands. I want your advice. Counsel me. What shall I do?"<br><br>Brigham said to him, "Are you serious?"<br><br>"Yes, I'm serious."<br><br>"Very well," said Brigham. "If you're serious, I'll tell you what you shall do. I want you to quit worrying and rest yourself, and I promise you you will have means by which to go on."<br><br>Then he went to Brother Tomlinson, who was going to sell a tavern, and he said, "Brother Tomlinson, you want to sell your tavern. All right. You'll get two offers. The first offer will be the best offer. Take that offer and then give liberally to Joseph Smith."<br><br>Well, that's how it proved to be. He sold the tavern. The first offer was the best offer; he took it. Then he went to the Prophet Joseph Smith and gave him three hundred dollars of the money which he had received from his tavern. Three hundred dollars in those days is about eighteen hundred dollars today. And so the Prophet had means. And those men then moved on, with their wagon trains in the snow, crossing icy rivers. There were no bridges. They began at Dublin, crossing Indiana, crossing Illinois, and arriving at Far West, Missouri, in April.<br><br>Brigham sent for Mary Ann to come. I don't know how she found strength to do it, but she started at Kirtland and took a wagon and went over to the Allegheny River. On that river she got a small boat and was taken slowly down the river to the Ohio River, then finally coming to the junction of the Mississippi, traveling up the Mississippi to St. Louis, changing there to a Missouri River boat, and finally coming up the Missouri River and landing at Richmond.<br><br>Brigham met her at Richmond. She was so emaciated from lack of food and the discomforts of that trip he did not recognize her and had to be told who she was. He took her to his little new farm at Far West and nursed her back to health and strength.<br><br>Then came upon them all the terrible mobbings you've heard about. I'll have to skip a great deal. Joseph Smith was now in Liberty Jail. Brigham and Heber--the two senior apostles now, due to the apostasy of the senior man--rode over every few days to the Prophet to talk to him through the little window of his basement cell, asking his opinion, his advice and counsel. From that prison he told them what to do, and those two men followed his counsel.<br><br>The Saints were driven out of Missouri, and Brigham Young did one thing I'd like you to know. He took a paper and went around to all the male members of the Church and said to them, "I want you to sign this paper, stating that you will pledge everything you own to a committee to be used to take out with us the Saints who can't go on their own, who have nothing. We do not want to leave a member of the Church behind who wants to leave." To the credit of that body of men, poor as they were, bereft of stock taken by the mobs, they pledged their money, their cattle, their wagons--everything they owned as a group--to take out the poor. And then in February Brigham and his wife and Vilate Kimball and her children got in a wagon. They obtained a scrawny team somewhere. Brigham drove that team about twenty miles, took the families out, pitched a small tent, put them in the tent, built a fire, cut enough wood for twenty-four hours, turned the team around, and went back to Far West and got a poor family which had nothing and brought it that far. Then that family camped in the tent while he took his family on another twenty miles and came back and got the second family. Others were doing the same thing.<br><br>By that means they took the poor out of Missouri to Quincy. And that's been the habit of this church ever since, to take care of its poor if it possibly can.<br><h2><b>Mission to England</b></h2><br>When they reached Illinois, they were reminded that in April they had promised to obey the Lord's command to come back and start for their European mission from the cornerstone of the Far West temple. Brigham Young reminded his colaborers of that, and so five of the apostles got in a wagon and started out. Of course they had gone from Far West to Quincy and had to travel as I described; so they left Quincy, crossed the river, and--using back roads where they wouldn't be noticed, because they were in grave danger for their lives--arrived in Far West on April 25 at midnight. They were to leave April 26. Heber C. Kimball and one or two of the loyal Saints met them there. They sang a song, offered a prayer, ordained two other brethren apostles, making a total of seven, a majority. Then, dedicating each other to it, and as day was breaking, they left on April 26 in harmony with the revelation and commandment given of the Lord on their mission.<br><br>As they rode past the house of one of the apostates, one of the brethren, Brother Turley, said, "Stop, I want to say goodbye to this man." And so they stopped.<br><br>He got out and knocked on the cabin, and the woman said, "Who is it?"<br><br>He said, "It's Brother Turley."<br><br>"It couldn't be. He's in Quincy, Illinois." But she opened the door and there stood Brother Turley. And she said, "What are you doing here?"<br><br>"We have just finished dedicating the temple site and are leaving for the mission to England, and I am going with them."<br><br>With that he closed the door, and the apostate listened with chagrin, knowing that the prophecy had been fulfilled, hearing the rapidly retreating sounds of the horses' hoofs on hard dirt as they rode east out of Far West. They had fulfilled a prophecy, determined that they were not going to let the Lord down. They rode on across the country and finally reached Quincy.<br><br>By that time the Saints had moved up to Commerce, which is now Nauvoo. Brigham Young got a room in a barracks across the river in Montrose, and in that one room put his family with Wilford Woodruff and his family. They lived, two families together, in one room.<br><br>September came. So sick he couldn't stand, his wife sick with a newborn baby, his children sick in bed, Brigham crawled out of that house to the door and staggered to a wagon. He crawled up onto the floor of the wagon, was hauled down to the river two or three hundred yards away, managed to crawl into a boat, was taken across the river, crawled out, and lay on the ground for a long time. A horseman came along and offered him a ride and got him onto the horse in some manner, and he was taken to the house of Heber C. Kimball. Heber C. Kimball himself was sick. The two men lay sick in bed in the Kimball home for, a week or two, and finally they determined that that mustn't be, and so they arose, arranged for a wagon, said goodbye to their two wives--as Mary Ann had come across the river to help nurse him by this time--got in the wagon, and lay down. Heber said to Brigham, "Let's not leave them this way." So they staggered to their feet and raised their hats and said, "Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for Zion!" and fell flat on the floor of the wagon.<br><br>They were hauled away twenty miles. They stayed with a family. I shan't describe that, except that as they drove along in a wagon they had acquired, they came across at Terre Haute, Indiana, a drunk member of the Church, a doctor, who gave Heber C. Kimball an overdose of morphine. That night Brigham fought all the long night to save Heber's life. Heber looked more dead than alive in the morning. The three men with them decided they wanted to go on. So Brigham said, "All right, you take the team and the surrey and go on, and we'll catch up with you when Heber gets better." And as they went out, thinking Heber was going to die in an hour or two, Heber weakly said from the bed, "We'll beat you to Kirtland."<br><br>As soon as Brigham and Heber were able to go, they went to a small town, Pleasanton, near Terre Haute, and there the Saints gave them $13.50. With that $13.50 they started out and got on a stage (a bus today), went as far as the $13.50 would take them, went into a tavern, and hired a room for the night. The next morning Brigham looked in his purse. There was enough money there to pay for the tavern rent and enough money to take them another day's journey. They did that all the way across Indiana, across Ohio, to Kirtland.<br><br>About the second time it happened, Brigham said to Heber, "Are you putting money in my purse?"<br><br>Heber said, "No, you know I haven't any money. How could I put money in your purse?"<br><br>"Well, it's there."<br><br>They spent a total of $89.50 out of the $13.50 which was given to them.<br><br>They worked their way to New York State by way of Cleveland and Kirtland, up to Buffalo across New York, into Vermont, where Brigham saw some of his family, and down to New York City. Brigham traveled in rags. The only way he had to keep warm that winter was to have an old quilt wrapped around him, tied with a rope to keep it on. En route he was given three yards of sateen to make an overcoat.<br><br>By the next April they were ready to sail. They had no money. Brigham appealed to the Saints in Long Island by saying to them, "We have come this far without money, but we can't swim the ocean without money. And we must get to England." And so the members of the Church there contributed to him personally $19.50. Then Brigham went to the captain of the Black Ball line.<br><br>Brigham said to the captain, "How much will the fare be?"<br><br>The captain said, "Eighteen dollars."<br><br>It cost him a dollar to hire his share of the cook, and he had fifty cents left. The ship pulled out. Brigham occupied an upper bunk and Heber C. Kimball a lower bunk, and each shared his bunk with another man--two men to each bunk. And that's the way they crossed the ocean. There was a table where they ate their food which was brought to them from the cook's galley.<br><br>They landed in England a month later. Brigham Young had been seasick the whole time, so sick he couldn't get out of the bunk. And when he got to England he was so thin and so nearly starved that his cousin, Willard Richards, who met them at the dock in Liverpool, couldn't recognize him.<br><br>The following map represents the trips he took in England. He got to Ledbury, and in Malvern he was inspired to call on John Benbow, who had been converted by Wilford Woodruff, and to ask Benbow to lend him the money to get the Book of Mormon printed. Benbow lent him enough to get the Book of Mormon printed and later tore up the note. They printed 5,000 copies of the Book of Mormon and 3,000 hymnbooks, started the<i>Millennial Star</i>going, converted 8,000 people, and left a year later for Nauvoo. They landed in New York, came across to Philadelphia, then to Pittsburgh, and then down the Ohio and up to Nauvoo, arriving in 1842.<br><h2><b>Artificial Respiration</b></h2><br>Something happened in November of 1842 I'd like to read to you. Brigham was very ill. He had a terrible fever. The Prophet stayed and nursed him for six hours, and for thirty hours the frenzied fight to keep him alive, with all the known medical means, continued night and day. The skin began to peel from his body until his body had a peeled look. When the fever left him on the eighteenth day, they bolstered him up in a chair, but he was so near gone he could not close his eyes, which were set and staring. His chin dropped down and his breathing stopped. Mary Ann took in the situation and threw some cold water in his face, but this had no effect. Then she dashed a handful of strong camphor into his face and eyes, "which I did not feel in the least," he later said, "neither did I move a muscle. Then she held my nostrils between her thumb and finger, and placing her mouth directly over mine, blew into my lungs until she filled them with air. This set my lungs going and I began to breathe." And thus the present method of artificial respiration was used many years ago.<br><h2><b>Plural Marriage</b></h2><br>During that period the Prophet Joseph Smith taught Brigham Young the doctrine of plural marriage. I'd like you young folks to know that the Prophet Joseph Smith revealed this to the world and revealed it to Brigham Young. Here is about what happened. Mary Ann Young was lying in the cabin, the front wall of which was right up against the edge of the road. There was no path. It was a hot summer's night, the windows were open, and she pulled the bed over against the window to get what air there was.<br><br>Down this road came Brigham Young and Joseph Smith. She heard Brigham say to Joseph, "Joseph, the doctrine of eternal marriage as you described it to me is not from the right source."<br><br>Joseph Smith said to him, "It is from the right source, and you will know it, Brother Brigham."<br><br>Brother Brigham then moved toward the door to open the latch, and Joseph Smith walked on up the street. Then Brigham stopped. He didn't pull the latch string. He suddenly called out, "Joseph! Joseph! The Lord has revealed it to me!" Joseph came back and they spoke a few minutes, and then Joseph went on.<br><br>Later on, Brigham said:<br><br><i>I saw he was after something</i>[Joseph had been hinting to him],<i>his conversation leading my mind along and others to see how we could bear this. The revelation was given in 1843, but the doctrine was revealed before this. And when I told Joseph, right in front of my house in the street, what I understood, as he was shaking hands and leaving me, he turned around and looked me in the eye. Says he, "Brother Brigham, are you speaking what you understand? Are you in earnest?"</i><br><br><i>Says I, "I speak just as the Spirit manifests to me."</i><br><br><i>Says he, "God bless you. The Lord has opened your mind."</i><br><br><i>And he turned and went off.</i><br><br>And that was how Brigham Young first heard actually in words from the Prophet what he was to do. His loyalty to the Prophet, of course, was such that he proceeded to do it.<br><h2><b>Be Loyal, As He Was</b></h2><br>I haven't the time now to explain to you how they went east, how from that time on they promoted the presidency of the United States for Joseph Smith, how in Boston they heard of the death of the Prophet, how they hurried back from Boston across Massachusetts, taking a boat down the Erie Canal to Detroit, across Michigan on a stage to Chicago, across Illinois to Galena, and down the river quickly to Nauvoo in time to save the Church from the apostates. Brigham Young stood up there on that immortal day and, as the power of the Lord transfigured his face and figure so that it looked like the Prophet Joseph Smith, even to the whistle (a mob had broken a front tooth in 1832, and as he spoke he made a whistling sound), he said, "Here is Brigham. Have his knees ever faltered?" He comforted the Saints, and by the inspiration of God they knew that it was he and the Twelve who were to lead the Church, not Sidney Rigdon.<br><br>He died in Salt Lake City in 1877, of peritonitis following appendicitis. As he lay on the bed, my great-grandmother said, "his eyes seemed to be fastened upon someone in the far corner toward the ceiling of the room. And we heard him say, 'Joseph! Joseph! Joseph!'"<br><br>May the Lord bless us all to be as loyal as he was. As you walk past that bronze effigy which faces the interior of your campus, you may look at it as you pass, and perhaps there will come to you a feeling of what it means not even to teach the multiplication tables without the Holy Ghost. That was the command he gave Brother Maeser when he sent him down here. The key to his life was the Holy Ghost, which he courted constantly, to which he was attuned as the strings on a musical instrument vibrate to others in the same tuning level. May the Lord bless us all to understand the gospel, to know we must be loyal and true if we expect to reach salvation, I pray in the name of Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>S.

<h1>Doesn’t Matter” - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Wouldn't that be wonderful if it were true that I was a marvelous work and a wonder. It's a great honor, brothers and sisters, to have the invitation to talk to you here today. I feel mighty frightened right at this moment when I think that you are all college students and professors and I am just a country boy who milked the cows and didn't even have a high school in his town. To come here I feel embarrassed. But I am grateful for this great university, and I am grateful to be one of the Board of Trustees.<br><br>I think of the experience of the Prophet Joseph when he was only eighteen years old and was visited three times during the night by Moroni and again the next morning. Moroni quoted various passages of scriptures, telling him that they were about to be fulfilled. One was from the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, where Isaiah said that the Lord would set his hand again the second time to gather scattered Israel, that he would bring in the dispersed of Judah, that he would set up an ensign unto the nations. Now, whether you realize it or not, this institution is an ensign to the nations--there isn't anything else like it in all the world--and so is the great organization of this church. And I thank the Lord for the faith that I have that the promises of the prophets will be fulfilled, that this work will continue to spread abroad until it shall fill the whole earth. I think you students are privileged to be here with these wonderful men and women of the faculty who have faith in the Lord and are helping to plant into your hearts a love for the Lord and a love for his truth and to prepare you for the positions of responsibility and leadership in our Father's kingdom and also in the world.<br><br>Now, in the last general conference, which just ended a week ago, I spoke a little on the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit, and I quoted from a survey that had been made of nine of the largest churches indicating that there wasn't one of those churches that believed in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. If you were to take that out of our church what would there be left to look forward to? I remember a little statement that appeared in the<i>Reader's Digest</i>some years ago from Channing Pollock, entitled "Heaven Doesn't Matter," and I just wonder whether heaven<i>would</i>matter if we didn't believe in the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I'd like to read that little statement from Channing Pollock. After philosophizing on the kinds, of heaven that people expect to obtain, and, referring to Aunt Jane, he adds:<br><br><i>Shall we like her, or ourselves, as disembodied spirits? I've never thought of myself as a materialist, but the things I've enjoyed all seem to have required body and mind. . . .</i><br><br><i>In the resurrection, there is to be no marriage nor giving in marriage--and that's a big drawback, too. Personally, I can't conceive a heaven without it. My own ego is so inextricably blended with that of my wife, and my own happiness has been so long part of hers. Nor would it help much to be vaguely associated with her in spirit. Married life is made up of so many physical and mental contacts, of so many shared fears and hopes, sorrows and joys, pains and comfortings that both of us, and millions of other wives and husbands, couldn't help missing terribly in any conceivable resort of souls.</i>[<i>Reader's Digest,</i>30 (January 1937):23]<br><br>Now we have a message for those millions who couldn't be happy with that kind of philosophy, because we have a true conception that has come to us through the restoration of the gospel in our day and time.<br><h2><b>An Eternal Weight of Glory</b></h2><br>I'd like to read you just a little statement from the Doctrine and Covenants to show how definitely the Lord has indicated in his revelations the eternal duration of the marriage covenant. He said,<br><br><i>For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundations of the world. . . .</i><br><br><i>Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.</i><br><br><i>Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage [that has to be done here]; but are appointed angels in heaven; which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.</i><br><br><i>For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:5, 15–17]<br><br>Now, I've done a lot of missionary work, and I've talked to many leaders and members of other churches, and if you were to promise them that they could be angels in heaven they'd be satisfied. But not so with the Latter-day Saints. In this revelation the Lord has made it very clear that unless there be this binding together under the new and everlasting covenant they can be ministering angels to those who are worthy of a far greater degree of glory. And so heaven<i>does</i>matter to Latter-day Saints when they understand these things, and it gives them something to work for and something to seek for.<br><br>Now I'll read you, out of that same section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a statement to those who do qualify. Compare this with the other one that I just read you:<br><br><i>It shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; it shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 132:19]<br><br>What a marvelous promise! We don't need to say, like Channing Pollock, that heaven doesn't matter. If we just knew and could understand what awaits us when we've finished our lives here, I am sure that the greatest ambition of our lives would be to prepare ourselves for the life that is to follow. Just as you've come here to school to prepare yourselves to be successful in the battle of life, to be able to enjoy the comforts of life, to be able to enjoy the companionship of educated and trained people, to be able to be leaders and not leaners in this great world, you'd also want to plan for that eternity that follows.<br><br>Now I don't know whether you ever think of how long eternity is. My wife doesn't like to. But when we had been married for thirty-five years, I said, "Mummy, what do you think we'll be doing thirty-five million years from today?"<br><br>She said, "Where'd you get that crazy idea? It makes me tired to think of it."<br><br>"Well," I said, "you believe in eternal life, don't you?" I said, "In the Book of Mormon we're told that time is measured only to man, that with God there isn't such a thing as time. It's one eternal round. And the Prophet Joseph illustrated by taking a ring. When you cut it, he said, there's a beginning and there's an end, but as long as you don't cut it there's no beginning and there's no end." I said, "Now, Mother, if you believe that, you and I ought to be pretty well acquainted with each other thirty-five million years from today."<br><br>Now, I have a little talk on how long eternity is that makes thirty-five million years look like just the snap of your fingers. Now, if you have the capacity and the faith to believe such a thing, just think of how important heaven is. You won't say, like Channing Pollock, that heaven doesn't matter. It becomes the most important destiny to which you strive, and you'll prepare yourself to be exalted there.<br><h2><b>What Is Salvation?</b></h2><br>When I was a boy, a little saying that we learned in our ward went like this: "To Latter-day Saints, salvation without exaltation is damnation." And I've never forgotten that. The Christian world as a whole does not give much thought to heaven and what will happen after this life. I've talked to many Christians, and about all they think about is to be saved, but they don't know what they mean by being saved. I sat in the study of Peter Marshall, who at the time of his death was the chaplain of the United States Senate, and he said, "A person can be saved just like that," and snapped his finger.<br><br>I said, "I've never thought it was quite that easy myself, Doctor Marshall."<br><br>Now, when you tie them down to what they mean by being saved, about all they can think of is to escape eternal burning. They think that if they're not saved they're going to burn in that fire that never ends, and so forth.<br><br>I've talked to them. Back in South Carolina, at the close of a conference meeting, I was invited to go with the missionaries into the home of a minister, and the leader of the group said to this minister, "President Richards answered the question we were discussing."<br><br>"That so?" he said. "What did he say?"<br><br>The district president turned to me and said, "Brother Richards, you tell him."<br><br>"Well," I said, "I'd be glad to do that, but I'd lots rather tell him why he ought to join the Mormon Church."<br><br>The minister said, "Well, I'd like you to tell me that, but could I ask you one question before you do?"<br><br>"Certainly," I said. "What is it?"<br><br>He said, "Can a man be saved before he dies or does he have to die before he is saved?"<br><br>Down in the South where I labored they all think they're saved. And you know these preachers that gather the multitudes in. All you have to do is to acknowledge that Jesus is your Savior and then you're saved. So when the minister asked me that question I said, "Now, if you'll tell me what you mean by being saved, I'll answer your question." He thought a minute, and he went red in the face, and I knew he was embarrassed with about eight Mormon missionaries sitting right there, and I said, "I'll tell you what we believe. We believe that we were saved before we were born. If we hadn't been, we would have been cast out with Satan and a third of the hosts of heaven. We believe that we might be saved every day that we live, for when we learn a principle of truth and we obey that principle we're saved from the consequences of a broken law. We believe that we might be saved every day after we die. To a Latter-day Saint," I said, "salvation is a process and not an end." And I quoted the words of the Prophet Joseph where he said that a man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge.<br><br>Now, the Lord might forgive us, as these preachers tell us, if we believe in Jesus Christ; but he can't reward us for what we haven't done just because we acknowledge the Savior as our only Savior. And so you follow the prophecies in the scriptures of the things that are to transpire. You remember that when John was banished upon the Isle of Patmos he saw the new heaven and the new earth--when "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away"; and when we should no more need the sun by day or the moon by night, because the glory of God would be upon the earth; when no man would say, "Know ye the Lord?" for every man would walk in the light of the Lord, his God. (See Revelation 21:4, 23–24.) And then he "saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened. . . and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works" (Revelation 20:12). Now, that isn't just an acknowledgment; that's the things that have to be written up to our credit, that we be lifters and not just leaners. And then he said, "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power." But they shall become kings and priests unto the most high God and shall rule and reign with him forever (Revelation 20:6).<br><br>Think of that. That doesn't sound like sitting around and playing a violin or a harp forever. And that's about all that the ordinary Christian can think of for salvation. I think it would become a little monotonous; and furthermore, as far as I'm concerned, I'm off on the wrong foot if that's what heaven is, because I don't know one note from another. And I'll have to start all over again.<br><br>Can you imagine sitting and playing a harp forever and forever? As one man put it, "For the first million years he wants to look at the face of the Savior." (Now don't think that I'm sacrilegious.) And then he said for the next ten minutes he wanted to look at his wife, and then he wanted to look at the Savior for the rest of eternity.<br><br>Now, it seems to me that anyone with common sense ought to realize that a person has a greater destiny than anything like that. This life ought to be a preparation for steps forward and upward in achievement and accomplishment that we've never dreamed of here in this life, and that's what my faith is.<br><br>And then take the parable of the talents. To the one that had received five talents and to the other that had received two the Lord said, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord" (Matthew 25:21). That doesn't sound like sitting around and twiddling your thumbs and looking at something forever, does it? He'll make us ruler over many things. What are we going to rule over? These are things we'll find out, and this is why we have this eternal principle of the eternal duration of the marriage covenant.<br><br>I feel sorry for people who don't understand these eternal truths. They are the truths we want you young people to understand, so that you'll make no mistakes when you marry and will be sealed by the power of the holy priesthood under the new and everlasting covenant so that you can be prepared for that glory.<br><br>Why do we have the three degrees of glory if we only have to believe on the Savior in order to be saved? And when we're saved, which one of those glories are we going to go to? You see, they don't understand. That's the way people's minds are blinded by the leaders of men. That's why Isaiah saw that because they teach for doctrine the precepts of men the Lord would proceed to bring forth a marvelous work and a wonder, which would cause the wisdom of their wise men to perish. They don't understand these things.<br><br>Now, I have no objections to preaching that one must acknowledge that Jesus is the Savior, but it takes more than that. You remember when they came to John the Baptist to be baptized of him, he saw that they hadn't changed their lives. He said, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham" (Matthew 3: 7–9). You see, John understood that it took more than just an acknowledgment. Jesus said that if the blind lead the blind they fall into the ditch together. He didn't say that they would be saved together, but that they would fall into the ditch together. And so it's necessary that we have some conception of what awaits us and why we should prepare for it.<br><h2><b>Build on the Right Foundation</b></h2><br>Now, the Bible is so plain in its teachings of the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit, I don't see how anybody could fail to understand it. When he placed Adam in the garden, the Lord said it wasn't good for man to be alone. And he made a helpmeet for him, and he said that "they twain shall be one flesh" (Matthew 19:5). Now if you divide<i>one,</i>you have only two halves; you don't have two ones. And no man or woman can attain the highest degree of the celestial kingdom without companionship. Thank God that he has arranged a thousand-year millennial reign for these wonderful women that are not willing to give themselves away on good-for-nothing men. (You know what I mean. You wouldn't have any of them like that down here [at BYU]. I tell the girls it's a happy hunting ground down here; but in the world generally, it would be better to wait.)<br><br>We run onto many little experiences and stories. For instance, in California some years ago I went to a Relief Society bazaar with my daughter there--her daughter's sitting right down here this morning--and I met a woman who came up here to go to the Y and started keeping company with a young man who was a member of the Church but wasn't at all active in the Church. When he became serious and proposed to this woman, she said, "I'll never marry a man who doesn't do his duty in the Church and honor his priesthood. I'm going to be able to point to my children and say, 'You follow your father.'" He wasn't willing to pay the price; so their courtship ended right there. In a short time she started keeping company with another young man. He proposed, and their engagement was announced in the newspaper, and a copy of that newspaper was sent to the first suitor in Chicago, where he was living at the time. When he read it, he called her up all the way to Los Angeles--this was before they had those cheap rates--and he said, "I can't live without you. If you'll call off that engagement and give me another opportunity, I'll do anything and everything you ever ask me to do in the Church." When I met them down there in California (she was the daughter of one of the families that lived in the stake there when I was the president), he was a counselor in the bishopric. I've since checked with the stake president, and he said the man later became the bishop and was the best bishop in the stake. And here--just a year ago in April, I think it was--I met him in front of the Hotel Utah. He had just been appointed a member of the stake presidency. Now, there was a girl who understood what it meant to build on the right kind of foundation, who understood that life beyond this life is more important than this and that it pays to make preparation for it.<br><br>I've sometimes used the little illustration of an incident that occurred when they built the Salt Lake Temple. President Brigham Young came on one occasion and found the workmen throwing in chipped granite, and he made them take it out and put in those great granite blocks, with this explanation: "We're building this temple to stand through the Millennium." Now, we're building our lives to stand through the Millennium, and if we live for it we can spend that thousand years with Jesus when he comes to reign upon the earth. For Paul tells us that he shall reign until he has subdued all enemies under his feet, and the last enemy is death. And then he will deliver the kingdom up as a bride prepared for her bridegroom. But those who are not worthy to come forth on the morning of that resurrection, we're told, shall not came forth till the end of the thousand years, and then they'll receive their place in one of these lower kingdoms. Is it worth working far? A thousand years in the presence of the Lord, to help him and to be among the lifters. I think it will be the lifters that he'll call forth and not the leaners, and so we have to be workers in the kingdom.<br><br>I'll tell you another little story about a young man who called me one day. You may have heard me tell this. He said, "Is this Bishop Richards?"<br><br>I said, "Yes, sir."<br><br>"Well," he said, "I'm in trouble."<br><br>"What's your trouble?" I said.<br><br>He said, "I've been keeping company with a girl for three years, and she heard you talk the other night and now she won't go out with me any more."<br><br>"Why won't she?"<br><br>"Because I'm not active in the Church."<br><br>I said, "Good for her. I'm glad to know that there's at least one girl in Israel who'll listen to an old man like me. Now," I said, "what are you going to do about it?"<br><br>He said, "What<i>can</i>I do?"<br><br>"Get active in the Church," I said, "and then go back."<br><br>"How can I?" he said.<br><br>I said, "You go talk to your bishop. If he doesn't help you, you come back to me and I will." He hasn't come back.<br><br>I tell you, brothers and sisters, this, we are told in the Book of Mormon, is the time to prepare ourselves to meet the Lord, and if we're going to do that we've got to set our goals and build upon solid foundations. It's a time to work and not just to sit around and do nothing.<br><br>When I finished my first mission in Holland and I arrived in Liverpool--that's where the headquarters of the European Mission was at that time--Brother Charles W. Penrose was then the president of that mission. (He later became a member of the First Presidency.) They were holding a meeting, and my companion and I slipped in the back of the meeting while it was in process. Brother Penrose was preaching on the fallacy of the Christian idea that all we had to do in the next world was to take it easy. And then he went on, "If that's what heaven is, it wouldn't be heaven for men like Brother Richards down there and myself, would it, Brother Richards?" I didn't know that he knew I was in that meeting, but that's the way I felt toward life.<br><br>When I had a heart attack up in Grace, Idaho, back in 1942, I was away from my work for six weeks. I was then the Presiding Bishop of the Church, and I tell you I almost sweat blood to think that I had to be on that bed and couldn't be out working. So the first meeting that we attended as a bishopric with the First Presidency after I returned, I said to the Presidency, "I found out what hell is."<br><br>President Clark said, "What is it, Bishop?"<br><br>I said, "To see the other fellow working when you can't work." I said, "If there's any truth to the words of the song that there's sweet, sweet rest in heaven,' I'm going to ask to be routed the other way."<br><br>My counselor, Bishop Ashton, was witty, as you might remember, and he said, "Well, Bishop, I wouldn't worry too much about that if I were you. You may not have to ask for it."<br><br>I said, "Yeah, I've thought of that too."<br><br>The apostle Paul, who was caught up into the third heaven and the paradise of God and saw things he was not permitted to write, said, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). I hope that you all can feel that in your own hearts and realize how important this life is to prepare for what awaits us if we prepare ourselves for It. And if you will, you'll be honored in this life, you'll be successful in life, and that's why you're here at this school. And I commend you all for being here and for your desire.<br><h2><b>It's Worth It</b></h2><br>Brother Wilkinson told us once in one of our meetings--and I have since heard it broadcast over KSL--that a survey taken here in the United States indicated that on the average for the nation, a man who gets a college education earns during his lifetime $176,000 more than a high school graduate. Then I always say to the students, "If the going ever seems a little difficult and the exams are hard and you have to burn the midnight oil, just put a little plaque on the wall:<i>$176,000.</i>Then ask yourself whether it pays or not."<br><br>I remind you of the words of the apostle Paul: "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." And then he adds, "For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Galatians 6:7–8). You have to decide each day how you're going to sow seed that will make you happy in this life and make you worthy of the love and respect of good people and the love of your Father in heaven. Then you have to decide what you're going to do to prepare yourselves for that great eternity that awaits you, and particularly for the thousand-year millennial reign.<br><br>With all my heart I pray God to bless you. I can't read that clock, but it looks like it's time for me to quit. So I leave you my love and blessing. And I want to tell you that I have four grandchildren attending school here, and I have one great-granddaughter, and we love them and we love all of our family, and I'd just as soon believe that death was a complete annihilation of both body and spirit as to think that I had to live forever and forever after I pass out of this life without a continuation of the love ties that bind me and my wife and our wonderful family together. I don't know what there really would be to live for. I'd just as soon call it quits. So I thank God for this great eternal truth of the eternal duration of the marriage covenant and the family unit. I hope you will all live and set your mark to achieve that objective and goal in life. I leave you my blessing in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>LeGrand Richards was an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 16 October 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>Life: Rules, Winning, and Prizes - Paul H. Dunn - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is an awesome sight, brothers and sisters, and I am humbled by it. I pray for the inspiration that would be required to teach perhaps a principle or two.<br><br>President Oaks, faculty, and student body, I bring you special greetings from part of your number in Austria and from those just returned to Austria from Israel. It was my privilege last week to attend a Mozart concert in Salzburg, along with my good wife and another couple. How delighted we were to be approached by a number of your fellow students who are studying there. I asked if there was one message I could take back, and--typical of those who are away from our country, away from home and this great University--it was their desire that you realize the blessings and opportunities provided here. I am pleased to indicate that they are well and happy in the work.<br><br>I am pleased also to recognize BYU's great baseball team. To you, Coach Glen Tuckett and Coach Vernon Law, we are all pleased and proud of the great record that you have made. Many eyes have been upon you, and I think it's significant that this school leads the rest of the country in the innovation of bat girls. I don't know what greater motivation a player would need than that. I came down to watch a ball game or two, and I can appreciate why Coach Tuckett and Coach Law counseled these players to keep their eyes on the ball. We salute you ladies who have set such a wonderful example.<br><br>This prompts me to tell of a little experience I had in Boston some time ago. I recounted this story to a group of BYU employees earlier in the fall. I suppose it wouldn't shake your faith if I told you that while I was on my mission I occasionally took in a ball game. (I believe in being a well-balanced individual.) On this occasion I had my wife and daughter with me, and as I was being escorted to my seat, I noticed that the place next to me was to be occupied by a man of the cloth. (I couldn't tell whether he was Protestant or Catholic because they dress quite similarly now.) It became obvious as the game progressed that he was an avid Red Sox fan. He had an interesting vocabulary and he never hesitated to express it. The game that night was against the New York Yankees. If you know anything about the American League, you can appreciate that there's not a whole lot of love between those two teams. Some 33,500 fans filled the park to observe the contest.<br><br>The score was nothing to nothing until the eighth inning. Then the first batter for the Yankees singled sharply to right. He took second on a fielder's choice. Now you have this situation: the winning run is on second, one out, and Bobby Mercer at bat. He hit a sharp ground ball to Rico Petrocelli at short. Petrocelli bobbled it momentarily. The ball got through his legs and out onto the outfield grass. Here came the winning run around third. Boston was going crazy. A perfect strike to the plate, a cloud of dust, human flesh crashing, and then the decision by the umpire--<i>"Safe!"</i>Well, you could image, I suppose, the mayhem in Boston over that decision--but particularly the man on my right. He was now standing in his seat with a fist clenched. These were his words, and I shall never forget them:<i>"Thou hast eyes but seest not!"</i>I suppose there's a great sermon in that.<br><br>The story concerning an umpire prompts yet another. It seems that on the other side of the veil there was to be a contest between the hosts of heaven and the other force below in a baseball game. The two coaches got together; and one, a heavenly messenger, said to one of the imps of the adversary, "Do you realize what you're asking?"<br><br>He said, "I think so."<br><br>The messenger said, "You recognize, of course, that in heaven we can field a varsity team of former hall-of-famers."<br><br>"Yes," the little imp said, "but you ought to understand that we have all the umpires."<br><br>I am sure BYU's team probably has thought that a number of times in games they have played.<br><h2><b>Run to Win</b></h2><br>Inasmuch as we're honoring BYU's baseball team today, let me take something of an athletic theme as a text. I guess it doesn't surprise some of you to learn that there are scriptures regarding athletics in all of the standard works of the Church. One of your great teachers, Robert Matthews, brings to our attention some athletic terms that the apostle Paul used in several of his letters, and he prefaces his work with this comment:<br><br><i>Every two years in Corinth (and also, of course, in other cities) games were held in which all the sports which the Greeks loved, such as footracing, boxing, jumping, wrestling, javelin and discus throwing, and chariot racing, were presented. The prize was a mere wreath, or crown, of pine twigs or ivy leaves, but a winner was welcomed in his native city with great honor. Rigorous training and long practice were required in order for a person to qualify and to participate in these events. A contestant had to go beyond mere amusement and had to discipline himself by constant, severe effort in order to be a winner. In proclaiming the gospel, Paul makes several references to these athletic events. He speaks of boxers, fighters, runners, and the course they run. He speaks of gladiators fighting wild beasts, of a crown for the winners, of goals, of prizes, severe training, proper conditioning, the starter, the judge, and above all the will to win. The early Christian converts were no doubt familiar with these events and games. And, therefore, Paul used the vocabulary of the athlete to urge his listeners to apply the gospel into their lives and particularly to show them the importance of self-discipline and self-denial.</i><br><br>Brother Matthews goes on to say that Paul probably stood in one of those great stadiums of the Greek games of his time and watched the marathon runners as they would go up and lay aside their armor. They used to practice running in their armor, and then they would lay it down for the race. The starter would set them off; they would run 26 1/4 miles, going out into the neighboring village and back on the road, finishing up in the stadium. At the conclusion of the race, the judge would award the prize to the winner. Paul probably watched such a race and saw a great vision of life when he said these words:<br><br><i>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</i><br><br><i>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.</i>[Hebrews 12:1–2]<br><br>Paul perceived in sports one of the greatest things that training can offer: the will to win. He saw those champions crowned in victory, and he saw the wreath that they had received, and he saw that one day he would stand triumphant and receive the greatest crown of all, the crown of eternal life. Paul knew how these great men strove for victory, and he knew of the zeal and vigor with which they went into the race, and he saw that the Christian was likened unto them. The illustrations Paul used are particularly suitable because of their religious significance. Like Jesus, Paul was skilled in the use of vivid illustrations drawn from current events. He pointed out that the price of victory in the gospel sense as well as in the athletic contest is dependent upon sustained effort, self-discipline, and total dedication.<br><br>Now let me quote from his letters. [<i>Sipping from a glass of water</i>]: I'm sorry to drink in front of you, but I came home the other day and lost my voice. I hope this will help me bring it back. It does remind me of an experience I had one time. In some parts of Europe and Australia, they don't seem to believe in water. I was speaking in Australia, where water is nonexistent as far as drinking is concerned, and before a large group I started to choke. I had swallowed improperly, as one sometimes does, and I couldn't breath, couldn't speak. I turned to get some help from those on the stand, and they just shrugged their shoulders. They had a look that seemed to say, "Well, good luck." I was panicky, and I did the only thing a good American would do. I grabbed a vase that was on the stand and took a rose out of it and drank the water.<br><br>This is what Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? (You see, the Corinthians would understand that.) So run, that ye may obtain." Every athlete, said Paul, exercises self-control in all things. He does it to receive a perishable wreath--just a simple little twig or wreath--but we, an imperishable one. I do not run aimlessly, he went on to say. I do not box as one beating the air, but I pummel my body and subdue it lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified (1 Corinthians 9:24–27).<br><br>Now notice this to his friend Timothy: "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day" (2 Timothy 4:7–8). And then, again to Timothy, Paul made this great admonition on which I would like to make a comment (I appreciate what these young men, as many of you here, represent.) An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules (2 Timothy 2:5). Now, there's a great sermon in a single line. Life is made up of interesting rules and regulations, and one can become the victor only as he competes according to the rules and the regulations of the game. You and I are in the great game of life. There are lots of rules and regulations. Some of us have a hard time occasionally discerning why they apply to us.<br><br>I learned as a young high school athlete that rules sometimes are more important than winning. I guess I have shared this experience a time or two around the Church, but I remember when I went in to sign up for varsity baseball. I was fifteen years old. I went over to the gym where the head coach was officed. Scared to death, butterflies in my stomach, I knocked on his door. "Come in," was the reply, and I walked in. He said, "What can I do for you, young man?"<br><br>I said, "Where do you sign up for varsity baseball?"<br><br>My coach made a very interesting observation. He said, "Do you want to play ball, or do you want to be a champion?" Well, that was kind of crazy. I wanted to play ball.<br><br>I said, "I came to play baseball."<br><br>"Well," he said, "we're all filled up. Thank you." And he excused me.<br><br>I went out, and he shut the door. There was a drinking fountain there, and I took a drink of water and thought, "Well, now, what's that all about?"<br><br>Fortunately I had the stamina to knock on the door again. He said, "Come in." I walked in.<br><br>I said, "I want to sign up for varsity baseball."<br><br>He said, "I asked you a question. Do you want to play ball or do you want to be a champion?"<br><br>Finally it sank in. I said, "I want to be a champion."<br><br>"Oh," he said. "Then sign here." He said, "At this school<i>we build champions</i>. We don't play ball." There's a difference I have learned.<br><br>Well, the year went on, and somehow I made the team and had some great and glorious experiences. As we came down to the final innings of the season, Fairfax High (our archrival) and Hollywood (which I represented) ended in a dead heat--a tie. There would be a one-game playoff on Friday afternoon on our home field.<br><br>Thursday afternoon our coach got us all out on the ball field. We were standing around him, as players do with their coaches, and he was giving us some instruction, fired-up enthusiasm, motivation. Then he turned and said, "Paul, you'll pitch tomorrow." I was thrilled but scared.<br><br>I want to give you a little flashback. This was an interesting coach, not a member of the Church, but a man who had seen in contests the great ability to build youth. He had each boy on his team sign a contract, not a professional contract, but a contract of rules and regulations. There were some<i>thou shalts</i>and<i>thou shall nots</i>, and one of them had to do with the Word of Wisdom, although he had never heard of it. He said, "Now, if you're going to play ball for me, you'll play according to the rules. Is that understood?<br><br>And I said, "Yes, sir," as did all the other players. So we signed our contracts, and he kept them on file and occasionally he would remind us.<br><br>Well, as he was giving his pep talk, our all-star second baseman was standing in the circle with his hands on his hips. When the coach made a pass, he stopped and he did a double take. "Jimmy," he said, "is that a nicotine stain on your finger?" Jimmy put out his hand.<br><br>He said, "Yes, sir."<br><br>Then he said, "Well, don't you know the rule?"<br><br>"Well, yes, sir."<br><br>"Did you sign a contract with me?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Do you know the penalty?"<br><br>"Yes, sir." And this was being said in front of the whole team.<br><br>He said, "You've lost your privilege. Turn in your uniform."<br><br>I almost shouted, but I didn't, "Coach, wait till tomorrow! We've got a game."<br><br>Jimmy was batting .380 and as a second baseman had not made an error in league play. And he now had to turn in his uniform. Our coach was the kind of person that kept close to the boys, even when he disciplined them. He didn't lose him, but he wouldn't let him play.<br><br>The next day I drew the assignment to pitch. The game went into extra innings, and they beat us one to nothing in the top of the thirteenth. Do you know how it happened? A ground ball was hit to second and the ball went through the substitute's legs, and that proved to be the winning run. Well, I went home that night and literally cried myself to sleep because I wanted to win. You see, I hate to lose.<br><br>Well, that was over twenty years ago. I thank God this day for a great man, a great coach, who taught me that playing according to the rules was more important than winning.<br><h2><b>The World Needs What You Have</b></h2><br>In a very real sense, you and I have been sent to earth to play a very important game, and there are some wonderful rules and regulations attached to it. To those of us who have the common sense and the understanding and the ability to listen to the coaches, I submit that we have a great head coach, Harold B. Lee. You have heard him, the Quorum of the Twelve and all General Authorities, bishops and stake presidents, leaders and wonderful teachers. Do you think all these people are really out to kid you? Or have they been sent at a particular time in your life to assist you in playing the rules better according to the game of life? I submit it's the latter, and I challenge you as a player, in this contest to listen to wise and capable counsel. You're here at this University for a number of reasons. We of the Board of Trustees see two primary ones: (1) to prepare yourself--and prepare you must--to meet the great challenges that the world offers you, and (2) once you have become prepared, to give it to the world, to make this world a great and marvelous and wonderful place in which to live.<br><br>I have just come from a 2 1/2–week stay in Europe, and I'd like to testify that the world needs what you have, and it needs it quickly and in great abundance. We see you here training on this campus as the ambassadors for Christ to teach others how to play the game of life. Now, there is a challenge attached to that, young people, as you make preparation for yourselves, for your families, and for the rest of the world. We're a missionary church. You know that as well as I do. The scriptures are replete with counsel from our Heavenly Father through his Son. Let me just remind you quickly of one or two examples. They're not new. You study them more completely here, I suppose, than anywhere else in the world. Here's a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith contained in section 64 of the Doctrine and Covenants. It was given in September of 1831, shortly after the church was organized. There were not many members, but they had a tremendous and awesome responsibility to share, to give, to teach. This is what the Lord said to a prophet:<br><br><i>Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the Lord's errand; and whatever ye do according to the will of the Lord is the Lord's business.</i><br><br><i>And he hath set you to provide for his saints in these last days, that they may obtain an inheritance in the land of Zion.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:29–30]<br><br>Could I just pause and ask a question? How are they going to obtain it if you and I don't give it and give it willingly and effectively? And then he continues:<br><br><i>And behold, I, the Lord, declare unto you, and my words are sure and shall not fail, that they shall obtain it.</i><br><br><i>But all things must come to pass in their time.</i><br><br><i>Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great.</i><br><br><i>Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these last days.</i>[D&amp;amp;C 64:31–34]<br><br>Permit just a personal reference to this. Back in the 1940s my younger brother received a mission call to New England, and (without running through all the details which really don't matter) he was sent to a little community in Nova Scotia called Kentville. There he labored for most of his mission. As some elders and missionaries do, he came home seemingly a failure in terms of convert baptisms. And you know how older brothers are with little brothers who don't produce, don't you? I didn't let him off the hook at all. Twenty years later, almost to the day, his older brother Paul was called to preside over the same mission. In my first member district conference at Halifax, Nova Scotia, a little lady came up to me after the first session. She said, "Elder Dunn, Elder Dunn, do you have a brother by the name of David?"<br><br>And I said, "I believe I do."<br><br>And she said, "Was he on a mission in New England?"<br><br>I said, "He was."<br><br>And then you missionaries would appreciate this. She opened her purse and started through all her pictures. She lifted one out and said, "Is that him?"<br><br>I said, "Twenty years ago, that's him."<br><br>"Oh," she said, "where is he?"<br><br>I said, "He's in southern California."<br><br>"Oh, I'd like to communicate with him. He's responsible for bringing me into the Church."<br><br>I said, "No, ma'am, you're mistaken. My brother didn't bring anybody into the Church."<br><br>"Oh," she said, "I hate to correct<i>you</i>, sir, but--." Then she called six other people over, all with great families, who happened to be the backbone of the district at Halifax. And she said, "All of these are because of your brother. We thank God for him."<br><br>Out of small things great things shall proceed.<br><h2><b>Teach Your Neighbor</b></h2><br>Now, missionaries, how do you put that on your weekly chart for comparisons? I just submit that we're all missionaries. I've often thought (as every General Authority does), "If we could somehow unleash, in an organized form, before the whole world, the power that's represented here today." Think of it. Eight thousand, probably more, returned missionaries on this campus alone. Why, that's half the total full-time force in the whole world. Now, could I challenge you as a great university in your own wonderful way to be missionaries, even here in Provo? I know it's a little more challenging and difficult, but there are lonesome people on this campus. There are those who seemingly are not wanted, who haven't been befriended. There are the inactive; there are those struggling, as well as the thousands of people with whom you come in contact as you go to and fro. The missionary opportunities are no less here than anywhere else in the world.<br><br>Permit a "for instance" or two very quickly. You know what the Lord says in section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants. He says it about as simply as it's ever been expressed: "Warn your neighbor" (see D&amp;amp;C 88:81). Your neighbors can be those both in and out of the Church that need any kind of a warning.<br><br>I guess I wouldn't be out of order to tell you a little interesting experience that happened to me last year. Before I left on my mission I lived right across the street from the sheriff of Salt Lake City. He is a wonderful, law-abiding citizen, and he has made me more so. When I came home, I sold my house, and moved just around the corner about the same distance away. One day while I was observing construction on my home, which is on a little hill with quite an incline, I pulled the car up, parked it, and got out and walked around to head up to the house. Suddenly the car started rolling backwards downhill, and there were several little children playing at the bottom. I panicked, as any parent would, and ran around and opened the car door. It was rolling fairly fast now. I got halfway in, and the momentum of the car upended me and threw me down on the street. I got my leg in, trying to pump a brake that wouldn't pump, because it's all power steering with power brakes so that nothing worked. I knew I had to divert the path of that car. To make matters more challenging, the car door banged on my leg; with a real prayer on my lips, I somehow got the strength to turn the wheel to divert its path. In doing so, it crossed the street, jumped the curb, and I pruned--and I mean<i>pruned</i>--the sheriff's prize maple tree. I really leveled it. The car went over the tree and through his back fence and came to a stop in his rose garden.<br><br>Now, here's the scene. You've got a runaway car with a General Authority on his back in a rose garden. The sheriff looked over the hood of the car and said, "Paul, what in the world are you doing?"<br><br>And I couldn't think of anything any better than this. I said, "Sheriff, I'm your new home teacher."<br><br>Well, now, that is not the way to warn a neighbor. I don't think the Lord had that in mind, but rather to share feeling and concern and to give help.<br><br>Maybe this is more of what he had in mind. An acquaintance of mine became seriously ill not long ago. I hurried up to the Veterans Hospital in Salt Lake City to see if I couldn't attend to some of his needs. He's got some problems. He's not the most active soul in the world, and you can kind of get the picture. There's one around you somewhere.<br><br>He was surprised when I walked into the room. "Well, how did you know I was here?"<br><br>"Oh, the Lord has ways of sharing this kind of information."<br><br>He had a blood condition that had caused his body great distress. It was very serious because of his age. He had tremendous pain in his ankles. He was eating dinner at the time I entered the hospital, so I sat on the edge of his bed and said, "Would it help if I massaged your legs for a minute?" So I massaged him. And I said, "Can I ask you a personal question? Did this sudden illness scare you a little?" I said, "Does the bishop know you're up here? Would you be offended if I told him?" I asked, "Would you like a special blessing?" He nodded yes. "Do you have faith?"<br><br>"No," he responded.<br><br>"Do you have faith in me?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Do you know what faith is?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>So I sat on the bed and taught him.<br><br>You know, I find that most people don't know these things because they haven't been taught; they don't understand. I gave him a little 2 1/2-minute talk on faith. The first principles of the gospel are what? Faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now, if you back up and look at faith, it says what? In the Lord Jesus Christ. Sometimes we leave that out. So I taught him the principles. He hadn't ever heard that before, and he was sixty-two and had been born and raised in the Church.<br><br>I had noticed, of course, when I first went in that there were four other men in the room. It was a ward shared by several men without any privacy. I noticed while I was teaching (although I didn't make it a pronounced sermon as such; it was just between the two of us) that others were straining to hear. So as I stood up in preparation for going around to place my hands upon my friend's head, I turned, as the Spirit prompted me to do so , and I said to the other men lying in their beds, "Gentlemen, may I have your attention please?" They all sat up in bed. I said, "Perhaps you have noticed I am here to visit my friend, who is ill like you. I'm his home teacher. We're members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints--Mormons. I haven't had a chance to get acquainted with you; I don't know what your particular faith is, but we believe in assisting each other spiritually. I am here to attempt to do that tonight. I'm going to give this man a special blessing." Then I taught briefly just what that was. I said, "I wouldn't expect you to endorse it or reject it particularly, but would you mind being reverent for a moment as I perform this ordinance for my friend?" And they all just sat there. So I stepped behind (because we had no way of getting privacy), placed my hands upon his head, and blessed him. The Spirit touched both of us, and the tears came without shame from a man who, I guess, hadn't been in church in twenty-two years. When I got all through, we embraced each other, and I said, "Now, can I ask you a personal question? Did I offend you?"<br><br>"Oh no, Brother Dunn," he said, "this is one of the most sacred moments in my life. Thank you." Then I turned to go out, and four other men wanted blessings, two of whom weren't even members of the Church. Now, Latter-day Saints, you don't have to be embarrassed at who you are or what you are. There's a teaching moment awaiting every one of us as we share this most priceless gift which is ours. I pray God that we might catch something of that great vision and the importance of it.<br><h2><b>Seize Your Opportunity</b></h2><br>Now, I had some other things to talk about, but time won't permit. Let me just leave this challenge with you to get as well prepared as you possibly can on this great campus. I don't know where you duplicate this effort. You can't. This is the Lord's university, presided over by men of God. I know these men as you do. I watch them work. I sit with them. I testify that they have your interests at heart. I pray that you won't be like some who get out into the world and then want to kick themselves because they didn't take advantage of the opportunity. Seize it now while you have it. Make every moment profitable. Live for it. Prepare for it. Then go out and willingly give what you have learned. The world wants what you and I have. We don't have to be embarrassed to teach it, to live it, to testify of it.<br><br>God really lives. Jesus is the Christ. Some of you are yet trying to find that. We understand that. You're in what some of the psychologists call ambivalent age. You vacillate. You want unconsciously the security of youth, of childhood, but you want the maturity and the freedom that go with adulthood. And you vacillate back and forth. Some of you won't drop your anchor until two or three or four years from now. There's one great blessing I learned in the mission field. There are such things as late bloomers. Thank God that we don't judge and prejudge some people right out of this existence. Some of the little guys that I had in that mission who I thought would never wake up have come home, have found themselves, have dropped their anchors, and have become great stalwarts in the Church and the community and have gone on to surpass some of my so-called stars of yesteryear.<br><br>Now, you have the potential within you to do everything that you were sent here to do. Just in conclusion, remember it's a great contest. In the game of life, you'll win if you play by the rules. You'll find yourself and the Lord, and then you share the gospel and give it, even on this great campus and in this great community. God bless you. I know he lives. I know Jesus is the Christ. Harold B. Lee really is a prophet. With great personal interest, I watched him as an apostle for over eight years. I have been in conference with him. I have sat in an upper room of the temple with him. I have seen him in his most tender moments. Then I saw, as you did, the mantle fall upon him. He really is a prophet, and, like you, I thank God for that knowledge. May we so give it to the rest of the world, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i>Paul H.

<h1>rself an Honest Man - Victor L. Brown - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Good morning, brothers and sisters. I am grateful to have this opportunity of being with you this morning. Many times when I am introduced, the first question asked after the introduction is "What ward are you bishop of?" The other day at breakfast, I sat next to a local government official. He leaned over to me and said, "Who's the new Presiding Bishop of the Church?" So I have several influences keeping me humble.<br><br>I am grateful for the lovely music these wonderful young women have presented this morning, for their soloist and their director, and particularly to be on the same program where these Indian leaders were introduced. It's wonderful to be with you this morning.<br><br>I'd like to visit with you this morning as a bishop. I am a bishop, even though I don't have a ward to preside over. I would commend to you your branch presidents, who have the responsibilities of a bishop. As a bishop, I would like to talk this morning about some rather intimate matters, some matters that are of great import to you and to me and to everyone, and I pray that the lord will bless me that what I might say will have lodging in your hearts and have meaning to you. I pray that my remarks may be such that you will understand your relationship with your Heavenly Father perhaps a little bit more.<br><br>In speaking of relationships with our Heavenly Father, I would like to tell you of an experience my brother had. He was a judge presiding over the family court. He was sitting on a child custody case, a nine-year-old girl whose father was suing for her custody. She had been reared by her aunt. She was frightened of her father. No one on either side of the family wanted her to go with her father. After hearing the arguments of the attorneys on both sides, Judge Brown invited this little nine-year-old Negro girl into his private chambers. He wanted to get acquainted with her without the influence of the courtroom. He said to her, "Whom do you love more than anyone else in the world?" She did not respond. He said, "Do you love your grandmother more than anyone else in the world?"<br><br>She said, "No."<br><br>"Your grandfather?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Your auntie?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Whom do you love more than anyone else in the world?" She said, "I love Lord Jesus more than anyone else in the world. Would you mind if I spoke to Lord Jesus?"<br><br>He said, "Why, certainly not, you go right ahead."<br><br>She pushed her chair back from his desk, knelt down, and said, "Lord Jesus, would you please bless Mr. Judge Brown so he'll know what's best for me."<br><br>A relationship with our Heavenly Father, the faith of a child.<br><br>Now, as a bishop, I would like to talk for a few moments about some of the problems we are faced with in this life. One of the serious problems today is the philosophy that as long as a certain activity or standard is practiced by many, it's acceptable. Today we see evidence all about us of men and women who have lost their integrity. We see it on the national scene; we also see it on the local scene.<br><br>Not long ago an employee of one of our cities was discharged. He was discharged because of improper conduct on the job. Some might call it dishonest conduct, although I don't think he was accused of stealing. He stole time. Regardless of the reason, he was discharged. And then he was reinstated because what he had done was such a common practice they would have had to fire most of the employees in the department. It was acceptable. By the fall of one of our great leaders, and I considered him a great leader, we have seen what has happened on the national scene as a result of doing things that are acceptable. One problem that concerns me as much as any other is the apparent self-righteous attitude displayed by many as these problems have become known. I would like to quote a scripture that can give us some balance in our attitude as we see others in difficulty. In Luke we read:<br><br><i>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.</i><br><br><i>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</i><br><br><i>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</i><br><br><i>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</i><br><br><i>I tell you</i>[and this is the Lord speaking],<i>this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/18.10,11,12,13,14?lang=eng#9">Luke 18:10–14</a>]<br><br>I would hope as we view the tragedies that are occurring we would remember which of these two we would like to be. May I suggest that we paraphrase the words of a song? Remember the words, "let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me." May I suggest that for<i>peace</i>we substitute the word<i>integrity.</i><br><h2><b>The First Step to True Greatness</b></h2><br>What is integrity? In a general conference of the Church in 1938, Elder Albert E. Bowen, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, said this:<br><br><i>It has been said that on that day when someone at some inconvenience to himself determined to keep a promise which he was not compelled to keep, civilization was born. The statement, of course, is intended to make clear that the relationships inherent in civilization could not exist, nor civilization endure, if people as a general rule did not keep their promises. Certainly the business world would collapse at once if this practice fell into decay. Almost all the vast and complicated intricacies of trade and exchange are carried on on the basis of promises.</i>[<i>Conference Reports,</i>October 1938]<br><br>A man by the name of Simmons said this of integrity: "Integrity is the first step to true greatness. Men love to praise but are slow to practice it. To maintain it in high places costs self-denial. In all places it is liable to opposition. But its end is glorious, and the universe will yet do it homage." And Emerson: "Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself and you shall have the suffrage of the world." And Carlyle: "Make yourself an honest man, and then you may be sure there is one less rascal in the world." (Someone has said that those who go to institutions of higher learning just to gain intellectual knowledge and forget their morality become the rascals of the world.) George Eliot: "There is only one failure in life possible, and that is not to be true to the best one knows." And again, Carlyle: "The courage we desire and prize is not the courage to die decently but to live manfully." And finally Shakespeare:<br><br><i>The purest treasure mortal times afford</i><br><i>Is spotless reputation; that away,</i><br><i>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay. ...</i><br><i>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;</i><br><i>Take honour from me, and my life is done.</i><br>[<i>Richard II,</i>I.i.177–83]<br><br>And then, what does the Lord say in the scriptures? "Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.34?lang=eng#p33">2 Nephi 9:34</a>). "He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house. He that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/101.7?lang=eng#7">Psalms 101:7</a>). "Lying lips are abomination unto the Lord: but they that deal truly are his delight" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/prov/12.22?lang=eng#p21">Proverbs 12:22</a>).<br><h2><b>Examples of Integrity</b></h2><br>May we look at some examples of integrity, examples that would teach us what it really means. There are so many examples of integrity. I believe there are more examples of integrity than there are of the lack of integrity. But I believe also, my brothers and sisters, that we individually must determine our state of integrity, if there is such a thing, and I think there is only integrity or lack of it. The greatest of all the examples of integrity was given to us by Jesus Christ himself. We read in Matthew:<br><br><i>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</i><br><br><i>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</i><br><br><i>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</i><br><br><i>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.8-11?lang=eng#p7">Matthew 4:8–11</a>]<br><br>Perhaps one of the next most inspiring displays of integrity is found in the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. You remember in studying the life of the Prophet that he was stripped of his clothing and tarred and feathered, and it took all night to take the tar off of his tender flesh. And then he said, as he recorded very simply in his history, "This being the Sabbath morning, ... I preached to the congregation as usual, and in the afternoon of the same day baptized three individuals" (<i>History of the Church,</i>1:264).<br><br>Again he showed tremendous integrity when he was in jail. After listening, to obscene jests, oaths, blasphemies, and filthy language from the guards, he suddenly arose to his feet and spoke in a voice of thunder the following: "Silence, ye fiends of the infernal pit! In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you and command you to be still. I will not live another minute and hear such language" (Leon R. Hartshorn, comp.,<i>Classic Stories from the Lives of Our Prophets,</i>p. 29).<br><br>And that great ancient prophet Job:<br><br><i>All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</i><br><br><i>My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</i><br><br><i>God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</i><br><br><i>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</i>[<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/job/27.3-6?lang=eng#p2">Job 27:3–6</a>]<br><br>Then there is the example of two young men not too many years ago-before you were born, maybe even a little before I was born--but not too many years ago. Two young Mexicans down in Mexico gave their lives rather than deny the faith. Many of you have perhaps seen the film produced here on campus,<i>And Should We Die.</i>Let me just read a couple of passages from that film:<br><br><i>The two young Mexicans talk together about what they will do if they really are to be killed for their religion.</i><br><br><i>Elder Monterrey says, "I have a good wife and children. I would love to see them grow tall, but the Lord has given me a testimony, and to deny it would be worse than death."</i><br><br><i>His companion speaks of how much joy he has found since joining the Church. He says he does not want to die, but he could never deny the faith that had brought him so much happiness. They pray for strength and ask the Lord to bless their families, ending with "Thy will be done."</i><br><br><i>The two young men are marched out into a field by Pancho's men with guns, followed by a number of women and a few men and children. Monterrey's wife falls on her knees beside the leader and begs for her husband's life. He tells her, "I have offered them life. It is their decision." He then gives them one last opportunity to give up their religion.</i><br><br><i>Elder Monterrey answers, "We cannot deny Jesus Christ nor the testimony we have of the truth."</i><br><br><i>They are then asked if they have a last request. Elder Monterrey says, "Yes. We would like to pray."</i><br><br><i>The leader says, "Well, pray and get it over with."</i><br><br><i>The elder says, "Our Father in heaven, we approach thee in the final moments of our lives. Bless us with strength, and forgive these men who are about to take our lives. Bless our families with health and strength that they may live good lives." His mother and wife stand together, watching, as the guns are fired and the two men drop dead.</i><br><br>These men exemplified honesty, integrity of the soul, integrity of the heart, integrity of the intellect.<br><br>One of the great leaders of our nation, Abraham Lincoln, left us something. He left us the example of integrity in his public office, integrity in the home, integrity in the individual heart. Summing up his accomplishments--the preservation of the nation, freeing the slaves, his kindness and mercy to the unfortunate, his compassion for his soldiers, his statesmanship at the head of the government--all will be seen as but products of his two outstanding characteristics: spirituality and uncompromising honesty.<br><br>Last Friday night, here on campus, I sat across the table from an eminently successful businessman and had a most interesting conversation with him. He comes from Southern California. He has achieved great success in his business. He said to me, "When I have young men come to work for me who appear to have the potential to become somebody in my business, I tell them there are four things that they must accept and do, and the first of these is honesty." He gave me the others. I shan't give them to you. I am not sure that the other three are necessary. They certainly are not necessary if the first one is forgotten.<br><br><i>Einstein once advised young people: "Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value." A man of value hopes to win success by it, but is not crucially dependent upon success; a man of mere success is always haunted by the fear of losing success, whereupon he loses all. No human being can live comfortably with himself upon such precarious terms.</i>[Quotation from Sydney J. Harris]<br><br>A few weeks ago, Sister Belle Spafford, who is the president of the Relief Society of the Church, was attending a women's convention in New York City. She was on a panel representing approximately twenty million women in the world. She was invited to participate as a voter on an issue. A proposal was made that did not conform to her teachings as a member of the Church. It had nothing to do with morality as such--that is, the type of morality we normally think of--but it was contrary to her beliefs. She was the only one who voted negatively in that great convention. Integrity! And now the leaders of that conference are reconsidering their position. All of the other women voted positively. You see what courage it takes to be a woman of integrity?<br><br>I was in the East a few weeks ago, and I visited with a businessman, a member of the Church, one of the most inspiring businessmen I have ever met. He told me of an experience he had had some time ago. He was the chief executive officer of a billion-dollar-a-year business. The company manufactured products of various qualities. The first-quality product was in the manufacturer's name; the second-quality product was in the name of the customer. One of their customers, who did sixty million dollars' worth of business a year, came to him a while ago and said, "I want a letter from you telling me that the second-grade product is just as good as the first-grade product."<br><br>He replied, "But it isn't as good."<br><br>The customer said, "But it has the same ingredients."<br><br>"The ingredients aren't in the same quantity. It is not as good."<br><br>"I want that letter or you'll lose my business." A sixty-million-dollar account. And this wonderful man said, "If that is what I have to do to keep your business, I don't want it."<br><br>Integrity! It exists in the world, my brothers and sisters, but it exists in the hearts and the souls and the minds and the intellects of individuals. It doesn't exist just in masses of individuals.<br><br>I had the experience one day of coming back to Salt Lake City on an airplane after a conference. A young man whom I had never seen sat in the seat in front of me. He recognized me, I suppose, from some of the pictures he had seen. He spoke to me and told me he was returning to his home in Detroit. He had graduated from Brigham Young University and had gone on to another school to get his MBA. He was a junior employee in the department in which he was employed at the Ford Motor Company. He had been chosen by his department head to represent the company at a very important meeting on the west coast. There were many men his senior in the department; they were furious that a junior man would be invited to go to such an important convention. It was a real plum professionally. The department head told one of them why he had chosen this young man. He said, "I know he will not embarrass the company. He won't go out and get drunk. He'll go out and take care of himself and represent us properly. That's why I chose him." You see, integrity can mean many things in the way of success in our lives.<br><br>Now I'd like to share with you a lesson that a young man has taught. This, to me, is one of the most touching lessons of integrity I have ever read. This is the true story of Elam Hill, director of physical education at Sequoia Junior High:<br><br><i>Today I saw truth. For a moment I lived and breathed in the great presence of truth and felt its sweetness plunge deep into my soul. I am a coach in a junior high school. I work with five hundred boys each day. This has been my occupation for over twenty years. I enjoy it. Traditionally, I am supposed to be rugged, tough, crusty--yes, even a little severe at times. And yet underneath this exterior, feeling and understanding must exist if the job is to be done.</i><br><br><i>Today was test day in climbing the rope. We climb from a standing start to a point fifteen feet high. One of my tasks these past few weeks has been to train and teach the boys to negotiate this distance in as few seconds as possible. The school record for the event is 2.1 seconds. It has stood for three years. Today this record was broken. But this is not my story. How this record was broken is the important thing here, as it is so often in many an endeavor in life.</i><br><br><i>For three years Bobby Palacio, a fourteen-and-a-half-year-old ninth-grade Mexican boy, has trained and pointed and, I suspect, dreamed of breaking this record. It had been his consuming passion. It seemed his whole life depended upon owning this record. In his first of three attempts, Bobby climbed the rope in 2.1 seconds, tying the record. On the second try, the watch stopped at 2.0 seconds flat, a record. But as he descended the rope and the entire class gathered around to check the watch I knew I must ask Bobby a question. There was a slight doubt in my mind whether or not the board at the fifteen-foot height had been touched. If he missed, it was so very, very close, not more than a fraction of an inch, and only Bobby knew the answer.</i><br><br><i>As he walked toward me, expressionless, I said, "Bobby, did you touch?" If he had said yes, the record he had dreamed of since he was a skinny seventh grader and had worked for almost daily would be his, and he knew I would trust his word. With the class already cheering him for his performance, the slim, brown skinned boy shook his head negatively. And in this simple gesture, I witnessed a moment of greatness.</i><br><br><i>Coaches do not cry. Only babies cry, they say. But as I reached out to pat this boy on the shoulder, there was a small drop of water in each eye. And it was with effort through a tight throat that I told the class: "This boy has not set a record in the rope climb. No, he has set a much finer record for you and everyone to strive for. He has told the simple truth." I turned to Bobby and said, "Bobby, I'm proud of you. You have just set a record many athletes never attain. Now, on your last try, I want you to jump a few inches higher on the takeoff. You're going to break the record."</i><br><br><i>After the other boys had finished their next turns and Bobby came up to the rope for his try, a strange stillness came over the gymnasium. Fifty boys and one coach were breathlessly set to help boost Bobby Palacio to a new record. He climbed the rope in 1.9 seconds--a school record, a city record, and perhaps close to a national record for a junior high school boy.</i><br><br><i>When the bell rang and I walked away, now misty-eyed, from this group of boys, I was thinking, "Bobby, little brown skin with your clear, bright, dark eyes and your straight, trim, lithe body--Bobby, at fourteen you are a better man than I. Thank you for climbing so very, very high today."</i>[Quoted from the<i>California Teacher's Journal</i>]<br><br>Integrity, honesty, living as the Lord would have us live--these are the important things. I suggest, my brethren and sisters, that we students and faculty on this campus relate what I have said this morning to ourselves. There is a code of honor on this campus; and when I think that there might be some who come to this campus knowing that code of honor with no intention of keeping it, I have a hard time believing it. This student body should be above reproach in every way. And I would hope, my brethren and sisters, that of all the principles of the gospel that you study you will take to heart the lesson of morality. When I speak of morality, I speak of virtue. I speak of keeping ourselves clean and pure from the things of the world and not following the world, in its acceptance of immorality, sexual relations out of wedlock, adultery, fornication, homosexuality. Even though the world is accepting these things, the Lord has never modified to the least degree the commandment "Thou shalt not commit adultery." This is one of the teachings that are vital in your life and my life: to keep ourselves from these evils, to maintain our morality and integrity.<br><br>The Lord recognizes that we are human beings, and sometimes we make mistakes. But he has given us a way whereby we can regain his good grace, and that is the law of repentance and forgiveness. If we truly repent, if we will go to our branch presidents and discuss our problems freely and honestly, we can gain forgiveness from our Heavenly Father if we follow the full steps as directed by our branch presidents. But if we avoid that, the Lord has cautioned us he will not always strive with the souls of men.<br><br>I pray, my brethren and sisters, that each one of us will analyze our own intimate lives, that we will determine to be men and women of integrity, that we will be so much so that we will enjoy living with ourselves. I bear witness that God lives, that Jesus Christ is our elder brother, and that it is in his way, and only his way, that we will find eternal life and the joy and happiness that come from righteous living. I bear this witness to you and leave my blessing with you that through loving the Lord enough to keep his commandments you may find the peace that surpasseth all understanding. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Victor L. Brown was the Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 6 November 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>© Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>n Freedom: This Nation Shall Endure - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
Humbly and gratefully I stand before you this morning, humbled by the responsibility which is mine as I face this choice audience, and grateful for this great and unique institution, founded by a prophet of God.<br><br>As an introduction to what I trust the Lord will be pleased to have me say today, I quote a short paragraph from a memorable prayer given at the dedication of the London Temple by President David O. McKay:<br><br><i>Next to life, we express gratitude for the gift of free agency. When thou didst create man, thou placed within him part of thine Omnipotence and bade him choose for himself. Liberty and conscience thus became a sacred part of human nature. Freedom not only to think, but to speak and act, is a God-given privilege.</i>[<i>Improvement Era,</i>October 1958, pp. 718–19]<br><br>As a further introduction, I quote from another beloved leader for whom our newest college on this campus is named--President J. Reuben Clark:<br><br><i>The Constitution of the United States is a great and treasured part of my religion. . . . The overturning, or the material changing, or the distortion of any fundamental principle of our constitutional government would thus do violence to my religion. . . . My faith teaches me that the Constitution is an inspired document drawn by the hands of men whom God raised up for that very purpose; that God has given His approval of the Government set up under the Constitution "for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles": that the constitutional "principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before" the Lord. (D&amp;amp;C 101:77, 98:5.) . . .</i><br><br><i>So far as my knowledge goes, this is the only government now on the earth to which God has given such an approval. It is His plan for the government of free men.</i>[President J. Reuben Clark,<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution,</i>pp. 7, 172]<br><h2><b>They Poured Out Their Blood</b></h2><br>Not too many miles from Boston rests a large boulder on Lexington Green. Inscribed on this rock, which I read again a short time ago, are the words which Captain Parker gave to his minutemen on April 19, 1775, nearly 200 years ago:<br><br><i>Stand your ground, don't fire unless fired upon,</i><br><i>But if they mean to have a war</i><br><i>Let it begin here.</i><br>And it began.<br><br>Said Webster, "They poured out their generous blood like water before they knew whether it would fertilize the land of freedom or of bondage."<br><br>But they aroused their fellow Americans. Within one year John Adams faced the body of men who were deliberating on whether to adopt the Declaration of Independence. With the inspiration of heaven resting on him, Adams was said to have declared:<br><br><i>Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in the beginning we aimed not at independence. But there's a Divinity which shapes our ends. . . . Why, then, should we defer the Declaration? . . . You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to the time when this Declaration shall be made good. We may die; die Colonists, die slaves, die, it may be, ignominiously and on the scaffold.</i><br><br><i>Be it so. Be it so.</i><br><br><i>If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready. . . . But while I do live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a country, and that a free country.</i><br><br><i>But whatever may be our fate, be assured . . . that this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but it will stand and it will richly compensate for both.</i><br><br><i>Through the thick gloom of the present, I see the brightness of the future as the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its annual return they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude and of joy.</i><br><br><i>Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I began, that live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment, Independence now, and Independence forever.</i>[<i>The Works</i>of<i>Daniel Webster,</i>4th ed., 1:133–:36]<br><br>Yesterday, I read further in the great current volume,<i>Quest of a Hemisphere,</i>by Boyle, published by Western Islands, Boston. I am grateful that we now have again a textbook for our children, grandchildren, and their parents that restores that which has, in many cases, been removed from our histories by wolves in sheep's clothing.<br><br>I love history books that tell history as it was--as the Book of Mormon tells it--with the Lord in the picture guiding and directing the affairs of the righteous, winning their battles for them.<br><br>In this new history, we read again, as some of us who are old enough remember reading, the courageous and stirring words against the Navigation Acts, the Stamp Act of 1765, and "taxation without representation." In this real American history we have the record of Washington, Jefferson, and the record of Samuel Adams of Boston, who organized Committees of Correspondence and groups of young men banded together as Sons of Liberty. We read again the words of James Otis that a law was void if it violated the human rights of man and that a man who is quiet is as secure in his house as a prince in his castle.<br><br>Here we read that:<br><br><i>The colonists fought the threat of aggression as much as aggression itself.</i><br><br><i>With grim determination, they opposed every attempt to rob them of any liberty they had gained.</i><br><br><i>To the colonists--our benefactors--it was not so much the amount as the principles of taxation (without representation) that the colonists opposed.</i><br><br>Here again in this new history are also the fiery words "give me liberty" of Patrick Henry of Virginia and also his words: "If this be treason, make the most of it."<br><br>John Hancock, George Mason, Paul Revere--John Dickinson and his<i>Letters from a Farmer,</i>"We cannot be happy without being free."<br><br><i>The British colonies were largely settled by people who had revolted against their living conditions in other lands. They were rebels, in a sense, who had the courage to flee from want and persecution, and face the perils of a wilderness to seek a better form of life. When they found a better way, they fought to keep it. Their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren did not want any monarch to change their way of life. They had plowed their own lands, built their own homes, and made their own clothes. Who was their master?</i>[Donzella Cross Boyle,<i>Quest of a Hemisphere</i>(Boston: Western Islands), p. 113]<br><br>Chapter seven closes with a discussion of freedom of the press and these stirring words inspired by Peter Zenger: "The right to print the truth is a necessary part of political. liberty." And these by the famous lawyer, Andrew Hamilton from Philadelphia: "The loss of liberty, to a generous mind is worse than death. . . . The man who loves his country, prefers its liberty to all other considerations, well knowing that without liberty, life is a misery" (Ibid., p. 84).<br><br><i>Thus, in colonial days, did the people of the colonies stand firmly against any form of dictatorship. Thousands of immigrants came to the settlements along the Atlantic seaboard, with only a vague idea of the freedoms they were seeking, because they had not known many of them. They were pursuing a vision. Freedoms sprouted in a wilderness like flowers on a vacant lot, because each person who came had broken the pattern of life in his old country and he was starting all over again. "Something new" began to grow in the New World--a mere idea. People began to question the right of government to interfere with their freedom to come and go, to buy and sell, to own or lease, to talk or listen, to vote and elect. In other words, people began to think they had the right to govern themselves. Yet, a new nation had to rise in the Western Hemisphere before this idea gained the force of law.</i>" [Ibid., p. 84]<br><br>And so today on Lexington Green, you will see a sacred old monument nearly two hundred years of age that covers the remains of those patriotic minutemen, and on this monument are inscribed these words:<br><br><i>Sacred to liberty and the rights of mankind!!!</i><br><i>The freedom and independence of America</i><br><i>Sealed and defended with the blood of her sons. . . .</i><br><br>Yes, there is much, much more on that old historic monument, including their names.<br><br>Yes, their mother Gentiles, as Nephi foresaw 2,367 years before, were gathered together upon the waters and upon the land to battle against them. "And I beheld," said the prophet Nephi, "that the power of God was with them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle. And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations" (1 Nephi 13:18–19).<br><h2><b>Modern Prophets' Tribute to the Founding Fathers</b></h2><br>With independence won, another body of men assembled, and under the inspiration of heaven they too drafted a document--probably the greatest instrument ever struck off at a given time by the mind of men--the Constitution of the United States.<br><br>Said J. Reuben Clark, that great constitutional lawyer:<br><br><i>The framers (of the Constitution) were not political tyros (beginners) flying a political kite to keep in order the henyard, that is, the colonists. They were men widely experienced in affairs of government. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Constitution was not the work of cloistered, fanatical theorists, but of sober, seasoned, distinguished men of affairs, drawn from various walks of life. They included students of wide reading and great learning in all matters of government. . . .</i><br><br><i>The Constitution was born, not only of the wisdom and experience of the generation that wrought it, but also out of the wisdom of the long generations that had gone before and which had been transmitted to them through tradition and the pages of history. . . .</i><br><br><i>These were the horse and buggy days as they have been called in derision; these were the men who traveled in the horsedrawn buggies and on horseback; but these were the men who carried under their hats, as they rode in the buggies and on their horses, a political wisdom garnered from the ages. As giants to pygmies are they when placed alongside our political emigres and their fellow travelers of today, who now traduce them with slighting word and contemptuous phrase.</i>[J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,<i>Church News,</i>November 29, 1952;<i>Stand Fast by Our Constitution,</i>pp. 134–:37]<br><br>If there are those who doubt President Clark's tribute to our Founding Fathers, then hear the words of President Wilford Woodruff:<br><br><i>Those men who laid the foundation of this American government and signed the Declaration of Independence were the best spirits the God of Heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits . . . inspired of the Lord.</i><br><br><i>Everyone of those men that signed the Declaration of Independence, with George Washington, . . . called upon me, as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the Temple at St. George two consecutive nights and demanded at my hand that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the house of God for them. . . .</i><br><br><i>Would those spirits have called upon me, as an Elder in Israel, to perform that work if they had not been noble spirits before God? They would not. . . . Said they: ". . . We laid the foundation of the government you now enjoy, and we never apostatized from it, but we remained true to it and were faithful to God."</i>[<i>Conference Reports,</i>April 1898, pp. 89–90;<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>19:229]<br><h2><b>Self-Government Involves Self-Control</b></h2><br>These two documents--the Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States--resting on the bedrock of the love of the Lord and of liberty, became the foundation of our Republic. And from this foundation has come the greatest civilization on the face of the earth.<br><br>James Russell Lowell was right when he said: "Our American republic will endure only as long as the ideas of the men who founded it continue dominant" (quoted in<i>Prophets, Principles and National Survival,</i>p. 149).<br><br>What were those ideas? Well, they were in part incorporated in our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. God grant we will all become familiar with both of these documents. And Washington covered them well when he said:<br><br><i>Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. . . reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government.</i>[George Washington,<i>Farewell Address,</i>September 17, 1796;<i>The Writings of George Washington,</i>Ford Edition, 13:307–:8]<br><br>I serve as a member of the Board of Trustees of this great university. One year we invited the late Cecil B. De Mille to speak to our student body and accept an award. I will never forget his words when he stated that men and nations cannot break the Ten Commandments, they can only break themselves upon them.<br><br>And he was right. Only a moral and religious people deserves or will defend its freedom.<br><br>Edmund Burke stated it well when he said:<br><br><i>Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites--in proportion as their love of justice is above their rapacity--in proportion as their soundness and sobriety of understanding is above their vanity and presumption--in proportion as they are more disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good, in preference to the flattery of knaves. Society cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon the will and appetite is placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.</i>[Edmund Burke,<i>Works,</i>4:51–52, quoted in<i>Prophets, Principles and National Survival,</i>p. 33]<br><br>As Elder Albert E. Bowen put it: "Self-government involves self-control, self-discipline, an acceptance of and the most unremitting obedience to correct principles. . . . No other form of government requires so high a degree of individual morality" (<i>Improvement Era,</i>41 (1938): 266, quoted in P<i>rophets, Principles and National Survival,</i>p. 128).<br><h2><b>A Land Choice Above All Others</b></h2><br>I love this great nation of which we are a part. I have traveled and lived abroad just enough to make me appreciate rather fully what we have here. I never return to these shores from abroad, as I have done scores of times, but what I think of the words of Scott:<br><br><i>Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,</i><br><i>Who never to himself has said,</i><br><i>"This is my own, my native land!"</i><br><i>Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,</i><br><i>As home his footsteps he hath turned,</i><br><i>From wandering on a foreign strand!</i><br><i>If such there breathe, go, mark him well. . . .</i><br>[Sir Walter Scott, "The Lay of the Last Minstrel," in<i>The Complete Poetical Works of Scott,</i>Cambridge Edition (Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. [c.1900]), p. 40]<br><br>And then that great poem by Van Dyke, "America for Me":<br><br><i>'Tis great to see the Old World and travel up and down</i><br><i>Among the famous palaces and cities of renoun,</i><br><i>To view the crumbly castles and statues of the kings;</i><br><i>But now I think I've seen enough of antiquated things.</i><br><i>So it's home again, and home again, America for me,</i><br><i>I want a ship that's westward bound, to plow the rolling sea,</i><br><i>To the land of youth and freedom, beyond the ocean bars,</i><br><i>Where the air is full of freedom and the flag is full of stars.</i><br>[Henry Van Dyke, "America for Me," in<i>The Best Loved Poems of the American People</i>(Garden City, New York: Garden City Publishing Co. [c. 1936]), p. 424]<br><br>Yes, I love this nation. To me it is not just another nation, not just a member of the family of nations. It is a great and glorious nation with a divine mission, brought into being under the inspiration of heaven. It is truly a land choice above all others. I thank God for the knowledge which we have regarding the prophetic history and the spiritual foundation of this great land of America.<br><br>When I contemplate the great events that have transpired here, going way back to the days when our first parents were placed in the Garden of Eden, and recall that this garden was here in America, that it was here also where Adam met with a body of great high priests at Adam-ondi-Ahman shortly before his death and gave them his final blessing, and that to that same spot he is to return again to meet with the leaders of his people, his children--when I contemplate, my brothers and sisters, that here in this land will be established the New Jerusalem, that here in this land will Zion be built--when I contemplate that prophets of God anciently served here in this land, and that the resurrected Christ appeared to them--and when I contemplate that the greatest of all visions, the coming of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, to the boy Prophet in our day, took place in this land, my heart fills with gratitude that I am privileged to live here, and that I have the honor and pleasure not only of serving in the Church but also of serving in the government of this great land. I consider it an honor and a privilege.<br><br>I am grateful for the Founding Fathers of this land and for the freedom they have vouchsafed to us. I am grateful that they recognized, as great leaders of this nation have always recognized, that the freedom which we enjoy did not originate with the Founding Fathers, that this glorious principle, this great boon of freedom and respect for the dignity of man, came as a gift from the Creator. The Founding Fathers, it is true, with superb genius welded together the safeguards of these freedoms. It was necessary, however, for them to turn to the scriptures, to religion, in order to have their great experiment make sense to them. And so our freedom is God-given. It antedates the Founding Fathers.<br><br>I am grateful that the God of heaven saw fit to put his stamp of approval upon the Constitution and to indicate that it had come into being through wise men whom he raised up unto this very purpose. He asked the Saints, even in the dark days of their persecution and hardship, to continue to seek for redress from their enemies "according," he said, "to the laws and constitution . . . which I have suffered [or caused] to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh" (D&amp;amp;C 101 :77). And then he made this most impressive declaration: "And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood" (Ibid., 101:80).<br><br>It is gratifying that the constitutions in many of the other lands of our neighbors in the Americas are patterned very much after this divinely-appointed Constitution, which the God of heaven directed in the founding of this nation. It is not any wonder, therefore, that Joseph Smith, the Prophet--a truly great American--referring to the Constitution, said, "[It] is a glorious standard; it is founded in the wisdom of God. It is a heavenly banner" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,</i>p. 147).<br><br>President Brigham Young declared prophetically,<br><br><i>When the day comes in which the Kingdom of God will bear rule, the flag of the United States will proudly flutter unsullied on the flagstaff of liberty and equal rights, without a spot to sully its fair surface; the glorious flag our fathers have bequeathed to us will then be unfurled to the breeze by those who have power to hoist it aloft and defend its sanctity.</i>[<i>Journal</i>of<i>Discourses,</i>2:317]<br><br>But, continuing, President Young asks:<br><br><i>How long will it be before the words of the Prophet Joseph will be fulfilled? He said if the Constitution of the United States were saved at all it must be done by this people. It will not be many years before these words come to pass.</i>[Ibid., 12:204]<br><br>These words were spoken April 8, 1868, over one hundred years ago.<br><br>Yes, we have a rich heritage, but may I remind you that nations ofttimes sow the seeds of their own destruction even while enjoying unprecedented prosperity, even before reaching the zenith or the peak of their power. I think history clearly indicates that this is often the case. When it appears that all is well, ofttimes the very seeds of destruction are sown, sometimes unwittingly. Most of the great civilizations of the world have not been conquered from without until they have destroyed themselves from within by sowing these seeds of destruction.<br><br>It is my conviction that God does now look with favor, and has looked with favor, upon this government, which he established by wise men. It is also my firm conviction that his protective hand is still over the United States of America. I know, too, that if we will keep the commandments of God--live as he has directed, and does now direct, through his prophets--we will continue to have his protecting hand over us. But we must be true to the eternal verities, the great Christian virtues which God has revealed. Then, and only then, will we be safe as a nation and as individuals. God grant that the faithfulness of the Latter-day Saints will provide the balance of power to save this nation in times of crisis.<br><h2><b>Let Us Rededicate Ourselves</b></h2><br>How many of you heard or saw the statement regarding some of these matters which our living prophet and his counselors gave us recently? It was presented over television and appeared in the Church section of the<i>Deseret News.</i>I quote a part of it. Said the First Presidency,<br><br><i>We urge members of the Church and all Americans to begin now to reflect more intently on the meaning and importance of the Constitution, and of adherence to its principles. . . .</i><br><br><i>In these challenging days, when there are so many influences which would divert us, there is a need to rededicate ourselves to the lofty principles and practices of our Founding Fathers.</i>[<i>Church News,</i>September 22, 1973, p. 3]<br><br>Let us not permit these admonitions of our living prophets to fall on deaf ears. Let us, as they direct, learn the meaning and importance of our God-ordained Constitution. Let us rededicate ourselves to the lofty principles and practices of those wise men whom God raised up to give us our priceless freedom. Our liberties, our salvation, our well-being as a church and as a nation depend upon it. This nation has a spiritual foundation--a prophetic history. Every true Latter-day Saint should love the United States of America--the most generous nation under heaven--the Lord's base of operations in these last days. May we do all in our power to strengthen and safeguard this base and increase our freedom. This nation will, I feel sure, endure. It is God-ordained for a glorious purpose. We must never forget that the gospel message we bear to the world is to go forth to the world from this nation. And that gospel message can prosper only in an atmosphere of freedom. We must maintain and strengthen our freedom in this blessed land.<br><br>I have wished, as did President Franklin D. Richards, that<br><br><i>we could have a goodly number of substantial young men growing up in our midst who would become skilled and mighty in the law, and who could go into any of the courts and set forth the true principles of justice and equity in all cases. We need more of such men. We do not want men to become lawyers, turn infidels and live for nothing but the little money they can make. We want to raise up a corps of young men armed with the spirit of the gospel, clothed with the holy priesthood, who can tell the judges in high places what the law is.</i>[<i>Journal of Discourses,</i>26:102]<br><br>We have allowed our courts, through their anti-prayer, anti-God decisions, to outlaw in the schools the positive belief of the truths contained in the Declaration of Independence, the very foundation of our nation.<br><br>I am so grateful for the establishment of our new J. Reuben Clark School of Law here on this campus. Here students can be taught the gospel truths, the eternal truths about laws and government. This school can wield a mighty influence for good throughout this great nation and this sick, messed-up world. It can send forth a group of faithful, courageous Latter-day Saint priesthood-patriots who are both able and anxious to do the Lord's will concerning our political problems--men who really do understand the true meaning and importance of our Constitution, men who have dedicated themselves to the principles and practices of our Founding Fathers. But let each of us, whether we are in the field of law or not, strive to follow the counsel of our prophet. Therein is safety.<br><br>God bless you and all of us, and may God bless America and preserve our divine Constitution and the Republic which he established thereunder, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Ezra Taft Benson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when this devotional address was given at Brigham Young University on 4 December 1973.</i></i><br><br><i>©Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

<h1>ome, Hallowed, Gracious Christmas - BYU Speeches</h1>
<br>
<br>
It's an honor to be here. Although my present competence is geared more to a first-position version of "Flow Gently, Sweet Afton," my years with the violin so long ago perhaps qualify me to express deep gratitude and some appreciation for that magnificent music. I am thankful.<br><br>It had occurred to me that I might talk today about a subject such as voluntary compliance with established standards, but I drove here on the freeway. I think I won't discuss that subject today. Instead, I'd like to talk to you about the season. I am aware that examinations are dead ahead and would hope that in some marvelous way the alchemy of this special time of year might dissuade us temporarily from contemplating them and permit us to join together in consideration of this wonderful holy day season, which I love. I love its sights, its sounds, its scents, the thoughts and feelings that it inspires, its songs, its sentiments. I love the tenderness it evokes, the gratitude and generosity, the sensitivity to thanks and to giving, its acts of kindness and of love, the effect on family. I love what it does to release friendliness and goodwill between one man and another, which most of us keep under pretty rigid control the rest of the year. There are occasions, of course, when those carefully reserved feelings come forth naturally and spontaneously, as, for instance, when we're caught under an awning in a downpour, or waiting behind a snowplow, or joined together in distress or action in the face of some calamity or personal difficulty. But of all these occasions, Christmas seems to be chief among those which bring out from good men, and maybe some of us less than good, those repressed emotions of brotherliness and kindliness.<br><br>I love the Christmas season. I love its spirit and its memories. It was at Christmas long ago that a tiny girl nestled snugly in my arms in the middle of the night and sighed with relief. She had been upchucking, perhaps from a slight overdose of excitement and anticipation, mixed with the season's largess of goodies. "Daddy," she said, "for a while I was afraid I was going to lose the Christmas spirit."<br><br>And I love to remember the little hand on my knee as we rode through soft flakes of snow to our grandmother's on Christmas morning. We had been singing with the carolers on the radio when she said, "What does it mean to adore him?"<br><br>I worked at an answer, but every attempt engendered more questions and further efforts to explain until finally, compassionately, she laid that little hand on my knee and said, "I guess to adore him just means to love him."<br><br>Well, I come this morning with three themes, or one theme and two variations, to express briefly my love for the season. The theme is centered in a few words in a very familiar song, much like the one we sang together. These are the words. Have you heard them as well as sung them?<br><br><i>Joy to the world, the Lord is come.</i><br><i>Let earth receive her King.</i><br><i>Let every heart prepare him room,</i><br><i>And heaven and nature sing.</i><br><br>Seven hundred years before he came, Isaiah sang a sweet psalm of his coming:<br><br><i>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined....</i><br><br><i>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</i>[Isaiah 9:2, 6]<br><br>His advent, of course, had been long anticipated. In God's plan there was place and need for a sacrifice, an atoning sacrifice for sin. And so he came in due season, not as man anticipated but as God directed. There wasn't any pomp; there were no blaring trumpets, no parade or ceremony, no army, no array of great ones ushering in the King. There was a crowded inn, a manger, a mother and a baby, some shepherds, and some wise men, unconscious of their different stations. There were angels and a message for those who had ears to hear.<br><br><i>They were all looking for a king</i><br><i>To set them free and lift them high;</i><br><i>Thou earnest, a little baby thing</i><br><i>To make a woman cry.</i><br>[Author unknown]<br><br>He grew, served, taught, learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and did, as he had been sent to do, the will of his Father.<br><br>When the appointed time came he was accused, mocked, arrayed in a purple robe. They platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head. They smote him with a reed and took him to be crucified. He was lifted up upon the cross by man that he might, as he said, "draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil" (3 Nephi 27:14).<br><br>On the cross he comforted those who suffered with him, he invoked the forgiveness of his Father for those who took his life, and in anguish he cried out to the God whose face for the moment may have been turned away from the awful scene--who knows, perhaps to wipe a tear. "Truly this was the Son of God," said the centurion (Matthew 27:54). He rose, as we know, at the appointed time from the tomb in which he had been tenderly laid--the first that should rise. Resurrected, he companied for many days with his apostles and others, ascended to heaven as they watched him, visited his people in the American hemisphere and taught them, appeared to Paul and to Stephen, and in the last dispensation, with his Father, revealed himself to a boy prophet. As he promised, he will come again. For all of that I give thanks. I bear testimony that it is true. He will come again.<br><h2><b>A Thanksgiving Time</b></h2><br>My first variation on the theme then, is thanksgiving, the second, and briefest part of this message. Christmas--and every other important holiday, it occurs to me--is a thanksgiving time: to mothers, to the founders of our country and the fathers of our free society, to those who have offered their lives to keep it free, to our loved ones departed, and at Christmas (always and every day, of course, but especially at Christmas) to God our Father and his holy Son, Jesus Christ. The past year has been full of perplexing problems; the possibilities ahead are certainly sobering in prospect. Yet the Christmas season brings to our hearts the spirit of thanks and of giving.<br><h2><b>Wholesome, Hallowed, Gracious</b></h2><br>With Christ and gratitude and giving in our minds, then let me share with you the third part, or the second variation. It comes from another source, from another time. From Hamlet we read:<br><br><i>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</i><br><i>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</i><br><i>This bird of dawning singeth all night long;</i><br><i>And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,</i><br><i>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</i><br><i>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</i><br><i>So hallowed and so gracious is that time.</i><br>[Hamlet, 1.i.158–64]<br><br><i>Wholesome, hallowed, gracious</i>--what wonderful words. I love them. They represent to me all that Christmas and the season may mean. Think of them with me for a moment.<br><br>How to make the season<i>wholesome?</i>Why, by glancing healthfully inward for a moment. By seeking to bring ourselves more nearly to that measure of wholeness, of integrity, of unity with loftiest desires, of congruence with richest spiritual feeling, of harmony with that person that I would fondly like to be.<br><h2>Wholesome: the Master of Christmas</h2><br>Many years ago a great man who taught at this university gave us a vision of the importance of that harmony. When I graduated from high school I wanted to come to Brigham Young University, with his name and face and strengths in mind. I really had in mind Harrison R. Merrill and BYU, in that order. If you know it well, rejoice with me; if not, be introduced to one of his greatest poems. He called it "Christmas Eve on the Desert."<br><br><i>Tonight, not one alone am I, but three--</i><br><i>The Lad I was, the Man I am, and he</i><br><i>Who looks adown the coming future years</i><br><i>And wonders at my sloth. His hopes and fears</i><br><i>Should goad me to the manly game</i><br><i>Of adding to the honor of my name.</i><br><i>I'm Fate to him--that chap that's I, grown old.</i><br><i>No matter how much stocks and land and gold</i><br><i>I save for him, he can't buy back a single day</i><br><i>On which I built a pattern for his way.</i><br><br><i>I, in turn, am product of that Boy</i><br><i>Who rarely thought of After Selves. His joy</i><br><i>Was in the present. He might have saved me woe</i><br><i>Had he but thought. The ways that I must go</i><br><i>Are his. He marked them all for me.</i><br><i>And I must follow--and so must he--</i><br><i>My Future Self--Unless I save him!</i><br><i>Save?--Somehow that word,</i><br><i>Deep down, a precious thought has stirred</i><br><i>Savior?--Yes, I'm savior to that "Me."</i><br><i>That thoughtful After Person whom I see!--</i><br><i>The thought is staggering! I sit and gaze</i><br><i>At my two Other Selves, joint keepers of my days!</i><br><br><i>Master of Christmas, You dared to bleed and die</i><br><i>That others might find life. How much more I</i><br><i>Should willingly give up my present days</i><br><i>To lofty deeds; seek out the ways</i><br><i>To build a splendid life. I should not fail</i><br><i>To set my feet upon the star-bound trail</i><br><i>For him--that After Self. You said that he</i><br><i>Who'd lose his life should find it, and I know</i><br><i>You found a larger life, still live and grow.</i><br><i>Your doctrine was, so I've been told, serve man.</i><br><i>I wonder if I'm doing all I can</i><br><i>To serve? Will serving help that Older Me</i><br><i>To be the man he'd fondly like to be?</i><br><br><i>Last night I passed a shack</i><br><i>Where hunger lurked. I must go back</i><br><i>And take a lamb, Is that the message of the Star</i><br><i>Whose rays, please God, can shine this far?</i><br><br><i>Tonight, not one alone am I, but three--</i><br><i>The Lad I was, the Man I am, and he</i><br><i>Who is my Future Self--nay, more:</i><br><i>I am His savior--that thought makes me four!</i><br><br><i>Master of Christmas, that Star of Thine shines clear--</i><br><i>Bless Thou the four of me--out here!</i><br><i>Wholesome, hallowed, gracious.</i><br><br>The angelic message was "Peace on earth, goodwill to men." We do not despair of peace; yet we know something of history and something of the scriptures and something of present complexities, and we know that no one of us nor all of us here together can govern the world of men and their decisions. There is something we can do about peace in our lives and peace between us and our families and our neighbors--something--but we cannot control an insatiable world and the decisions of many men. But goodwill to men, what of that? Many of you are already experts in that adventure, but perhaps others have yet to learn that goodwill, like love, is more than language.<br><br>Do you know the words of Millay?<br><br><i>Love is not all; it is not meat nor drink,</i><br><i>Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;</i><br><i>Nor yet a floating spar to men who sink.</i><br>[Edna St. Vincent Millay]<br><br>God so loved that he gave. Christ so loved that he gave. What of us? I remember the impressive words of Bonhoeffer, who said of Jesus that he was a man for others; and the words of Luther, who in his great speech on good works talked of Mary, who, having heard the announcement, went about her life preparing, not retired from the active scene because she had such knowledge, but involved in giving and growing and preparing.<br><h2>Gracious: Brotherly Love and Giving</h2><br>For<i>graciousness,</i>how do you like the marvelous, simple story of the little boy who saw the bright, new automobile and said to its owner, walking about it on Christmas Eve:<br><br><i>"Is that your car, Mister?"</i><br><br><i>The man nodded. "My brother gave it to me for Christmas."</i><br><br><i>The boy looked astounded. "You mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you nothing? Gosh, I wish--" He hesitated, and the man knew what he was going to wish. He was going to wish that he had a brother like that. But what the lad said jarred him all the way down to his heels. "I wish," the boy went on, "that I could be a brother like that."</i><br><br><i>Paul looked at the boy in astonishment. Then impulsively he said, "Would you like a ride in my automobile?"</i><br><br><i>"Yes," said the little boy.</i><br><br><i>After a short ride, the youngster, his eyes aglow, said, "Mister, would you mind driving in front of my house?" Paul smiled a little. He thought he knew what the lad wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile. But he was wrong again. "Will you stop by those two steps?" the boy asked. He ran up the steps. In a little while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He was carrying his little polio-crippled brother. He sat him down on the bottom step, sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car. "There she is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother give it to him for Christmas and it didn't cost him a cent. And some day I'm going to give you one just like it. Then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that I've been trying to tell you about."</i><br><br><i>Paul got out and lifted the little lad to the front seat of his car. The shiny-eyed older brother climbed in beside him, and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride.</i><br><br><i>That Christmas Eve Paul learned what Jesus meant about brotherliness and giving.</i>[C. Roy Angell, in<i>Guideposts</i>]<br><br>And if I may add it, I'd like to tell you another thing I love very much about Christmas. I love to remember what the scripture says, and perhaps you are well aware of it: "Let brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares" (Hebrews 13:1–2).<br><br>There was a night when we had the blessing of having in our home a stranger, sorely afflicted. After all these years I have some hesitance to mention the incident, lest anyone know or connect her with it. She was from far away. She was away from her family. She had been incarcerated in institutions, had been released to go to her parents in another state, also far away, but after months of little progression and apparently with little hope in sight, had been relieved of her restraints there. Having affiliation with the Church, she found her way to Salt Lake City, to Temple Square, which she thought to be the heart of the Church, and sat across the desk from me, hopeless, her eyes blank, talking about her children, talking intermittently also about the voices she heard. She was ill. There was no appropriate place to send her, so we took her home.<br><br>Our holiday season was impaired a bit, as I now impair the memory by the repetition. That didn't matter much. We missed a few parties; we felt someone should be with her, because she was obviously seriously ill. We didn't know the therapy; we knew how to pray to God, and she joined us with our then very little family. The days went by. Christmas arrived. That morning she arose with us. She sat in a chair and watched as the presents were given and received. For everyone received by anyone else, she also received a gift. I fancied I saw the curtain going up a little. I watched a tear come trickling, and then, without premeditation and certainly without instruction, a little girl climbed onto her knee, put her arms around her neck, and said, "Susannah, I love you." And the tears gushed and the curtain rose and the humanity came through. She wept, then talked freely about her little ones, about her husband at home, about her problems.<br><br>A little later I made a telephone call. I spoke to a man who was agonizing through the day. He didn't want her away, but her illness had made it improbable to have her home. I talked with him of her present circumstance. He said, "Is there any way to get her home?" We found a way. There was an airplane and gracious people who made way, and a lady who got nervously aboard and soon thereafter arrived home to the arms of her own loved ones. She wrote us regularly for many years to thank us for a simple gift of brotherliness at a special time.<br><h2>More Important than a King</h2><br>Oh, I love the words<i>wholesome, hallowed, gracious.</i>Among the many wonderful things I would like to remind you about, I love and will conclude with a brief statement from a great book written long ago. It is about a slave who lived in Christ's time and watched him on a certain special Sunday in the midst of a multitude.<br><br><i>Suddenly, for no reason at all that Demetrius could observe, there was a wave of excitement. It swept down over the sluggish swollen stream of zealots like a sharp breeze. Men all about him were breaking loose from their families, tossing their packs into the arms of their overburdened children, and racing forward toward some urgent attraction. Far up ahead the shouts were increasing in volume, spontaneously organizing into a concerted reiterated cry; a single, magic word that drove the multitude into a frenzy.</i><br><br><i>"Do you know what is going on?" said Demetrius.</i>[He was talking to another slave.]<br><br><i>"They're yelling something about a king. That's all I can make of it."</i><br><br><i>"You think they've got somebody up front who wants to be their king? Is that it?"</i><br><br><i>"Looks like it. They keep howling another word that I don't know--Messiah. The man's name, maybe."</i><br><br><i>Standing on tiptoe for an instant in the swaying crowd, Demetrius caught a fleeting glimpse of the obvious center of interest, a brown-haired, bareheaded, well-favored Jew. A tight little circle had been left open for the slow advance of the shaggy white donkey on which he rode. ... There had been no effort to bedeck the pretender with any royal regalia. He was clad in a simple brown mantle with no decorations of any kind, and the handful of men--his intimate friends, no doubt--who tried to shield him from the pressure of the throng, wore the commonest sort of country garb.</i><br><br><i>It was quite clear now to Demetrius that the incident was accidental. ... Whoever had started this wild pandemonium, it was apparent that it lacked the hero's approbation.</i><br><br><i>The face of the enigmatic Jew seemed weighted with an almost insupportable burden of anxiety. The eyes, narrowed as if in resigned acceptance of some inevitable catastrophe, stared straight ahead toward Jerusalem.</i><br><br><i>Gradually the brooding eyes moved over the crowd until they came to rest on the strained, bewildered face of Demetrius. Perhaps, he wondered, the man's gaze halted there because he alone--in all this welter of hysteria--refrained from shouting. His silence singled him out. The eyes calmly appraised Demetrius. They neither widened nor smiled; but, in some indefinable manner, they held Demetrius in a grip so firm it was almost a physical compulsion. The message they communicated was something other than sympathy, something more vital than friendly concern; a sort of stabilizing power that swept away all such negations as slavery, poverty, or any other afflicting circumstance. Demetrius was suffused with the glow of this curious kinship. Blind with sudden tears, he elbowed through the throng and reached the roadside. The uncouth Athenian, bursting with curiosity, inopportunely accosted him.</i><br><br><i>"See him--close up?" he asked.</i><br><br><i>Demetrius nodded.</i><br><br><i>"Crazy?" persisted the Athenian.</i><br><br><i>"No."</i><br><br><i>"King?"</i><br><br><i>"No," muttered Demetrius, soberly--"not a king."</i><br><br><i>"What is he, then?" demanded the Athenian.</i><br><br><i>"I don't know," mumbled Demetrius, in a puzzled voice, "but--he is something more important than a king."</i>[Lloyd C. Douglas,<i>The Robe,</i>chapter 4]<br><br>I wish you a happy Christmas.<br><br><i>Joy to the world, the Lord is come.</i><br><i>Let earth receive her King.</i><br><i>Let every heart prepare him room,</i><br><i>And heaven and nature sing.</i><br><br>God bless us all that we, may have a wholesome, hallowed, gracious, special time. I bear witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he lives, that he governs, that he inspires and directs, that he will come again. God help us to worship in all the wonderful ways there are this season. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><br><i><i>Marion D.
